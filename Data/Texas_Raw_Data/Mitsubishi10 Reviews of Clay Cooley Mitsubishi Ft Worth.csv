Then introduce to their buy here pay here program that they call fresh start with cars you don’t want.  Sales people there are extremely young early 20’s and very unprofessional.  Don’t waste your time!!,1.0
1,"October 17, 2015",I have taken 2 of my vehicles to Blake and he has gone above and beyond what was expected for my services.  They had my vehicles finished  well before they said they would and he was a pleasure to work with.  I will only take my vehicles to Blake from now on for any service after my experience there.  I wish all of my employees had the professionalism and work ethic as Mr. Patterson!!.  It is a rare find these days.   Thank you again for a pleasant experience.,5.0

5,"May 01, 2015","Was supposedly ""approved"" for 30k to spend on a vehicle over the phone from 400 miles away. Was told to pick out the truck I want from any clay cooley location I did find one I wanted in another state they said no problem we can get it. After taking off work for two days and driving over 400 miles to make this purchase upon arrival was told they would not get that truck but find another like it and we'd make a deal as all prices are negotiable. So I was angry but still trying to make this happen as not to waste a trip found a 2011 model with 50k on odometer they were asking 31k I told them I'll give you the 27,500 the 2012 with 37k on the odometer  had Wich was the one I wanted but couldn't get gm came out and said prices are not negotiable Wich none of their vehicles come with warranty unless you purchase it and it's a minimal warranty.long story short left there and went to Moritz pre owned and spoke with terry explained my cooley experience he was honest and up front I purchased a much nicer truck with 25k more on the odometer  but FREE lifetime power train warranty as long as I own the truck unlimited miles anything happens to motor transmission  or transfer case 100.00 deductible  is all I'm out of pocket and they give you a truck to drive while yours is in repair this is offered on all pre owned vehicles they sell. Bought the crew cab 4x4 I wanted with warranty for 21k 0 down and affordable  payments 11k less for a nicer truck with a lifetime warranty in my honest opinion I wouldn't tell my enemies to shop Clay Cooley after what I went through.Moritz Chevrolet pre owned made a horrible day a wonderful day! If you want a no pressure no b.s. buying experience speak with terry at moritz pre owned on camp bowie and 820 less than a mile up the road from Clay Cooley...I shopped you first didn't shop you last and either way I won't ever see clay again! Buyer beware!  ",1.0
6,"April 30, 2015","My husband and I went to clay cooley in ft worth on camp bowie to have a chip checked to see if we were winners.. when we arrived was told had ti test drive a car prior to them checking our chip. We agreed..  after test drive they wanted yo sale us the car.. they ran our credit we were approved.. we were there for hours filling out all the paperwork after all the contract was singed and keys in hand we left...a couple days later we received multiple calls saying the need references and bank statement... we gave them references over phone and told them would be in next day after drs appt to give bank statement... Well the next day after went to dr went to dealership and gave them bank statement.. After giving them my bank statement they wanted ti know about the extra money being deposited in my acct.. told them it was child support.. They told me I needed to let them claim that money.. I told them no, I didnt use it when they approved me for the car told them wouldnt use it as part of income and wasnt going to add now as part of income... they told me if I would not let thrm count the child support then I had to give the car back.. told them ok but yhat I needed a ride to my house so could get my other car that I needed to pick-up my granddaughter from school. They asked to see the keys to the vehicle that I was already approved for and had for a few days now.. I gave them the keyssthen they told us they were busy and when someone was free would giveus a ride... They left us stranded in their parking lot with no way home so that I could pick up my granddaughter from school.. we stood outside watching at least 5  employee and the asst manager  stand in group just talking and playing around and refusing to give us a ride.. It was cokd outside, I was sick abd now going to be late to get my granddaughter... I finally called my oldest daughter and asked if she could leave and come puck us up... We were there for over an hr watching the employees not doing anything. They took the keys back to a vehicle I was already approved for because Iwould not allow them to add my child support, abd the asst manager was extremely rude to us... I would never ever recommend this dealership to anyone..",1.0

9,"March 26, 2015","After being made to feel that owning a new car or any car was out of our reach after leaving Ford, my husband and I were feeling discouraged and STRESSED! That's when one of my friends said 'Go see Trey Moss at Clay Cooley, he WILL help you!' Was my pal RIGHT OR WHAT?! Trey not only got us into a NEW car, he made the buying experience a BREEZE! He went above and beyond the requirements of his job to ensure that we were happy and that this was an exciting process not a stressful one. I can not say enough good things about this Salesman, dealership, experience and the CAR! Go see Trey, take a spin in one of their cars and I promise you won't want to leave the lot without one.",5.0
