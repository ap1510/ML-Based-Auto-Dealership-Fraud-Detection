0,"February 06, 2016","I got a deffective 2016 dodge caravan, tires wear out at 5000 miles,  left the car with them for five days for a warranty repair. They brought me to enterprise car rental, after five days of rental use enterprise charged me $156 they say for insurance. After picking up my dodge caravan i found out they only change 1 tire. So now i will end up changing 1 tire at a time coz the other tire is halfway worn out. So from now on i have to pay for rental car whenever i find defects again on my dodge",1.0
1,"March 22, 2015","I traded in a 2012 jeep wrangler for a 2015 jeep wrangler. Toward the end of the sale, I asked the salesman (Tony Richardson) if I need to remove the license plates, he said he would take care of it.
So, about a month later, I get a toll road bill in the mail for the jeep I traded in. The dealership allowed one of their employees to drive my trade-in jeep on the toll road on 3 different occasions with my old plates still on it, running up a toll bill on my name....nice business ethics.

So, I emailed the GM-Mark Warren to explain what happened, he never returned my email.
Then I called the GSM-Dean Marshall, he never returned my call. Good Leadership. Once the sale is complete, good luck with this dealership.

I finally get ahold of the salesman because no manager would return my calls or emails. I asked the salesman why I got a toll bill in the mail, he said it was the wholesalers driving it to the auction, which was a lie. My jeep was driven on 3 different days on the same toll road.

End result, the dealership gave me 8$ for the toll bill and said pay it yourself, They run up a toll bill, then expect me to pay it myself. How's that for customer relations?

2,"May 20, 2013","They are also a Hyundai dealership and that is what we bought, a new Sonata.  Our salesperson was Matt and he was fantastic.  In fact everyone there felt like old friends, they made us feel so relaxed we actually enjoyed shopping and buying a new car.  The dealership was clean, the cars were easy to view, they had a fantastic stock - in fact I had researched Sonatas for days and they had a dark blue that was astounding and I hadn't noticed on all the sites I had checked out.  I have driven Mercedes Benz for the past 18 years and most of the dealerships are so snooty, act like they are doing you a favor to show you the cars.  The folks at Allen Samuels in Tyler were professional yet friendly, could answer any questions we had, showed us how things worked, were not pushy nor aggressive and they genuinely seemed to be glad to be working there and happy to show us the Hyundais.

I took the Sonata back to the service dept. to have a few things ""tweaked"" so the car would perform the way I wanted - and the service staff was as wonderful as the sales staff.  They made the exact adjustments I wanted. They listened to me; ask any 66 year old woman when was the last time a mechanic asked her how she wanted her car to perform.   I am happy with my new Sonata; I expected to be.  My husband and I were both so pleasantly surprised that buying a new car could be a fun experience.  ",4.8

4,"March 20, 2013","I took my jeep here to have an oil change and they called me shortly after dropping it off (after waiting about 10 minutes in the lobby while 5 different employees walked by me) to tell me that the plug was stuck and they couldn't change my oil. After some discussion the manger told me that he was ""unwilling"" to try and fix it. How can a jeep dealership be unwilling to fix something on a jeep? He told me the ONLY thing he could do was to replace the entire oil pan and plug, costing about $700 dollars. I promptly picked up my jeep and took it to another shop where they were able to fix the stuck plug, remove it, and put a new one in for me that does just fine. It is so frustrating to take your car to it's own dealership and have them tell me that they are ""unwilling"" to try and fix something because it will actually take some effort and WORK. If a jeep dealership can't fix my car, who can? Apparently this little shop I took it to can! Long live the little man and small businesses! I will NEVER take my business to this place EVER again.",1.0
5,"March 03, 2013","Me and my husband when there to buy a new truck, So we got great service from the being, everyone was friendly and once we signed the contract it became another story, the check engine light was on, yes on a brand new dodge longhorn mega cab, they told us to drive it and bring it back later to look at it so we stayed at a hotel that night so that we could be there first thing in the morning so they could fix it, they told us when we got there the man that could work on it wasn't there today, we told them we wasn't leaving in that truck with the check engine light on they had to do something, well it took all day and my son is 14 months old was not a great day there, Ok well that made two days we spent at the lot. they fix it said it was a wrong code. A week later I noticed the fender flare are coming off the truck which you could tell where they were glued on, and that the transmission is jump into gear really hard, also that the panel in the cab was rattling, so they told me to bring it in and they would look at it, so I did that on a Tue , exactly two weeks to date I had my truck, well they gave me a loner car and rushed me out of there, well I called Drew and asked if they do tint since it was going to be in there getting fix I would like for them to tint it as well, he said they could do it. So Bill service manger called me Thursday and told me a little bit about what was going on with it, I say ok I need it back by Friday I was going out of town to see my husband, he said it would be ready, Ok So Friday I head that ways he called me around 9:30 are 10 to let me know the truck was at tint and it would be ready soon, ok I said I was on my way up there that I was already in Palestine, cause I had to talk to Patrick about dropping the extend warranty, (whole other story) Well I get there everyone is nice talking to me and everything finally around 1 I asked bill the sales manger was my truck ready, he said you don't have your truck, no I would be gone, so he called janel I think that's here name, she called the tint place to see if it was ready they told her yes, she give me the bill I wrote a check while she went to pick it up, I was so mad when she got back and the tint was bubbled up and my truck was nasty from dirt, oil, and glue from the tint don't know how she seen to drive over with all the junk on the window, she get out nice truck, no that's not right that is bubble it will go away in 10 days don't roll your windows down for 10 day I said that's wrong, so the first thing she did was call the tint company and wanted them to explain to me about the bubble I told her I didn't want to talk to them she just keep talking to them, she tried to hand me the phone once again I don't want to talk to them I paid y'all, next thing you know she disappeared and so did everyone else, I called my husband he said tell them to take it off now, I couldn't get anyone to talk to me I was stand there and no one was speak to me, they would walk by with there head down and not even look at me, So I ran into janel again I her where was bill she said he went to lunch I said when will he be back she said in an hour I was already there all day I had to be back by 2:30 to get my son they didn't care they wanted me to just leave, I Said can you call bill and tell him want is going on, nobody knew is cell number, well I did he gave to me the day before and told me to call if I need anything, So I called told him what was going on he said I'm turning around I'm in traffic I'll be there in a few just hang on, need to say I'm stand out in the parking lot crying by my self not know what to do about, didn't want to leave with the bad tint, he asked my was anyone out there talking to me I told him no, he hold on I'm going to call and tell someone to come talk to you, ok a lil later he called me back and ask did anyone come and talk to you, I said no, he said I'm sorry, I'm trying to get there as fast as I can I'm by the mall just hang on, he called me three times in total to just let me know he was great, so he get there and then it was like everyone wanted to be my friends again he come out and talked to me about everything and asked if all the dirt was on the truck I told him no y'all had it for a week now he said I'm going to take it and wash it and get it cleaned up which he did a great job, then the other bill sales manger is like you didn't pay I was like yes I did 250 dollar, he told me well give you your check, which then he couldn't find janel to get the check about that took more time. so finally washed check back and bill as me to ride with him to check on the transmission once more to explain to me why it shifted so hard, when we showed by up he was going to park me where I could just drive out I said I need to get the other key they had to order, we get back in side and nobody know where the key is which I told them drew had all ready told me the key was there a few days ago, so bill sales manger has to find the key, so when he did bill the service manger had to take the truck back over there to get the key program it was a very long day didn't get out of there until 3:30 are later. So know I have tint with bubbles in it they told me to give it a few days if it don't go down to bring it back and they will have to fix it so I got them to sign something about if the windows tint don't come off right they will have to replace my window back to factory, So I guess I have one more long day ahead of me at Allen Samuels, This place is a joke, at least one of them cared enough to skip his lunch to come back and take care of a customer.. Thank you Bill Fee the service manger

6,"July 31, 2012","On a Saturday, I called to ask about a new 2012 dodge half ton they started the approval over the phone. Second time on the phone everything came back good. Got a ride up there (my car broke down) looked at trucks on the lot didn't see a black one asked he said hold on brought around a black crew cab 1500 which is what i wanted and went home in my new truck. Went back on the following Monday to sign everything. Everything went ok, just wish i could've gotten the price down a little more but still wasn't bad sticker was 33,000 or 35,000 got it for 28,000 and even with taxes and extended warranty was still only to 32,000. All of the employees were great and handled everything well. No headaches at all. I will be going back for my next purchase which will be something for my wife. Good experience all around. Still seemed like what east tx used to be, very nice and helpful.",4.8
7,"January 28, 2012","I can't say enough positive things about my experience with Allen Samuels Hyundai. The personnel I dealt with were extremely professional and highly motivated to make my visit both rewarding and informative. Tim O'Brien was my salesman and he was fantastic. He was knowledgeable, friendly, and extremely well versed about the automobile (Equus). I probably would not have bought the car from any other salesman. In fact, I was looking to possibly purchase a Genesis, but had pretty much made up my mind to buy a Lexus LS or a BMW 535. But my experience with him and the knowledge that he provided about the Equus, made me change my mind. I stopped in just to look again and had made up my mind to buy one of the other two vehicles. I am really glad I didn't because I am extremely pleased with the Equus and have praised it to a number of friends of mine and advised them to really look at the quality of the Equus and not just look at the name Hyundai.",5.0
8,"March 26, 2011","We live only 50 to 55 minutes from this dealership, and went there to buy a new 2011 Hyundai Sonota Limited. My husband wanted it a certain color with gray leather interior, and was told there were none in the State of Texas. One of the other dealerships, Huffines in Plano Texas, contacted me, found out what we were looking for, and got back to me in a few days, getting the exact car that my husband wanted from Arkansas. Now that is customer service and satisfaction. We dealt with Roosevelt May and Lamar Rogers at Huffines. They were wonderful. Loved the new car so much that we came back 2 weeks later and traded my 2009 Toyota Corolla in for a new 2011 Sonota SE. The price was way too good to pass up. Again I called Allen Samuel's Hyundai in Tyler and talked to Tom Bedair, again hoping to give our local dealership our business. They told me that they couldn't give me the price that Huffines was giving me, and to go there for my car. Now that tells me they could care less about the customer. I would highly recommend Huffines to all my friends and family. It was definitely worth the 2 1/2 hour drive to Plano. I can't say enough about Huffines Hyundai ! Sorry Allen Samuels, you definitely lost at least 2 good customers!",2.0
