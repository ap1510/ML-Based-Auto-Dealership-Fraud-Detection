1,"March 23, 2020","Outstanding job by the salesman Emil, worked a deal with the sales manager that all parties were ok with.  Both listened and I drove home in a used 2019 Forte.  A special shout out to finance manager Mike Ogaz took the time to not pressure and explain the additional coverages offered to me.  Thanks to all the staff at the dealership.  ",5.0
2,"February 20, 2020","I stopped by service Monday 2/17/20. I didn't have an appointment and I was having a very weird issue. Without missing a beat Donnie and Gary jumped into action to figure out what could be causing this issue. I didn't have time to drink the complimentary TINY bottle of water (they used to be regular size) before Gary was telling me that I was ready to go. I went back inside their lair and they explained the situation to me in terms that I could easily understand. They were both very professional and I truly appreciate the job they did for me. I have to wait for the part to arrive, but that's not a big deal. Premier customer service. Thanks",5.0

7,"June 08, 2019","I have been waiting to put this review in hopes that they would make things right; however, it has been a month and they have not. Three months ago, I went to Cowboy Kia to purchase a vehicle. After signing my documents, and taking my new truck home, the next day I traded in my other car for my mom to get a new car. Two weeks later, Brian Wilson informed me that I needed to take the truck back or they would file it as a stolen truck. Obviously, I returned the truck. Already extremely upset with Cowboy Kia, I didn't think it could POSSIBLY get worse! .. IT DID!! 3 months later, I get an email from Capital One, that my ""trade in"" was REPOSSESSED!! Tommy Mueller & Brian Wilson did not file the paperwork correctly! I am truly OUTRAGED by this outcome. Let me tell you how it got worse... The car that was supposed to be traded in, before they decided not to do their job correctly, is also in my father's name, so he has been in contact with Mark Compton, the General Manager. After being called a xxxx, and being told that my dad is too poor to file a civil suit, we are sick of their games. So you're wondering WHY we don't take them. Silly for them, you don't have to be RICH to file, it's only $125 and we will be. KHOU has also decided to write a story on this. They had their last chance to make it right, and instead played ""phone tag"" with us instead. THEN played stupid saying they never even took our car. It's okay though, Capital One provided me with documentation on how they TOWED THE CAR FROM COWBOY KIA CONROE! So to you, Brian Wilson, Mark Compton, & Tommy Mueller, YOU HAD YOUR CHANCE.",1.0

Jimmy is very knowledgeable, listened to our wants and then immediately found a solution that worked for your family.  We actually left with two brand new cars that we absolutely love.  I would highly recommend Cowboy Kia and Jimmy Edwards if you are in the market for a new vehicle.  You will be treated to professional and first class buying  experience.

12,"May 02, 2019","Bought a used QX56 from them, was forced to buy tracker device that they added on after negotiated price.  I drove the car about 75 miles and the check engine light came on. Didn't think much of it, it's typically just something simple.  Not in my case, one of the catalytic converters is out.  They obviously had reset the ECU. Would not repair.  Repair cost is over 2k.  Will never buy from them or refer to them.  Two bad practices on their part.  If they get a car in with a problem it's there responsibility to repair it or disclose it not hide it.",2.0

21,"August 20, 2017","I requested information online twice about a 2002 Buick Rendezvous they have on their website for sale, never got any information  on it. So, I decided to just go ahead and take my mom up to the dealership to see if it was still there. I checked the website upon arrival, and it was still listed and the price had dropped. When we asked about the car the salesman said "" that car hasn't  passed inspection yet, so we can't  offer it to the public yet"" so my mom asked him ""why is it on your website then??""he then replied"" they just haven't  had a chance to remove it"". This is a lie, I had seen the car on the website a few days prior and it had no picture of the vehicle...today, there was an image online. So, the salesman said he may have a different car for us, he pulled around a 2009 Hyundai. We went through the whole process, test drove the car, filled out the paperwork, only to find out the car WOULD NOT pass inspection! So how is it we were not allowed to look at the Buick because it hasn't  been inspected, yet he tried to sell us a different car that hadn't been inspected either?! A waste of two hours at the dealership.",1.8

32,"November 29, 2016","Took my car in for an oil change. An hour later was told I had a crack in my Turbo Line Feed.. NOW $15 HAS TURNED INTO $410 .  ONLY TO FIND OUT LATER, my car not only wasn't serviced properly with synthetic oil as requested , my car was also damaged by the mechanic who failed to mention the damage done to the body of my Optima when it slipped off the lift.  
Not only was my car  properly repaired from damages caused by the dealership,  I feel the turbo line problem was caused at the same time.  I'm still trying to resolve this horrific event that has now consumed way to much of my energy and time.",1.2

35,"July 19, 2016","I found a great Sedona on their website, but since I was driving from San Antonio, I wanted to make sure that I could get the price to something more manageable. I called and talked to Jolene, who told me that the price I was looking for on that van shouldn't be a problem. I gathered all of my paperwork and started the 3.5 hour drive out to Conroe. At the outset of my trip, I called Jolene to confirm that we were all set. She told me that she would be waiting for me at a certain time, and if she wasn't there, to ask for another particular salesperson. 

I arrived at the dealership early for my appointment, and was met at my car by a salesman. I told him I had an appointment with Jolene, and this salesman asked me to follow him into the store, where he sat me down at his desk and began to ask me questions as if I had never interacted with the dealership and he was going to try to sell me a car. I told him I had already gone over everything with Jolene. Much to my surprise, he said that Jolene was in a meeting. So I asked for the other salesperson, and was told that he was not working today, at which point this guy went right back to trying to sell me a car, completely oblivious (and uncaring) that I already had it all worked out. At this point I was pretty frustrated, for the obvious reasons, but also because this guy had yet to give me his name, or even try for small talk. Once I asked his name, he told me it was Jonathan, and shook my hand. Immediately after he drew his hand away, however, he went right for his drawer where he took out a squeeze bottle of anti-bacterial lotion, and proceeded to wipe off any possibility of any germ that I might have passed on (even though I was not sick).

The entire interaction was insulting and infuriating, but I'll give a couple more highlights. On their website, they promised to beat any offer that Carmax gave me for my car by $1000. However, when the first number came back for the Sedona, the actually were only offering me half as much for my trade-in as what Carmax offered. Also, once the GM came out all I heard was how much of a hit he was taking on this sale, and how he was going to jump on the sword for me and give me a great deal, blah, blah, blah. Needless to say, the number that was such a great deal wasn't anywhere close to what I had originally been told by Jolene shouldn't be a problem. It should be noted here as well that I called the dealership from inside the dealership a number of times and asked for Jolene, who was always mysteriously busy in a meeting, or had just stepped out, or whatever. Finally, the $300 Visa gift card that was supposedly given for any new car purchase was only for writing positive reviews on websites, which many of those websites specifically prohibit.

These people are everything that's wrong with car sales today, and why places like Carmax are thriving. If you are itching to play the car sales game, and are ok with not believing anything that you're told, then, by all means, go to Cowboy Kia. If, however, you prefer to be treated as a human being as opposed to a conquest, take your business elsewhere.   ",1.3

38,"July 01, 2016","This dealership is the most deceptive dealership I have ever dealt with from the management down to the sales staff. I bought a car on April 2nd 2016 when KIA was running a promotion to receive a $300 gift card for purchasing a car. I was told today, 3 months later I would not be receiving this card because the promotion ended before I purchased the car even though the promotion was still being advertised at the dealership and on the internet. I was told by management today (07/01/16), after 3 months of calling and asking about the gift card that the promotion had ended either on March 28th or 29th but for some reason when I went in on April 2nd the promotion was still being offered to me and wasn’t given an explanation why. The night of April 2nd I had direct conversations with management and my sales associate Trinidad about how the $300 gift card was an extra incentive I would be receiving in order to further reduce the purchase price of the car. I think the shadiest part about the whole transaction came from the sales associate Trinidad. I was told directly from him in order to receive the give card I needed rate him as excellent on KIA’s short survey they send out. Any response other than excellent and I wouldn’t be receiving the gift card. I also have the text messages to prove this. Also, I was told by Trinidad I would need to go on Yelp and Dealerrater and give him and the dealership an excellent rating as part of the things I needed to do in order to receive the gift card. I knew right off this was total garbage but wanted to comply in order not to hinder the receipt of the gift card. At this point I could care less about the gift card but want to alert any future and past consumers to the deceptive practices of this dealership. I will surely be sending out mass emails to the multiple Texas/Houston veteran organizations I’m a part of to include: Wounded Warrior Project, Lone Star Veterans Association, Texas Disabled Veterans Association, and the Veterans Affairs Office of Houston to make sure they know NOT to do business with these crooks.",1.0

40,"June 28, 2016","Wanted to buy our second Kia Soul.  Found the right car on the internet, so called to confirm price and incentives.  Internet saleswoman confirmed the price, but wasn't sure about the Kia incentives, so asked her to give me a call once confirmed.  I wanted to be sure before driving to the dealership.  

She called the next morning to confirm the price and incentives offered, which sounded great, so I headed in.  Get to the dealership and sit with the salesman expecting me, only to learn the price of the car was $1,000 more than the price on the net, and two of the three incentives didn't apply.

Asked to speak to a manager, explained what happened.  He then went on line to look at the same ad and said, ""Oh, they should have changed that.""   They never once apologized for wasting my time or for the fact their internet salesperson needed to be back in the training room.  This just confirmed the fact they're a bait and switch operation -- lure you in with deceptive advertising and sales tactics.  

Beware!

41,"June 28, 2016","I went down here to look at a few Kia's and was immediately greeted by Steve. He was attentive and polite and was not pushy in any way. I was specific about what I wanted to look at and what for in a vehicle and was quick to meet my needs. I walked away that day with a brand new Kia Soul, fully confident in my purchase at a fantastic price. I spent over a week at other dealers and time and time again was met with the same old schtick. Not this time! Steve is awesome and this dealership is awesome. Do yourself a favor and check them out. You won't be disappointed.

48,"June 11, 2016","We encountered the typical games every dealership will play to get you in. The ""Starts At"" price online is never the price you will get unless you are an Uber-driver military man who finished college in the last year. We were expecting that, so that wasn't a big deal. But it was the other games they played that bothered us. The salesmen told us first thing after we showed up that there was a special that weekend, a $300 Visa gift card with any vehicle purchase. On the website and on signs all over the dealership it stated Cowboy Kia would pay $1000 more for our trade-in than another party. We brought in an appraisal for CarMax then were offered $1000 less than that for our trade-in. We inquired after the promise and were told they were under new management and didn't honor that guarantee anymore... the guarantee that was on their website... and still on multiple large signs all over the outside of their dealership. Note that at the time or writing this review several weeks later, this guarantee or $1000 more is still scrolling prominently across the top of their website. After acting like they couldn't possibly give us that price for our trade-in, they realized they could as we were headed out the door. The finance guy was nice. I would recommend him to a friend, so perhaps you could call that a silver lining, but the overall experience was just so bad that I can't give a higher rating. After all was said and done, we waited around for over an hour, maybe closer to two, for our car to be delivered. Finally, as we were heading out to our car, we asked our salesman about the $300 Visa gift card. He said they were under new management and no longer offered that promotion. They sure go through new management quickly.",2.6

57,"June 02, 2016","The tint on my new car (purchased February 29th, 2016 from Cowboy Kia Conroe)

Our sales person was Trinidad Rodriquez and he told us that the people that did the tint on our car was no longer the person doing the tint because they were doing a poor job.  He told us that he spoke with his manager and said they would contact someone in our area to fix it.  We went back and forth and trying to get someone to call us back.  So I called and spoke with Scott Sanders and told him what was going on with the tint and he too told me that they would find someone in our area to fix the issue.  He told me he would call me back with who they found.  I waited and waited then I called back again and spoke with John Hewitt and again told him what was going on with my tint and he again told me that they would find someone in my area to fix the issue.  He told me he would call me back with the information and I said are you sure you will call me back because I have been told that by so many people at this dealership. He said ""I said I would call you back and I will"".  Well that was over 2 (First week of May) weeks again and I have yet to have anyone call me back. This email was sent to Bryan Bittick on May 17th, 2016 @ 2:01PM and I have yet to have a call back from anyone regarding the tint and finding someone in my area (we live almost 3 hours away from the dealership)to replace the bubbled tint.  After being told by ALL these people they would find someone in my area (Beaumont) I feel that is what they should do.  I even went as far as to find different places in my area and the price they would charge to fix it, sent the information to Bryan Bittick but nothing…  We are paying a lot of money for our brand new car and we want it fixed in our area like we were told would happen.  I thought by going to Cowboy Kia in Conroe was a smart move but I was clearly wrong.  They will tell you one thing to get your business but go back on what they said.  If I could do it all over again I would not buy anything from this dealership nor would I refer anyone to shop at this location!

I would like to say that it only took from Feb 29th until May 9th to get a signed copy of our contract.  When we bought the car we were told they would send us a signed copy with our extra key and the plates for the car.  However, this was not the case because it took several of months and tons of emails and phone calls to receive our contract (May 16, 2016).  Also, when we bought our car we were told we could receive a $300.00 Visa gift card.  This also took several months to come because they make you fill out a GOOD review on “dealerrate.com”.  If you don’t do this then you will not get your money.

70,"May 24, 2016","First of all, the advertisement you get in the mail and prices you see online are ONLY if you qualify for them.   They list every possible discount you could get if...your a college graduate, military, uber driver, etc.  it's a joke.   They will give you the ones you qualify for then once you get close to the price you want to be at or LITERALLY -JUST BEFORE YOU SIGN their little spiel ""you'll take it for this price, sign right here"", (I did this at least 4-5 times) they come back and say ""oh, you don't qualify for this discount either"".   We went home (4 hours later) talked about it  and went back the next morning and told them we would take it for the last price that they came out with the night before, but oh no, they tacked on another $150.00 (I know $150.00 isn't anything, but it's the principle of it).   We agreed to $150.00 more, signed  and went on to finance. Another 2 hours and they were not even busy at that time as we showed up as soon as they opened.  An absolute disorganized madhouse!  They tell you one thing and do not stand by their word at all. Oh, and by the way...the gift card with purchase of a new vehicle-MAKE SURE you print out your reviews because if you don't it's another excuse to cost you more time and effort. Nowhere on the paper they give you that tells you which websites to go to does it tell you to print it off.  (I was told by Mike, the Finance Manager it was-NOT TRUE!). The FREE oil change (as I was told I would get from my salesman and then by finance it comes with every new purchase and again just 3 days ago by the finance manager) wasn't free.  Also, I was promised a detail and a tank of gas. (When I bought my BRAND NEW vehicle the tank was 1/2 full, I called they said we will fill it for you when you come get your tags.) NEVER got any of it.  I have called and left messages for the Sales Manager I have not received any return call.  I spoke with the Finance Manager, Mike, who says he will take care of it for me.  He wants me to let them come pick my car up and fill it up a detail it.  I'm sorry, I'm not comfortable handing the keys to MY brand new car that I just bought over to you all.   I should have been taken care of appropriately the first time.  All I can say is make sure you get EVERYTHING in writing.  Also, on another post I read they didn't get their sales contract the night they signed.  They didn't give us ours either.   I find this very odd as I have never left a dealership without it.  This was my 6th car to buy.  When we did get it, I noticed the interests
 rate was not what we were told we were getting.  I would not send my worst enemy to this dealership.  It took 7 hours total to purchase my car.  I love my car, but it was the WORST CAR BUYING EXPERIENCE EVER!  ",1.2

This extended the offer negotiation time and the time before we could meet with the finance manager. They have plans to build a new, state of the art dealership at the present location.

They confirmed the availability and gave me an appointment. I called them again when I was half way to confirm the appointment, and they confirmed it again.
When I reached the dealership the receptionist told me that vehicle has gone for servicing to Toyota showroom across the road and cannot be seen today. When I asked them that why did they gave me an appointment, they did not have any answer. I told the receptionist that I want to talk to manager to give the feedback. They asked me to wait in the waiting room. I waited for one hour and kept on reminding them but no one came to talk to me. I had to just leave the place.

I read multiple negative reviews online about the customer service here being really poor however, I still made a visit to the dealership thinking it wouldn't be so bad because I was very interested in one of their vehicles. Boy was I wrong! Veronica Hewitt was our sales person. She was nice and friendly until she found out that we would not be buying the car on that day. (She just couldn't understand that we needed to still do our own research before committing. And thank goodness we did because she lied about aftermarket alterations she would sell to us that come to find out can't even be done.) We initially came in to see a specific vehicle and she didn't even try to tell us details about the maker or model of the car. She didn't know about the vehicle features, mileage, cost, NOTHING AT ALL. She was just very uniformed especially considering the fact that we called in advance to say that we were coming and she too even called me to confirm the car we were looking for. Luckily we had already done all of our research and knew enough about the car so we were ok with looking over it and doing things by ourselves. After viewing the car we went back inside to meet her at her desk just to get the cost. We already came in with our own loan financier however, she stated that she just wanted to check in the system and ensure that the interest rate that they gave in advance matches. I told her I did not want my credit to be ran and she assured me TWICE that matching it in the system was only going to be a ""soft-pull"". (Side note: During the time that she left us waiting at her desk there was another customer in the area that was so upset with the salesman assisting her that she yelled ""Do not bring him near me! I do not want him working with me!"" so someone else had to assist the customer. Red flag moment maybe?) Moments later when we had to leave, she swings her arms up in the air waving them and with an attitude said, "" You made me do all this work for nothing!!!"" and didn't say a word to us afterwards. We were stunned! What work did you do? All we asked for was the cost of the car in which you still haven't provided us with? The next day she sends me a friendly message in regards to still selling me the car as if she didn't speak to me so poorly the day before and then completely ignore me. Two days later I received and email indicating that I had two HARD inquires on my credit. That's the ""work"" that she was in the back office doing. Veronica blatantly lied and ran my credit. Now I'm stuck with hits from companies I don't even know. I called to speak with a manager however, I never received a call back. I messaged Veronica and of course I never heard back from her either. Doing business with a slimy dealership like this is not worth is. Pay the additional money and take your business somewhere where your personal information is protected and the sales people use honest business tactics.",1.6

98,"May 13, 2016","I've already sent a review of Cowboy Kia to the main Kia site. I've NEVER been treated so badly. This will be our 4th Sorento and 5th Kia. We actually bought our 1st Kia from Cowboy. So it was shock that we were treated so shabbily yesterday. We went in, stating up front that we're still shopping, but fully intend to buy a 2016 Sorento within the next week or so. We had an appointment at noon, but the sales rep we were to meet was not available. His 'brother' assisted us instead. Once he learned that we would not be taking a new car home that day, he totally lost interest. I understand that, but to go off and leave us in the parking lot TWICE was beyond rude. Not only did he lead us to a car that he KNEW we had no interest in, but left us to 'go get keys' for something else. His only comment; ""I've got to feed my family', which he repeated 4 or 5 times. He did lead his sales supervisor out, but once HE found out we weren't buying that day, he went off to deal with someone else. We waited in the lot for quite awhile, which I jokingly said ""we could cut and run now!""  Finally, we went back inside, no one had offered either of us a cool water nor to sit in the shade. FINALLY someone else came up and said he'd be taking over for 'Steve'. (He had no idea what had taken place nor what we were shopping for.) STEVE HAD GONE TO LUNCH...  I'm sorry but this is so unacceptable. Do you leave a customer in the middle of a negotiation? 

We'd been warned about Cowboy Kia beforehand, but we thought we should at least hear them and what offers and incentives they might have. Right now, I don't CARE what they offer, I will not be going back, and I'll tell EVERYONE that this is a dealership to avoid. 
KIA General needs to reconsider allowing this dealership to operate under their current management and policies.

Things to expect from Cowboy Kia of Conroe is: 1. Don't believe what you see in the ads and don't believe what you are told over the phone. 2. Don't walk out without your signed copy of the sales contract, my wife and I were told we would receive the signed contract in the mail with the plates and extra key. Got the plates and key but no signed contract. After several calls were made to our salesman we received a copy of the contract with no signatures, blank. 3. Don't expect to receive service after the sale. The window tint is starting to lift in several areas on different windows. After explaining to our salesman that the tint was financed and was Cowboy Kia of Conroes responsibility to repair, he stated that the company they were using was doing really bad work and they fired them and started using another company and would have our problems resolved. It's been a month and we're still waiting. Also, we're still waiting for a return call from the sales manager. 
I wrote earlier ""Things to expect from Cowboy Kia of Conroe"", Expect a friendly staff, expect a great car, my daughter loves her car. Other than that, don't expect much else. 
Signed,
Last time buyers.",3.4

Steve Hewitt started me out but had an appointment customer come in, so I was turned over to Jim Holsen. Jim helped me so very much from looking at SUVs to finally the Forte. After 2 test drives that's the car I wanted. He was very informative about all the cars. He made sure I got the car I wanted in the color I wanted. Everyone there was friendly making sure that I was being helped at every turn. And the finance manager and sales manger worked to get me the payments I needed and at a great interest rate to boot! Everyone I had contact with made sure my car buying experience was fun and stress free. I would recommend this dealership to everyone.

174,"April 05, 2016","Cowboy Kia posts misleading ads and blatantly lied to us on the phone before hiding behind a weary and well practiced ""we have a disclaimer"". 

I saw the listed price on cars.com and was impressed by the low price, but concerned that there might be fine print, so I spoke with them via their online chat service. The woman I spoke with told me that was the ""internet price"", but was wary of confirming a price online and told me to wait to be contacted. No one contacted me so we called in the morning and spoke with Jim. We let him know that we saw a new Kia Soul at $12630, and wanted confirmation that that was the price before driving over two hours. He told us that was the base price and it was legitimate so we sorted out or financing and drove 2.5 hours to Conroe. 

When we got there, the salesman quoted the price at full MSRP, which was over $5000 more than the online price. He brought us to an office to explain that the online price was with every available discount and walked us through the discount list. Unless I was a veteran that graduated college in the last year and drove for uber (among other things) I would not qualify for that price. They offered me $750 off of the full MSRP, which was still $5000 over the online price. Even if EVERY rebate and discount on his sheet applied to me, it still did not add up to the price listed on the site. He told us repeatedly that we were mistaken and their ad had a disclaimer despite the fact that I had saved a pdf of the complete webpage on my tablet. He crumpled up our paperwork as we were leaving. 

We spoke with the manager on duty on the phone to let him know that we understood their policy but that we should have been told when we called to confirm the price, especially since we let them know on the phone that we had such a long drive. The manager was unwilling to help or budge on the price and just told is that he would talk to Jim. ",1.0

I went home that night and weighed the decision of 2 vehicles and within a couple of days I texted her that I would be in to buy the car that I wanted for my daughter.  I told her that my daughter had no idea and thought that I was buying her an old car.  I asked her if she could put a bow on it.  Well when my daughter and I arrived Veronica played right along, even having my daughter test drive an older used car.  It was funny.  We drove right to the new car with the bow.  My daughter was very surprised.  Thanks Veronica!!!

273,"February 24, 2016","If you are looking for a dealership with integrity and that treats it customers ethically; you will make the wrong selection by choosing this dealership.  They will not stand by their advertised pricing at all and are not willing to negotiate even though it is on their website.  I saw a vehicle online Sunday evening February 21, 2016 that I was interested in and submitted an online application along with an inquiry about the vehicle.  I was contacted by the dealership the very next morning and told to come and pick out a car.  I knew the car I wanted and informed Angelica of that along with my wishes of no games.  I liked the car and was coming to get it, so if it was unavailable...please don't waste my time and I would assure you that I will not waste yours.  So she scheduled me and appointment with Veronica for the same day at 2pm.  Little did I know,  I was given an appointment  to test drive a vehicle that was not on the lot and didn't find this information out until after I traveled 40 minutes to the dealership.  Veronica suggested that we move forward with paperwork and I agreed.  She never gave me a price for the vehicle and eventually said that she could not discuss this with me only finance could.  After making it to finance, I found out that the price of the vehicle was $2,000.00 more than the price listed on several other websites.  Not only did the website have a price that was $2,000 lower, there is a banner that reads, “at Cowboy Kia everything is negotiable”.  Not only did they not honor their price they were not willing to negotiate the deal.  I refused to sign the contract (which should have been completed before I even went to finance) in finance and asked the finance manager to speak with someone about the inconsistency in the price.  I left the dealer that evening and no one contacted or spoke with me until I initiated the follow up call the next afternoon.  In the phone conversation, I was told that the dealer would not honor the price that was listed on the website and they kept with the shenanigan that the price was a cash only price.  There was no indication of a cash price only on any of the websites that I viewed.  About an hour later, the dealership changed the prices on the website without any resolution with me.  Perhaps they thought the ads were misleading and flat out fraudulent, so they should update the price.  I have viewed several sites and complaints all say the same thing about the dealership.  I will forward my complaint to the BBB, state of Texas OAG, KIA regional office, KIA Headquarters, and KIA Global and every social media website knows about their unethical practices.",1.2

I'm a Benz lover and they advertised a 2010 E350 Coupe with very low miles. I was immaculate and I was in love! However, we were told that they didn't want our car (a 2007 Cadillac CTS) but that if we brought I our 2010 E350 back with an appraisal from either Carmax or Texas Direct, they would do the deal at $1000 above the value. Wednesday morning, my husband Drove back to Conroe with an appraisal and an approval from our credit union for the $29995 Benz ... Only to be told that they had fired the salesman who promised us the $1000 extra on our trade and that they wouldn't honor it. Jose was our salesman and was very polite/helpful but was undoubtedly being shuffled around by his veteran cohorts. From Moe to Scott the numbers kept changing and NOT in our favor. The haggling lasted over 5 hours and ended with the GM telling me if we let him carry the financing, he'd 'let us buy' at the original selling price and appraisal plus the promised $1000. Really?! When we refused, he said ok then in order to do the deal you will have to buy the 'Kia Package' which would add back $2000 to our cost.

283,"February 15, 2016","Please save your time and do not do business with Cowboy Kia. I reached out to Cowboy Kia because I was interested in purchasing a 2015 Kia Forte Koup that was listed on their website. I have talked to several people at this dealership and they are all walking disasters. First, I waited almost two hours just to speak to someone in sales. Once that happened I was actually hopeful that the deal would go through. I test drove the car and really like it. I worked with Colt (sales person) and told him my price range. He suggested I get the 2016 model to get a better price. There are several signs on this lot that state the best price is the internet price. I questioned how the 2016 model could be cheaper than the internet price of the 2015 model. His answer was unclear but I chose to move forward with the 2016 model. The first offer that was presented to me was $60 above my maximum price. I declined. The second offer was $30 above and I declined as well. At that point I had already been at the dealership for 4 hours. I was more than ready to go. I asked for my keys and as I was driving away, finance walked out to my car and gave me an offer that I was looking for. I declined because I couldn't imagine sitting there for another hour waiting on finance to draw up the paperwork. This dealership moves very slow and is not equipped with enough staff to meet their demand. Several customers walked out during the time I was there. This dealership must realize the percentage of getting a customer to return to their lot is really low once that customer has left. So today I reached back out to Colt and asked if the offer was still available. He originally assured yes. A few hours later Colt reached out to me saying the 2016 model they were trying to sell me on Saturday was really a 2015. This was quite upsetting but I asked if we could move forward with the 2015 model. He stated the 2015 did not have rebates. I was more than fine to move forward. He told me they would be unable to earn my business. I did not understand and Colt would not elaborate. So I reached out to Claudia (Internet Sales). She also would not elaborate and ended her two sentence respond by saying the car I wanted had already been sold. I called the dealership and spoke to someone different and was assured the model I was looking at was still available. Please do not do business with these people. It's unclear how a dealership does not know they are selling 2015 model and not a 2016. I also reached out to KIA and searched the KBB/Blackbook value of the 2015 model and I am positive that the MSRP for the 2015 model is not the same as the 2016 model even on new 2015 vehicles because KIA did not make a 2016 model! You would think they would know the 2016 model didn't exist but they didn't! Worst experience I've ever had purchasing a vehicle!!!",1.0

291,"February 10, 2016","THESE GUYS ARE CROOKS!!!
I have been to several dealerships in my pursuit of finding the right vehicle. I researched prices through smartphone apps and searched web pages for several days when I heard about ""Cowboy Kia of Conroe"". They advertised a substantially lower price than the competition in my local area. With them being a two hour drive each way I made sure that the price of the same specific car they advertised was in fact the same price I was to expect when I drive all the way there to buy a car. I was assured by the Internet specialist (Angelica Tutter) that they had several cars fitting the exact description of the ones I had shopped for at other dealers and that their price was Definitely the price as advertised, and that is the price I was to pay.
I printed up their prices and used it as a tool to shop the local competition in hopes of making the same deal locally. When the local salesman heard what dealership I was referring to, they warned me and told me that (Cowboy Kia) does Not run an honest operation and that I shouldn't waste my time going there.
Needless to say, I had to find out for myself...
Upon arrival everything seemed to be going as planned. I test drove one of the vehicles I had been looking at online and while sitting in the car I once again asked the salesman (Tommy Mueller) if the car I was driving was indeed the price that was advertised. He emphatically said yes. He even made mention about a bonus care package that went with the car as well. My emotions were swirling in anticipation of the great deal I was about to make... 
Once I was seated across the desk from the salesman ready to sign the contract, the deception started to unfold. The price Tommy was Now offering was over $10000.00 more than the price I had been told by him, Angelica and the listed price they had on their website, which by the way, had No Fine Print alluding to any special circumstances such as incentives/ rebates associated with the price of the car. 
I then asked him what happened to the agreed price I was told by Angelica and also by him while sitting in the car just moments before. He shifted the conversation to rebates that were required to get to that price. One of the rebates required me to drive for Uber another required me to install a wheelchair apparatus to the vehicle for handicapped passengers. Another required me to be a veteran or active military. Even if I qualified for every rebate they offered me I would still have been close to $5000.00 more than the previously agreed price!
After standing firm on the price I was told multiple times I would be able to purchase the car for, the salesman made a couple of trips to a back office to conference with the sales manager (Paul Jones) who finally made an appearance and Tommy (salesman) was nowhere to be found. After realizing there was not going to be a deal made, I challenged their honesty and integrity bringing up everything they had done deceiving me into driving two hours just to find out that they were just  as dishonest as I was warned about in the first place.
Buyer beware!!!
They lie!!! I confronted them with their lies and they said every dealership in the Houston area practices the same sales techniques...
Really???
Is this true?
I will definitely not be buying a Kia because if they allow dealerships to deceive the public on multiple levels, I don't believe I want their product!

300,"February 05, 2016","They use a lot of shady and unethical marketing practices. 

First of all, they offered me a $100 gift card for a good review in here and other website, just this can tell you about the ethics of the business.

I bought a car in there, the process was slow, painful, and very confusing. They don't talk to you with the truth at all, they try to sell you ideas far from the reality. 

The first offer I got was like this: ""If I offer you a car with no down and the first payment on February, would you buy it?""

Then they told me that they would give me a package as a gift, which turned out that it costs like $2,000. After one week of waiting for their response they told me they made me a discount, the discount in reality was taking this package off so the invoice would be $2,000 less, not a real discount.

At the end of the purchase I had to put $500 down. Which is OK, is not that much, but they offered me no down.

After a month with the car, we got via mail an opportunity to win a price, you had to uncover some hidden numbers from a ticket, and if you matched two you would win. We got two ""2500"" so my wife thought that we had won something. I noticed that the number didn't have the ""$"" sign so I predicted it was a scam. By the way, this ticket came with a ""DownPaymentVOUCHER"" for $3,000.

Obviously it turned out that way, they asked my wife to go there and then they tried very hard to sell her a new truck, that they already knew she liked. About the price, the 2500 number were just ""points"" to get into an opportunity of winning $10,000 scraping some ticket, obviously she won nothing, other than two sales guys pushing her to run her credit to buy a new truck.

The worst of all is that if the sales person can't get you with their ""offers"" they get mad, the get mad at you because you are not buying. This sales person called my wife a lot of times asking for the good review in exchange of a $100 gift card, one time this person told my wife ""OK, then, I will keep your $100 gift card for myself"", are you kidding me?

Without counting the emails saying that we would get two gift cards on the total of $500 and other lies. 

Everything in there feels like scam, don't trust these people.",1.0

She also told me the rebates would be waived at dealership discretion (reinforced by Veronica) We already had financing approved through our banking institution. She made it clear to to me there would be no dealer adds added to the price. I covered everything prior to driving there only to get scammed!!!This dealership is staffed by frauds. They are trained to misrepresent their inventory. We walked away from a gem of a deal at another dealership just to drive 250 miles for them to NOT stand behind the negotiated price.

1. Keep the customer there as to create ""anxiety"" and willingness to just buy a car and escape!
2. The gave us a price that we agreed on.
3. At the end, they did not honor the original agreement and said that is just how it goes!
4. They kept us there all day only to be show an complete LIARS and SNAKES buy giving us a higher payment than we agreed upon.
STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS DEALERSHIP! They give you a $100 gift card ONLY if you go on this site and several others and leave positive feedback..not ""real"" feedback...but it must be positive. This should be made illegal!
I cannot say enough about the HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE we had there.  Took our car keys and refused to give them back several times when we wanted to leave. I almost called the police. Do yourself a favor and do what we did: After 7 hours of xxxx at Cowboy Kia, we went to DeMondtrond and dealt with a salesperson named George.

The Bluetooth function in the vehicle that allows one to connect a personal cell phone without any wire connections to the car phone system so that the driver can do handsfree dialing and talking.  A Safety plus! and also allows one to download his or her own personal music into the existing system.
The get-up-and-go on the road surprised me for the size of the car.  Gives you a sense that you are in a really sporty vehicle when taking to the highway at an accelerated speed.

He listened to what I wanted and he guided me through a purchase with no snags and made me fee very comfortable making my purchase.

They flat out lied to me over the phone (after THEY called me) guaranteeing terms of a sale, and denied the guarantee, refusing to honor their word after I dragged my pregnant wife 1-1/2 hours up there. This happened twice. The second time, they sent pictures of the a vehicle I was interested in and spelled out the downpayment, monthly payments, and term length of loan in text, (they already had my credit application on file from my filling it out both online, and 3 days earlier the first time we drove up there). The manager even said "" Consider it my personal gift to you and your wife for your new baby"". Seeing it in writing, I thought, there was no way that they could be so deceitful, again. I was wrong. They raised the price by more than $1000 the first trip, and more than double the second time, both times once I got there. Fool me twice, I guess. My fault for giving the benefit of the doubt. They even denied me the opportunity to speak to the manager and the rep that sent me the photos and text guarantee.

My original complaint was ""I had fuel system serviced 3 weeks ago and has steadily gotten worse mpgs along with heavy shimming intermittently"" to which Nathan proceeds to go to my car and start diagramming scratches dings and dents on the exterior of my car...I know not how exterior appearance has ANYTHING to do with mechanical problems...but OKkkkkk. Then he proceeds to try to thrust a $600 tune up on me when I DO mention that I have never had spark plugs changed since I've bought the car. ($600 ""tune up pkg"" does NOT include spark plug replacement...so I needed this WHY?) So I told him, ""no I've had all those things done recently I would like spark plugs replaced and find out why its running so bad since last visit 3 weeks ago"". He then said it would be $218 to which I asked ""why so much?"" and he broke down all pricing to which by then the mechanic found that I needed to replace the alternator belt, another $200. So I ""ok'ed"" the $418 repairs and left to later return to after standing there 30 minutes while they entered all my repairs into the computer with them telling me I owed $661.72.

I am a person who likes to research cars and come up with the model, trim and options.  I had my eye on a Kia Sorento for some time now and research both the LX and EX models without options (I am not an options guy).

I did learn something interesting about car manufacturers; out of a hundred units that are shipped at the beginning of a model year, 95 are fully loaded and 5 are the base (no options).

He helped us look around and we became interested in the Kia Sportage. I love the service that Mr. Steve Kobo provided. He even called to check on me (I had been ill)and see if we had any questions. I am dissapointed in the Kia Sportage.... its beautiful and fancy but it doesn't give that great of gas mileage. Thanks.",4.8
409,"June 16, 2011","My daughter and I recently purchased a Sportage from Steve Kobulnicky at Cowboy Kia in Conroe, TX.  From the time we stepped onto the lot, Steve made us feel comfortable and was eager to help us find the right vehicle for my dauther ~ her first car.  Steve and the Kia group were willing to work with us on price and when my daugher struggled a bit with color we even talked about bringing a car down from the Carolina's. The closing of the deal and paperwork process was reasonably painless and Steve was instrumental in moving this process along quickly due to a previous commitment.  When my daughter stopped by later to pick up her new vehicle, Steve did a great job of walking her through the car to make sure she understood all its essential functions.  Her follow-up visit to the service center was positive and the service manager was kind enough to provide a IPOD cord for the car when my daughter realized her existing cable would not work.

Overall, my first Kia experience with Steve and Cowboy Kia was very positive and I'd highly recommend folks give these guys a look if you live in the Houston area.  They are truly ""pros in position""!",4.6
410,"June 16, 2011","Steve was extremely friendly and bent over backward to make a deal that worked for us. I was highly pleased with my car buying experience at Cowboy Kia and would definately recommend this dealership to a friend looking to buy a new or used car. My only disappointment was with the Kia (main site), website which shows the Soul starting at $13,300. The site deceptively shows the base model as having 5 speed with air conditioning. When I arrived at the dealership I was told that the starting price shown on the website was for a 5 speed without air conditioning. I found this to be deceptive on the part of Kia corprate, as the website is misleading. Though I was sold a fine used vehicle I would have liked a new Soul for $13,300.  ",4.8
411,"June 16, 2011","Bobby and Johnny, worked with us and found a a dependable, reliable, and low mileage vehicle for my husband.  They did all theycan to keep the payments within our budget, and made sure that we were comfortable through the whole process. These guys are really friendly people, they treat you like family, and will do what they can to earn your business. They didn't give us the run around and made sure we understood the process of purchasing the vehicle.  I am so grateful to these men for helping us. The are professional and friendly.
I have and will continue to recommend Cowboy Kia to my friends.",4.8
412,"June 13, 2011","My husband and I had been shopping for a new Kia Soranto and we decided to go see what Cowboy Kia had to offer.  We were treated like family.  Victor found me the perfect fit for me.  I have been driving it with love everyday.  I had to visit the service department to have some scratches fixed and Kriss was there to greet us.  He took care of us right away and put us in a loaner car for the day.  Kriss went above and beyond and fixed my Kia up good as new.  I'm so excited to drive this vehicle everyday. Victor calls me from time to time just to check in and see how we are doing.  He is really a top of the line Kia family member.  I will tell all my friends, family and even passer by's to buy a car from Cowboy Kia.

413,"May 24, 2011","This car buying experience was the best!!! I was treated with respect from everyone I came in contact with, and the Salesmen were especially courteous. The finance man worked tirelessly to get me the best deal. The Salesmen knew their product and explained everything in detail. I've never seen a team work together like a family that treated their customers like one of the family. I thank Conroe KIA for the best car buying experience I ever had. I've been to other dealerships and none of them compare. Thank you Cowboy KIA for having a great team that works great together for the best Customer Service ever! I will definitely have others to visit you for their next car shopping experience. Sincerely, Julianne Hall

414,"May 15, 2011","Great salesman, no pressure at all!  Very friendly, knowledgable, willing to work with us, stayed within our budget without us having to continuelly remind them we had a budget!  Made an effort to find the car we wanted rather than trying to talk us into a car the next step up.",5.0
415,"March 11, 2011","My wife and I just bought a new Kia Soul and Kia Sportage from Cowboy Kia.  I was dreading going to a new car dealership as it had been a few years and I never liked the experience.  The high pressure sales people I had dealt with in the past was still vivid in my mind.  A colleague at work had referred me to this dealer because he had bought there about 6 months ago and thought it was great.  Well let me tell you, my wife and I were treated fantastic, we got a great deal, with no pressure what so ever. Our salesperson Mr. H was on top of the whole experience.  Not only knowledgeable and professional, he has a superb personality and is very funny.  We could not get both cars detailed on the day we bought, due to another commitment, so we took mine back this afternoon to get it finished.  They jumped right on getting the car cleaned and Mr. H finished going over the warranty and all the gizmos in the car to ensure we understood how to operate everything. All of the people we dealt with were great and we are both extremely satisfied with the whole experience.  We recommend them whole-heartedly!!!   ",5.0
416,"February 13, 2011","Everyone was extremely helpful, courteous, and pleasent to deal with, especially Victor Kaufhold. Victor went out of his way to make my new car purchase a pleasent experience and worked hard to make the deal for my new KIA Sorento happen. I would highly recommend Cowboy KIA of Conroe and Victor.",5.0
417,"February 12, 2011",I looked online and they had a Koup I wanted to look at.  Parked next to the Koup was a red SX. I really liked it.  George and the staff at Kia are really friendly and helped me get a really nice car for a reasonable price.  So far I would have no problems recommending Cowboy Kia to friends and family. ,5.0
418,"February 08, 2011","I first visited Cowboy Kia on January 22nd to test drive the KIA Soul+. Victor greeted me promptly and took me to drive the automobile I was looking for.  I loved driving the car immediately, and Victor was very thorough in going over the safety features as well as all the standard equipment that the model comes with. Absolutely no pressure from him. I made a deal for the car I wanted, and was firm as to what I was willing to pay. This car is rapidly becoming very popular, and it took 9 days to find the model I wanted. This is where Charlton came into the picture. He didn't give up looking for the color I wanted in my Soul+.  Two days before I was going to be picking up my car, with my second choice color, Charlton calls me with the good news.
I am so happy to be driving the exact car I wanted!  All the employees I met at Cowboy Kia of Conroe are professional and knowledgable. I highly recommend this dealership to anyone that is looking for a great car buying experience....and a fabulous automobile!

419,"February 08, 2011","I called 2 weeks prior to my visit, I knew exactly what I was looking for and I explained to Victor that I had some credit issues. I felt that I had worked hard and deserved to own a new vehicle. I told him what I had saved and he said that he would be entire sales process because of bad experiences w/ other dealers. I drove of the lot around 2:45 pm the ""PROUD OWNER OF A 2011 KIA SORENTO."" I am so excited, I still get butterflies when I think about it, I have told so many of my co-workers, family, and friends that if they are looking to buy COWBOY KIA is the best choice :) ",5.0
420,"February 07, 2011",I needed to purchase a new car for me and my husband. I looked in the phone book and found the nearest Kia dealer in my location.I like to keep my purchases local in my area for several different reasons.We live in this area and we need to support our local suppliers and dealers. I pulled into the dealership and was greeted by george hewitt who made me and my husband at home.George found out all mine and my husbands needs for the purchase of both our new vehicles.After george helped us he took us to finance where we meet with David Johnson.David helped us ge the right rate for our needs and some much needed aftermarket products that will help keep us if we need assistance after the sales. I know that we got a great deal on both our vehicles and financeing purchsed at the best rates for us.I will strongley recommend George Hewitt for sales and David Johnson or all finical needs.CowBoy Kia of Conroe will always be recommended to all of our church and friends and family members. Thank You CowBoy Kia for a Great Job.,5.0
421,"February 07, 2011","I did not know buying a car could be such a pleasant experience!  Salesman Victor Kaufhold met my husband and I when we arrived and was with us until we walked out with our new vehicle.  All our questions and concerns were answered immediately.  The color I wanted was not available on their lot, but they found me the color I wanted right away and never tried to persuade me to take what was available, which has happened in the past with other dealerships.  Then Victor introduced us to David Johnson in the Finance Department.  Mr. Johnson really listened to us when we explained what we could afford and was very kind and thoughtful throughout the financing process.  Plus, got us financing even better than what we had expected!
Thank you Cowboy Kia for my beautiful new 2011 Kia Soul Exclaim!    
I highly recommend Cowboy Kia of Conroe to anyone looking for a vehicle.",5.0
422,"February 05, 2011","The weather was very cold as my wife and I came on to the lot.  I was surprised to see a consultant out in the cold as well, but Mr. Kaufhold was very quick to offer a warm handshake and smile.  Immediately, I was at ease as Victor brought us inside to find what we were looking for.  Victor only took about 2 minutes to suggest 2 vehicles and we went to the lot.  Within a couple of minutes we were test driving a beautiful Sorento.  Within 2 days, Victor helped us drive away in a brand new 2011 Sorento (fully loaded)!  That was a great feeling!  Victor and the staff at Cowboy Kia treated us like family.  Not only do we have a beautiful vehicle but new friends at Cowboy Kia.  They went above and beyond to make sure that we received the best financing and trade-in allowance.  Thanks again!!!!!!!",5.0
423,"February 05, 2011","They sold me a used Mini Cooper that was unsafe because the airbags didn't work and they knew it.  When I found out they wanted me to ""back out of the deal"" even though I'd already owned the car for over a week and it was going to cost them 1500 bucks to fix it and they kept saying they had only made 400 dollars off the deal.  They then started telling me they couldn't let the car off the lot.  This was when I'd brought it in for them to fix the driver's side power window.  They made me think I was going to have to call the sheriff just to leave with a car I had bought a week prior.  Service department seems to run separately from anything else at the dealership.  They then offered to pay for a 1/3 of the cost to repair the airbag sensor and wanted me to take it to some fly by night place that did it cheaper than the Mini dealership.  I just don't trust them at all and wouldn't recommend anyone I know to them for purchasing an auto new or used.  The salesperson, Jimmy, was a nice enough guy but when you get jacked around that much you don't know who's in on it.",1.6
424,"February 04, 2011","My experince at Cowboy KIA, has been great each and everytime that I have visited the dealership. Upon my arrival I was greeted by "" Mr. H and Michael, they listened to me and took care of my new  vehicle needs. They were patient and kind with me, while I looked at several cars. I had traveled to a dealership in Houston, at first and those guys were rude. I normally don't buy from the local dealers thinking that I can get a better bargains. By far, this was one of my ""Best Car Experiences"". The customer service all around was great; from the car salesmans, finance guy, the porters. I truly can't praise these guys enough, everytime I had a need or question they we're on point with an answer. Thank you to Cowboy KIA, enjoyed doing business with you! ",4.6
425,"January 04, 2011","The reason for this review being so low is for starters, they turned around and sold my two year old Kia that had only 19,000 miles on it before they had made sure and secured financing on the other car that I had been told had been financed!!! I went through this process for two months dealing with lie after lie about what was going on from the people in financing and the head manager. Never could get a straight answer over the phone, instead I always had to make the 30 minute drive back up to the dealership in order to get any answers, or at least bullshit answers!!
They promised to have my trade in paid off within a week to two weeks and it ended up taking two months even after they had already sold it leaving me with having to deal with Kia Financing contacting me wanting me to make payments on something that was neither in my possession or even in the possession of the car dealership!!
No one should have to go through the drama that we went through in order to buy a new car!!! With the actions that they had demonstrated I ended up with no other choice than to take the deal that they gave me two months later instead of having the choice to take the car I had used for a trade in and walk away!! The only good thing was the sales person that we dealt with, Mr. H, he was great!!! However, he had been put in the middle of this mess by the management team in order to cover their own mess up and that was very unfair to both him and myself!!
So to answer your question, NO I would not refer anyone, friend or foe, to this dealership!!!!",2.2
426,"October 27, 2010","Tommy is the rudest person I have ever met. He should not be working with people at all. When I was trying to get my payment where I wanted it, he said you make (x) amount of money, what's the problem? The problem was that I didn't want to spend all of my income on a car payment. It doesn't matter anyway. I told him what I wanted and they told me in the beginning they could get it where I wanted. They never did. I should have left then. In the beginning I told them I had $1000 for a down payment, they said that was fine. In the final steps of the paperwork they told me they wanted $2000. So I said o.k. They told me I had a month to come up with the other $1000. I came in the next day with a posted dated check, I was told they don't take post dated checks, that I had to pay it all then. Then the cashier guy said they hold checks for 3 weeks, max. Tommy found someone (who knew her job) that said they do in fact hold checks. I was also given a ""We Owe You"" slip, this had the things that are wrong with the car that they promised to fix. Not only do the people inside (Tommy) not have any clue what there service department can or can't do, they also don't anything about their hours over there. We thought it needed a front end alignment because it was pulling to the right. The service people said it didn't need an alignment, just a tire replaced. I got my car back yesterday and now it's pulling to the left even worse than it was to the right. I don't even want to deal with these idiots anymore. I'm so frustrated with them.",1.6

When I did get my car back, the gps was broken and outdated by at least 5 years even though I paid for it.  The staff did not return my phone calls, they were rude, and even the General Manager did not have decency to help me.
