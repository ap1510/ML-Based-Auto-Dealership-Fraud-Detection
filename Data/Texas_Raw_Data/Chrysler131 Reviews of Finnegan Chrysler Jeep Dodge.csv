1,"June 09, 2020","Omar Coreas was my Salesman when purchasing my new Jeep.  He is extremely knowledgeable, and so kind.  While negotiating he said he wanted to earn my business, and that’s exactly what he did! He made the transaction very easy, and I received everything he promised!  Thank you Omar!",5.0

3,"March 26, 2020","I brought my Ram after the check eng light came on and Sal met me on the service drive before i even exited the vehicle. He reassured me that i was in good hands. I did not ask for it but he provided me with a loaner vehicle and that he would keep me informed what was going on and he surely did! 
Sal had my Truck ready the next morning and way cleaner then how i dropped it off.  Sal's  knowledge of the brand he works for is fantastic! 

Sal has earned my loyalty this day forward as long as i have my Ram truck.

5,"March 20, 2020","Purchased my Ram in 2013 and decided on Finnegan as they offered a 15 oil service fee for life for my vehicle.  This was non-transferable and I continue to own this vehicle.  Seems Finnegan now has backed out of this offer saying they no longer with to honor their agreement.  

Sounds like they are unable to honor their agreement, but i honored my part by paying for the vehicle.  If this isn't corrected, i can NOT see how i can trust anything they say for my next truck.  I will gladly drive to Wharton or Sealy for my next purchase otherwise.

I requested the service manager call me to discuss this issue, since he was in a meeting at the time i was at the dealership THREE WEEKS AGO.  Still no call - must be a very long meeting!!!

It is not a matter of employee friendliness, quality of work or timeliness of service.  It is a matter of the dealership itself NOT fulfilling the PROMISE they made in their own promotion. ",3.4
6,"February 12, 2020","Service is always good! Never an issue. However, you all need to bring back the Finnegan Friday Special.  Paying 49.95 for an oil change is a little extreme.especially since their are "" other locations"" who will do it for way less.Yeah, i know, you get what you pay for.. But i will take that chance if need be. Lets bring back the good 'ol days! You would definately get the other customers to come back!",5.0

20,"August 21, 2019",Tired of dealing with car salesman and the used car market- friend referred us to Bubba Alvarez at Finnegan in Rosenberg. Everyone at the dealership was friendly and made us feel like they wanted to help us find the used truck that we were looking for. Bubba  is a great guy and jumped through hoops to make us happy and we will definitely buy from him again. Finnegan isn’t your typical dealership. Definitely care about their customers; feels like. family owned place without all the corporate BS around most other dealerships today. Go see Bubba Alvarez at Finnegan if you are in the market for a vehicle!!!!,4.8

24,"July 08, 2019","These guys were closing when we drove up. Instead of telling us to come back the next day, they allowed us time to test drive and make a purchase. The finance manager was already home and drove back to assist us. Nicest, friendliest, no bs group of salesmen I've ever dealt with! ",5.0
25,"July 07, 2019","Service guy Chris helped me set up a service plan that was right for me, and at a reasonable price better than a quick oil change and service shop could offer. Also I’m old enough to know if you let the pro’s service your vechicals they will run problem free for a long time. I would recommend Finnegan auto group to anyone they are a top notch organization and wil take care of the full spectrum of your automotive needs and this is coming from someone who just transplanted from Detroit, MI.

29,"May 27, 2019",I purchased a new Jeep Rubicon from them. They had to locate it and have it delivered to the dealership. It came it quicker than promised. Very knowledgeable Sales staff. There was some minor confusion related to some add-on items. Sales Manager made it right. Finance beat our credit union interest rate. Not so good on trade-in offer. But that is typical. Sold it myself through another channel. No big deal. Overall excellent experience. ,4.8
30,"May 11, 2019","I believe Don Adams was the first salesman I spoke with and also Miguel in sales. Highly Professional & knowledgeable. Very friendly and made me feel comfortable.

32,"April 26, 2019","Visited the dealership today to see Mike Todd and test drive a pre owned Ford truck advertised online. Mike was friendly and helpful, pleasant and professional. I am a no nonsense type of person and Mike treated me with respect. We drove the truck and I fell in love with the truck and with Finnegan Chrysler. These guys are great. I have challenged credit and had a financing approval ready to go, but Mike took the time to try to find me a better deal on financing to lower my payment and save me some money.  The finance company had made an error on their paperwork and their finance department worked with me to get it all straightened out. They were patient and apologetic for the error even though it was not their fault. Paperwork was straightened out i a timely manner and I signed on the dotted line. I could not be happier.
Normally I do not have a very good opinion of car salesmen and dealers, but my experience today at Finnegan Chrysler changed my opinion. There are good dealers and great sales people out there. Mike Todd from Finnegan Chrysler proved this. I could not be happier with my experience or my purchase. THANK YOU MIKE TODD AND FINNEGAN CHRYSLER!

37,"February 22, 2019","This is what buying a car should be like!  I placed a request for info online, and asked to be emailed.  Unlike several other dealers who proceeded to blow my phone up with unwanted sales calls, Finnegan emailed me a detailed worksheet with everything itemized out BELOW the ""internet"" price!  I received a text and another email, inviting me to get pre-qualified for financing and come test drive the vehicle in person.  Two days later I was in my new vehicle!  I spent about 45 minutes actually at the dealership, most of it was learning the operation of the Jeep's amazing features after everything else was already done!  DW, Don & James in finance made this the most amazing experience!  I will be telling anyone I meet about it!  Thanks guys and thanks Finnegan!  You really changed my mind about what buying a car is like!",5.0

40,"January 26, 2019","I shopped ahead on the internet and saw a Ram 1500 that perked my interest at Finnegan. I called first to tell them the truck I was interested in and explained to them my health situation would keep me from purchasing until next week...if I could purchase at all. In other words, I was not going to buy that day! I also requested that they give me their best price. I’ve been through a lot lately and did not want the stress of haggling. They promised me they would have the truck ready and the numbers ready. I test drove the truck, it wasn’t quite what I wanted, but if the price was good, I might come back. Well, I waited and waited for the quote, finally Don the sales manager presents me with a Base number that is far higher than the internet price. Then he proceeds to go through all the add ons and their prices and the price gets even higher. Ridiculously higher! I looked at him and said “i’m outta here”. He ran after me with paper in hand and is telling me he will remove the price of all the add ons. He was leaning on my car while crossing them off. I never thought this would happen, but I literally had to start crying for him to let me leave. In his defense, crying is easier for me these days then ever. But, it should have never come to that. Plus, they obviously lied to me on the phone when I was very honest with them. ",1.0

67,"April 03, 2018","This has been the worst experience I've ever had buying a car. I honestly wish I could rate negative stars. What is so puzzling to me is how badly this transaction could go when I walked in with my OWN financing, something I've never had for my last 4 car purchases. Normally you have bad experiences when trying to get the price you wanted but we already had that settled!!!!

The Bad Experience Part 1

I bought my Dodge Durango back in November of 2016 and my sales rep, in the middle of negations, left us for over 30 minutes to go help another potential buyer. 30 minutes may not seem like a long time but when we had already been there for hours looking/talking it all adds up. Not to mention we have kids and have the parents watching our toddler and baby.

Everything in my body told me to just get up and leave but I give people the benefit of the doubt and I liked the car and I don't really like car shopping in the first place.

He finally came back and we got to terms that worked for both parties. They were going to add some HEADREST DVD players and fix some items we talked about but at a later time. We got a new car! (yay...??) It only took them another 30 minutes to do god knows what because the tank wasn't full and the car was cleaned/detailed, they were going to do that next time I stop by. We finally got to drive home around 9:30 pm after everyone else had left for the day.

Now starts The Bad Experience Part 2

I couldn't reach anyone to talk about the dvd players or the repairs that were going to be made for over a week. I literally had to go drive up there and force them to take the car back. They finally got me my sales rep who got me a rental car. They gave me a brand new 2017 car that had 10 miles on it... I'm putting tons of miles on this thing and finally get a call 3 days later talking about my car and how I shouldn't have the car because it's not a rental. The service manager calls me and tells me we are waiting on the dvd players and they had to get custom built headrests which somewhat satisfied me for recent experiences but it'll take a little bit longer to get them in. 

The very next day I get a call telling me the car is ready and I thought maybe they put a rush on everything, I was getting super excited to get my new car with custom dvd players and the repairs done we talked about.

Can you guess what happened? First thing I do is look in the back of the car to see some 1990's bulky dvd players strapped to the back of my headrest with the seats basically falling apart because they didn't put it back together right. None of my repairs were completed and it still wasn't cleaned....

At this point I'm done. I don't like to complain or threaten to get my way. I didn't have much in writing and I'm not the type of person to cause a scene. The car worked, the things needed fixing weren't mechanical, and the DVD players worked. My kids wouldn't care what they are looking at. I get in my car and drive away. 

This brings us to present day: The Bad Experience Part 3

This is the first car I've owned that has something called a Wheel Lock. About the dumbest invention in the world if you ask me. All 4 of my tires have it but low and behold, my car doesn't have the key! I found out about it at my last oil change when I asked them to rotate my tires because I heard you are suppose to do that kinda thing every so often. It couldn't be done so It's been nagging me in the back of my mind that I should get this taken care of but the thought of calling Finnegan Dodge again gives me the shivers. 

Despite calling before hand and saying we can come down and get one, they wanted to charge us $165 to fix our wheel lock problem after we got there. My wife is sitting at the service center while I'm trying to call the sales manager. He's in a meeting so I have to leave a voicemail. 

Have I received a call yet? Nope.

A few things have come from these experiences:
1) I will never shop at any Finnegan Dealership again.
2) I will never recommend anyone to shop at a Finnegan Dealership
3) I'm not even sure I want a Dodge again",1.0

We went up there one evening basically knowing we wanted that Jeep if we could get it for the price we wanted. Gene DOESN'T listen. He never once asked what names we wanted on the title of the car - just assumed my husband. He basically ignored me and seemed put out when he did something wrong and we hard to correct him. He needs to listen more. He continually kept grabbing his crotch which is truly disrespectful. At delivery, he did not go over any of the features of the Jeep. 
This isn't the first vehicle we bought there, but if salesmen are like Gene it might be the last. ",1.6

It took them 3 weeks longer than allotted to get my car back to me. They felt bad and gave me a free oil change so of course I'm going to come back to use that instead of spending $80 some where else. Was told they would have me out before 8, waited until 9 to ask why it was taking so long and they blamed it on software updates... for my oil change. Just don't. ",2.2

119,"March 07, 2016","We went to Finnegan's to purchase a new Dodge Durango Citadel.  They had one just like we wanted... We worked out what I considered a fair deal for both parties but we couldn't drive the car because one of the wheels had been taken off to put on another vehicle (we were told one of the owners messed up a wheel on another Durango).  We came back the next night (Tuesday night) after work and were able to test drive the car... very first thing I noticed was the brake pedal went immediately 3/4 to the floor (which is unlike the Durango we drove the day before or the Challenger we bought from them last year).  To make a long story short they had the Service manager then a service Technician drive the car.  The Manager said it was ok... the Tech said only it stops the vehicle ok.  They told me to take the Durango home and if by the next day we didn't want it they would find another for me.  As we were leaving the dealership the car wouldn't shift out of first gear... I had to slow way down then shift to neutral then back to drive to get it to shift (it did it again the next day when taking the car back).  They found another Durango like we wanted in Beaumont and said they would have it by Thursday or the latest Friday (this was Wednesday).  After not getting a call on Thursday I called our salesman on Friday morning... he said they were still working on the transfer but the deal was done they just needed to do the paper work and should have the car delivered either that day or Saturday.  Again didn't here anything all day and called Saturday morning and was told it can't happen on Saturday and they would get it on Monday or Tuesday.  At this point I am frustrated at the dealership... from the Service department saying there wasn't anything wrong with the first Durango we wanted to buy to the management trying to push us into buying a bad car.  I told the salesman that he would have to give us more discount on the car or we will just go somewhere else.  I received a call back shortly from the Sales Manager... the gist of the conversation was no, they weren't going to discount the car any more and ""I just need to be patient and I will get the car""... on top of that the manager stated that the holdup is that they hadn't worked out a deal on the transfer yet (the salesman told us on Thursday it had been done and only the paper work needed to be done).  We immediately drove down and picked up our SUV we were trading in and left and went to Ryan Dodge in Sealy and bought a car.  I will NEVER do business with Finnegan... We still have a Challenger and I will drive out of my way to somewhere else to get it serviced... I don't trust the service department at Finnegan's... or the sales department!!",1.6
120,"December 11, 2015","We were recommended by a relative to contact salesman, Daniel and we were going to trade my wife's car for a '16 Traverse. Finnegan Dodge also owns the Chevrolet dealership next door so I contacted Daniel to see if he could also sell Chevys and he said yes so we were going to be in Richmond for Thanksgiving, we live 300 miles away, went in fri. 11/27 made a deal on the Traverse and all was good. They also had a Ram that I liked and told Daniel I wouldn't have much time on sat. the 28th but if we could make a deal by phone then I would trade my truck for the Ram. He said he would put some numbers together and call me which he did and I sent him pictures of my truck and all the info. about it. after a couple of calls negotiating we made a deal and I went in to sign the papers and do the deal. Mark the finance guy handled everything very smoothly, and quickly, All was good until on tues. I got the papers out to get the v.i.n number for the insurance agent and noticed the selling price and the internet advertised price was a big difference and the number of payments for the length of the loan was 9 months more than I had agreed on. After several phone calls to Daniel finally got through, after the sale they are not very good about returning or answering calls, he told me he would check with Mark and find out what happened. A few calls later he tells me Mark is going to call me in about 20 mins. After another day or 2, I decide to do some research and find some reviews that are not so good and they have a pretty standard response from R. Bowman with his email link so I email him and text Daniel that I sent Bowman an email, within about 15 mins. I get a call from Mark in finance and told  him about the mistakes on the contract and he tells me that I got a heck of a deal and they only made $200 on the deal and I had added credit life which when he told me the payment would be $3.00 a month more and extended bumper to bumper warranty would be $7.00 more for a total of $10.00 a month more but said nothing about the number of payments changing which if you put a calculator to it the numbers do not add up to 9 months of payments. He then told me there was no way they could have done the financing for the amount Daniel and I agreed on which to my surprise he told me it didn't matter what Daniel and his manager had agreed to that it was up to him. My biggest mistake was being in a hurry to get back to the family dinner and not reading over the entire loan contract, Mark never mentioned the number of monthly payments but made sure to tell to sign the place that says you can't sue them. This would normally set off a signal that something must be wrong with either the truck or the papers. But I was in a hurry and didn't catch it. Never did hear from R. Bowman but I did get a call from John Vaughn on 12/7 after I texted Daniel (because they weren't returning calls). John told me he would be off on 12/8 but would investigate what happened and call me mid morning 12/9. Called John and left a voice mail since he didn't call and it's 12/11 and still haven't heard from him or anyone else. Lesson learned never ever sign anything until you read every part of it.",1.6

125,"January 30, 2015","I bought a used Dodge Ram 1500 from them at a decent price, but after I paid and left with the truck is when I noticed a few problems. It was raining when I bought it and it masked the scratches and dents I found on the roof the next morning. The reason I noticed it was from the second story of the house looking down to admire my new truck. I didn't think I had to check the roof if they (supposedly) already inspected the vehicle, nor was it written in their inspection report. I also found a pool of water under the steering wheel and found the source to be coming from the roof. It was from one of the dents in the roof and drips along the electrical fuses/wires next to the cluster panel of gauges behind the steering wheel. I called the salesman numerous times, but he didn't return my calls. I took pictures and sent them to him, still nothing. I live in Corpus Christi and finally drove to the dealership to get some answers. I talked with the manager, he looked at the leaking roof, took my number again, said he could fix it, and I haven't heard anything from him in over two months. Also, the front end alignment was off and although I can't prove that they knew about it, I shouldn't be paying hundreds for an alignment after a couple months of use.
1) Scratched, Dented, Leaking Roof
2) Alignment issues
3) Zero communication
4) My time away from work to pay more money out of my pocket due to their lack of customer service.

I have left messages with someone named Javier who I have spoken with EVERY single time I have called.  He has put me on the waiting list for a loaner car since the seat repairs will require me to leave my car for several days.  He has then conveniently forgotten that I was on the waiting list for a loaner car.

128,"June 19, 2013","Shopped around other dealerships and my experience with Finnegan was the worst of them all. Unfortunately they had a car similar to the one I've been looking for. Other dealers offered perks (car washes, free oil changes for a year, etc.) for buying from them. But after my salesman asked his manager for the answer to every question I asked it was no for any perks. Speaking of salesman, this guy had to be new because he didn't know much about the car he was selling nor much about the services provided by the dealer. I believed I spent three hours there due to his incompetence. First it was the pricing, (he didn't know it was listed on auto trader for several thousand cheaper then the sticker price). Then it was financing. I was pre approved and he seem to not know what that meant. He kept coming back with papers stating how much a month I need to pay. I insisted to list the bottom line price, (cost plus ttl) and he continue to ask over and over to run another credit report. Another thing which he didn't know was if you keep checking your credit score it goes down. His response, ""it won't effect your credit at all"". BS, it was obvious he just wanted me to finance with them not my credit union. It was really annoying. Third, I waited an hour and half to see their finance assistance. When I got in the office he was given the impression I was buying the car through the dealership. At that point I was completely done with the salesman no matter what. The loan guy finally fax my credit union the sales form. I was so relieve to actually leave I didn't bother to visit other dealerships liked I planned. I tested drove the car home and loved the car hated the experience. If you absolutely have to go to this dealership ask for Mike and Allison the receptionist it very helpful. Mike was the only bright spot in my experience. Wished he wasn't busy with other customers it would have saved me from many headaches and I'll probably had a better review about this dealership. Top it all off, they had my hard plates for a few days now and no one bother to tell me. Finally I'm sure this is a good place to buy a car you are looking for I just got stuck with a bone head of a salesman. Request for Mike if you can.",2.3
129,"March 11, 2013","Went to Fennigan's after talking with Aaron multiple times. I was driving over 400 miles to get the vehicle and wanted to make sure it was in good shape. I asked specifically if it had a mechanical problem I knew was common to the F150's. The driveshaft slip/bump issue. He told me he personally took it out and drove it and it did not. I asked him this three different times during separate phone calls before driving the long distance. I also asked if there were any other problems the dealership knew the truck had. He kept saying that their dealership does a rigorous inspection of all vehicles before they put them up for sale. When I drove the truck I knew immediately it had the driveshaft problem I had asked him about. Plus, after having it inspected by a local auto shop I learned of several other mechanical problems. (Noise by transmission where the driveshaft went in, and the front seat heater/cooler was not working. It also had rotors which shook the truck when you put on the brakes.) When I returned from having it inspected to see if they would repair the problems Aaron left and I had to deal with another salesman. He had us wait around two hours just to tell us they wouldn't work on it till the weekend was over. My wife and I made a round trip of 17 hours for nothing. To make matters worse, I called the next week and we worked it out if they would fix the three major issues, then take it back to where I had it inspected and it passed their inspection I would still purchase. Aaron assured me the General Manager agreed to this and they would fix it. Aaron called me back twice saying they had done some work and that he was working on getting the rest done.
