In addition, there were no pictures. After FOUR requests and one week later, still no pictures and no responses. The general manager's email address is either extremely well hidden on their website or it does not exist. I even asked the online chat assistant for help. She was unable to give me an email address.",1.4

10,"January 06, 2020",John was one of the greatest salesman I‚Äôve ever dealt with. He did not put any pressure on me and made the whole thing an enjoyable experience. He got my information and even told us to go enjoy lunch So we went across to Houston steakhouse until the deal was finalized. He then drove the brand new car to Houston steakhouse for us to drive back to the dealership and sign the papers which literally took a total of 25 to 30 minutes. I highly recommend this dealership and I highly recommend John for an honest and hassle free car buying experience. I give six stars if it was possible,5.0

13,"October 11, 2019","I have been customer for 6+ years and bought two Jeeps from them. All regular maintenance and services for both the jeeps were done at this location. I had noticed since year or so that customer service especially in the service department was going downhill. Every time I take my jeep for service, they are salesmen trying to sell me some kind of PM. 
Few weeks ago I got new set of rear breaks installed from them. While I was driving couple of days after the break job, break lever did not engage and hit the floor board. Imagine this was in traffic driving on 59 South, I somehow managed to steer away from hitting the front vehicle. It was almost an accident, I pulled over immediately and inspected for break fluid leaks and fluid level. No leaks and fluid level was good. Then, turned it back on to test the brakes. After pumping few times, brake lever engaged, so I though it was one time occurrence because of new break job. Few days later, it occurred in two separate occasions.
I took it to the service department on 10/08/19 at 8:00 am and explained the situation, he (Juan Reyna) said that he would get back to me once they figure out in couple of hours. I get a phone call two hours later and he tells me that everything checked out fine with inspection, no codes showed and mechanic drove around to test and comes out with nothing. So they think brake fluid is dirty and would need to be flushed which might fix the issue. If it doesn't then it might be master cylinder which needs to be changed. So he quotes me 179$ + for break fluid flush. I refused his proposal because it's guess work and literally gambling with my money. I explained again that, I had no issues for almost two years since I owned the vehicle and after I get new set of brakes this issue showed up. He kept repeating the same thing despite me trying to explain so at that point I requested to talk to the manager. He connects to manager line, after few rings he picks it back and tells me that manager is on an other call and manager would call me in 5-10 mins. No call for an hour and half, so I called back and he tells me that manager is busy and according to manager, brake fluid flush would not fix the issue, it would need further diagnostics and they think it is master cylinder which they would give me a quote soon and manager would call to discuss per my request. That was around 10: 30 am, I waited till 1:00 pm, I still did not get any call. 

I waited till 2 pm and decided to Uber and find out in person. Walk in, Jeep is sitting outside by the cashier. I had asked for the manager (David Roads) and walked into his office. He was rude to begin with, tells me that they were busy with city of Houston and had no time to call me and couldn't perform diagnostics to the vehicle as there were other vehicles in line. Not to mention again, I dropped it off little before 8:00 am and I was the first customer. Manager apparently did not know the whole story ( But per Juan, they had a discussion about this earlier) so I had to repeat myself and explain whole 9 yards.  He never apologized but kept giving me excuses why they couldn't get to it or call me. He had time to discuss my case but did not have time to give me a call ?? At this point, I can't trust anyone. There is either communication issue internally or no one wants to admit their mess up. They were obviously not expecting me to show up, I caught them off guard and I hear whole bunch of excuses.
Then tells me to leave the vehicle for inspection which they would look into it tomorrow  in the am next day and would get back to me tomorrow. Never offered me a loaner vehicle nor a ride. He assigned me to Service Consultant ( William Hernandez), who I had to explain my whole story again. He was patient and seemed legit. It was 2:45 pm, I requested for a ride and left.
I get a call from William around 10:30 am, he tell me that his mechanic can't find anything wrong after test driving. They would like to test it again and update me in couple of hours. I get a call around 1:30 pm and same answer and tells me that they would like to test it cold and see if anything can be spotted. I get a call around 4:30 pm with similar answer that they can't seem to find anything wrong with it and suggests me to note if I observe anything out or norm. 
At this point, I lost two days, whole bunch of stress and nothing has been resolved. I suggest saving your money and time by avoiding this place...",1.0

16,"May 17, 2019","Unbelievably POOR SERVICE and a misleading service technician.   Originally brought my Vehicle in for a regular 30k Service inspection with an Oil Change.   After dropping it off at 9:30am my Service Tech called at 3:30 pm to inform me there were additional problems.   A front tire sensor, rear differential fluid, and now a broken steering hub all uncovered problems on a Friday at 5:30pm.   None of these problems existed when I took my vehicle in to my previous mechanic.  An original estimate of $600 has now exploded to over $1500.   I will NEVER bring my vehicle to River Oaks Jeep again and encourage you to think twice about trusting them with your business.",1.2

18,"November 05, 2018","1. On 06/12/2018 I purchased a 2018 Chrysler Pacifica from River Oaks Chrysler Jeep Dodge Ram. 

2. On 07/26/2018, the Pacifica stopped running while we were driving it down the road. It had to be towed to River Oaks Chrysler. I  spoke with Sales Representative: Gregory Washington, Service Consultant: William Hernandez, Service Manager: David Rhodes and Owner: Mr. Alan Helfman. I was told that the 2018 Pacifica had a battery problem and they did not have battery in Houston--the battery had to come from Dallas. It was returned to me on ?08/03/2018 with the impression that it had been fixed. 

3. ?On 11/01/2018 the Pacifica stop running again while driving down the freeway.   I was not able to contact anyone at River Oaks Chrysler to have it towed. ?We called William Hernandez several times and could not get hold of him. ?It was towed to ?River Oaks Chrysler by Fast Tow at my expense of $175.

4. As of 11/05/2018, they have not looked at our car for 4 days.  No one has taken the time to look at the Pacifica.  I was instructed that they were backed up and did not have the time and would ""try to get to it"". Once again, we did not receive an update.

5. I think I have been sold a ""Lemon"", this car needs to be fixed correctly or Chrysler should replace my car if they cannot solve the issue.

Update:

Car was brought into River Oaks Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram on Thursday November 1, 2018.  It was finally escalated and put in the shop to see what was wrong late on Monday November 5th, They ordered the parts and said once they arrive they will work on on the car.  multiple called thru we week were made and messages were left.  I called William Hernandez again on Monday November 12th, and was informed that the are installing the new computer that morning and will program it.  They wanted to let it sit and run the car later that day to make sure everything is running properly and would call us to pick it up by the end of the day.  I then called again around 4pm and no one answered.  On Tuesday, November 13, called again left a couple messages to check the status of the car.  at 9:15 I was able to finally talk to William Hernandez and was informed that they wanted the car to sit over night and try it one more time to make sure all was in proper working order and it was now ready for release. 

It took 12 days for my car to get fixed. That's too long. ",1.0

20,"June 12, 2018","I have purchased 3 cars from this place, and the owner Mr. Allen is a very nice guy was there for all 3 sales!

However, BETTY FOOTS, the service manager promised to pay my first car payment due to these issues. It is June and I have yet to receive a check from them, and every time I call BETTY FOOTS, she tells her employees to say she is not in the office and after calling again, her phone goes straight to voicemail. Who has time to play games with you BETTY FOOTS!!! If you are not going to pay the note, just say that, but the games that you are playing to say that you are a MANAGER, is ridiculous!

21,"April 03, 2018","I bought a used car here. After I walked off the lot--no one cared.
My tires had lug nut lock and they did not pass it on when I bought the car. I was given the run around, used car dept. said it was up to the service department to check the car for all parts. I asked to speak to the general manager and unknown I was given to the service manager. David Rhodes, the assistant service manager asked me what they could do after hearing my story. I asked him to pay for the tow if there was a charge. He was going to talk to the used sales department and get back to me.
Guess what? He never called back.
When I contacted him today-he said they weren't paying for the tow and maybe I should check with the place wheres (yes that was his articulation) I get my oil changed?? Maybe they have the lug lock.

Meanwhile, they appraised my 2010 Jeep Grand Cherokee for a trade value. When we got back, the only negative was the interior color of brown (which I did not want and was a Deal-Breaker)  Alan got with Larry, the Sales Mgr. and he was on the phone and computer with their sister store and found what I wanted.  By the time I finished the negotiations w/Alan and signed the financial papers, the New vehicle was prepped and waiting out front.  Dijon joined me in the Jeep and showed me how it worked.

34,"January 05, 2016","second jeep we purchased from this dealership. and second time with Darrell Misel. Why? because he knows his business. and when he realized that the car was for my wife he immediately switched his comments and questions to her. Smart as we had already walked out of a dealership for ignoring that fact. 
next car  purchase in the family will probably be with Darrell Misel. you can trust him.

43,"April 09, 2015","Worst car dealership!!! My husband and I traded in a truck and a car for a new Jeep Compass. This was by far the worst car buying experience ever. We spent over 6 hours at the dealership and recieved the worst customer service. The salesman Dijon did not even go on the test drive with my husband because he said he was to busy but the whole time my husband was out on the test drive Dijon was sitting at his desk doing nothing. Then after we finally finished and were told the jeep would be brought to the front they tell us they haven't cleaned the jeep yet and we would have to wait another 45 minutes. We had enough and told them just bring us the jeep. They finally brought us the jeep but with no paper tags, my husband had to go ask for them, then the salesman Dijon put the tag on he car and he left a big scratch on he back. Now about two weeks later I am receiving calls from the old finance company for the car we traded saying payment is past due. River Oaks paid off the car but then reversed the payment. I called River Oaks several times and finally got ahold of the finance department, according to Trey it's not a big deal and my payments are not late and it is not a big deal, he will have the person who dealt with us when we bought the car call us back.

46,"December 11, 2014","My experience in this, sometimes ""troublesome and anguish"" process of purchasing a new car and finding a good deal, was very smooth. From the first time I entered the stablishment and was approached by the Sales person, Michael Sabrsula , I felt comfortable and welcomed, and trust me I am the kind of person that asks a million questions. My first intention was to purchase a pre owned car, and I have experinced in other Car dealers that once you mentioned the word ""pre owned"" you are not treated anymore so kind. I had one experience at another brand dealer, when They asked my budget  and I mentioned it, the salesman said, ""then we are sitting in the wrong car"" meaning it was over my budget. So much for a good salesman and service. But this was not the case at River Oaks Chrysler Jeep, Michael took me for a drive test of a pre owned car, which I enjoyed and hooked me up into purchasing a Jeep, but I didn;t close te deal there, I needed to do some more checkings but due to the excellent service and kind follow up from Michael, I finally purchased not a pre owned but a brand new 2015 model.  And like this I can share some other positive experiences thorughout the process, like the moment I couldn't make up my mind about the color and Michael was enthusiastically moving around the cars so I can compare colors one car next to the other. Or the moment I came to pick up my car, and the car had a little layer of dust since it was outside ready to be delivered and I arrived late, and I juts pointed out this to Michael, but not hoping that anything would be done about it, and to my surprise when I came out, after signing all the papers and purchasing some extra rugs for the car, the Car has been washed again ! and prepared for delivery, This is ""state of the art"" Service, in USA, Japan, Europe and everywhere.

48,"July 07, 2014"," I can't say enough about my car buying experience with River Oaks Chrysler Jeep and Dodge! I have driven a Mercedes GL450 SUV for 7 years now and I was ready for a change. I decided I wanted a Jeep Wrangler. My sales associate, Santana Franco was very knowledgable about all the differences between all the different Jeep models, and was able to help me figure out which one would be the best for me. Unfortunately, I am pretty picky and they did not have exactly what I wanted in their inventory. I wanted a Rubicon X without a viper hood. Santana took me over to meet Blake Helfman and explained what I was looking for. Blake assured me they could get me the Jeep I wanted and they could add whatever accessories I wanted as well. He put his team to work and got me the vehicle the next day! Jim Edmund was instrumental in working out the deal to get the Jeep there so quickly, and my sales associate, Santana made sure that vehicle didn't go anywhere until I could come in and sign the papers (I was out of town for a few days.) The paperwork was painless, and it went by so fast! I was so surprised!
    I also wanted to add accessories to my Jeep. Jackie Chau, who is the accessories sales manager there at River Oaks, was awesome! I brought in a picture of another Jeep I had seen on the road. She and Mike were able to tell me exactly what the parts were and gave me a price right away. The parts were all there in a few days, and they even offered me a loaner car while all the work was being done. The work was done in the time expected and I just got my Jeep back today. I can't say enough about the service and quality of the work. I am SOOOOOO HAPPY!  Thank you River Oaks Chrysler Jeep and Dodge!",5.0

51,"June 12, 2014","Judging by the other reviews, it appears that when you‚Äôre lucky enough to deal with the right people, this place isn‚Äôt too bad.  Unfortunately, this wasn‚Äôt the case for me. 
I had been shopping around for new Wrangler Unlimited Sahara and River Oaks had the model I was looking for.  Went in to the dealership, looked around, talked to one of the internet sales people and they gave me a quote on the model I was looking at as well as valued my trade in.  Two days later I emailed the internet sales department several times but didn‚Äôt get a response (getting them to respond to voice mail or email was impossible). Finally got the sales person I dealt with on the phone and put a deposit on the Jeep I wanted.  I asked to have a few things done to the vehicle and said that I would pick it up the following week.  This was on a Thursday.  On Saturday, I went in to look at the Jeep.  The salesperson walked me around and around, then back to the office, then, he left and finally came back to tell me the Jeep had been sold.  Huh?  Honestly, the fact the Jeep had been sold after putting a deposit down mildly annoyed me.  The fact that the sales person (Will Scanlan) did NOTHING over the three days since the deposit was made reeked of blatant incompetence.  If you DO decide to purchase a Jeep from here, do yourself a favor and don‚Äôt deal with this salesperson.  Anyway, he said a similar Jeep was in transit and would arrive in 10 days.  He also said that he would attempt to locate another similar model locally from another dealer. I accepted that and left.  Did my own search and found several similar models and emailed this info to him on Monday.  No response.  Called and left voice message. No response.  Now, by this time I would have normally told them to kiss my a** and gone elsewhere.  However, they had offered the best deal so I continued to act professionally towards them even though they could care less if they sold the Jeep to me.  Definitely a ‚Äúhey, we are high volume, if we don‚Äôt sell it you we will sell it to someone else..‚Äù Not knowing where else to turn I reached out their general sales manager, Jim Edmund (what a tool).  The conversations started out with me saying ‚Äúhey Jim, I‚Äôm working really hard to buy a Jeep from you guys but so far your sales people have made it impossible. We have an agreed to deal in place but‚Ä¶‚Äù. At this point he cut me off and said ‚Äúwell, there are plenty of other dealerships around, perhaps you should go to one of them‚Äù.  Surprisingly, I didn‚Äôt end the conversation there (again, trying to save some $) but I decided fairly quickly that this is the sort of guy that contributes to car salesmen having a bad reputation.  Anyway, promises made about getting back to me, finding a vehicle blah blah blah.  Never heard from them again.  I ended up going to Texan Jeep yesterday and bought a Jeep from them.  They actually beat the deal offered by River Oaks and were great to deal with.  The sort of transaction where when you‚Äôre driving home in your vehicle thinking ‚Äúthat went well‚Äù.  So, my strong advice?  Go elsewhere.  If you do go here, don‚Äôt deal with Will Scanlan or Jim Edmund.",1.8
52,"May 16, 2014","On May 8, 2014 my views of buying a car were excellent. I was treated fantastically from the time I walked onto the property until I drove off in my new Jeep Wrangler. I've never been to a dealership and the owner himself ensured me that he would I would be happy when I leave. He was determine to start me on the right track of rebuilding my car buying worthiness. I will be purchasing a vehicle from River Oaks Chrysler Dodge Jeep until God calls me home. I felt comfortable like I was a part of the family at River Oaks Chrysler Dodge Jeep. I'm going to do what I have to do to refer as many customers in that direction. 

Thanks

Very Happy and Satisfied Customer",5.0
53,"April 24, 2014","I was searching for a 2014 Cherokee Trailhawk and found River Oaks Chrysler had one like I was searching for in transit, I called talked to Blake Helfman, he sent me information on the vehicle and I put a deposit down to secure the purchase, Blake kept me informed on the disposition of the car helped me get answers from corporate engineering on some questions I had to be able to tow it behind our motorhome, Fred Afshar called to let me know the vehicle had arrived at the dealership and set up for me to come in to complete the purchase, Fred orientated my wife and I on the vehicle (very thorough), Luke Holdorf took care of the financing and extended warranty, he was very thorough and helpful explaining everything so I fully understood. Mark MCCARY is their accessory person and he has been extremely in arranging the installation of the equipment to be able to tow our new Cherokee behind our motorhome. I would recommend this dealership to anyone interested in purchasing a vehicle.",5.0
54,"April 09, 2014","I went to River Oaks Dealership on April 8, 2014 to purchase a used 2013 Dodge pickup.  The price had already been settled on and I was traveling 3 hours from Louisiana to finish the deal.  I let the salesman know I was on my way.  Before I made the trip tho, I had the salesman walk around the the vehicle and describe to me any flaws on this vehicle.  He assured me it was in perfect condition, nothing to report, only 3 tiny rock chips, so small you can barely see them.  Once arriving at the dealership, the parking was awful.  Once a person left a parking spot we were able to have a place to park.  Walked inside the Pre-Owned building where 2 salesmen were sound asleep on the sofa facing you as you walk in the door.  They never looked up.  Several other salemen looked to see who walked in.  I told them who I were looking for, they said they had not seen him for about 20 minutes.  One gentleman kinda looked for him then after waiting about 5 minutes they pointed to a guy walking in the parking lot with a female, as they both were eating ice cream.  Once he came inside I introduced myself and he asked if I had seen the truck.  I told him no, I didn't see it anywhere.  He went to get it out of the back somewhere and brought it out front.  Once I walked up to the truck I immediately noticed a 2 ft scratch on the driver's door and a red scrape and a white scrape from a door, both on the passenger's side along with several other rock chips.  The vehicle had not been washed or detailed.  Pollen was in the bed.  On top of the cab, it looked like it had been parked under a tree  and junk was built up.  The sales manager, Jim told me it was a used truck and that's what I get for the price.  The price settled on this truck was about $32,000.  I told the sales manager that I would have bought the truck if it had been as I was told and cleaned up to look worth the price!  He told me he had cut the price to the bone, it's a used truck and what did I expect?  He was visibly angry.  I told him thank you but I was not buying the truck!  This was an awful experience!  I hope other customers BEWARE!",2.3

57,"October 08, 2013",OVER THE PAST 45 YEARS I;VE BOUGHT -SOLD TRADED MANY MANY MANY!! VEHICLES- I HAVE NEVER! HAD SUCH AN INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!!!! THE ENTIRE PROCESS WAS NOTHING SHORT OF 5STARS!!! ALL MY FUTURE CAR/TRUCK PURCHASES WILL BE @RIVER OAKES! YOU SHOULD DO THE SAME!,5.0
58,"July 30, 2013","Zero stars is still too many for these guys. Sarcastic and snarky salesmen, not knowledgeable about the vehicles they have on the lot, inflexible and unwilling to do anything whatsoever for the customer. 

I found a vehicle online, called up mere hours after it was posted, and tried to put a deposit down on it to hold the vehicle --explaining that I would be there within 24 hours to pick it up. Financing was taken care of, and it was the end of the month. The gentleman laughed at me saying ""No, no chance. If we did that, every car on the lot would be on hold and we wouldn't need any salesmen."" This was a 745pm call, when the dealership closes at 8pm. OK, no problem.

Called back first thing in the morning to ensure the vehicle was still available--I was told by three people it was, and then informed them I would arrive within three hours to sign the PO and drive away. OK, no problem again.

Somehow, miraculously, unbeknownst to anyone.. the vehicle was sold! Financing arranged, cash in hand, multiple phone calls with intent to buy and offering funds to hold it .. and nothing.

This is by far the worst dealership I've ever encountered, and am thankful that I didn't purchase a vehicle from them. If they treat customers with money in hand this way, I hate to think how they treat people after the sales process.

Unprofessional, unethical, inflexible, rude, and in severe need of even basic customer service training.  I wholeheartedly DO NOT recommend this dealership to anyone, under any circumstance. I wish this were isolated to one salesman or rep, but it is a pervasive problem throughout the organization. Multiple people all playing the same games.

60,"May 06, 2013","My experience with this River Oaks, as a whole, was first-rate.  I placed an order for a Jeep Grand Cherokee with Mark Gusman, and he couldn't have been more helpful.  He was very non-nonsense and did not try to wheel and deal like the typical car salesman.  His price for the Jeep was significantly lower than any other dealer in the Houston area (which says something).  I also spoke with Lionell Logan, the other Internal Manager, while there, and my experience with him was equally as pleasant.  I can't speak highly enough of this dealership, as the entire experience was completely painless and nothing like I have ever experienced before.  It truly was refreshing.  Even the Finance Manager was straightforward and courteous.  If you are looking for a Chrysler, Jeep, or Dodge, you can't go wrong with River Oaks in Houston.    ",5.0

63,"December 12, 2012","In looking for a new Jeep Wrangler, I asked around within my network for recommendations (those I know how have owned or purchased Jeep vehicles locally).

A good friend recommended that I go see Yvon Dupich at River Oaks. My friend had recently purchased a vehicle from Yvon. This recommendation turned out to be golden. Yvon handled the process and the deal better than any experience I have had in purchasing any of my previous vehicles.

I highly recommend a Jeep...but I even more highly recommend you purchase it from Yvon Dupich.",5.0

65,"November 21, 2012","After going to dealership after dealership and searching the jeep forums for the best place to go and buy a new Jeep at a good price, I finally found the golden egg. What a great experience I had buying from River Oaks and it's all thanks to Mark Gusman. Mark helped me since day one when I placed the order of my new 2013 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Rubicon to the day I picked it up. He worked with me on a price that I could not pass up that no other dealership would even attempt to offer. Since I am a first time buyer the experience was all new to me, but thanks to Mark and the rest of the employeees at River Oaks, I was not worried or nervous on making this first big purchase. The thing that would have made the whole experience better is if they were located in South Austin where I live, but driving down to meet up with Mark and to pick up my new Rubicon was worth the trip. Thanks River Oaks and especially thank you Mark Gusman. ",5.0

69,"October 28, 2010",I went in to visit River oaks jeep. I was looking for a new jeep with all of the  options available. The sales person greeted me but seem to write me off as just a looker not a buyer so he seem to walk away as I walked through the lobby by myself. I had several questions about the jeep I really liked but he never seemed to come back to help me out. I'm not sure if it was the cloths I was wearing?? I don't wear suits and ties to work but I do make a great living and sales people shouldn't be so quick to judge.,1.5
