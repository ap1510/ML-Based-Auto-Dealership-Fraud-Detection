1,"October 16, 2015",They really are your family. Larry Wooten in sales is the absolute BEST and the service dept bar none is top notch. Russell and Mike in the Service Dept are the epitome of integrity!  They will fight for you with the manufacturer on any warranty issues. They go out of their way to help. ,5.0
2,"July 27, 2015",The service quality is terrible. They act like its an inconvenience to have to deal with vehicles that need work. They take your car and wont answer the phone or call you back. You ask why your car is not finished and they act like its normal to tell you one thing and do another.,1.2
