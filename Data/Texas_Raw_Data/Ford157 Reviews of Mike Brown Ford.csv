I also can‚Äôt not mention Duane and his lovely wife who delivered my vehicle to Georgetown, TX.!",5.0
1,"May 24, 2020",Wendell Gray has been my service advisor for about 2 years and I always go to him because he will shoot straight with me as to what I need or don't need for my Escape.  His integrity is important to me.,4.8
2,"May 15, 2020","I stopped at Mike Brown in search of a new Ranger pickup.  I found what I was looking for and when a salesman finally showed up, I requested a price.  I was informed the salesman that Ford priced vehicles based upon the purchaser's location (really) so I provided the requested info and the salesman went off and returned with a price of $24,500 and told me this was a dealer demo vehicle with a few miles on it.  I requested a look inside and off he went again to get some keys (I guess I am the only one that wants to look inside a car before buying it...lol)  A review of the vehicle showed a few things to vehicle required to suit me, sideboards, sprayed bed liner, and a trailer hitch.  We agreed the three items would be added and I would pay $625 (half of the additional items) and the sales manager told me face-to-face that we had a deal.  I drove 40 miles home and got my old truck I was using for trade in and my wife to follow to bring me home.  When I arrived, the vehicle had risen in price by EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS!  At this point, I'm flabbergasted...what?...how?  Then I learned I just thought I understood English...I had made an EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLAR misunderstanding.  They were trying to jack up the price and I did not want it that bad.  Only common courtesy prevents me from telling you what I think of them.  Avoid this place‚Ä¶just a normal used car tactics at a new car dealership.",1.3
3,"May 14, 2020","Been with MB Ford 15 yrs, 4 vehicles purchased and serviced regularly there over that time. Nearly always been good work and great service, save for a few years back when the caps on engine oil and other fluids under the bonnet got left off after service and discovered at home a few days later. Had words with the then service supervisor. Never a problem since. Will keep returning to MB Ford in Granbury for new vehicles and routine servicing.  Liked that they washed the truck this time. Nice touch.",5.0

The service department gave great friendly, professional service.  When the parts came in we received same day service.  We‚Äôre very happy with the repairs being completed correctly and in a timely manner.",5.0

13,"July 29, 2019","A few months ago I took my car in for a rattle.  It sat there three days (while I was scrounging up transportation to work) and they never worked on it.  When I said I couldn't wait anymore, they said I could come get it.  I tried again a few weeks later - just an oil change.  They actually told me my air filter needed replacing. Little did they know I had it replaced a month before when I got my car inspected.  Who would actually do this? And today - tried to make an appointment for service for a real problem affecting the use of my car and was told they are two weeks out. When I said I can't wait two weeks - she said she'd let the lady handling my appointment request know I would be going somewhere else.  Got into David McDavid today. I have tried and tried with this place because of the convenient location to my home.  I'm done.  Go somewhere else - they show no concern for their customers.  Makes me sad - in early 2018 they were fantastic.",1.0
14,"February 06, 2019",Juan and the whole staff at Mike Brown are absolutely wonderful to work with. They always give 110% and go out of their way to make sure that you get the vehicle you‚Äôre looking for. This was my first time buying a vehicle and they worked around my work schedule and helped me find the exact car I was looking for. My parents have bought multiple cars from Juan and we always recommend him to our friends and family.,5.0

I can say this dealership has never been high pressure to sale you  Paul my vehicle sales associate is very knowledgeable about the product he sales. 
They used simple sales tactics 
You pick out the vehicle you desire. 
You take out on a test drive. 
The present you a price 
You do a little negotiation. 
Both parties agreed on the price 
You go into finance office  sign paperwork and down payment. 
You are offered options in financing and add ons.  You say yes or no and your done no hassle to buy extras. 
This is an enjoyable dealership to do business with

22,"December 01, 2018","Mike Brown Ford was a huge help for my daughters first car. Miss Cindy was very helpful from the get go, not only got to know myself but my daughter as well and her wants and needs for her first vehicle. She went above and beyond thru the whole process in which we are very grateful. Ty who we signed the papers with was awesome as well got us in and out in minutes!  Very hard to find sometimes but I have to say I will for sure send family and friends to Mike Brown Ford in Granbury.

24,"November 15, 2018","We recently bought a brand new pickup from this dealership. We have had to take it back 3 times since we received it (mind you - this is a BRAND NEW pickup.) It has been the same problem over and over, without resolution. I am never one to complain, but this has been absolutely ridiculous. The most recent issue lead them to tell us it was ""bad gas"" and therefore the warranty will not cover it, even though the presentation is EXACTLY similar to the 2 previous episodes. Very upset with the quality of service provided and extremely disappointed in the staff. I just want to let others know so that they do not get stuck in this awful situation like we have been.

25,"September 20, 2018",I had the most wonderful experience working with Cindy my family has been going to her for years! We absolutely love! She has been our go to girl for any new vehicles she gets the best prices for the cars that we want.

26,"September 20, 2018","My husband made an appointment to see a pre-owned car on Saturday.  While we were on our way he received a call 
To check if we were on our way .  When we arrived Juan Meraz was outside waiting to greet us . 

Now I was not in a good mood as did not want to drive this far for a car ( 40 minutes ) but I must tell you that the friendly and welcoming way Everyone especially Juan ( our sales person
)  treated us made up for the drive .

From the moment we walked in and all through the process of purchasing this car , we received first class treatment just like we were buying their most expensive car there !   They were VERY accommodating with some of the things we needed fixed on the car .  Juan made arrangements for me to bring the car back on Wednesday to get those items taken care of and he gave me a very nice loaner car .

He had all the paperwork ready for this and even met me at the service area . He kept telling me if there's anything else we can do for you please call me anytime .

Today when I went to pick up my car he was there waiting for me and he went to get my car for me while I waited in the nice air conditioned office .

My husband said that he even received an email from Mike Brown telling him to be sure to let them know if they can do anything else for us .

I have to say I have not bought a car at a dealer in over 16 years but this experience has surpassed any we have had in our auto buying experiences .  

Everyone we met here at Mike Brown auto had a genuine interest in making sure we had the best experience possible and they very much succeeded !

I highly recommend them and it was definitely worth the drive .

I hope I don't need a car again soon but if I do this is the place we will come back to without hesitation .

You don't need to go to Fort Worth or anywhere else .

There are not enough stars in your rating system to give them especially Juan Meraz . While our paperwork was being done he chatted with my husband and I like we knew each other for years .

He is so friendly and caring .  He's not pushy and made sure that we were happy with our purchase .  

So go see Juan if you need a car !  I guarantee you will have the best experience and you will drive away happy !

43,"July 09, 2018",Came in originally to buy a part the day before and got side tracked looking at a new car. Jeremy approached us with a friendly no pressure attitude to help us if we wanted it. We knew we were probably not going to buy a new car but he was so nice we came back to Mike Brown Ford to look at the used lot options since we had to come back for a $4 part the next day. Easiest and fastest car purchase we have ever experienced! Jeff was upfront and made buying a car hassle and frustration free! From the beginning of our search on the lot with Jeff all the way to Ty in financing and finishing up with Cindy (Jeff had a funeral to attend) we just couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better experience! We were in and out in less than 2 hours total including looking and test driving multiple times. And there was no shady back and forth about the price because they started with their best price on the Taurus we were interested in and the offer for our trade in from Doyle which was also super friendly! We will definitely come back here for our next car purchase! ,5.0

49,"June 28, 2018","As someone who dislikes the fact that we have to grind through the haggling and headache of buying through a dealer rather than just buying a car ""off the shelf"", I can truly say that this was a great experience beginning to end. Cindy Gavin was a phenomenal sales associate and provided answers, thoughtful insight, and assistance every step of the way. She was very familiar with Ford trucks, as she owns them herself, and was able to provide me with tips, tricks, and a great extended test drive through several different types of terrain. Although I dislike the haggling that comes with car buying in general, I was able to work with Doyle to come to an agreement on price and trade in values. They will push, you just push right back until you find a middle ground. It's just the nature of dealerships and it's understandable. And I didn't have to threaten to walk out to get something reasonable. 

All that to say yes. Yes, this place is worth the drive and blows the big name DFW chains out of the water. I will definitely be purchasing my next vehicle at Mike Brown. ",5.0

52,"June 26, 2018",Michael Whitfield was a excellent salesman and made they whole process run smooth and thought outside of the box with trying to meet what we were looking for. 10/10 recommendation from me when looking to acquire a new vehicle from thus dealership.

54,"June 18, 2018","Took our 2017 focus in for second time(1st time 7 months prior), George Barclay  in the service took care of us.  Never in our history of dealing with service dept.  of dealerships have we experienced such  outstanding treatment. George was attentive, explained everything that would be done,  how,  why,   when it would new ready,  etc, etc. He made our stay(wait) very pleasant.  When we returned to pick up our vehicle a couple days later, George explained everything that was done,  and any other questions we had.

One of my favorite parts was seeing Craig sit in that Ford Focus with Taryn for over 30 minutes explaining the features, programming stuff, and giving her his business card to keep in her car Incase of emergencies or maintenance issues.

71,"May 12, 2018",Mike Brown auto is a great place to do business with.  I‚Äôve been doing business with them ever sense they opened the doors at the old Hooks dealership.  I‚Äôve always got a good deal and have been treated fair.  That being said the last purchase I made on 4-18 was amazing. Juan at the Ford dealership worked very hard making this deal come together while I was out of state. Juan handled it all over the phone so all we had to do was drive back make the trade and I was back on the road. This transaction reminded me of when I used to buy from Jole Rogers.

118,"April 10, 2018","While having my wife's Edge serviced, we decided to look at trucks. We were planning to buy a travel trailer and needed to know towing capabilities etc. of certain models. Kyle Phillips was the young man who assisted us that day. We informed him we were on a fact finding mission and that it would be at least a month before we'd be able to commit to anything. Kyle and I traded info and over the course of the next 5 weeks kept in contact by phone or email. When it got closer to our being ready to buy I sent Kyle a list of what I wanted. He said he had a couple he thought I'd like. The first one he showed us had everything we wanted and more but at a price that was right.

Kyle was professional and friendly as well as very knowledgeable about all things Ford. He assisted in choosing a tonneau cover and made arrangements for its installation. Kyle is an incredible young man with bright future ahead of him. Since the purchase, he has called to follow up on any questions I might have or issues. The entire staff was very courteous and helpful but Kyle stands out.
I recommend him highly.  

Of course I had hoped that Kyle would have gifted the truck to me because of my winning personality, but alas, I know he and the dealership have to make a living. But he still gets high praise,  my deep appreciation and recommendation to friends. Thanks.

If I had a diesel, it could be two weeks.  

I asked why he didn't inform us at the outset that they wouldn't even look at the car until the next afternoon.  All I got was a funny look.  

Apparently, they know don't know they have a service problem.  So, what I learned is this.  1.  Don't go to Mike Brown for if you expect quick service.  2.  Certainly don't by a diesel here unless it is a spare truck.  3.  Ignorance is bliss.  4.  Just because a guy has a title as manager, doesn't mean he knows how to manage.  5.

I walked out at 12:00 pm.  During this time I began to ponder on what the acceptable amount of time an oil change and inspection should take.  I came to the conclusion that what ever the acceptable amount my be, it was not 3 ¬Ω hours.  While pondering that I also began to wonder the true cost that this oil change was costing me.  As a videographer I bill $50 dollars an hour that means  The oil change cost me 175 dollars plus the cost your business charged me.
Which brings me to my final complaint.  I was quoted over the phone that the works package(which includes a tire rotation) would cost me around 35 dollars.  When I arrived I asked about the cost of the an inspection and was told that it would be 14 dollars.  So when presented with the bill I was expecting around $50 so I was a little surprised to see a bill for $70.  I feel cheated and untaken care of, which is the worst experience possible especially since I'm now $240 dollars poorer.",2.5
