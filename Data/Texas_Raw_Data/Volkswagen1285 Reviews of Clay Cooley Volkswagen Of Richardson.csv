2,"March 13, 2020","When you go to a dealership with something printed off of the internet from the dealerships website......they NEVER have that vehicle in stock(this is called ""baiting"")!!!! Then I had a sales manager try to sell me a used vehicle after I showed him the NEW vehicle that I wanted and also told him that i wanted a ""NEW"" vehicle. To make things worse for me.....I called the next day to try to get someone to help me with regards to buying a new vehicle and they NEVER called me back. HOW CAN A COMPANY BE IN BUSINESS WHEN THIS IS WHAT THEY DO TO THEIR OWN CUSTOMERS????????? Clay Cooley is NOT a reputable business to do business with. RUN FROM THIS COMPANY!!!!!!!!!",1.0
3,"February 27, 2020","My sales person was Joseph and the manager I worked with was Bryan Jackson. Both these gentleman were very knowledgeable with the car, a  2019 (Golf GTI). The price and over all deal was very competitive and fair. It was a seamless transaction. I got good value for my trade also. The whole process was stress less  unlike previous car purchases I made in the past. I also was directed to the parts department and want to also complement the parts manager for his attention to customer service. It was a pleasure doing business with Clay Cooley Volkswagen of Richardson through the whole process, Joseph in sales, Bryan in management, and the parts manager! I would not hesitate to purchase another car from them if the need ever arises. Thanks, JR Stafford ",4.8

He made the whole process a breeze for us and remained patient throughout. He had a professional demeanor and is a true gentleman. Thank you, Herman for your help.

5,"January 29, 2020","This is the worst dealer for VW car service. I dont have experience with their sales, but i have been there multiple times for service.  Do yourself a favor and stay away if you need your car serviced. I had multiple bad experiences there, but the last time I went there was so bad it practically tipped the scale, ill never go back again.  They were bad before Clay Cooley took over the dealership, but its even worst now.  Just real bad customer service.",1.0
6,"December 18, 2019","Clay Cooley Volkswagen will not fail you!! My husband and I got new cars on the same day at the same time!! I brought my old car in for an oil change, and the rest is history. The staff here truly listens when you talk, I was just speaking out loud that I wish I could get a new car... well While I was waiting, I was met by Herman, he was so nice and made me laugh often. He asked me about all of my preferences, what I wanted and what I didn't want. He took some info and was back with results quickly.
I called my husband to meet me and we then met with Bryan Jackson in finance... omg he is an angel!! He took the time to explain all the financial information and what he was going to do. Well all I can say is, he is awesome!! He got us both 2019 new vehicles ( EVERYTHING I WANTED IN MY CAR by the way) and Lower payments then what we expected! I love this place!! I came back to get my car washed, yes the service dept is Amazing too! Everyone was still nice and helpful! If your looking for a car dealer, who makes things happen, and with a smile, you need to make a trip asap!! oh did I tell y'all that we do not have perfect or good credit.. go head, take a trip to Clay Cooley Volkswagen Richardson and tell them I sent you!!",5.0

Sold me car extended warranty contract Not active
The dealership sold me extended warranty contract in 09/08/2017 for $3000 and when I sold my car later in 4/5/2019 went to the dealership to cancel my warranty for the car 2013 Lexus gs350 and one of the finance manager filled cancellation form and after 3 month still no refund, so I stop by and talked with one of the finance managers and his name Salvador Garcia told me he will find out with the corporate office about my refund in 7/5/2019 till today 7/30/2019 once telling me the corporate said they gave you the refund then said oh they said no one submitted cancellation to us then later said oh the warranty already expired and that is why no refund then said oh I don't know where your refund give me more time to see what the corporate office find out , so I contacted the warranty company direct to see what is going on and the told me this warranty contact never exit never been activated by the dealership and look like the dealership charged me in the financing the warranty cost without activating the warranty contract and today when I told the dealership about it that never been activated they said not our job to handle it we just trying to help you . Go by yourself handle it with the corporate office , it is been 4 months now and no one know where is my money , and I was without warranty while driving my car for almost one year and half .... the payment for warranty cost was add to the finance amount paid by usbank ( warranty cost $3000) ... need the full cost of the warranty refund it to me plus interest I paid on it  ",1.2

I have to say a BIG shout out and thank you to Darius in New Car Sales,  Todd the Used Car Manager and JR the New Car Manager for their patience, their humor, their drive to find exactly what we wanted in a car, for going above and beyond in every aspect of our recent New 2019 Jetta purchase. I was not all impressed with Terry in finance which is the reason we purchased it out right. Sorry Terry, no paycheck for you! Oh and I can't forget the guy who explained all the warranty options (i forgot his name but very much nicely dressed). No one really likes car salesman but I have to say these guys were 100% top-notch stand up guys during the entire process. I can't forget Kathy who answered the phone when I called to get pricing, she was not nice at all. I think she was at a different location though.

10,"April 12, 2019","WHEN YOU BUY A NEW VEHICLE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE FUN. IT MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD ABOUT ACCOMPLISHED GOALS IN YOUR LIFE. IF I COULD I WOULD GIVE THEM -10 STARS.
 In the beginning it was all good Ed called me says he has some trucks in stock so I rushed down literally to get the process moving.
i had already been in a car that was excellent to me for the past 3 years. payment were high so i thought lets get a truck about the same payments and get more use out of it.
well that's after the application got filled out and the used car salesman crap came out making promises that could not be fulfilled. i picked out a truck they could not get me into it with out some huge down payments 4000 to be exact. and a co signer ?
wait a minute I'm current on my payments have not made one single late payment and you telling me what. so I decided to to drop it. 3 days later the calls me back and says hey the blue truck you liked i can get you in.  great lets do this went back down and now they needed more verification more paper work on my side ok got that together cool done.
so after all that and now the paper work and title transfers are completed . 
WRONG TRUCK ALL TOGETHER. they put me in what i thought was going to be the original truck i picked. at this time he tells me oh im taking down to get it detailed and fill the gas tank and blah blah blah more bull ^%$#, only to find out he had not done any of these things.
the manager Todd Counts was sorry and gave me 3- 6.00 car wash coupons like that's going to make a huge difference for the hours I spent dealing with lies and used car salesman words of deception. so now i have the vehicle in my possession and the bank has to have more information and needs more information from me and if I don't get this done by 5 o'clock today i have to return the truck that I already have had fr 5 days!! and it's 3 o clock in the afternoon! so with lots of hustle and frustration I call todd and he sheffles me off to another salesman and doesn't even deal with me anymore just shuffles the problem off to another person  so with many phone calls and lots of emails and screen shots the deal is finally done long story short do you homework ! 
this was the most frustrating experience i have ever dealt with for a vehicle i did not even want  but now i have to live with it insurance shot up 150 more a month and my payments are 150 more a month got got love it! and no way in any way shape or form would i ever recommend this team of liars and problem shufflers to anybody!! todd won't even take my call or even return my call now that's great customer service !! way to go CLAY COOLEY FOR THE AMAZING CUSTOMER CARE AND BUYING EXPERIENCE.

11,"April 02, 2019","The salesman and finance people here are a bunch of crooks!  We were told our purchase price would be $35k plus tt&l including the warranties ""they gave us"". Turns out the vehicle that's only worth $37k is now costing us $44k! We believed they were treating us right and making sure we wouldn't end up upside down on another vehicle but in all reality we are worse off now. Please don't make the same mistake and believe these lying xxx's!",1.0
12,"March 27, 2019","I had a 2016 Jetta that I had 20K mileage over the lease. So I didn't want to deal with the dealership with the lease return and decided to contact Volkswagen credit directly to purchase the vehicle, so that I wouldn't have to pay the 20k mileage overage cost. I secure the loan through VW credit for the purchase and I get a call from Travis the leasing manager at Clay Cooley VW Richardson. He says that I will have to pay the TT&L straight from my pocket if I purchase through VW credit. So I go to the  dealership to execute the loan and roll in the TT&L. When I show up he is eager to show me a new lease, I told him I came to purchase and he claimed that If I lease another vehicle I would owe nothing on the old lease.
So since this was the reason I was going to purchase the vehicle to avoid the mileage charge on the old lease I went ahead and signed up for a new lease and I left happy. Well surprise, I received an letter in the mail 3/26/2019 that I owe $5K for mileage charge from old lease, I called VW credit and they claimed they don't do what I explained the dealership described. I call Travis the same day and he lied to me and claimed that no he only was talking about my last payment not any lease return charges. It makes me sick to my stomach and very angry that I was taking advantage of. I should have know better because when they typed up the new lease for the new car they put that my annual mileage was 5,000 per year and I had to have them correct and make it 15,000 miles per year.  If you use this dealership you better have every single item in writing. It is a shame that these guys lived up to the old cliché of Car Sales are crooks. If you find a good dealer and sales person keep going back because they are few and far between. I will now start my letter campaign to every executive in VW. Dejected - but praying for a resolution.",1.0

24,"December 25, 2018",Clay Cooley put a new water pump on my 2016 Volkswagen CC under warranty in July of 2018. By December 2018 it was leaking worse than it was before. I took it back to them since it was still under the parts warranty so they could do it again. I am guessing that the Tech did not follow the strict procedure in the manual that says the pump must be carefully seated on the alignment pins and then the bolts have to be torqued in a very specific sequence to a very specific torque value. This must be followed very carefully or the composite pump can be damaged or may deform over time. The Service Writer (Alex) tried to tell me that my engine was leaking oil on to the pump and this caused the gasket to fail. I do my own oil changes so I know that my engine does not leak oil. I told him he would have to prove to me that the engine was leaking. He said the Service Manager would have to look at it. A little while later he called and said they would replace the pump under warranty (because the engine wasn’t leaking and they couldn’t prove that it was). I was then told that they would only replace the pump if I replaced the oil separator and took off the catch can that I installed to protect my intake ports and valves from the oil and varnish the PCV system allows in to the engine (a know problem on all direct injected engines).  In the process of removing the Catch Can they damaged one of the clips on a hose making it useless (their way of making sure I could not put it back on). These people are predators so stay away from this dealership. ,1.0
25,"December 09, 2018","I went to the dealership on Saturday November 17th.  I found a used Mazda3 and we came to terms on price and they brought us into finance.  We signed a contract and because the Mazda's drivers window needed a regulator, they gave us a loaner car to drive.  They allowed us to drive a VW Passat until the Mazda was ready.  I finally took delivery of the Mazda on November 30th.  I drove the car for less than a week when Ralph, their finance director called me and tried to tell me the bank did not approve the deal but they had moved to another bank with it.   I could still get the car but the interest was going to be about 10% higher than what I signed.  I told him I got off work at 6pm and would just bring the Mazda back and hung up.  I was on my way to the dealership and he called again saying that they had used all of their ""favors"" up and would honor the original deal.  Being in the mortgage business, this was a typical bait and switch tactic where they get paid more money on the financing.  It did not work with this client.  And, it only cost them a couple stars in my rating and now I cannot recommend them for the predatory tactics they attempted to work on me!  I wish like xxxx he would have stood his ground and we could have just cancelled this deal.  Stay away from them!

26,"August 23, 2018","I have been trying to get a warranty refunded for *A YEAR*. Clay Cooley has been hostile the whole time. We just filed a complaint with the State of Texas. He is our experience. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM. We filed a hostile dealership form with the warranty company, who has since refunded clay cooley and they have NOT PASSED THIS MONEY BACK TO US. 

I purchased a car with Clay Cooley Richardson on 8/5/17, I was upsold into also purchasing:
- an AWS extended warranty [$3854], and,
- an AWS maintenance agreement [$700].

When I was able to research the two agreements I realized I was still under manufacturers warranty so did not need an extended warranty and the maintenance agreement was far more expensive than paying for maintenance with a genuine mini dealership.

I gave written notice to cancel both contracts (via email) on 8/15/17 @ 8:47am

I followed up on a response to that cancellation email on 8/15/17 @ 9:47pm

I followed up again by email on 8/18/17

I followed up again by email on 8/23/17

Through this period and the end of 2017 I routinely called Clay Cooley and was repeatedly assured that the cancellations had been sent and that service cancelations just take months to process. Despite asking I was never provided with any evidence they had processed the cancellation

In early 2018, I visited the dealership in person and was greeted by a new finance manager who filled in the cancellation backdated to the initial notice date and faxed it to the service providers.

Again I saw no refund at my end and repeatedly called Clay Cooley to be assured it takes time for cancellations to be processed.

Finally, around May 2018 I researched and called the service providers [The Warranty Group] directly and discovered that both policies were still active and they had no record of ever receiving a cancellation notice.

On 5/12/18 I sent the cancellation form from the dealership to their claims department, who forwarded me to the accounts department who assisted me with doing a customer initiated cancellation.

I provided all required documentation for the customer initiated cancellation on 5/14/18 and received confirmation they had been canceled on 5/18/18 with the refund credited to the dealership as they were unable to directly refund to my finance.

I called and contacted through their website Clay Cooley to inform them of the cancellation. I also gave notice to my finance in case they could assist the process. 

When I saw no refund forthcoming, I again repeated called Clay Cooley to follow up. I also followed up with the service providers and requested a receipt for the cancelation on 7/23/18 and was provided one on 7/30/18

I visited the dealership in person again on 8/10/18 and was assisted by a finance team member, however, they claimed not to have access to see why the refund had not been processed. Following up today they have left the company and their contact details disconnected.

That pretty much sums up my experience with Clay Cooley. I would be surprised if even 50% of my calls have been answered, and then usually only by a receptionist that has forwarded me to a number that has rung out. I have left dozens of voicemails which have never been returned. Their only email contact information is through a form on their website which has always been responded to by calls from their sales team who quickly hangs up when you ask to be forwarded to finance/accounts. I have never recieved a call from finance/accounts either in response to contact from me or reaching out to me to help close out this matter by email or phone call. The few times I have visited in person, the person I met with has left the company within a few weeks.

27,"July 26, 2018","I brought my car in for service and had to ""rent"" their loaner car, I had the car for less than 24 hours and a crack was spotted on the windshield upon my return.  They said it started under the passenger side wiper blade...therefore I am liable.  I was willing to pay for half, because I believe it was there when I took possession, but myself nor their representative looked under the wiper blade!  But I am having to pay the full $500 to replace the windshield!!! they will not even consent that it may have been there before it has been over 100 degrees in the shade! I kept the car in the garage at night, so I am so disappointed with this!  I was planning on buying my next car from them, but I will not be going back to them for anything and I will NOT recommend anyone!!!!!!!!!

28,"March 25, 2018","Shop them first, shop them last, either way, they'll make you pay!

I had possibly the worst sales experience of my life here. Their sales culture is predatory and horrible. Don't waste your time or money. 

I stopped in because I'm a returning VW driver who wanted to upgrade to an SUV, and had sort of settled on the Tiguan. The test drive was actually pretty good. The salesman did a bad job of reading me and kept going on with his own little pre-planned speeches without really listening to me, but was overall pleasant and knew his stuff. The car itself felt like a natural upgrade from my Jetta and drives very similarly with a lot more power. However, I made the mistake of saying that, because the salesman clearly thought he had the sale in the bag and tried to screw me over.

Long story short, they asked me what I was looking to pay, evaluated my car for trade-in, took forever to crunch the numbers (because the salesman was taking a personal call) and came back at 266% of the price I told them. I understand how the game is played and they have to make money, but there is a BIG difference between $300 and $800, and they made little effort to work with me. Essentially they wanted to milk me for every cent without even trying to please the customer. After about 5 rounds of back and forth and they refused to come much closer, I walked out. However, they still had my keys from evaluating my car for trade-in, and REFUSED TO GIVE THEM TO ME. That's right, they HELD MY CAR HOSTAGE so the manager could come out and brow-beat me for another 15 minutes. I finally got them to give me my keys back and high-tailed it out of there.

The best part is that they had a trainee shadowing the salesman. When he went off to make his personal call...I mean, crunch some numbers, the trainee told me that he didn't like their sales culture, that the managers were a bunch of jerks and vultures and that he had an interview next week and is likely leaving them. Way to instill confidence in the customer, genius. And then when my partner and I walked outside to look at the vehicle again and talk, he didn't even give us 15 seconds before following us out and hovering. We walked back inside, he followed again, and I had to angrily ask him to give us some space because he can't take a hint. If he weren't already leaving or if I thought they actually cared about improving their sales culture, I'd call tomorrow and tell them to fire him.

Either way, don't waste your time and money on these con artists. They WILL try to scam you. Stay away!",1.4

I asked for email with quote and didnt receive anything until I called them multiple times.

I called Eric again and he said it is just typo and he will send updated one. I got the email and now the price is even higher than what is on the previous quote!!! WTH!!
I called Eric again and he said he will have his manager to call me (are you serious?) and his manager said there was system issue and price is listed lower than what it supposed to be (seriously,,). And he cannot give me 0 finance with that price even though they did state that in the quote.
Finally, they said I have to pay 2,000 dollar more than they told me over the phone + $$ more if I decide to go with 0 finance.

34,"April 25, 2017","Purchased a 2016 VW Jetta from Autonation VW in Richardson. Shortly after my purchase the dealership was sold to Clay Cooley. When I purchased my Jetta I was sold 2 oil changes, supposedly at a discount, which are done every 10,000 miles. When the time for my first oil change approached I was informed Clay Cooley VW Richardson would honor the oil changes and they did on the first one. Fast forward and my next oil change is due but, Clay Cooley won't honor it because, well, they don't want to. That was the reason given to me. No notice from them via email, phone call, nothing. I spent my morning driving over to the dealership and expecting the service I had paid for but, it did not happen. I spent the next 2 hours on the phone trying to get an Autonation dealership to change the oil and they all said it should be done at a VW dealership due to the parts and tools needed. So, I scheduled an appointment with Rusty Wallis VW to have it done but I will being paying for it, again. I am not happy a dealership went back on their word to current and future clients and then treats them like idiots because they don't want to stay and pay for the service already paid for and promised. I have to admit, I now can see why their service bay was empty. Normally I go to a car dealerships service bay and it is busy with people getting oil changes and having service so, people are learning not to go to this dealership for your service. ",2.0
35,"March 14, 2017","Our buying experience was great.  However, dealing with the finance department trying to cancel the maintenance package on my new 2017 Jetta is horrible.  

We bought my car on 12/2/2016, got talked into buying the maintenance package by the finance officer while singing paperwork.

We changed our mind on paying for maintenance up front, came back to the dealer the next day 12/3/2016 to fill out the cancellation form (we had 30 days after purchase to cancel this maintenance deal).  The finance officer assured us he submitted the form that same day (we have a copy of the dated form).

It has been now more than 3 months and nothing has happened yet.  The biggest headache is we cannot get any one from the dealer to call us back on the status of this issue.

Both my husband and I had called numerous times and talked to many different people in the finance department at the dealer asking for an update on the cancellation and refund of our money.  We were told each time that they would investigate and call us back.  NO ONE EVER CALLED BACK.

We are still working on trying to get our money back.  We don't recommend this dealer because of the after sale customer treatment

36,"September 02, 2016","What a great car buying experience at Clay Cooley VW Richardson. It started with just kinda browsing the lot while waiting for new tires to be put on my car. Eric Williams walked out of the building and instantly changed direction to take care of me. From the moment he asked if he could help me to the moment I rolled off the lot, Eric took great care of me. He listened to what I needed, he listened and understood my financial parameters and challenges and he worked on my deal until it was done. GM Robert Kersh got involved as well and in the end made the deal possible. Going through Finance was a breeze once the deal was final. I spent less than 2 hours at the dealership Thursday and Friday. None of that 'spend all day here' waste of time. Everybody was conscious of my time and I very much appreciated that. The friendliness, care, respect, and speed of going through and finishing transactions was phenomenal and unlike any experience I've had before. If you are looking for a great VW dealership to buy your car from, Clay Cooley VW Richardson is it. The people there make the experience.

Due to recent family and life emergencies I had been struggling with keeping my payments up to date.  But they were able to help me overcome those issues and get me into a cheaper car payment that served my immediate needs.  They never treated me as if I was a hassle to deal with.

I know that I can count on them to put together a financing option that would help me out not only right now but also in the future as my financial situation improves with time.  They were able to see that I at one point had tier 1 credit but had been stumbling as of late due to my family situation.

On completion of the test drive another salesman approaches us and let us know the car was just sold. WHAT?? We were very frustrated and upset, and not sure how that could have happened when we had a confirmed by email appointment to look at the car. No one called to say that if we wanted them to hold the car, a deposit would be required. The GM wouldn't come and talk to us at all and didn't step in to correct the issue. He could have easily stopped the transaction that was going on in the next office and said that we had made an appointment and had the first right of refusal.  Instead, they offered us a 1 year earlier (2012 instead of 2013) car with 13000 additional miles for the same price. Are you kidding me??  After haggling with them, they did drop the price somewhat, I explained for me to feel comfortable about the sale, they would have to match what the other one had (window tinting) for the lower price. Tyler said he will see what he could do (but made no commitment). I left a deposit to hold the car until they could get the car to their lot. For 2 days we couldn't stop thinking about what happened and how that could have been avoided.  We bought another Jetta from Volkswagen of Irving (Metro VW - check my positive review).

We were helped by THE BEST salesperson I have encountered in all my years of buying cars. Before I even test drove my CC, Concepcion ""Connie"" Flores, had told me more about the car than I had learned after test driving the same model on other lots.

I have to admit that I have never in my entire life walked into a dealership, met the salesperson and thought, ""I really hope I like the cars here because I want to buy one from her."" THANKS CONNIE!!!!

Once we decided on the cars, we met with the Finance team and they were just as informative and helpful.

I just took my car back into AutoNation Richardson to have the license plate put on the car, and the customer service experience in the Service Department was just as refreshing. They were courteous and extremely fast. I will be taking my car back to them for as long as I own it.

DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE DEPARTMENT! Anyone that has rated this place for more than 1 star either hasn't used the service department or doesn't care about their car. I should've looked at the reviews for this place before I took my car there and ruined my brand new car's paint just for a nitrogen tire topoff!

I have a brand new mustang with 8000 miles on it and got a nitro fill tire service package with it. With that service package, I can get my tires topped off with nitrogen whenever they get low for free. I got my car from a autonation dealer in fort worth but live in rockwall so this is the closest place to me that does nitrogen fills and I thought that with it being an autonation dealership, they would be reputable (wrong). I had several issues in my time there.

1. The guy that drove my car to to back dragged his wet and dirty shoe completely across my door panel trying to get in, I didn't say anything, thinking that that was something minor and that I could hopefully clean it up later and not be able to notice.

2. It took 20 minutes to fill 1 tire up! I requested 1 tire be filled and 1 only!

3. They come back 20 minutes later and I see that there was a 6-8 inch SCRATCH literally in the MIDDLE OF MY DOOR!!!!! I forgot to mention that I went in on a rain day so my car along with every other car was wet and had beads of water all over it. I always walk my car over visually when I take it to a shop because I don't trust those careless, dang near minimum wage chumps, and for good reason it turns out. There was ironically an area on the door, right where the scratch was, where it had clearly been rubbed by shorts or a rag or SOMETHING, I'm not sure what but it clearly was touched because in the middle of that area that didn't have beaded water at the moment, there was the scratch along with wads of mud. This is right by my drivers door handles so i think i wouldve noticed the mud when I dropped it off and the scratch seeing as I've washed and more importantly waxed my car every weekend since I've had it with the weather permitting. I rubbed it as hard as I could hoping it was just some sort or surface mark but no, it was throu the clear coat. I asked to speak with the service director or some sort of manager and he came out to look at it with me and simply TOLD ME HE WOULD NOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS!!! I was pissed to say the least before hand, but after he told me this, and I went back and forth with him and he wouldn't be responsible at all no matter what; for his careless employees mistakes. I am seriously furious. My door is going to need to be repainted and with them being irresponsible and being CARELESS ABOUT CUSTOMER SATISFACTION, I'm going to have to get this repainted so I don't have to be reminded of this event and the eyesore they created, everytime I walk out to my new mustang. I wonder if they did it because it was a mustang. I'm not sure why or how it happened. All I know is that it did and it was clear that it happened there being that the car was completely wet and beaded with water then when it came back there was that one spot that had clearly been rubbed by something and left a scratch. I would seriously drive up to 3 extra hours any way if thats what I had to do to avoid going to this service department again. I will never buy a Volkswagen or step foot at another vw dealership again. I hate Volkswagen/Audi even more than I did before this event.

51,"December 09, 2014","I've been looking for a Passat SE for a while, and I found it at autonation vw richardson dealership, which scammed me twice in a row within a month. Shenanigan no. 1: On 1/11/2014, I went to autonation vw richardson dealership for the 2014 Passat car with mileage 14k. The final agreed-upon OTD price was $19,300. The manager who made the deal with me was Mr. Chris Denman. $500 was charged on my credit card as a car deposit. I did not have the car loan paperwork with me at the moment. So I put the deposit down because the sales said that a deposit means the car could not be sold to anyone else for as long as a week. The sales told me that I can bring in the car loan paperwork back and he assured me that the car would be held in the lot for me to pick up by then. He then presented me with a purchase agreement on which the price was printed. Both Mr. Chris and I signed. Of course, he very conveniently forgot to give me my copy of the purchase agreement. Well, we would have thought that a verbal agreement and a signed purchase form, with a deposit put down have concluded a purchase contract of a tangible item. Right? Apparently, a shady car dealer would not think so as they don’t care about any kind of business ethics on a binding deal. Two business days after, on 12/11/2014, I went back to the dealership with the loan paperwork, only to find out that the car was sold, without even a courtesy call to me. I was upset. So I requested to talk to the sales manager Mr. Christ Demn. To my surprise, he didn't bother to make any effort to explain whatever reason it was for the breach of contact. Instead, he said “bye” to my face, and that made me frustrated even more. Another sale man Mr. Mike approached me, offering a comparable car with a deep discount to compensate my loss. He seemed very sincere that I decided to give the dealership a second chance. Shenanigan no. 2: 5 days later, Mr. Mike reached out to me on 17/11/2014 to let me know that a 2013 Passat car with mileage 22.3k was up for sale. Another general manager offered to sell me the car for a final OTD price of $18300, I accepted. The dealership had intended to get the car's wheel retouched before I pick it up. So I was told to return on 28/11/2014 to buy the car. Everything seemed smooth. I had the car loan paperwork. The car I wanted was offered to me with a fair price. On 30/11/2014, I arrived the dealership, only to receive another “nice” surprise. They raised the agreed-upon price for another $500, after they committed to the deal! Did they have sellers remorse or just play games with me? I didn't know. So I asked to speak to the General Manager on site. The sale person told me that he was not there, ah, another good excuse for avoiding a customer and sell the car to someone else for higher margin. I have had enough with this shady car dealer. I'd never buy anything from them and I would tell everyone I know to avoid them. I have filed BBB complaint, and rate a zero star if I could on every single dealership reviewing website.",1.0

59,"June 02, 2014","I purchased my 2014 VW Jetta SE here in April, and the buying experience was great - couldn't have asked for better.  Unfortunately since then, my view of the dealership has done a complete 180.  Once my car got to about 1,000 miles, my brakes started making an AWFUL, LOUD noise unlike anything I've ever heard.  The only way I know how to describe it is it is as though I have a family of seals, seagulls, or bats following me around wherever I go.  The noise is loud enough to hear with the windows up and the radio on, but if you have the windows down you better have some earplugs.  It is beyond embarrassing and something I would expect out of a 15 year old hooptie - not a brand new VW.  

I made a 7 a.m. appointment on Saturday with service advisor Bob King to get my brakes checked out, and he told me before they even took my car to the back that there might not be anything they can do.  I of course asked him to elaborate, and I was abruptly told this is just a noise that VWs make but they'll take a look at it.  Ok....About 2 1/2 hours in, I decided to check in with Bob to see if he had any news on my brakes.  He tells me that everything looks great and there are no issues, as if I'm supposed to be excited about that.  I ask, ""What do you mean nothing is wrong with my brakes?  Why are they making this horrible noise, then?""  Bob proceeds to shove a piece of paper at me that apparently explains noises that are normal for VWs to make.  Wrong answer.  I bought my first VW in 2006 after graduating college, and I have owned them ever since.  This new Jetta makes VW #3 for me.  I am quite familiar with the cars, and I continue to buy them for a reason.  Up until this point, they have always been reliable for me and very fun to drive.  

I ask Bob if there is someone else I can speak to about my brakes, and he says I am welcome to call VW.  Excuse me?!?!  *I* am supposed to call VW, about a fault on my brand new car that I bought from *your* dealership?!?!  I didn't take that bait, so Bob tells me I am welcome to talk to the service manager.  I walk inside, go into the service manager's office, and I immediately apologized because there was a woman in his office and I thought I was interrupting them.  It later became apparent that he had a personal relationship with this woman ""hanging out"" in his office and I wasn't interrupting anything at all.  I explained the situation to him, and he also told me there's probably not anything they can do for the brakes.  He asked me if he got in my car right then, would it make the noise I'm talking about?  I said, ""I can't guarantee that, but please take my car to see.""  He replied, ""Oh, so it's not a consistent noise.""  Excuse me?  It's consistent in that it happens all day, every day, throughout the day, independent of the weather, outside temperature, etc.  Does it happen 100% of the time though?  No!  And that's all I was trying to convey because I am not one to embellish details.  After that exchange with the service ""manager,"" it became obvious that I wasn't going to get anywhere with the dealership at all so I demanded they give me my car back.

My plan?  I have started documenting every time my car makes this god awful noise (which is a lot), I am making You Tube videos, and I will not stop until they decide to take my problem seriously.  It's the only thing I know to do.  I will be heard. ",1.0

88,"December 30, 2013","I arrived at the Service Bay at 12:20 and was told that they may have to order a key for my father's car. Not that they would definitely, but that they might have to order it. 2 hours later they told me, well we have to order the key, oh and the other service to regrind the lenses on the headlights, well the guy who does that is not here today. I was not happy, but said ok, so they said it has been pulled around to be washed and you have to pre-pay for the key.

Then the it became totally and utterly absurd. I waited about 20 minutes and went to pre-pay for the key at which time the service tech that was passing by told the cashier that he could not find the car. He began running around the lot looking for the car, and enlisted the sales person who had taken my information to begin with. An hour later, my father's car appeared, during this time I asked several questions. #1 How could you lose a car? Apparently if the panic button on your key does not work they have no way of locating it on the lot---note that I was there to replace a key. Does this sound a little bit like the laziest way to locate cars on a lot or is it me?  Next since I had time on my hands I asked the strangest question, how do you not know if you have the key here or if you have to order it? To my shock the cashier said well we do not know until it is pulled around and put on the computer....to which I replied, so you can not tell by the year, make and model that you have to order the key? She said, no because it is done by the vin number....so theoretically it could be the same make, model, and year and you could carry the key to the red one but not the blue one?????? Go Figure!!! Those German engineers are sure well mind blowing! Needless to say, after leaving 3 hours later with nothing accomplished and just ridiculous answers I left to never return.

On another note, had they just said we have to order the key, if you step inside and pre-pay we will torture you next week when it arrives, all would have been good. And just a heads up to management, instead of your staff running around baffled by the amount of business that they had during the week between Christmas and New Years, you might should give them a heads up. Like people are on vacation, and so they do not have to miss work or take a sick day to have their cars checked out, we might be busy.... just a thought I mean it would be like not warning the staff a Nordstrom that the day after Christmas was going to be a bit on the busy side. The staff were overwhelmed, befuddled and a bit on the bewildered side for my fabulous three hour observation.",2.3

98,"October 29, 2013","Everyone with car trouble hopes to find a car shop they trust.  I’m 52 years (young) and since my early twenties, I’d always been told “the LAST place to take your car for service is the ‘Dealer.’”  I’ve always relied friends and relatives for references for the best ‘neighborhood’ mechanic, because their labor is typically HALF of what a dealer will charge and they NEVER treat you like you’re ‘just another number’ in the assembly line. But my confidence in Dealership Service Centers was COMPLETELY restored when I stumbled into AutoNation Volkswagen in Richardson and met Pete Nicholson and his service manager – Steve Mulholland.  I have since been back three times over the years to service my 2006 Jetta, and time and time again these guys continue to blow me away.  Not only is their customer service ‘over-the-top’, our family mechanic of 10 years couldn’t even match their prices… ok, ONCE when I needed repairs they were $45 dollars higher than our family mechanic, but in fairness, our mechanic said in order to beat AutoNation’s bid, he would have to use “aftermarket parts.”  I love Eddie, and my family still uses him for their Hondas & Toyota, but I figured if the DEALER is only $45-$50 more and I’m getting ‘Volkswagen’ parts installed by ‘Volkswagen’ certified  mechanics – it was worth the difference!  It’s important to remember you're not just paying for the cost of the parts and the time it takes to install them, you're also paying for the technical expertise of the technician.  The last time I went to AutoNation was 3 weeks ago, because my air-conditioner quit working.  I thought it was the compressor or blower fan, but it was far worse.  I needed new belts; new hoses, a new Air-conditioning control switch and the mount that held the radiator had broken lose.  I checked around, and the best price I could find was nearly $1,600 – my family just didn’t have it.  Pete and Steve knew my family and I were financially challenged that particular month, but refused to let me drive around in the Texas Heat without air-conditioning. The shop was slammed at the time and they needed to run a full diagnostic on my vehicle.  They told me they would need me to leave the car for a few days.  Even though they had an Enterprise Rent-a-Car next door, they gave me a Demo to drive for the 10 plus days they had it in the shop, which save my family hundreds of dollars in rent-a-car charges. But the icing on the cake, was they were able to do the repairs for just under $1,100!!   If  you have a Volkswagen, take it to AutoNation and ask for Pete Nicholson, then go inside the Service Center lobby and shake hands with the Service Manager, Steve Mulholland.  His door is ALWAYS open and they are the nicest and most professional ‘neighborhood’ mechanics you’ll ever meet – it just so happens they work in a ‘Dealership.’  My name is Bart Hermer and I am an AutoNation Customer for life.",5.0

101,"October 17, 2013","This was simply the best vehicle purchase experience that I have encountered in all my years, and that great experience was provided by Gary Blakley. He is a true gentleman and arguably one of the best sales consultants you would ever encounter. Simply by the way he listens to your needs and shares his experiences and knowledge as if you were part of his family.

The Volkswagen dealership at Richardson by far was clean and organized. The employees are really friendly. The vehicle I test drove was super clean in and out. I really thought I was driving a brand new vehicle. The vehicle was a certified Volkswagen Jetta and after consulting with Gary, it made total sense to buy a certified vehicle that had a warranty and was inspected by certified Volkswagen mechanics.
 I found the same vehicle cheaper at an independent dealership but with higher mileage, no warranty and not in pristine condition as the one I test drove at the Richardson dealership. As my grandfather would say, “A penny wise, a dollar foolish”.

The sales experience does not end with the signing of the financial paper work in which the financial person named Mustafa was kind and knowledgeable, but after the financial paper work was completed, there was a young gentleman who showed us to our car and answered any questions we had with the vehicle options and setup my mobile phone to the vehicle’s Bluetooth phone system.

To top it off, I get a call from Gary on the weekend just to check to see how the vehicle and I were doing.     

I totally recommend this dealership and Gary Blakley!

The service was performed great to my satisfaction and I was told that I had an exhaust system leak in the EGR Cooler also told it was not an emergency and when the hole got big enough a light would come on in the dash panel and it would be time to get it fixed.. the price would be approx. $1150.00. On about Aug 13 I received a call from Jim Wilson who said he was with AutoNation and he had worked a special for me to get my car fixed for $658.00 plus tax and that it would take approx. 2 hours.  I took the vehicle into the dealer on Aug 20th. at 10:30am at 1:30pm I ask if my car was about fixed and was told  by Mr. King that it would be about 2 more hours. Mr. King also said Mr. Wilson did not know how many hours this would take. I received my carat 4pm and the work order said: ""Removed and replaced EGR Cooler test drove vehicle after repairs.

I left the car and was given a car to drive home. when I picked my car up the next morning at 11am it was so hot that I could not touch anything inside. I thought the heated seats had been left on.

The service was exceptional there and I was concerned about finding a place in the DFW area. I initially to my car to AutoNation Park Cities off of Lemmon and I would NEVER go there again. The first time I took my car it was for an issue which Park Cities had attempted to fix three times and charged me every time they got it wrong. Everyone was very nice, professional and considerate of my time and the money I had already spent at a separate dealership. I've been at least six or seven times since my first time a couple of years ago and every time, the experience has been consistent. You will definitely feel that they care that you know you are on the road in a safe and reliable vehicle. They always ensure you have transportation to and from the service as well as while your car is being serviced. They have always been professional and courteous. I have never felt overcharged and they have always been upfront and clear on all charges prior to any work being done. Additionally (and I have had a good amount of work done on my car) they have always managed to stay within the initial estimate. Nothing worse than being told that the car will be $500 then two to three calls later you end up picking up your car and paying $1200. I would and have referred people to this dealership and would continue to do so. ",5.0

I actually feel like it's a place where I can relax and think things through - the environment removes the most basic of anxiety that comes with purchasing a new or used vehicle.

Second, Josef Puhringer is the best sales consultant. He is a very calm, classy person to get to know and do business with. He does not rush you, yet he will quickly work very hard for you at focusing in to what you value in a car. He knows how to find you something that you will truly love for years to come. He is patient and will truly be your advocate. He completely takes away the anxiety of making a big decision like buying a new car. He's been doing this for a long time, knows the VW cars & brand for decades, and is a foremost expert on all things German.

116,"June 17, 2013","I bought a used Honda & extended warranty at another AutoNation dealership farther from my home. I was told to take it here for oil changes since it was the AutoNation dealership nearest my home. When I called for an appointment I was asked to be there in an hour. When I arrived Jessica greeted me & said it would take a little longer since I had a Honda & they would have to get my parts. She said I should have called a day before! I explained that I had called & been told to come now. I asked how long & she said an hour. I'd already dropped what I was doing & driven there, so I said I'd wait. Over 2 hours later my car was finally ready. I should have asked the price in advance. I didn't expect an oil change to cost $100.94. That included a free tire rotation & car wash. Discount Tire would have rotated my tires free. (Yes, even though I didn't buy them there I've been a good customer for years & they'll take care of me.) I could have taken care of the car wash at Star Car Wash myself for $5 or paid $15 & had it done for me. I felt I was held up, but my mistake for not asking the price in advance. Then after I left I discovered they didn't reset my oil life feature, oil was spilled all over under my hood, & according to my receipt the wrong oil was used! My son did some checking & found out that my first oil change with my warranty was supposed to be free. (They had pulled up my warranty information & should have known.) He went back with me and got the other issues taken care of. The service manager was very nice & did get the problems corrected. He explained that they are a Volkswagen dealership and aren't equipped to take care of Hondas. Why didn't they just tell me that to start with? I would have gone elsewhere.

They never called me to let me know the part was in or not so when its the day that my appointment was scheduled, I call and they dont know anything about it. I talked to 3 different people and every time i have to repeat my story and what i need. This was frustrating to me because I live an hour away from this dealership and I blocked off my day to bring the car in and when its time, they don't know anything about my appointment or the reason for it. When I was there the first time they needed to inspect the car, everyone seemed so busy and out of order. They seemed rushed and running around and 3 people I spoke to, although i had to tell them all the same thing, none of them seemed to have time to listen to me. Of course they will not know what I am here for the second time, because the first time they were all too busy to take the time to listen to me, care for my concern, and appreciate my appointment and the fact I came to service my car at their location. 

I dont want to single out one person in the service department, because it seemed like a culture of busy flustered workers.. perhaps 3 very busy people all ask if I had been helped but no one really helped me. 

Oh and before leaving they ask me to give them a good score on their email survey, which I did last time.

He gave me a very thorough review of the vehicle in which I was interested.  He was very knowledgeable, and even shared the history he knew of the vehicle.  He was not pushy or aggressive in any way, which I appreciate very much.  We took a test drive, and he continued to point out various features of the vehicle.  When we returned, he asked if I might like to get my trade in vehicle appraised.  Donnie made me comfortable in the building as I waited and soon returned with a number I found to be fair.

In our dealings on cost, he was very straight forward with me, and did not subject me to numerous trips back and forth to the sales manager.  He simply asked me where I needed to be and worked with me to help me get there.  

Donnie also made a committment to repair a small scratch on the hood of the vehicle, which I appreciated very much.

My finance session with Michael Weimer was likewise very pleasant.  This usually lengthy process was done as quickly as possible, and explained very clearly and professionally by Mr. Weimer.

I would and will recommend this dealership to any of my acquaintances in the market for a car.",5.0

He is one of the reasons that I came to this dealership and wanted to work with him.  He worked with me through a few issues that came up with the original car that I signed me lease for and in the end still got me a great car that I enjoy.

The leasing/finance representative I worked with( I do not remember his name) I found to be somewhat rude during both of my visits to pick up my car and finalize the paperwork. He seemed annoyed that I asked questions and just wanted me to sign and get out of the dealership. For someone like myself who was making their first lease/purchase on their own I was obviously a little nervous and wanted to make sure I got all the information that I needed and I felt rushed.",4.0

I started to look elsewhere and I am so happy I bought a car from Josef Puhringer! I felt like he is the best car salesman on the Planet Earth that has Ever existed PERIOD! From the moment I called the dealership in the morning to talk to sales he was happy to help me find a 2013 Passat that I was looking for. I told him what I wanted and he called me back lightning fast within 5 minutes to tell me he had the vehicle I wanted in stock and ready to sell. I made an appointment to see the car that evening and he even told me they would negotiate on the price even below MSRP and they sure did! I got a great car at a discount price that was fair for both me and the dealership. Josef ALWAYS was very professional, patient, a great attitude and had a big smile on his face for the whole duration of the sale. Once I went through finance Josef gave me a very detailed overview of the vehicle from outside to inside with an excellent explanation of ALL the vehicle features. The next morning I got a follow-up call from Josef to confirm that we were happy with the purchase and I told him yes I was and I will definitely come back and buy my next car from him. Josef treated me with great respect and dignity and he was very humble and more friendly than most people that I have ever met in my life.

Bottom Line if your in the DFW area and want to buy a Volkswagen look no further than the Amazing, Superb, Most Excellent Mr Josef Puhringer, a very honest, friendly, and professional Salesman expert on VW.

I also wanted to acknowledge the finance gentlemen I believe his name was Darren? and also Darrick and Michael for approving my offer on the car!",5.0

I appreciated the courtesy each time I visit especially the carwashes and his friendliness.  
We have not had any mechanical problems.  But, the efficiency when having oil changes and tire issues taken care has been just great.

166,"March 29, 2013","I have been looking for a vehicle to replace my 2007 BMW Z4. I considered a Porsche 911, Audi S5, Mercedes S class, and Cheverolet Camaro and the Dodge Challenger. My usual searches can last for months as I think that an automobile purchase is a very important decision. Through my search, I realized that what I wanted was a sporty car and a manual transmission. A few other features were important, but those were near the list's top. As I came closer to making a decision, I realized that I wanted to lease or buy a vehicle that was much less expensive than the high end cars that I started with ($60-$70k). Then I had a flash, get a VW in the $20 to $$30k range with most or all of the features I want. And I found the Beetle to fit that bill. As a 2012 the car was priced down to arounfd $20,000, my trade was at my target (without negotiating) and the vehicle had a 2.0 Turbo, leather and many other features available with a newer car.

In this experience, I worked with Charles. Charles was a really nice guy and very knowleddgable. We talked VW and went through all of the features of the car. Charles explained what was available with regard to a lease or purchase choice. And of course the test drive. Charles took me on the road and directed me to areas were I could experience different driving conditions, ie. highway, residential, country...

VW wanted my Jetta, so I worked with Gary to exchange it for a Golf TDI. He was very personable, professional, down to Earth, and friendly. He actually cared about my interests, found the right car for me, and got me a great deal without any hassle. All of the other service staff members have been very kind and I can tell Volkswagen of America is very customer driven. I highly recommend this dealership!",5.0

210,"February 04, 2013","This is my second purchase from Boardwalk Volkswagen in Richardson TX.  A couple of years ago, I purchased a 2009 VW Pre-owned and Certified Tiguan and Josef Puhringer was our salesman.  Josef was outstanding in every respect.  He was instrumental in helping make every aspect of the Tiguan purchase a pleasant experience (and I can tell you, I absolutely hate buying a car from a dealership.) 

I had such a good experience with the Tiguan purchase, that I drove across town again last week (I live closer to Lewisville VW) to do business with Josef.  Always cheerful and knowledgeable of the product, Josef actually takes the time to listen to his customer and tailors his assistance to what the customer needs.  I am a retired military officer, very picky, almost 60 years old, have owned many vehicles and am hard to please.  I can honestly tell you this, by far, has been my best car buying experience at a dealership and it is due, in great measure, to the services provided by Josef Puhringer.

Whenever I encounter a friend who is considering purchasing a VW, I will highly recommend that Josef Puhringer be their sales rep.  My 2009 Tiguan will eventually need to be traded and I look forward to doing business with Josef in the near future.  He is definitely an outstanding asset to Boardwalk Volkswagen !!!!",4.8

Terry was very helpful and kept in communication with me letting me know what my repair status was so that I had sufficient time to plan the interim time and my arrival.,5.0
215,"January 29, 2013","This was the second purchase from Steve and this dealership, the last being in June of 2012 (not very far apart). We don't live close to this store, but from our attempts at another dealership it as worth the drive out there. Both times we have been taken care of to the highest standards. We were treated the same whether we bought used (the first one) or new (the second one). The pricing was better than the local competition both times so already we were considering the distance for the better price. But the customer service definitely was the deciding factor. Our spur of the moment decision to purchase again led us out to the dealership after work on a Thursday, putting us there around 8:00 PM. The only heads up we gave them was wanting to see a couple brand new Beetles. By 8:30 we were test driving two different models, and shortly after we were working on financing. Financing usually takes the longest, as we are in a similar business and we have to stay late regularly to get this part of the deal done, and we were the customers now in that situation, the dealership closed at 9:00 but they were still going ahead with everything as if it was normal hours. We finally got things all wrapped up and drove out of there about 9:45 with a brand new Beetle with everyone still treating us just as friendly and excited for us with our new purchase. Being that late we had not even seen the car in the daylight, or had a chance to go through everything on it before taking it home. Unfortunately we found a couple cosmetic issues and one other small item, but Steve didn't hesitate to offer to pick up the vehicle, get all of our concerns fixed and return the vehicle back to us. These are the kinds of details that make a dealership stand out from the rest. To us, it makes it worth it to drive an hour to get there, and when it's time for service, we will take it there as well even though we have a dealership 5 minutes from our house, literally.",5.0
216,"January 28, 2013",Terry listens. It seems to me that too many people in the service business today do not listen to the customer they are supposed to serve. He took care of everything asked for the first time. He is also friendly and seems to care about giving the best service possible. I have found him to be that way every time I come in for service. I like my CC too -,5.0
217,"January 25, 2013","I haven't had a new car for many years and have always been partial to Volkswagon because I learned to drive on a 1966 Bug. I looked at the variety of reasonably priced small fun cars out there and the Beetle was the best quality by far.  It is a very well thought out car and I am thrilled with my purchase. I got a white manual transmission 2.5L 2013 Beetle with navigation, sound, and sunroof.  That particular car was in short supply, so Gary Blakley found the exact car I wanted at another dealer and had it brought to Boardwalk.  The car is beautiful and I am overwhelmed with the quality of the vehicle and appreciative of the knowledgeable help I received from Gary. He really made a huge effort to see that I got the exact car I wanted.  Also, Gary was able to get my family the right price so we could afford the car.  If you are looking for a fun car to drive with lots of perks, I highly recommend the Volkswagon Beetle.  As a die hard Honda Prelude owner, I never thought I would find anything that came close to it in quality.  Thankfully, the personable, friendly help of Gary Blakley, Mostafa Abou-Auf, Michael Trammell, and Kirks McCoy enabled me to find a wonderful new car! Thank you Boardwalk!      ",5.0

219,"January 25, 2013","We purchased a used 2005 GTI for my son recently.  It is a fun little car, and he loves it.  We had 2 occasions to perform service, and both were good experiences.  On the first, we were also notified of some VW warranty work that was performed without any additional cost.  Had we used our regular mechanic, we would not have even known about this.  In the second case, Boardwalk quoted work on the engine that was about the same price as other non-dealers.  So, it made sense to have the work performed by those best trained on the VW cars.  We also are impressed with very friendly staff, with high focus on customer satisfaction.

He worked it so I got a great trade-in price for my 2001 and low interest on the loan so my payments are really manageable...and this was after most people go home from work.  Gary is a cool head with a good heart and I recommend him highly.  What makes him happy is to see other people happy.  I drive a long way to this dealership because of these guys.",5.0

286,"November 06, 2012","We had been looking for a new car for quite some time to match my wife's needs and settled on a 2013 Golf TDI.  We went in to the dealership on a rainy Saturday (9/29) and wanted to test drive the golf in rainy conditions because we are concerned with safety and handling under adverse conditions. We had no intention of buying a car that day but thanks to Todd's help and kindness, we came home that night in a brand new car!  We had very specific questions that Todd quickly answered for us and did his best to meet our high demands.  He even had a car delivered in the color we wanted from another dealership before we even spoke the the gentleman in finance, who was not nearly as cordial BTW.  In fact, we were so turned off by the initial words spoken to us in finance that we walked out the door.  I happened to catch Todd on our way out and explained what happened and he convinced us to stay and give them another chance.  Todd did everything he could to get us in our car that day and he is the reason why we have a car from VW Richardson.  Since it was raining, he made an appt for us to get the car detailed on another day after we left.  Todd has been responsive to every text and email and continues to prove that service is important.  Thank you Todd!",5.0

Once the kids came, I was in hand-me-down minivans up until now. Choosing my VW Jetta Sportwagen TDI (to haul the dogs now, not the kids!) was easy after the first test drive. From my first phone conversation with Mark Sayers, fleet sales, I felt comfortable to cut to the chase with him and get our business done! He was always courteous, professional, knoweledgeable, flexible, understanding, and amenable. He answered his phone all the time, or returned my calls within a very short time frame to answer the many questions I had about the vehicle and our 'deal'. He made it very convenient for me to meet him at the dealership even if was not scheduled to be there (twice!) to meet at my availability. That impressed me. I always felt respect from him and that earned my trust, making the car-buying experience so much less stressful, and even - yes - easy. What also impressed me about Mark is that he didn't pretend to have all the answers, but he always knew who would. That exposed me to others at the dealership who were always friendly and helpful. This tells that the Boardwalk VW mission/credo obviously values the customer by providing excellent service and care, and for a new car buyer re-entering the market, that is a very welcoming attitude, and important differentiator!

310,"October 16, 2012","A friend of mine referred me to Rick Bayon at this dealership and I was working with him for a couple of months back in June between a VW Tiguan LE and a VW Golf TDi before ultimately deciding on the TDi due to superior fuel economy and outstanding resale value. Then in August, I finally had a chance to visit the dealership so I can take advantage of the special incentives for TDI's, and Rick referred me to Jeremy Heuss who was a fellow enthusiast and definitely was able to relate to him on that level. At the visit, I somehow was stuck in a dilemma between a GTI and a TDi, and he let me test drive the two. After some thought between the two, I ended up deciding on the TDI finally and went straight to the dealership on Saturday August 25. During that time Michael Trammel, the finance guy, was very helpful with the purchase process and was able to explain all of the options available to me at the time. After being qualified for 1.9% went on to do some more signing and then got my keys to my brand new vehicle which marks my entry into the world of German vehicles and cannot be ever more satisfied with it. If you are looking to purchase a VW I strongly recommend purchasing one from Jeremy as he will be extremely helpful in shaping your purchase. Not only is he friendly but also very knowledgeable about VW's in general so rest assured on that.

When I walked into the showroom I was greeted and made welcome by Josef Puhringer, as well as a couple of other gentlemen.

After discussing these features as well as asking questions about things I had not even thought of, he found the perfect car and we took it for a drive. I loved it!     We completed the paperwork and Michael Trammell in Finance completed the sale.  Michael has a great sense of humor, by the way.

I had advised them that they had to drive the car, for a while, in order to see the issue.
Kirks truly listened to my explanation of the problem, and made sure that they thoroughly checked into the problem.

I sent my Jetta TDI to their dealership for regular maintenance and found the windshield was broken after I had taken my car home. This situation is of course frustrating in any way. But when I went back to the dealership for an investigation, Bob King, Jason Lederer and certainly myself followed a standard and professional procedure to deal with this situation without any unpleasant argument. 

During the whole process, Bob King, Jason Lederer demonstrated a strong commitment to great customer service which should be highly commended.  This incident has convinced me to do business with Boardwalk for years to come.

I gave Houston a try but after spending more money and time to continue with the same car problems, I decided to just take it back the Richardson TX Boardwalk Volkswagen Dealership. I called ahead and scheduled for my car service and repair for June 28, 2012. I was greeted by Ron Hollomon as soon as I drove up. I met the mechanic guy who was going to work on my car. He was the best and knew about Volkswagen/German cars. Please keep in mind my car was not driveable anymore. I had to carry it on a Uhaul tow. Not even 5 minutes after my car was there, the problem was discovered. A loaner car was given to us until my car was fix. We were also offerred to be driven to any destination if needed. The price was right considering all the work that was to be done. My car was cleaned and was never charged a fee. My car is running excellent now just as if it was brand new. I just want to thank Ron, his mechanic, and everyone that assisted us with our visit. There is no other Volkswagen dealership as great as this one. I will always bring my car there for all problems.

It turned out that the part needed to be sent from Germany so it was a couple of weeks before the actual service was provided.

I've owned a lot of cars in my life and dealt with a lot of crazy dealerships in the past.  Boardwalk has to be the most professional and friendliest places I have ever purchased a car from.  Jason Villa is not only a great sales manager but, but he's a fantastic leader of the best sales team I've ever had the pleasure of working with.  When I walk in, everyone has a smile on their face and is happy to see me.  And that's not just because I bought a car.  They are happy to see me even after the buying experience and every time I come in to get my scheduled maintenance performed.  Speaking of maintenance, the service department has been nothing short of excellence and treats me like a human being each and every time I come in.  In my book, that speaks volumes.  I have now purchased two vehicles back to back from this dealership and frankly, I won't go anywhere else as long as I own a VW.  I have been nothing but satisfied every step of the way and I would recommend this dealer above all that exist.",5.0

The trust is what I felt will be bringing me back, both Jason and Brian do not have to worry about being labeled as ""typical car salesman"". I never felt rushed, pressured, or talked into something that I was not comfortable with. After the purchase(s), any question I had about the vehicle was only a phone call away, no matter how small. We have a Jetta TDI, we've already put over 30,000 miles on it and it drives just like the day we drove it off the lot. Whatever vehicle we buy next, I will be calling Jason Villa first.",5.0

I took a test drive and the rep touted all the car's features. We went to his office and he went to his manager's office to get the price (even though I thought I knew what it would be based on our phone conversation). The price he showed me was $3000 more than the online price- not to mention and additional $800 for all the features he touted- and he was incredulous when I asked him what happened to the internet sales price. He finally explained that the online price was for leasing, even though this was not stated online and he did not mention this when I asked him about it on the phone. I voiced my displeasure and he then had the nerve to ask me If I still wanted to buy it. I firmly said no and left right away. Ten minutes later-once I am home-  he calls me and tells me ""you won't believe it, I got one thousand knocked off the price for ya.""

479,"June 23, 2012","Friday, June 22, 2012 was the second time, in my adult life, that I've had the luxury to purchase a new vehicle.  Although the circumstances were unexpected--my car sustained irreparable damage due to a catastrophic hail storm--my experience far surpassed my expectations.  When I purchased my first car, I felt as if I had been stalked, harassed, and pressured into a sale.  This is not to mention the lengthy time spent at the dealership haggling a price with the salesman and financial team for several hours.  

I did not experience any of these feelings when I arrived at Boardwalk Volkswagen.  My partner, having done previous business with Gary Blakely at the same dealership, respectfully requested him when we arrived the first time we visited.  Although Gary had gone home for the day, we were met by another salesman, Tony Azami, who took us on a test drive of the 2012 Jetta GLI, which I promptly fell in love with.  My partner and I indicated that we would return to the dealership when the terms of my insurance claim had been finalized.

Once the insurance company disclosed that the vehicle was a total loss, we decided to come back to the dealership to take the Jetta GLI and Jetta SE for second test drive to make sure this was the vehicle I wanted.  While I could not purchase the vehicle on my second visit, due to the waiting period necessary for my insurance company to process my total loss claim, I was again surprised by the customer service we received, this time by Gary Blakely.

Talking to Gary was like talking to an old friend--a rare and unique quality that is, sadly, missing from many salesmen of any trade.  Gary asked how my partner's life had been since the last time he'd purchased a vehicle and, all the while, treated me with respect as both an individual and consumer.  Having told Gary of the reasons behind my purchasing a new vehicle, the trouble I was having trying to obtain a rental car due to unavailability, and concurrently knowing that I was very interested in purchasing the car, he offered me something I never knew existed, the Borrower's Vehicle Agreement.

Not only did Gary provide me with a stress free purchase, he gave me the opportunity to ensure that the Jetta GLI was the right car for me.  Unexpected catastrophic events aside, I hope to have my new vehicle for a long time and I look forward to doing business with him in the future.",5.0

One day I went along with him to Boardwalk VW b/c he was having car issues, and he got helped by Tie, she was so genuinely friendly that I was convinced that the VW brand was a great brand to be part off, smiling faces at the car shop, color me surprised! Well when the time came for a car purchase of my own I immediately went to VW, and on my first little battery issue I took it to VW Boardwalk and was excited to see Tie, she even remembered my friend and the situation of his visit months if not a year ago.

As such, it wasn't working when I arrived to pick it up sicne know one knew to look at it. Granted, she was apologetic, but I was a bit irritated since I had specifically asked that it be checked out, along with the other issues (scheduled maintenance and replacement of the intake manifold.) I also found it a bit troubling that neither she nor the associate working at the desk where I came to make payment knew how to enter the code for the deductible. Given the time of day (around 6 PM on Friday the 8th)and that there were other customers in line behind me, this came across as slightly unprofessional. The car we brought in (2009 Passat)is the 4th car we have purchased from Boardwalk since 2005, and this is the first time I've had such an experience. I hope it is only a one-time fluke.",3.6

493,"June 12, 2012","Gary Blakley is the best salesperson I have had the honor of buying from - and finding a fantastic car salesperson is the hardest thing in the world.  Gary did everything to make our buying experience pleasant, fast, and fun.  Of course, we've bought cars from Gary at Boardwalk Volkswagen before - and we intend to buy from him as long as we buy cars.  We make all our friends listen to our enthusiastic recommendations of Gary before we let them ride in the new car, and I know some of them have bought from you.

I am so impressed with the way that Gary knows how important our time is to us.  He makes all the details of buying a car a pleasure.  He definitely takes his time to make sure he finds whatever we want, no matter how difficult it may be.

Each car I buy from Gary seems better than the one before - or maybe it's just the reminder of what a fine salesman and person he is.

I love my yellow Beetle, and I look forward to our next buying experience with Gary!!

From the time I talked to him on the phone until he walked us to our car he was a gentelman, courteous and a family oriented individual.  My husband and I went to the dealership with our kids and during the car purchase relative short time we spent in there, Josef made sure that they were comfortable and also part of the experience.  

I truly appreciate and value his sales person capacity to understand what I wanted and what I was looking for before even put a foot inside the dealership.  With that, Josef exceeded my expectations as a demanding customer. 

I'm very glad I follow my mother's advise as Josef was referred to me by her who also had a pleasant experience with him.  I would highly recomend Josef to my family and friends.

521,"May 25, 2012","  I had my Passat repaired by an out of town facility (I had an accident while out of town - couldn't take it to Boardwalk). The original estimate was $8,200. When I went to pick the car up, I was given a bill for $9,600. Without any notification, unauthorized work had been done (unrelated to the damage caused by the accident) and the work that was authorized to be done was not done correctly (different color grill segments, engine light on, a/c not cooling, parts not aligned, etc.).  I immediately took the car back to Dallas and dropped it off with Ron Hollomon (Boardwalk VW) and explained the situation and asked him to have the car checked out and let me know what it will cost to get the incorrect repairs corrected. Ron gave me a time when he would call me to discuss what was found. Low and behold, Ron called me when he said he would, told me what was needed, how much it would cost, and how long it would take. I approved the repairs and they went to work on it. The car was done when he said it would be, it was repaired correctly, and it cost a little bit less than expected! In addition to taking care of the repairs, Ron also went the ""extra mile"" by going over my bill with me (from the other repair facility) and put a copy of it in my file with Boardwalk so they have a record of what had been done to my car for future reference. It is important to have a service center that you can trust. Boardwalk VW Service Center (Ron Hollomon and the mechanics he works with in particular) will take care of you. These cars can be expensive to maintain and they require trained personnel to work on them. At Boardwalk, I know I'll get the best quality work at a reasonable price and never, ever have to worry about work being done without approval.",4.8

Bret was exceedingly knowledgable and helpful as we looked at several models and options. He went through each model and gave me the break down of the differences in each. He was very down to earth and honest, which I greatly appreciated. I worked with both Jason and Bret as we tried to figure out the best option for me. They were patient with me as I went back and forth, and neither one was pushy or tried to push the ""hard sell"" act. When I finally had mad a choice, Jason worked tirelessly to get me the best deal possible. I am still amazed at the magic he was able to work. 

Ultimately, they were able to get me out of a car I needed to get out of, but did not really want to, and get me into a FABULOUS new car and help the transition and the process of getting rid of my touareg. They were professional and efficient, and again, truly did work very hard to get me a fantastic new car! 

I have had volkswagens for about 10 years now, but I can honestly say that I will always go to Boardwalk from this point forward.

Anyway I got over that and drove home. 

Sorry, I couldnt resist that..... now the truth

I gave Bob King and the crew at Boardwalk a very high rating. Here is why:

Reason 1: from initial call to talking to someone with knowledge, about 1.50 minute(s).

Reason 2: I held the phone to the engine and said ""Bob listen to this"" (my Passat sounded like an old pick-up with a bad muffler) and Bob said ""that sounds like  (blah blah whatever, i can't speak car tech talk) and that is probably covered by the 8/80k warranty"".

Reason 3: Bob arranged to have my car looked at immediately. And they brought me home.

Reason 5: Bod saved me a ton of money. 

Reason 6: I was treated with respect and diginity.

551,"May 08, 2012","I feel almost insane for writing such a bad review, especially when one considers the overall rating for this dealership, but such a case only makes me more upset at what happened today. 


I will admit that my experience was initially positive for some time. I came with my dad intent on buying a car. Brian was very knowledgeable and friendly to us, making us more secure about our eventual decision on a Jetta. There was some negotiating back and forth, but we eventually agreed upon a set price, with him saying he'll ""throw in some tinted windows"" after he SHOWED us a paper SAYING that we'll get it. Big mistake. But we believed him and moved forward- signed papers agreeing to having my dad's credit report drawn. 

It wasn't until AFTER the credit report was drawn that he came back saying that they couldn't pay for the windows. Again, we stuck to our set price. I don't know who it was, perhaps a manager or finance manager, came into Brian's office and asserted himself in our faces and said no- something about how tinted windows weren't in the sticker price, how they're losing money, etc. It was in the most aggressive and abhorringly rudest manner that left my dad and me shocked and offended and confused.

Why would Brain say yes, have us sign papers, and then have this other rude man essentially bulldozing us over and saying no? It was unnecessary and my dad was very livid considering how not only were we lied to, but his credit score was going to be affected.

Brain came back later saying that they'll agree to the tinted windows, but never did he nor the rude man apologize for the way we were treated. 

Tinted windows weren't that important, but it was a big indicator to the trustworthiness of this dealership. ",1.8

Matter of fact, my brother recently said good bye to his 04' Jetta that took a massive beating but still stood strong. To say my over all experience with Boardwalk Richardson was great is grossly understating it. From the very beginning my time was respected, appreciated, and felt my sales associate did everything and anything to ensure my purchase was smooth.  I initially had my heart set on a red Golf which was sold the morning I was in transit to purchase it, Bret had several cars waiting for me to test drive. Like Goldy Locks and the Three Cars, I found my perfect car in a certified pre owned Rabbit. Everyone from the sales department to the finance to the service department when I went in a week later to have the car washed have been absolutely amazing! The employees make it an effort to give you a completley satisfactory experience and not treat you like you're some commission check walking through the door.

596,"April 21, 2012","It was crazy busy on Saturday 4/14/12 when I visited Boardwalk to test drive a 3.6 Passat that I had seen online.  I had made an appointment with Brian online to drive the car at 11:00.  I showed up for my appointment exactly on time.  Brian was busy with someone else.  I waited about 30 minutes before I was greeted by Alec who was very helpful.  He was somewhat knowledgeable about the car but gave me some misinformation.  They did not have the black Passat there so I drove a similar car.  I was very interested in the black one and wanted to drive it before I committed to buying it.  I came back to pick up the car and Brian helped me.  I had 3 hours to test drive the car and we agreed that I would return it at 7:00p.m. which would give me enough time to complete the buyer's paperwork.  Brian was not available so Alec helped me again.
The misinformation that Alec gave me was regarding the car battery.  I saw that the battery is located in the trunk, which was unexpected for me.  When I asked Alec, he suggested that maybe it was a ""back-up"" battery to the main battery that should be located under the hood of the car.
The paperwork signing process was hurried and Jason admitted that he was very tired.  We finished about 9:00p.  He did not realize, nor did I until the next day, that I had not even left a check for the downpayment.  While the information that he gave me is routine to him (such as the offering of additional warranties on the car), it is not routine to the buyer and should not be hurried through.  I chose not to take any extended warranty because it was not explained at a level that I was comfortable with.  I even suggested to Jason that I could come back on Monday and sign all of the paperwork if he was tired.

The sales experience was disjointed despite the fact that I had made an appointment.  I felt ""passed off"" between 2 sales people.  
Having said that, I absolutely love my new car and hope that the experience with the service department is much better and much less disjointed.

I dealt with Mr. Blakley about 10 years ago when I bought a VW Beatle and I had excellent service then. I drove from Denison, TX to deal with him again.  The dealership and Mr. Blakley were very professional, courteous and after the deal was made, the paperwork was done quickly.  Everyone I dealt with was professional and listened to my concerns. Mr. Blakley gave me a good price on my new car and the dealership had the exact car I wanted.  I thought I wanted a different color at first, and he looked up where the car was and said he could get it for me.  I really like this dealership since I first bought my Beatle and that is why I went online and looked up Boardwalk Volkswagen in Richardson TX to see if Mr. Blakley was still a salesman there.  

My VW TDI was clean and ready to go after the paperwork was signed.  I was treated very well and would go back to this dealership again and recommend this dealership to my friends.    ",5.0

I have been to other dealerships in the past and I would say that this was the best experience that I've had purchasing a car. Everyone one was very friendly and the dealership was run like a finely tuned machine.

I would like to say again how much I liked working with Brian. He is the most knowledgeable sales associate that I've ever bought a car from. Most sales people are too lazy to really learn the products that they are selling. I talked with 3 sales people at various dealerships in the last month during the lead up to our purchase. None of them was half as knowledgeable about the features and specifications of the cars as Brian was. He is a real car enthusiast and it showed during our visit.

Previously, I had never taken a vehicle for service, anywhere, regularly, much less to a dealership, thinking it was unnecessary and the prices would be too high. Actions speak louder than words, and the consistently excellent service, customer focus, and friendliness of the employees at Boardwalk Volkswagen in Richardson has made a believer out of me. To give you an idea of where I am coming from on this, I am quite stingy with my family's money, and the higher the price I am paying for something, the more picky and demanding I can become. In this case, I have always been happy, 100 percent of the time. I have always felt they really value me as a customer, especially Tie, my service advisor, and they put their money where their mouth is by offering discounts on service, honoring those discounts even when I forgot my coupon, or in some cases making a repair for free if they felt it was an issue that should have been recalled by the manufacturer but wasn't. That final item, to me, is above and beyond the call of duty, and is something that obviously would not happen if I took my vehicle to a mechanic who was not also a VW dealer. -MHamtil, Dallas, TX ",4.8

I will probably buy a VW for my wife's new car when its time just because of Brian and Boardwalk. I also received emails from both the sales manager, and general manager of the dealership after I bought the car thanking me for my purchase.

644,"April 02, 2012","I have to tell you, I have never felt more comfortable about a car purchase - I usually drive away feeling as if I was taken advantage of - But that is not the case this time - Your folks did a wonderful job of talking with me about the car, how it is priced, why it is priced that way, and then they gave me an opportunity to explain what I was offering to pay and why I felt that was a fair price - Through this process, we came to a price that both of us were happy with - It was an honest and enjoyable and comfortable process - I am very satisfied with the result.

By the way, if it were not for Brian's persistency, I would have never purchased this vehicle - He initially contacted me and then left me alone for a bit - Then he followed up again and it is good he did because I had taken this car off of my list of cars I was interested in - He followed up with me, reminded me that this car had just about everything I wanted and arranged for my daughter to test drive it for me - I live in Tulsa - Also, Brian was not afraid to let me have an Auto Critic guy come and check the car out before I bought it, as this is my normal practice when buying a used car.

Finally, Michael was awesome on the finance side - I was borrowing money from my Credit Union in Tulsa and they were having phone troubles that day - Michael was very patient and understanding and he made it all very easy for us - I know he had to do some special things to work through our Credit Union's phone problems as well as having to do part of the paperwork with me and then wait for my wife to come in later to sign her parts - As it turned out, it took several days before our Credit Union actually faxed the draft details to him and he was very accomodating - It is very nice to work with people who are trustworthy and also trust me in return - Again, I have never felt more comfortable doing a car deal (and my father was a car salesman so I grew up around a dealership).

I appreciate all of you and am completely happy with the car, the deal, and the process - Thank you!  Jim Virtue

Jeremy and Rick were both very helpful and down to earth, and I knew after just a few minutes of speaking to them face to face that I was going to have a great experience. I was able to buy my car just $200 over invoice, and Jeremy Heuss even added a few minor things that were not included in the package that just made me seal the deal.

679,"March 20, 2012","The Volkswagen:
After a few months of test driving every sedan known to man,  I settled on the Jetta -  Not just any Jetta,  but the GLI.  I needed a family sedan I could also feel comfortable taking high level executives around in from time to time.  What I wanted personally was something fun to drive,  and the GLI does that,  in style.  The 2.0 Turbo taken from it's GTI brethren loses no amount of enjoyment in a Sedan.  The aesthetics inside and out are extremely pleasing, with all the usual well thought out German gadgetry.  I went for the AutoBahn edition because of one thing:  The Fender sound system.  I have heard upscale stock radios before, but this thing was simply stunning.  Of course,  the stylish rims and leather were a bonus as well.

The Dealership:  
There were currently just 70 Standard GLI AutoBahns in the nation for sale.  The one I found at a closer to home VW dealership was traded to Boardwalk before I was ready to buy.  Bottom line: They had the rare car I was looking for and did not make me overpay to get it even given that I had chased after it from another dealership.  All of the ancillary people I met were extremely polite and helpful.  The dealership was spotless and there were plenty of amenities. 

The Salesman:
Mark Sayers was very easy to work with from the minute he took my phone call.  I could tell he had years of experience behind him and utilized that to make the whole process easy and streamlined.  The price was easily negotiated and, after having done months of research on these cars,  I was happy.    On a very rainy day,  Mark found a dry service garage to swap my belongings out of the trade. When I came back to drop off some missing paperwork a few days later, Mark had a detail guy take out a small scratch I put in while cleaning it. 

The Paperwork:
Jason, the ""finance guy"",  was extremely polite, conversational,  and expeditious.  While he quickly worked through the mountains of paperwork that are the less than fun moments of car buying,  we talked about similar interests and life in general, making the times go by much easier.  In a 2010 car purchase, the finance guy was extremely high pressure on extended warranties,  effectively souring the whole experience for me.  With Jason,  there was no pressure.  I think he sensed my apprehension.
  
The Experience:
I was in and out of the dealership in about 2 hours.  I consider that a win given I had not had but one small phone conversation with Mark 30 minutes prior, had a trade, and needed to do all the finance work.

The Reward:
Boardwalk will certainly earn my business again this year when I trade my wife's car for a Volkswagen.",5.0

691,"March 12, 2012","I live in Oklahoma City and was looking for a car that is hard to find.  My local dealers simply didn't stock what I was looking for. I checked around the region with dealerships in Dallas, Kansas City, even as far as Albuquerque, and finding anyone with this particular car was difficult.

I made contact with Michael Trammell from an initial internet inquiry.  He called me to confirm exactly what I was looking for and told me he would be on the lookout if one came into his dealership, Boardwalk Volkswagen in Richardson, TX. After about a week or two, Michael called to tell me that the dealership had just received the exact car, trim line and color that I was looking for.  

I arranged to drive down to Dallas on a Saturday morning and test drive the car.  The test drive went great and I loved the car.  We hammered out the details fairly quickly, including the terms on my trade-in.  I felt the offer he made on the new car and the trade were very fair.  Michael introduced me to Jason in the Finance Department and we had the financing done and paperwork signed in well under an hour.

Overall, I'm very pleased with the service I received and would strongly recommend Boardwalk Volkswagen.  Michael did a great job, as did everyone else at the dealership.  9.5 stars out of 10!",5.0
692,"March 12, 2012","As a long-time Honda customer, I was concerned about buying a product with a different nameplate.  The Passat seemed to be a better choice for our current needs so we visited Boardwalk VW.  We were greeted quickly but not ""smothered"".  Josef was polite and very informed about the details of the Passat and several other models about which we inquired.  He followed up with information that was both helpful and informative, not just another review from some magazine.
Josef understood my decision process and waited for me to get comfortable with the buying decision.  On a day when he was out, my call was returned by Jason Villa who also helped immensely.  Throughout the entire process I felt that the staff at Boardwalk, even those in the transactional end (sales) cared that I was happy with the purchase decision and that I would be a Boardwalk customer after the sale as well.
A special note about Josef:  he is comfortable to work with -- focused but not pushy.  He is someone that when I had a question, I enjoyed calling as he seemed pleased to help.  Probably the best salesman with whom I have dealt in thirty years of car buying.",5.0

Basically, the customers needs to accept the fact that, the dealership will make money regardless, but for you to get a better deal that you are comfortable with and to have a great shopping experience, just go to Gary.

Kim and Gary both were great to work with. Kim made sure my mom's car got the service it needed versus service the dealer would like to sell me. And when I mentioned that I'd like to test drive a GTI, he connected me with Gary. In turn, Gary was not pushy about the sale or about selling me more car than I needed.

Even though there were no turbos to test drive, we did drive a non-turbo just to see how it handled.  As time went on while we waited for my car to get in, Michael always kept us informed of the status and reason for the delays.  He and Boardwalk went above and beyond normal efforts in trying to find a way to get us the car we wanted when the sun roof became an issue for Volkswagen's production, and even ordered us a car without the sun roof for after-market installation in order to get the car to us faster.  He did not stop at this solution and finally found the car we wanted listed on another dealer's manifest and made a trade to get it for us.  It took 4 months from the time we originally ordered the car, but Michael and his team at Boardwalk never stopped doing everything in their power to get the car as fast as possible and kept us informed at every turn.

We agreed it would be best to bring the car back early the next morning, and Bob assigned me to Terry Granger, saying he would make sure Terry had the whole story.  Their connection was great, so that I didn't have to repeat the explanation the next day. I got a ride to work, which turned out to take a long time, in the rain with morning traffic, but the driver (Frank? sorry I'm not sure of his name) was very pleasant and drove carefully. Terry updated me by phone when part of the assessment was done, and then again when it was all done.   It was important to me that when I decided not to have one non-essential part fixed, there was no pressure.  I questioned another, and Terry put it in short, plain terms that the inspection would not pass without it. He got me a 10% discount for one of the items. The car was ready to go after work, so I didn't have to wait after I arrived.  It was shiny and clean.  Bob came to make sure I got an clearer explanation about the reason one of the parts had broken. I haven't had to take the car back for inadequate repairs since then.

That's when Bob King and Nikki Cloud stepped in to help me understand my warranties (Yes, I have two!) and what was covered. You see, I got all this information when I purchased the car, and didn't pay much attention to it until I needed it. That's what consumers do: They depend on their reputable car deailership, the place where they purchased their car, to inform them of what's needed and what's covered by warranty. Bob and Nikki did that with professionalism and grace. They deserve raises as far as I'm concerned. It was the first time (This was December 2011) that I visited Boardwalk's service department and did not feel like I was going to get stuck with a huge repair bill. As a matter of fact, it was the first time my warranties were even mentioned.

I had an emergency last year in trying to get my daughter's car inspected before she left for college the next day, that we purchased used from a car dealership in 2010.  After going to 5 different places trying to get it inspected, I finally called a VW dealership, and it just so happened to be Boardwalk Volkswagen, and Tayari Johnson saved the day!  I explained my issue, she asked me a couple of questions, and she told me to come over at 400 that afternoon and she would get my car in the shop and find out what was wrong and why it would not inspect.  She also had an idea of what the problem was, before the mechanic looked at it, and she was right.  The previous owner took out the original radio and replaced with a non manufactor radio, and they spliced it into the K wire for the OBD reader.  Your mechanic, Josh, was able to correct the problem and the car was succesfully inspected, and they had me in and out of the dealership within about 2 hours.  I was so pleased with the customer service and the determination to fix the issue.  Tayari also offered me a small coupon discount, because I was expecting to only have to pay 40.00 for an inspection, and it cost me over 150.00 for the inspection.  They also did a 27 car inspection and car wash for me for free, which I was very surprised.

I called around 5:00 pm and spoke with Donovan Guillory.  He answered many questions about the truck and actually walked out on the lot to verify the truck was still there before I made the trip to Dallas.  At 12:30 the next day, I was at Boardwalk talking to Donovan about the truck.  He had done his homework and I was impressed that a Volkswagen dealer knew so much about a Chevrolet pickup.  After I decided to purchase the truck, the process was smooth, quick and efficient.  Since this was an internet purchase, the only negotiation was my trade in which I believe was a fair deal.

824,"December 24, 2011","I recently had an electrical problem with my 2004 Tourareg and had to have it towed in to Boardwalk Volkswagen on a Sunday afternoon. I left a note for Billy Cooper my service adviser for the last 10 years or so. Billy called me on Monday morning and confirmed that he had the vehicle and that he would call me as soon as he knew what was wrong with it. In about an hour he called back and told me it was a dead battery and gave me the bad news about the cost of replacing it. He also told me that I had gone over four years since the battery was last replaced. I also had asked Billy to do an oil change while the car was there and he confirmed the price of that service. While I was on the phone he reminded me that I had not had a radiator flush since I owned the car and I was overdue for that service. He added up the total service bill and gave me the total. I asked if any of the service specials that I had seen lately would apply to my service and he assured me that he would research it and apply all of them that were still in effect. I asked when the car would be ready and he said it would be out by 4:30. Since I had no appointment and it was a Monday I was delighted.
When I picked the car up it was promptly delivered to me sparkling clean. The bill was less than Billy quoted and I saw where some discounts had been applied.
Billy Cooper is a special person who is totally customer focused. He provides honest and straightforward information and establishes complete trust with the customer. Because of his attention to my cars after the sale I will continue to be a Boardwalk customer. I currently own two Touraregs and have previously owned two Passats.",5.0

My initial and lasting impression of the dealership is that it is spotless (including restrooms and refreshment counters,)  and very ""customer friendly"". There are no looming showroom manager towers or one-way glassed offices. There are no clusters of idle salespeople standing around looking confrontational. When I was introduced to Mark Sayers, I had a good feeling about how my time spent at this dealership was going to go. Mr. Sayers was friendly, well-informed about the product and he was very efficient...staying on-task with paperwork and details while answering our questions.

832,"December 20, 2011","I first met Gary when I purchased my first Jetta. Gary was the first dealer at Boardwalk to stop and say hello and offering his help. Most dealers seem to look at a person's attire, hue and even other aesthetic characteristics like gender, race and credit score, but not Gary. I was so impressed because I am disabled and Gary did not show any difference with me. He was kind, offered me something to drink and even made sure I was comfortable. Gary listened to my concerns and then went about trying to find the care I wanted. I left Boardwalk two hours later in a new Toffee Jetta 2.5. 

Second time around I was upset and spoke to someone in service about my bad experiences with my car. It had been serviced on more than seven occasions and two of the problems having to do with my safety. The night before I picked up my grand kids and we were on our way home, then suddenly a car jump in front of me and was coming over on me and I went to honk my horn and it would not work. I was very frightened and nervous afterward. The next morning I called service and let them know what happened. They gave me an early appointment and me and my daughter drove my car in to be serviced. After the car was repaired I began to think about the Lemon Law and went into the dealership to ask questions, which my daughter handled. After being there for about twenty minutes Gary walked by and recognized me and asked why I was there. I told him I felt very uncomfortable and unsafe in my car because of several repairs and the engine failing while I was driving. Gary immediately went in to talk with the manager and came out to make sure I was comfortable, offered me something to drink and even a snack if I was hungry. After a few hours I was told to go and look at my new car, which was the same color (yay!!!)inside and out as my other car. Gary told me to look the car over and make sure it's the same car etc...  I drove away with my daughter with all smiles and feeling better concerning my safety and the safety of my grandchildren. 

Here's the kicker! It was not until two days later that I began noticing the car's interior seemed a bit different, the seats were and I began thinking I had another car. Once again Gary had made me very happy! The car was a 2012 Jetta! I called Gary and told him I finally noticed the differences and he laughed and told me he was happy that I finally noticed the surprise and he would always be there to help me. He further told me to call him if anything concerned me no matter what it was.

When you have what my wife and I consider to be a car that has more problems than we expect a Volkswagen to have, it tends to color your perception of the customer service experience in a slightly negative way even before you bring the car for service. The problems always seem to be eventually repaired and the car gets back to running fine, so I guess all is well that ends well.

Everyone we have come in contact with at the dealership has been extremely courteous and friendly. Even when we have had serious issues resulting in our meeting with Service Manager, Jason Lederer, he was attentive to our concerns and addressed our needs in a completely satisfactory manner. 

Baseed on the above, it is easy to see that a good rating is all that I can give for Overall Experience. When things break in the car that you don't think should break and you have to pay for them, then it becomes hard to think your getting a great price.  ",4.2

854,"December 03, 2011","I purchased a 2002 New Beetle in 2004 from a private dealer, and started using Boardwalk Volkswagen Richardson for servicing my ""new"" (to me!) vehicle. I chose the dealership only because of the convenience of the location but soon discovered how lucky I was. The service team is absolutely wonderful, always attentive and patient. They treat their customers with respect and if I could give them a higher rating than 5, I would. I especially have to give kudos to Billy Cooper who is usually there on Saturdays when I visit and has always been so very helpful.

Whenever I would bring my New Beetle in for service, I stayed far away from the Sales area, because of bad experiences with other dealers. That was remedied after meeting Gary Blakely. After 8 years of driving my New Beetle, it was finally time to get another vehicle. Jeff Fagan pointed me in Mr. Blakely's direction. Gary was polite, funny and so kind to me. He listened to what I had to say, and let me drive a 2012 Beetle for the day to help my transportation issues since my old car was not drive-able. After much consideration, I have leased a 2012 Jetta, and could not be more pleased. Gary asked me to stop by to say hi the next time I'm visiting, and I get the feeling he's not just saying that - he really means it.
At each step, every employee I encountered asked how I was doing, and if I needed anything. Jeff Fagan was especially kind and wanted to make sure I had a good experience.

872,"November 24, 2011","We had a great experience with Gary; he was very patience with my husband and I, we asked about different cars, Passat, Jetta, new bettle.
We did have the opportunity to test drive the cars. I wanted a Jetta, but after seeing the New Bettle, so cute & fun, I couldn't resist. The new ug has a new feeling; my husband thinks it is very sporty and I agree.
Gary was able to locate exactly the car that we wanted with the features that we wanted. So pretty much we bought exactly what we wanted because Gary was able to get it for us.
Love the car.
We will always go back looking for Gary on Sales; Mr Billy Copper for Service and also Mr Brandon.
This dealer has an excellent team.

873,"November 23, 2011","I contacted Mr. Hatley on a Wednesday and asked him for availability of a Jetta Sportwagen S Manual suitable for the lease deal advertised by VW North America. He did not have one in stock, but we made an appointment to discuss ordering one.  He called me back within 24 hours having found a vehicle that was exactly what I wanted. I went to the appointment and told him I had changed my mind and now needed an automatic. He was very responsive. He located another vehicle that fit my needs almost immediately, and ran the negotiations for the lease price expertly and efficiently. They agreed to my offer, and I went in the next day and picked up my car. Total time in dealership - about an hour and a half.  Very fast, excellent service, amazing car.  I am very impressed with Boardwalk, their management and with Mr. Hatley, a gentleman and scholar. I recommend him to others. Doug Eckel",5.0

Techs who service the car are not as careful cleaning up (thorough wipe down of minor spills/drips) after performing the work as I would prefer. Nice touch is the courtesy car wash provided. The service hours meet my needs well.  The waiting area is very comfortable, WiFi capable, television and well stocked with snacks and beverages.

Brian made a usually painful task enjoyable.  I will recommend him and Boardwalk VW to all my friends and family and already have.

Brian has gone above what most sales people do and even once the deal was done he still stayed with me till I drove off.  

I never once felt I was being sold and that to me is a great sales person.

878,"November 22, 2011","We all know Volkswagen is stellar in customer service. My last visit was no exception. I did not make an appointment - took advantage of the quick service offer. I own a 2009 CC (bought it in '08, which makes me among the 'first' to own the sleakest ride in the nation!). So on this visit, I arrived at 3:00pm and needed a headlight replaced, oil change, and inspection. I also had a prescheduled 5:00pm important appointment. When Jeff Fagan offered to assist me, I informed him of all this and asked if I should return on another day (there were several cars ahead of me). But he promised to take care of me. He did just that! Instead of my having to worry and wonder, Jeff not only took the time and visited with me twice in regards to the progress, but he also checked on my warranty coverage. So not only was the process handled in a superbly expeditious fashion, but I arrived at my 5:00pm appointment turning heads (my vehicle was spotless!) with 15 minutes to spare!

882,"November 19, 2011","My first connection with Michael was on the phone.  I called about whether they had the new Passat diesel available to test drive yet.  Michael's positive attitude and exhuberance came through the phone as he assured me they had one here and that I could come out anytime and he would be glad to help me.  I made sure to jot down his name and ask for him when I went out to see the car.  When I arrived, I asked for him and he was prompt in coming out immediately to see me.  Another salesman had the car out on a test drive so we chatted about the car and it's details while we waited.
Once we were in the car, Michael methodically went over each feature detail by detail.  It was very impressive as to the degree of his knowledge of the car.  That first visit sold me on the car along with Michael's help.  I brought my wife out to see and test drive the car within a few days.  She was very impressed with the car and with Michael.  We decided on that visit to pre-order the car with exactly what we wanted on it.  Michael helped us through that process quickly and easily.  That was on August 6, 2011.  Michael told us it would take 60-90 days for our car to arrive.  Each time I called out to talk to him about how soon the car might arrive, he went out of his way to check on the progress and let me know either while I was on the phone or by return call what to expect.  Never did I feel like I was bothering him or keeping him from other business during our conversations.  He made me feel as though I was his only customer in the world.  When the big day arrived, he was as excited as we were.  He had the car processed and detailed, all the paper work taken care of, and had put the car inside one of the showroom areas overnight.  When I got there, the car was inside and ready for us to go over some more details.  We took it on a short test drive for him to point out some features I may have forgotten.  The closing was fast and simple, the dealership allowing me to charge a portion and write a personal check for the balance.  Wonderful.  I brought the car back two days later to have the ceramic tint installed that Michael told me about.  Again, he was there to talk more about the car and help out with a loaner while it was being serviced.  I look forward to seeing Michael frequently in the future whenever I visit your dealership.  His profession courtesy and knowledge warrants him the highest marks on any scale of service.  The dealership should be extremely proud to have Michael on their team

They were/are: Beetle (Gary let me drive it home to see if it would fit in my garage, as i have a 1950s house with a one car garage.  Enjoyed the ride so much that I called&amp;said it was mine when I returned in about 40 min.

Next was a Jetta (comfy but not enough rear view vision over the long haul!! 

Went back and, as before, asked for Gary but he was away that Sat. . . .so i called midweek for the following Sat.
He is so gracious, cheerful &amp; great about answering questions that a Rabbit was mine with no hassel paperwork.

The following year my nephew was visiting from Univ of Alabama; needing a car, so I called Gary who said he'd look for a solid, decent mileage car if he could have two days max (nephew leaving shortly).  Found 3 yr old Jetta &amp; it is still doing fine in CA today!!

My office was really amused when I said it was time for a change again!! Went. back and on Monday I came in with a Rabbit . . .due to Gary's salesmanship,personality, &amp;the fact that he makes each cutomer feel that they are getting his full attention and is doing the best to get a fair deal . . .(including coffee, drinks, and Beetle choice of flowers . .until no longer offered).

2009 was last purchase, and he just laughed when I called to see if he would be working that Saturday so that i could support his retirement fund by looking at a New Beetle!

Gary cannot even SPELL high pressure. . . .a real positive over all these years.  He is quiet with a fun sense of humor and somehow manages to think one step ahead of what a customer will be asking!!

903,"November 07, 2011","I didn't schedule an appointment to have an oil change but I definitely waited a long time before anybody came to me; about 2 minutes or more.  And I saw several service reps and only one of them was on the phone while the others were in front of their computers.  The gentleman who greeted me went to one of the service reps and the service rep came over to the vehicle.  He didn't share his name with me but said that he was busy doing something on the computer.  I told him that I just needed an oil change and I would stay while it was being service.  
I appreciated the time it took to complete the task plus wash and vacuum the car.  But I was disappointed in the service rep.  After the car was service he didn't personally come over to me or anything.  He gave the paperwork to the cashier and walked back....wow.
I actually wanted to talk to him about the car.  Since I had over 80,000 miles, I thought he might share with me some needed serviceable items in the near future.  He missed an opportunity.  Despite the fact, he didn't go over with me what was done.  Yes, it was a routine oil change but the mechanics may have put something in the notes after changing the oil.  Basically, I felt ignored. 
Lastly, the cashier did have something bring up the car so I wouldn't have to go over to it... I appreciated that small gesture.

The most frustrating thing about my 2006 Passat is the Cost of Ownership.  The engineering, in my opinion, was poor.  For example, the price to fix a bad sensor for my electronic parking brake was $350.  For my recent visit, to fix a bad temperture sensor was $600 - almost all of this was labor.  I am very disappointed in the German engineering that went into this vehicle.  Even simple things like the interior have worn much faster than expected - material is peeling off of the interior door handles and the center console knobs have paint flaking off.  While the car drives really well, the attention to details by the German engineers was extremely poor - they did not design the car with service in mind.",4.2

Will Fail, my Sales Consultant, demonstrated a true interest in my needs, my financing preference, as well as the realistic parameters for my next car purchase.  His customer communication skills are to be commended!

Additionally, Will's quality customer-focused approach, combined with a no-pressure salesman attitude, convinced me that I was at the right dealership and I was selecting a quality vehicle.

After my car selection, it was a seamless transition to Patrick Carroll, the Finance Manager, to finalize my paperwork.  Patrick made me feel quite at ease and completed the required documentation in a timely manner.

Overall, I felt that I had landed in the hands of two big brothers--although I'm certain that I'm older than both of these great VW employees!

I was very disappointed with Edward Denice - Sales Manager, not willing to help, very arrogant and inappropriate. On the other hand, Patrick Carroll - Financial Consultant bent over backwards to help me, but his hands were TIED. I'm taking my business after 11 years of loyalty to VW  to another dealership that is willing and able to help me. 
I have placed a call into the GM, as he needs to be informed about Mr. Denice's behavior.

My service rep, Jeff Mauldin, originally recommended that we put a dye refrigerant in and come back in a month or so and see whare it was leaking.  That visit cost me about $350.  I brought the vehicle back in a second time and this time Jeff said that the tech had looked at the log in the on-board computer and found that the condesation unit's fan was cutting off when at idle and that this was caused by a bad battery.  So, they replaced the battery (at a cost of almost $400) and sent me on my way.  When I asked why they had not diagnosed the problem correctly on my first visit, I got immediate respones indicating that they would make it right.  When I brought the vehicle back in to have a part installed that I had ordered, I reported that the A/C problem had occurred again.  This time they kept the vehicle 2 days but were unable to reproduce the problem.  I told them that I would continue to drive the vehicle until the A/C stayed broke.  When I when to check out, I found that Jeff had comp'ed the price of the part that I had ordered ($130) and the entire amount of this visit's service as well as putting a $170 credit on my account.

Donovan took his time showing me around and never complained about the extra time he had to put in after the actual transaction was completed. I would recommend Donovan to my friends and family.
I was not to impressed by Jason the sales person. He was not professional at all times especially when I called my friend to makes sure all the financial regulations did not have a catch. He responded quite rude to additional questions I had and he tried to rush me into a purchase. He did not want to grant me the extra time. He recovered the next day and it went quite smoothly. He was quite knowledgable but he does not take enough time to guide you through the contract and explain matters accordingly.",4.4
943,"October 20, 2011","   Since moving to Richardson 7 years ago, we have been to Boardwalk for ALL of our service needs.  I own a Chevrolet while my wife owns a VW.  I have to admit that when we come to Boardwalk I feel absolutely comfortable that my wife's car is taken care of and that all service recommended is reasonable.  Unfortunately I do not feel the same when I take my vehicle to the Chevy Dealership.  Believe me wife does not let me forget it.  But I have to admit, Boardwalk is simply better.  

The work is done in a timely fashion.  The staff tells us what to expect, we have had no unpleasant surprises.  One of the reasons we feel so confident in the service we receive is the people.  For example Tie Johnson is, ""Da Bomb.""  Like the rest of the staff, she has a smile on her face, when/if you meet her you will find that she is engaged and knowledgeable.  When you meet people who care they stand out.  I am thankful that we have Tie to call upon.  

Tie is not alone, she is supported by Service Director Jason Lederer.  I was so impressed with Tie, I felt compelled to share our experience with Jason.  I think the fact that Jason recognizes that Tie is an asset speaks volumes about him and the organization.

As long as we keep getting this level of service Boardwalk has our business.

With the amount of miles I drive on a weekly basis, I was looking for somehting that wouldn't take me to the poor house. I ended up with a 2012 Jetta TDI. Yes, the payment did go up, but I will save more than the increase in payment in fuel costs so it is a win, win situation. I absolutely love my new Jetta. This is now the second Jetta that I have bought from Boardwalk, and I recommend Jason and Brian to everyone I know.",5.0

Park Cities Volkswagen continued to tell me that it was the weather when the alert had triggered every weekend for four weeks,  Park Cities service department told me there was nothing in the tires even though the alert would go off regularly on the same interval.  Finally when the Park Cities service representative told me that they could take the tires off and submerge them in water if I were willing to pay $150, I decided to go back to the great guys at Boardwalk in Richardson despite the distance from my home, and I am glad I did.  The Park Cities person told me that if it were her she would just go to Tire Discounters across the street.  She didn't even bother to check the computer to see that I had extended tire protection, which Billy did tell me when he and his crew spotted a huge construction nail in one tire in a location that couldn't be mended and a smaller nail in another tire that could be repaired.  

I will continue to have my New Beetle Convertible serviced a Boardwalk, and if I decide to lease another VW in 2013 it will be from Boardwalk NOT Park Cities. 

Interestingly but not surprisingly, I have had several encounters with Park Cities but have never been asked for feedback after the service. Sorry this review was so much about them, but I'll close by saying that the dissatisfaction I had with Park Cities was displaced by the satisfaction from working with Billy Cooper and his crew.

1103,"August 21, 2011","Awesome Experience - Excellent Prices on Great Used Cars !!!!!!!!!

I was in the market for a used car and came to Boardwalk Volkswagen because they had an excellent price for the vehicle I was looking for (a used toyota corolla). This dealership had very competative pricing on its used vehicles compared to other dealerships in the Dallas Ft. Worth metroplex, so I didn't mind driving to Richardson to give it a try. I was prepared for any sales experience to find the right car but after visting several other dealerships, I was unexpectedly suprised by the wonderful treatment I received at Boardwalk.

 Just 15 minutes before I arrived at the dealership on a Saturday afternoon, I called ahead to make sure the car I was interested in was still there. When I called I didnt have to wait on hold to finally get to a sales person who didn't know anything about the the car I was interested in, instead I was connected directly to a someone who knew everything about the car right then. 

When I arrived at the dealership 15 minutes later, Andy Ketch, sales consultant, had the car ready for me to test drive with the air conditioning already on (it was over 100 degrees that day). After visting many other dealerships in the heat, he was the only salesperson that didn't make me test drive a car that felt like it was 200 degrees inside the vehicle. This was greatly appreciated.

   The salesmen at this dealership, particularly Andy, are experienced and work hard on the details to make your experience great. The dealership sales approach was not rough, pushy, or egotistical.Unlike other dealerships where pushy people are trying to sell you something that they dont even know much about in 100 degree heat.  Andy was great during the purchase negotiations, and did not forget to make sure I was still comfortable with something to drink, even helping me charge my cell phone so I could talk to my husband. He remebered the details and did not rush me into my decision to purchase the vehicle. 

The excellent sales experience along with an excellent price on the car (which was a beautifully clean and shiny used car with a 1 owner car fax) made it easy for me to feel comfortable to make the decision to buy the car. I would definately visit this dealership again either for a used vehicle or for a new VW, and look forward to doing business with them and sales consultant Andy Ketch again. Thanks Boardwalk!!!",5.0

I spoke with Josef Puhringer who exhibited a 'can do' attitude from the very beginning.  I preferred to speak with him in person to gather information and told him about the car that I wanted.  I came from the far side of the metroplex and was not able to get to the dealer until nearly closing time.  He identified the vehicle from their inventory and had it available upon my arrival.  After demonstrating that we could make the purchase that evening, we went forward to make that car mine.  I got a deal I am very happy with and Josef Puhringer, the sales manager, and the finance manager all stayed well past closing to put me in the car.  Even with the late hours, they did not cut any corners on courtesy.  This was an overall great experience, thanks to their efforts.

I have owned innumerable VW's in the past and this was my third Jetta.  I will continue to purchase VWs and will revisit Boardwalk Volkswagen when the time comes again.

I purchased my last Jetta from Boardwalk and kept it for nearly 10 years, always having it serviced with their service department. When it came time to purchase my new VW, the CC in question there was no question about where to go in order to get the best experience possible. Boardwalk Richardson.

Quite frankly for location convenience and trying to stay in the family, I had my first two warranty service visits done with another VW dealer closer to home.  

For this visit, I stopped by the Boardwalk Richardson service department on my way home, after having my battery drained due to the extreme heat we've been having. Unannounced and unscheduled by the way and 30min from closing. I was promptly attended by the service advisor who was extremely helpful in finding me a loaner vehicle (instead of having to drop the car off the next morning) and took my car in for service the next day. In 15minutes I was on my way home.

The service crew not only resolved the battery issue, performed the 30K mile revision work, and state inspection, but was able to resolve a radio issue that was unresolved for months. 

Boardwalk VW of Richardson Service Advisors, Cashiers, and Technicians are 5 Star material.

One cannot work on the battery yourself it is a special design only a dealer can properly handle. 
We were in a bit of panic worried about towing and labor we could not handle at the moment. Even the battery itself was $110. Boardwalk looked up my warranty info and provided a towing service to come and get the car and loaded it up with the utmost care and concern. They also came and picked me up with a shuttle and took me to pick the car up. Service was done, and they had cleaned the car also performing a points service check for free. The battery system was replaced and they even managed to have the time on the clock and our radio stations still programmed. The CD exchange mechanism had also stopped working and they ordered a new replacement radio as well. Simply amazing service. Despite having lost money on a tire replacement contract 3rd party that went bankrupt and kept our money, no blame was on the part of Boardwalk and their continued courteous and thoughtful service will assure we do our utmost to buy another car from them in the future.

(FIRST SHOWROOM VISITED - SINCE THE RATING WAS VERY HIGH, I THOUGHT I WOULD HAVE A BETTER DEAL AND BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE) I BROWSED THE WEBSITE BEFORE GOING TO THE SHOWROOM, I PICKED THE MODEL AND THE FEATURES AND SHORTLISTED THE VEHICLE. THE VEHICLE WAS PARKED IN THE PARKING LOT AND OBVIIOUSLY IT WAS LOCKED. I LOOKED AT THE COLOR AND THE EXTERIOR IN THE SUNLIGHT - WHICH MADE PERFECT SENSE., THEN MADE MY WAY TO THE SHOWROOM (APPROX AROUND 2:20 P.M.) TO INSPECT THE INTERIOR FEATURES OF THE VEHICLE. I WAS IN THE SHOWROOM TILL 2:45 P.M. CT. I DID NOT BELIEVE MYSELF THAT I WAS NOT GREETED BY ANYBODY INSIDE THE SHOWROOM DURING MY PRESENCE (THERE WERE APPROX 7 TO 8 EMPLOYEES) NOR I WAS OFFERED ANY HELP. VERY BAD EXPERIENCE. NOT TO MENTION THAT THERE WERE NO OTHER CUSTOMERS IN THE SHOWROOM LOBBY. ALL THE EMPLOYEES WERE IN THEIR OFFICES WORKING ON SYSTEMS. I STARTED LOOKING AT THE ROUTAN INTERIOR (WHITE - SE MODEL PARKED INSIDE THE SHOWROOM). I INSPECTED THE VEHICLE INSIDE THE SHOWROOM FOR ATLEAST 25 MINUTES. IT WAS REALLY UNBELIEVABLE THAT NOT EVEN ONE EMPLOYEE ACKNOWLEDGED MY VISIT. I HAD QUESTIONS TO DISCUSS. BUT NO HELP FROM THE STAFF - VERY VERY DISAPPOINTING. I HOPE THE APPROACH CHANGES GOING FORWARD. I WENT TO OTHER VW SHOWROOM AND FINALLY PURCHASED MY ROUTAN ON JULY 11TH. I WAS RECEIVED, ACKNOWLEDGED AND THEY WORKED WITH ME TILL 10 P.M. TO OFFER THE BEST DEAL AND CLOSE THE SALE. I GOT WHAT EXACTLY I WANT. I HOPE THE MANAGEMENT AT BOARDWALK VW RICHARDSON WILL LOOK INTO THIS AND CHANGE THEMSELVES IN THEIR APPROACH.",1.0

My experience at Boardwalk Volkswagen was far superior to the horror stories I had been told. From the moment I stepped foot on the property, I was treated with the utmost respect from everyone at Boardwalk Volkswagen.

I came in to Boardwalk Volkswagen with the mentality that I was only looking for which car to purchase - but I informed Josef that I was probably 3-4 months from purchasing a vehicle. Josef respected me saying this and did not push me, but the information and knowledge he provided on the Jetta TDI brought me to purchase the vehicle that day.

The website eliminates the idea of going in and feeling the pressure of car shopping, however Josef made this experience a memorable one as it was not your typical car buying experience which was the reason my husband dreads purchasing cars.  There were no tips and tricks with this experience and I would for sure send my closest and best friends to see him.  He was very knowledgable with the 2010 Jetta model and knew the ethics of his job.

I was approached by Josef Puhringer and he was very helpful and engaging.  He walked me through the new 2011 Jetta TDI features and we discussed the current inventory (only 1 in stock) and the next batch arriving the following week.  I would have been satisfied to wait but I wanted to take a look at the CC.

Josef took me for a test drive in a 2012 R-Line CC and I loved the features and performance.  We then started looking at options to buy a CC as VW is running the 0% interest special.  We test drove the CC I would eventually buy and worked out the numbers.  

Once I got to finance, it was about 10 minutes with Patrick and I was the proud owner of a new CC.

The whole process took about 5 hours from walking in the door and driving off.  I made the process longer because I was not planning to drive off in a new car that day and was unsure if I wanted to buy that day.  Josef was very patient with me and clearly discussed my options.  I am very satisfied with his service and sales style.  It was not pressure based or overbearing as I have experienced in other dealerships in the past.

I returned on 5/21 to finish the ""delivery"" with Josef as I ran out of time on the 19th.  He walked me through all the features of the vehicle that were new to me compared to my 2006 Jetta.  He also helped me with the parts department to try and located an MDI connector that might work with my iPhone in a bumper case.

Overall, this was a very pleasurable buying experience.  I did not feel hassled and I would gladly recommend Boardwalk VW Richardson and Josef Puhringer to my friends looking to buy a new car.

1192,"May 11, 2011","I first visited Boardwalk VW in November 2010 because I knew I would be in the market for a new car in the summer of 2011 and I wanted to get a head start on my research. I told my salesman, Mark Sayers, about my intentions, and he still treated me with kindness, humor, and generosity knowing that I wasn't going to be serious about buying until months later. That stuck with me. In fact, even though I did more online and magazine research about different makes and models across the board (not just VW), I still remembered the test drive I took back then and the pleasurable experience I had. When I saw in May 2011 that VW was having a national sales incentive on the same model I test drove earlier, I contacted Mark who remembered me and acted like the past several months hadn't passed. Having a lot of retail sales experience myself, I was very impressed with this because any and all salesmen see hundreds of people every month, and to remember one (especially after only dealing with them a few hours one night months ago) is a skill that few rarely achieve. Even though my credit rating was not perfect, we worked out a deal that was cheaper than what I was paying per month and saved me the hassle of turning in a leased car that I know would have incurred additional fees due to minor cosmetic damage. At that time, I was handed over to Jason Daniel in the Finance department to finalize the deal. Jason was more introverted than Mark but he REALLY knew his stuff. I asked him specific questions and he would either know the answer off the top of his head or looked the answer up right then and there. With the help of some down payment money, he was able to make a deal even better than what Mark offered me earlier! I should also mention that I didn't even see Jason until after the dealership closed at 8pm, but I never got the impression that either he or Mark were irritated or annoyed that we were all there that late. Again, customer service skills like these are rare to find, and I believe, based on my experience, that Boardwalk VW screens their employees to make sure that they are nothing but the best! :)",5.0

1195,"May 07, 2011","I just wanted to take a minute and let you know how grateful I am to each of you for the great service I received when buying my 2010 GTI yesterday. Harold is a tremendous salesman that really knows his products and he made my car buying experience outstanding. This is the second car I have bought from him and I will reach out to him again when it's time for my next new car.  Kai was very instrumental in helping me resolve a small issue I had with the new car. When I came back into the dealership at 7pm on Friday night instead of asking me to make a return trip to the dealership the following day he was able to work me in and made sure the issue was resolved that night before I left. Tia in the service department has to be the kindest most eager to serve adviser I have every met. She worked with one of your most knowledgeable mechanics Greg to insure the problem was fixed before returning the car to me. When they presented the car to me on the service drive Tia and Greg explained what the problem was in detail and what was done to correct it and I have to say it's employees like these that will keep me coming back to Boardwalk VW for many years to come. Again thanks to all of you for going above and beyond my expectations in helping resolve this issue and for the absolutely awesome customer service!!!

I didn't feel pressured whatsoever to do anything and the employees were extremely nice and sociable.

I've been to quite a few dealerships, not just to browse or buy, but for maintenance also, and I have to say, Boardwalk Volkswagen is the best in customer service that I've seen yet.

I cannot say enough good things about this dealership. 
We visited many other car dealerships and went to a lot of websites when we were looking for another car. 
This dealership just exemplifies GREAT customer service.
Their website is very complete, user friendly and well laid out. They have lots of pictures of the vehicles and a good description of the car's features.
Every call or e-mail was responded to quickly and completely.
Their showroom is clean and orderly.
Staff are polite and professionally dressed.
When we saw the car, it was exactly as described. Mark was just a pleasure to talk with and he patiently answered all of our questions.
Mike in Finance was very polite. He said he couldn't give us a lower APR, but I guess I have to believe him!
Over the years, as we have travelled with my job, I have purchased cars in OH, IL, IN, VA and now we live in OK.
There is no question that this is the BEST car buying experience I have ever had. 
So, why did we drive over 4 hours to see a Used Car? 
If you contact Mark Sayers at the Richardson VW dealership you will know why.

1208,"March 27, 2011","Before I visited Boardwalk Volkswagen in Richardson, I knew the model (CC),  transmission (manual), and color (White Gold) I wanted. This proved very difficult to find locally. At the time I was looking, there were only 6 in the entire United States, and none of these were close by. Josef Puhringer understood that I was not flexible on these requirements. Josef offered to look for this vehicle, and let me know when one was located in our area. During the next three months, Josef called me every 4 weeks, asking if I was still interested, and letting me know he was still looking. Josef found the trim level and color the day the car arrived at its port of entry. I was expecting a 2011 model (it was February 2011), but the car turned out to be a 2012. I asked Josef about differences between the 2011 and 2012 models, as there was no literature available yet for the 2012. When I stopped at Boardwalk to leave a deposit. Josef had the details on all differences between the 2011 and 2012 models. I had the car within the next week. This is our sixth Volkswagen. What I enjoyed about working with Josef is that he has extensive knowledge of Volkswagen’s products, past and present. He is a good listener, and very thorough in all his communications. I would say Josef the best car salesperson I have ever worked with. I would not hesitate to recommend him to others.

I was so excited to show the new VW to my children who all wanted me to give them a test ride.

It was an uphill battle for them because of my financial rating. I was apprehensive at first because I expected to be turned down. They used their good contacts to get me a competitive finance rate. They assured me that they would help me and treated me like a family member. They explored various finance scenarios, including a larger downpayment or a co signor.  In the end I got my car with only a very minimal downpayment and without a co-signor.  I am also on the road to restoring my credit rating.

1219,"March 13, 2011","Josef Puhringer was my sales associate and was great to work with.  I went into the dealership initially about 6 weeks ago looking at a new 2011 Tiguan.  Josef was extremely knowledgeable about the Tiguan and we went for a test drive that night.  I went in the following week and he let me take the car myself for a couple of hours.  I wasn't entirely ready to buy yet at that point because I still needed to sell my 2004 BMW 330i ZHP.  I was initially disappointed at the trade-in value offered, but it's only reality that a private-party sell would attract a higher sale price.  So after a ZHP enthusiast purchased the 330i, I was back into the VW dealership within just a few days.  Josef went to bat for me in regards to the down payment.  They were kind enough to allow me to split up my down payment. I put a portion down that night and they accommodated me by holding a 2nd check for a week until my tax refund came in.  But what I was most impressed with is the speed in which Josef located the exact vehicle I wanted and had it brought via trailer to the Boardwalk location.  I was set on a white exterior and charcoal interior; however the sandstone interior was the prevalent color I noticed everywhere.  I left Josef an voice message one morning and by the same evening he had the car on his lot, detailed and ready for me.  I drove it home the same night!  My experience with Josef and the everyone at Boardwalk was good and I'm looking forward to having my Tiguan serviced there regularly.  What service shop could beat hours until 10:00 PM?

Basically he helped me get the car I wanted without the stress that can come with buying a new car.  The price was good and the negotiation process direct and uncomplicated.  Josef is easy-going and is there to help you get what you want, not what he wants to sell you.

I visited Boardwalk and other Volkswagen dealers in the DFW metroplex in the run up to my purchase and found Josef to be the best of of the bunch - very straight forward and unforced. My purchase was not an overnight decision and I talked with Josef a number of times about what I was looking for.  He let me set the pace, was ready to answer all questions, and was just basically very responsive.

And I love the car - a lot of fun, while still being utilitarian, at a very good price.

I did not feel intimidated at all, being a woman trading in a car and buying another by myself at all.  I've had some places tell me ""go home and talk this over with your husband and then come back.""  That was never even implied.  He treated me as I would guess he would treat his own wife.  It was a great experience and I walked out with the exact car that I had been wanting.  They made me an offer, I told them what I wanted, and they came back accepting it.  The comment was ""this lady has done her homework"" as I knew the value of my trade-in car and the value of the car I was buying"".  They seemed to totally respect that.

I have had a couple volkswagens previous to the 2006 jetta I had recently purchased and I was looking to get another one. I chose Boardwalk because they were a site sponsor and helped out our website.

The First Employee I had Dealt with was Jason Villa (used car sales manager) Jason is a stand up guy who is one who will help you out in any way that he can. 

The next employee I had Dealt with was Michael Trammell. Michael is a easy going guy who is about customer satisfaction. He helped me out with buying the jetta and making sure it was the right car for me.

Lastly, Mr. Terry Granger. I had needed to get some warranty items fixed on my car and I pulled up to the service bay and was told I needed to wait for a minute. Shortly after being told ""sorry about the wait,"" Terry went right up and introduced himself and helped me get my car in tip top shape. He also called me every step of the way with exactly what the service tech was doing to my car. 

Overall I think this dealership is the best VW dealership in America. I live in fort worth and make the 60 mile trek to Boardwalk to make sure that my Volkwagen is taken care of properly and within a timely manner.

I finally found a great deal on an Infiniti on Auto Trader at the Boardwalk Volkswagen.

My husband and I particularly liked a showroom floor CC Sport that was beautiful inside and out, and pretty much the same price range we were in for car shopping.  We were willing to get a base model from the lot but Ryan Evans, and Rick Bayon assured me that they were the best in financing and options, and told me if that was the car me and my husband wanted they would work hard to make our wish possible.  They kept their promises on price, rate, and even the car we wanted.  The showroom floor car!

A visit to a previous VW dealership in the DFW Metroplex left me thinking I was possibly nuts, because the service guy basically blew me off.  You see, we've had a problem with the headlights on our Passat since the day we bought it (used, from a third party, not a dealer).  In the end, it turned out there was a problem with the bulbs.  But for the last year, we've driven around with barely any more light that that produced by the driving lamps because the first service tech with whom we spoke didn't check anything and insisted the lights were working fine.  Part of the problem was that I expressed concern about the lights not getting any brighter when I switched from daytime running lamps to headlamps.  The first tech (at the other VW dealer) just told me, ""that's how they work,"" and that they were fine.  Brandon, on the other hand, listened when I described the other symptoms, such as a failure to light up street signs or the reflectors on parked vehicles.  He advised that the switching mechanism might be fine but that the lens aim or bulbs may be the problem.  It turned out the bulbs needed to be replaced.  Thanks to Brandon, we can now drive safely at night, and we enjoy our Passat even more than ever. Thanks Brandon!!!",4.8

1269,"February 05, 2010","As background, my VW (Rabbit)is 33 years old, and had been out of use for a few months (it turned out that a 33-year old fuel pump finally gave up, and thus the car would not start).  Obviously, when an automobile reaches this age, the availability of repair parts and technician experience, together with the dealership's customer commitment to service an automobile of this age become really critical.  Boardwalk VW, my service advisor (Terry) and the technician who worked on my car (I believe his name is Robert) were absolutely outstanding from start to finish on my service experience.  They had the expertise and the commitment to repair and service my 1977 Rabbit with the same enthusiasm as one might expect with a brand new car.  During the course of the repairs and maintenance, they also found a suspension component that was worn beyond normal specifications (not surprising, considering the age).  Unfortunately, it is very difficult to find such replacement parts ... none were available through normal parts distributors.  But Terry continued to search and he succeeded in locating the needed replacement part.  Terry and my technician also attended to some details that many dealerships probably would not have attended to.  For example, in comparison to newer cars, my 1977 car requires a heavier weight of motor oil (a weight that no dealer would have in bulk stock).  But this special request was no problem for Terry and the technician (and they understood the reason for the heavier oil weight).  When all was finished, my 1977 Rabbit runs perfectly again and I'm hoping for at least a few more good years.

Also of importance, my most recent previous service experience with Boardwalk VW, in late 2007, was very similar.  I believe the same technician (Robert, I think) worked on my Rabbit at that time and there were similar challenges in locating some replacement parts for a couple components that, as one might expect after 30+ years service, finally gave out.

This can all be summarized by saying that the service I received was truly excellent and far beyond what I think a customer would receive in a similar situation with most auto dealerships.  I've been a Boardwalk customer for many years and this is the way they've always worked with me. ",4.8

I was interested in a vehicle where I could get good size, versatility, increased gas mileage, and reduce my payment.  I got the initial run around between the sales person and the finance manager.  I was able to get them to move over 100 dollars/month off their initial offering, but could not   strike a deal that was good.

Returned to the dealership yesterday, with known equity in my lease vehicle.  
Gary was working with a potential customer in his office, who was very upset and was getting the same financial run around that I had my last experience at the dealer.  This customer walked away, and I took the opportunity to inform Gary that I was here to crunch more numbers.  Gary said he would get back to me while he was helping finish up other customers.  He came by several times, cordial, asked what my status was with my lease, and after sharing my known information about my lease status, he never would let me re-engage him in the sales process.  I truly felt blown off after waiting an hour and a half, to see him soliciting new prospects on the lot.  An educated consumer is not the prospect they are looking for. I drove down the road to Rusty Wallis and had one of the most pleasurable buying experiences for a new vehicle that I have ever had.
