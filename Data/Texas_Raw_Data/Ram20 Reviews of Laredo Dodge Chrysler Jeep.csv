15,"November 29, 2018","The used car sales mngr. was horrible! He had issues wih the finance company and called me up forcing me to resolve issues that I was unaware of, he demanded I go look for my co-signer at their workplace, when I said I wouldn‚Äôt do that , he turned even more rude and told me ‚Äú what‚Äôs it going to be? You go look for your friend or I send the vehicle to get picked up?‚Äù Who speaks to their customers like that!? All of a sudden he lost respect ?üèΩ and didn‚Äôt hesitate to speak to me in an undermining tone sarcastic tone. In the end he was wrong issues were resolved , but he still called back @ 7pm and said. ‚Äú well I haven‚Äôt heard anything so bring me my vehicle ‚Äú
I told him he was mistaken, and he continued with‚Äù well since I haven‚Äôt heard anything Im sending my people to pick up the vehicle, what‚Äôs you‚Äôre address?‚Äù 
I told him I didn‚Äôt have time for his errors , and told him they should have all my info including my address . I proceeded to hanging up. 
Still I did not get an apology from this coward. I‚Äôm in pure disgust. Little men like that should not deal with customers!",1.8
16,"January 21, 2017","This dealer tries all the textbook high pressure sales tactics such as focusing on monthly payments, four square sales pitch.    they would ask me ""what kind of offer i wanted""  i would reply ""just give me your best"", we would talk in circles but obviously they had more room to work with based off what the salesman was saying and his persistence in trying to goad me into giving him a specific number.  I told him if he cant do any better just say so and i would shop around, if they had the most reasonable offer i would come back.   I was particularly offended that they had the audacity while negotiating over the phone to claim that i was treating them unfairly by talking to other dealers to see if they could beat their offer.  In the end i decided I would be better off taking my business elsewhere.

that being said, i enjoy tough negotiations and do appreciate the salesman's persistence and must say that aside from the negotiations over the phone he was very courteous (maybe he was having a bad day or perhaps his manager wasn't giving him much to work with)",2.0
17,"May 11, 2016","I was a potential new customer and already felt as if I was a bother to the Internet manager. No thanks, made my purchase elsewhere",1.4
18,"March 08, 2016",Constantly lying to customer's about the status of the vehicle. Months spent in the dealership trying to figure out the problem and repairs that have me going back in the next week to start the arduous process all over again. Worst is they are the only dealership around so I don't have a choice. My next vehicle sure won't be a Chrysler I can tell you that. Horrible.,1.2
19,"August 19, 2015","I have been a jeep owner for the past 9 1/2 years.., was thinking of changing model this year 2015, but paid a visit with mr. Jon Hernandez
Was able to convince me into continuing my tradition.... 
I am very happy with my new jeep... Since being a customer, never had had a call from my seller to see how I was doing and if I had any questions...

Mr. Hernandez will definitely recommend you in the future.
