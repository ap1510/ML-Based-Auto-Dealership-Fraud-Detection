6,"February 02, 2020","I was in a severe front end accident 10 To 15 minutes after leaving the service department and is all I know is that the techs at Auto nation took all four of my tires off of my vehicle and put all new tires back into my Yukon and then they did a front alignment and supposedly they fixed the recall where my car shifts to the left and what a coincidence that most of my damage was done to the left of my car. Maybe the techs did something they shouldn’t have or I got faulty defected manufactured Bridgestone Deulars but I may never know but what I do know is that after spending nearly $1,300 of work to my Yukon, I was in an accident 10-15 minutes from leaving the service department and when I went back a few days later to go ask the service manager if their guys could have done something wrong Since they did take everything apart but he did not want to hear anything I had to say.

7,"January 18, 2020",Recently had truck in for warranty service in rattling exhaust pipe. For some strange reason they removed and rotated the front tires without resetting the tire pressure indicator. Also they did not put the lug nut key back in my truck. This morning I had a flat on the passenger front. Tire pressure indicator showed driver side. Could not take tire off to get flat fixed since the lug nut key was missing. Thank god I was not out in west Texas somewhere miles away and no way to remove and put on the spare. Total screw up mess in that service dept and somebody should be fired. This could have been a real disaster for me being a 73 year old 90% disabled veteran.,1.0
8,"January 16, 2020",I leased a Chevy Trax and when the lease was up I told the sales people I wanted to buy the vehicle.  They lied to me and told me I would still have to pay for excess mileage if I bought it and they said they did not know how to help me buy my car back.  Talk about desperate to sell a new car.,2.6
9,"November 26, 2019","Went in for oil change GREAT SERVICE  Looking for a 3/4 ton truck and found a used GMC which was rear ended and a impact on the front bumper with scratches and dents.  The manager said he would fix it  and got numbers which shocked me..  My trade was completely low balled and truck went from 23k to 32K and payment acording to sheet went from mid 400 to 700 a month.

Buyer be ware going here.   I never do these reviews and took my time to tell others.  My final thought, why would a dealer put a vehicle with tons of damage out on the lot for people see.  Still scratching head on that one",1.4
10,"October 09, 2019","
I really don’t know where to begin but I’ll start off by saying I purchased a 2015 Chevrolet Tahoe on April 13, 2019 from Autonation Jeep Dodge Ram in N Richland Hills.  When I test drove the vehicle it seemed to only need shocks and they said they would fix it with no problem because I agreed to buy the truck. I drove it home and parked it and never drove it again until they called and request that it be dropped back off for maintenance on April 22, 2019. I dropped it off to them but they couldn’t fix it so it was sent over to Autonation Chevrolet and they began repairs on April 26th  and kept the vehicle until May 6th. The problem still continued with the vehicle so it was dropped back off to them when they were able to fit it in on June 5th and they attempted to fix the vehicle once again and I was called saying it was ready for pick up on July 12th. When I went in to pick up the vehicle not only was it not fixed but it had been wrecked so they took the truck back in for repairs and attempted to fix it once again, now adding repairs for the damaged bumper, chrome trimming and bumper guard on the passenger side. My truck was kept from July 12th through August 31st and I was told that the reason it wasn’t fixed the first two attempts is because they had put the wrong parts on the vehicle. I picked the vehicle and was starting to be happy thinking that everything was fixed. On September 29th my family and I left for church and as we were driving I began to hear this humming sound. I’m not a mechanic or anything so honestly I thought it was coming from the tires and the road since my area is under so much construction. On that evening I was headed to visit my grandmother and the driveshaft broke and caused us to be stranded on the freeway. At this point I’m sick of going through the issues so when I had the tow truck driver to pick my truck up I had it towed to a different Chevrolet dealership. On the next morning, The moment the dealership inspected my vehicle they said whoever did repairs on my vehicle does not need to touch it ever again. They called my warranty company and General Motors to have the repairs approved but was told that with the driveshaft breaking it has something to do with previous repairs and needed to be repaired by the original mechanics. Autonation picked the truck up from them and repaired it on October 1st and returned it back to me on October 2nd. While they had it I mentioned to them that I was told by a GM mechanic that they needed to make sure they check the transmission because with me going at a rapid speed and the driveshaft breaking that they needed to make sure the transmission wasn’t damaged. Autonation was like yeah we got it fixed and nothing is wrong with the transmission and everything is good to go. I brought the truck back home and parked it in my garage that has never had a leak in it from the Tahoe. Monday morning when I woke up to take my kids to school there’s a leak. So I immediately called Autonation and asked for someone in upper management because now the transmission is leaking. They picked my truck up and swapped me out with a loaner and took it in for repairs around noon and around 3:30 they were calling saying it was fixed. I asked if they could keep my truck over night just to make sure and they said no we need our loaner back for other customers so get ready because they are on the way to trade out. I woke today and my truck still has a leak. I’m at wits end and simply don’t know what to do. My husband tried talking to them and he was told that because he was so angry and frustrated and threatened to get social media or the news involved that they no longer want to deal with the truck and that I need to take it somewhere else or pay for it myself. What do I do Tim because I can’t afford the repairs and I don’t feel that I should be responsible for something they really caused? Please help!!

13,"July 14, 2019","I had an issue with my vehicle I just purchased in May of 2019 at Autonation Chevy North Richland Hills, Tx. I was very upset with the fact that I had just purchased the car and a few major things were wrong with it.  I was advised I would have to pay $500 for parts and labor to get it fixed!  I was also told I would have to pay for a rental because no more rentals were available. Needless to say I was very very upset!.  Kelvin saw my frustration and took care of the rental car situation that same day. My car sat in the service department for 7 days and I received no response from anyone in regards to who was going to pay to fix my car because I certainly was not.  My level of disappointment and frustration was well beyond were it should have been for a new car buyer at this location.  I had to continue to reach out to management, service department, etc. to get the status of my vehicle because AGAIN no one was contacting me.  I felt I was being taken advantage and being mistreated because I am a woman.
Kelvin brought Hoot to me to discuss the issue, and Hoot heard and saw the frustration and anger in me regarding the lack of communication regarding my car.  He advised me he would look into it and contact me the next day.  He did exactly that and advised me my vehicle was ready. He did what originally should have been done in 1 day, versus having my car sitting in service for 7 days.  The service department and Hoot took care of everything wrong on the vehicle. Kelvin and Hoot were very sympathetic and professional when it came to making sure I left a happy customer. Which I was.  Thank you from Mansfield, Texas",3.8

17,"November 08, 2018",Absolutely the worst experience ever. They refused to fix the items on the car that were promised by the salesman when the car was purchased. And even tried to blame us for the problems. We finally got corporate involved and they corrected that issue several months later. Took it in for an oil change and they jammed my trunk. They finally fixed that the next week. I took it in last week because of a vibration in the rear end that was shredding my tires and went though an hour interrogation over whether or not I do burnouts in my car before they ever even checked out the car for a problem and then blamed is again for the actual problem and said it was out of warranty. Granted I bought this 50th anniversary Camaro brand new from them with 100 miles on it. I will never ever go back there for anything. ,1.0

23,"January 07, 2018","I feel this case is a criminal case as well as civil case. I don’t have fifty thousand dollars to pay a lawyer two hundred fifty dollars an hour to sue AutoNation Chevrolet, North Richland Hills. I need help on these issues.

The Better Business Bureau closed my case unfairly and prematurely. The Better Business Bureau rules favor the vender in this case. I want my case reopened.

Since the time they closed my case I found more issues with the truck that AutoNation Chevrolet North Richland Hills Texas lied about.

They closed my case unfairly because they said I would not take my truck back to AutoNation to let them look at it.

A man takes a gun into a bank, robes the bank, runs out and gets caught on the sidewalk by the police. The man takes the money back into the bank, gives it back, says he’s sorry and goes free.

No
If you get caught robing the bank you don’t get to go free if you return the money, you get arrested, convicted and sent to prison because you committed the offense of robbing the bank.

1. The truck I bought from AutoNation was supposed to be a new truck service loner with 2901 miles on it. At the 3300 mile point I found the rear tiers had thirty percent tire ware. You don’t get thirty percent tire ware in thirty three hundred miles. This means AutoNation knowingly, willingly and intentionally, lied about how and how much the truck was used.  AutoNation committed an offense against me to swindle me out of my money for their gain.
No
I am not obligated to take my truck back to a dishonest dealer who has committed six offenses against me. This dealer must reimburse me for my loses and be punished. You can fix a broken wheel bearing but you can’t undo an offense.

The standard procedure for looking for odometer fraud is to submit the VIN number of the vehicle to the Department of Motor Vehicles and they will pull up the service record which you can look at to find any inconsistency’s with the records and the reading on the odometer.

In this case AutoNation owned the vehicle, they could have used and loaned the vehicle extensively, turned back the miles and then did the service work and turned the service record into the state. Odometer fraud is a criminal offense.

2. AutoNation told me the truck had a sprayed in bead liner. I have found out the so called bead liner is not a sprayed in bead liner but it’s a thin coat of textured black paint. AutoNation blatantly lied about the bead liner. Auto Nation knowingly, willingly and intentionally committed this offense against me to swindle me out of my money for their gain.

No
I am not obligated to take my truck back to a dishonest dealer who has committed six offenses against me. AutoNation knowingly, willingly and intentionally committed this offense against me to swindle me out of my money for their gain.

3. AutoNation Chevrolet told me the truck I bought had navigation. I said I wasn’t planning to use OnStar and asked them if the navigation would work with or without OnStar and they said yes it would. I couldn’t get navigation working so I called the one eight hundred number on the My Chevy App and they looked up the VIN number and replied a week later telling me the truck doesn’t have navigation at all.

AutoNation knowingly, willingly and intentionally lied to me, telling me the truck had navigation when it does not. This is an offense that AutoNation committed against me to swindle me out of my money for their gain.

No
I am not obligated to take my truck back to a dishonest dealer who has committed six offenses against me. AutoNation knowingly, willingly and intentionally committed this offense against me to swindle me out of my money for their gain.

4. On the truck I bought, after I signed the deal including accessories AutoNation installed a set of substandard, poor quality, cheap running boards that vibrate and make noise.

AutoNation knew the running boards were substandard, poor quality, cheap running boards when they installed the substandard, poor quality cheap running boards. This is an offense that AutoNation committed against me to swindle me out of my money for their gain.

No
I am not obligated to take my truck back to a dishonest dealer who has committed six offenses against me. AutoNation knowingly, willingly and intentionally committed this offense against me to swindle me out of my money for their gain.

5. During the negotiation AutoNation raised the MSRP. This is against GM rules and it is illegal.
AutoNation knowingly, willingly intentionally lied to me in writing, on paper about the MSRP.
This is an offense Auto Nation committed against me to swindle me out of my money for their gain.

No
I am not obligated to take my truck back to a dishonest dealer who has committed six offenses against me. AutoNation knowingly, willingly and intentionally committed this offense against me to swindle me out of my money for their gain.

6. At the end of the negotiation AutoNation did not give me the original window sticker. This is against GM Rules and is illegal. This is offense that Auto nation committed against me to swindle me out of my money for their gain.



No
I am not obligated to take my truck back to a dishonest dealer who has committed six offenses against me. AutoNation knowingly, willingly and intentionally committed this offense against me to swindle me out of my money for their gain

25,"November 11, 2017",Some tech destroyed my cabin air filter taking it out to check it then they said it was already like that and wanted to charge me $79 for a new one.

26,"October 03, 2017","I called the service department and was put on hold for 10 minutes, I hung up and called back thinking maybe they forgot I was on hold......... Well thus began the endless cycle with the automated system where I would select the service department and it would ring and cycle me back through to the list of selections. I did this about 6 times until I finally elected to speak to someone else who quickly answered my one question and I was on my way. OOOOO don't let me forget about the ever present 2 hour wait time for an oil change. I experience this on a regular basis with the dealership. I'm exhausted with it and I definitely will reconsider where I purchase next time.",1.4
27,"June 26, 2017","They kept my car for 7 days, I needed an oil change and a recall to replace a sensor a 90 minutes job. Calls takes forever to be answered, their appointments are a joke and a waste of your time, it doesn't work. Don't expect a courtesy car, I borrowed a friend car to commute to work for the whole week. Very bad management, the person in charge of my car Steven did what he could and was very nice but when he addresses issues to management he comes back empty handed. Story short, the tech responsible for servicing my car was sick, after 7 days I picked up my car without having it fixed, took it to classic Chevrolet in Grapevine, job was done in no time, great service, great communication.
This could have been solved in a very simple way, bad management made it so complicated.",1.0

32,"January 01, 2017","I bought a pre-owned vehicle for my daughter the first time I visited this dealer.  I have them a $500 deposit to hold the vehicle a few days until I could pay the balance e, and that part of the deal went off flawlessly.

I came back two days later with an appointment to make the remainder payment and take delivery as all the paperwork was done already, and ended up waiting TWO HOURS just to make the payment!  The salesman was on point with us and constantly checking on things and apologizing for the delay and had no idea why we were waiting.  

When the finance guy finally got to us, we were done in less than 5 minutes.  Totally unacceptable wait just to make a payment when any one of the other dealer associates sitting around doing nothing could have easily done it for us.",2.3

I had never purchased a car from the internet so I  was skeptical about it, but their careful attention to detail and willingness to work with me was very reassuring. My niece lives near their location and went to look at the car on my behalf and even she was impressed with the car and sales process. When my 2007 jaguar arrived at my front door I was overwhelmed.

34,"February 03, 2016","I am writing this review to warn people, please do not trust this dealership with your money. It was a huge waste of our money.
We purchased our vehicle from this dealership along with an expensive extended warranty 5 years ago. We were informed that this warranty would cover just about anything needing to be repaired on the vehicle within the next 5 years, and that while the dealership would be working on our vehicle they would provide us with loaner vehicle to drive. 
We have had a terrible experience every time we have taken it in to get repaired. The service department lacks in any knowledge of our warranty, lacks in communication, and tries to tell us that things listed in the warranty are not covered. It seems to be an act of congress to get the promised loaner vehicle, they try to charge you to fix more than you bring your vehicle in for, and once they gave me my car back when it had not been fixed.
I took it in because the ac was not working, they called me a week later saying that my car was fixed, I paid the $100 deductible, and when I got in the car, the ac only worked on two settings, so I had to be late for work for nothing and leave my car with them for a one more week!

35,"January 20, 2015","This dealership is the closest one to my office and home.  After receiving a safety recall notice on my 2005 GMC truck, I took the truck to this dealer and effectively lost it for five days.  After it had been in their shop for a couple of days, I started trying to find out when I could pick it up.   Unfortunately this was a five day ordeal with the worst part being their inability to find anyone to answer the call.   At one point I was on hold for over 30 minutes and finally gave up.  I finally just talked to the service ""manager"" who found the truck - service recall cleared and maybe or maybe not cleared - and he is getting it washed so I can pick it up in 30 minutes.

If you are taking a vehicle to this dealership, I would strongly suggest that you get contact phone numbers for the service writers and the service manager.  The ""automated phone answering"" is totally unacceptable and frustrating.  Their appointments for any service work are a joke.",2.0

37,"December 12, 2013","I purchased a  05 corvette as well as the extended warranty. I also purchased the tire and wheel warranty with the road hazard. I had a slow leak in the driver side rear tire and the front passenger side tire. I took it in to get it fixed, normally would go to NTB for this but since I had purchased the wheel and tire warranty I thought they would take care of me.  They found a nail in both tires and informed me they were to close to the side wall to repair and would have to be replaced. They called the folks at the warranty company and we're told they would have to send a inspector to check it out. The next day I received a call from Autonation that the inspector would be there in 45 minutes so I.rushed down there so he could check it out. He sprayed his soapy water bottle on the tires and said they weren't leaking, I guess I was imagining the low tire pressure message I was getting every few days. He took some pictures and said he would let me know what they come up with. I didn't here back eight days so I.called Autonation black to see if they had heard anything. They told the warranty company said they wouldn't"" replace the tires, but I could bring the car in and they would punch the hole all the way through and patch it and pay for that. I was originally told it was to close to the sidewall. I can't believe they would do that on a high performance car with Y rated tires. Really concerned about customer safety. The temperature was 85 when they were checking the tires. They didn't seem to get it when I told them it only seems to happen on cooler days. I can't believe a dealership that size would stoop that low to save a few bucks sounds like something a shady used car salesman would do.",2.6

40,"September 25, 2012","I had a negative experience with the used salesmen at Bankston.  I was looking at a newer truck they had on their used lot.  Talking with the sales guys, I learned that they had taken the truck in the night before on trade.  They told me they didn’t actually have it in their system yet so they could tell me the price.  I test drove the truck and came back the next day to talk numbers.  The sales guy gave me the workup sheet.  On it, they listed a dealer add on of 400.00 for window tinting…on a used vehicle…that they didn’t even yet have in inventory.  I called the salesman out on it.  I told him you expect me to believe that you received this truck night before last and didn’t have time to put it in inventory but somehow had time to tint the windows.   I know for a fact that the trim package included window tinting.  He said its standard procedure.  I also noticed their documenting fee was in the ballpark of 350.00.  They basically wanted to gig me for an extra 750.00 in hidden fees.  They also were not interested in negotiating any money off the truck.  I ran out of this dealership.   I went next door and bought a totally loaded out F150 for 10,000 less with no hidden fees and the documenting fee was in line with the rest of the industry.   I guess all the construction must not be hurting their business.",1.3
41,"July 12, 2012","Myself and a friend stopped by this dealership as I was looking for a new truck.  We were met by a salesman in the used car lot.  I told him what I was looking for and my price range.  He said he could do that and that all I needed to do was pick out a color.  To be honest, I think he just heard my price range and didn't listen to my list of wants.  We went to his ""office"" without seeing any vehicles and he proceeded to tell us about how the guy in the next cubicle could work a deal and get me in at my range.  We basically sat around waiting for this other salesman.  

My salesman then proceeded to tell me how I didn't really want everything I was asking for (leather, bose stereo, etc.).  I told him I wanted to upgrade and that these luxuries were important to me.  He stated those items were overpriced from the dealer and that I would be better off getting them installed after market.  He stated that what I really wanted was a Texas Edition with chrome and 20"" wheels.  He stated that I needed to be thinking about down the road and what would be important when I went to sell the vehicle.  Again, I told him that these were the features I was looking for in my new truck.  I informed him that I had been looking at ltz models and he stated that I needed to give up some of my wants.  He then proceeded to tell me how there were slick salesman over in the new car department and that if I went and talked to them they would just confuse me and rip me off.  He insisted that I needed to talk to the other used car salesman to get the financing complete.  The problem was that the other guy was still working on a sale and obviously wasn't going to be finished anytime soon.  I asked if I could look at the models he was describing so that I could determine if this was something that I would be willing to work with.  He responded by stating ""you aren't hearing what I'm telling you, young lady.""  Written words can't describe the condescending tone used.  He again told me I wasn't going to get the amenities I was looking for.  I replied that I understood what he was saying, but if we were going to wait around on the other salesman to be available, I would like to at least see what truck he was talking about so that we weren't just sitting around wasting time.  He refused to show me any trucks and stated ""well all I'm going to do is point you over to the new sales department.""  Highly insulted, we left and have no intention of ever buying a vehicle from this dealership.

So when I called Bankston service department, they were busy and took a message to give to the next available service rep.

I promptly called Classic Chevrolet in grapevine and got ahold of a service rep immediately and they were helpful and called to arrange towing.

43,"December 27, 2011","Ernesto met me on the lot, and based upon my needs, he made a recommendation of a pre-owned vehicle that he thought just might meet those needs. He was absolutely correct, and the vehicle that he suggested exceeded my expectations. Negotiations went quick, and in minutes really, we struck a deal. I was paying cash for the vehicle and must say the slow and slightly disappointing part of the transaction was that it too long for a finance person to see me in order for me to sign all the papers that are required, even though it was a cash deal. The finance guy (don't recall his name) was none too friendly, but just went through the motions of what he needed to do. With that said, I based my 5 star rating solely on my positive experience with Ernesto. Ernesto even followed me to my house so that I would not have to go back to the dealership for my other car. So, 5 stars to Ernesto and his efforts, and an average 3 stars I would say for the finance guy, whoever he was. ",5.0

I was okay having the minor item fixed as the truck was seven years old and wouldn't be perfect, but the brakes and air bag problems were unacceptable.  I notified Bankston and was called back in a few short hours by Greg Bryant.  He apologized that we had any issues whatsoever, and had me bring the truck in the next day the Service Department was open (this was on a Saturday).  I did so, and expected at least a week of down-time as the service bays were full.  I was shocked to be called back that afternoon with Greg saying it was finished.  They were very courteous and polite, and the only reason they didn't get 5-stars across the board was because of the initial problems.

But, I have never had an experience as nice as the one that I had with the employees at Bankston Chevrolet in NRH, Tx.  They actually made my wife and I feel comfortable and welcome.  Not only was the salesman (Leon) great in his attitude and willingness to help but so were the management team, namely Jeannie(Sp) and Jessie (Sp).  I walked in to buy a truck and left with a camaro and a volvo.  Now I am a salesperson so I know what it takes to sale.  If you want my business, treat me like you would treat your family and do what is best for me.  That happened  That caused me to walk away or should I say drive away in two vehicles.  Good Job to your staff and the employees, namely the ones mentioned above, for their great attitudes and their willingness to do what worked best for us.  Also, the service department at Bankston went out of their way to show us around and told us what to do and when to come back and how they would be willing to help.  Who the heck trains these people?  Outstanding job!!!  Let me not forget the front desk lady who, as soon as I arrived and who did not know me, said.... I can help you.  WHAT?!?  She then gave me my tags, a check, and then had someone put my tags on.  Incredible!  And I was only there to pick up an extra set of keys.  

Good JOB!!!  My next car will be bought from this dealership.  I only hope that all remains the same.

Spoke with Debbie Blaker. She was calm. Not pushy- no hype.
That stuck with me.  I drove there the next day, Tish Harris saw me drive up.
Probably saw the fear in me,  opened the door and said welcome.  She never missed a step with me  and I knew in my mind at any time I can leave.  I stayed.  I was treated royally. I was trully being watched over that day. I will never have anything negative to say about those that helped me.  Mike Purtell was most kind. I had had another sales manager years before at another dealership. He was a little swarmy.  Mike was a pure pleasure and cool. Jesse Barraza  was focused but not so much that he was indifferent. He is entertaining, gets the job done. Just a note  I do not know if if is old world thinking.  Pinning a customer between the chair and the desk is old  style.  Give Jesse a bigger office, that desk is way too big for that small a space.  Tish will always be my go to person.  I had the oil change in March and I went to see her   no reason just to say Hi. I like my car. She is called the Unicorn.
 I do want you to know that I was a good customer that day. That was the day the fillies were running at the Breeders Cup Oaks and I missed it. I still had a ""great"" experience 11-05-10.

If I had been able to track it's progress, the wait would have been more bearable. I was very pleased with the dealership and the sales people, I would definitely buy again from Bankston Chevrolet Fort Worth.

The price comparison over the phone was better than quotes in my immediate area and I don't like to waste time. I drove almost 50 miles to buy a new SUV for my wife from Bankston.  Jeannie introduced me to Tish and she too was very friendly and made me feel at home. The price was the same when I got there, my trade in was what I had expected, Jeannie found a better finance rate than my bank and we completed the deal in just a couple hours.
A few days later I discovered the head liner was hanging down in the center of our new Equinox. When I contacted Jeannie and Tish I was greeted in the same friendly and helpful fashion. Jeannie went out of her way to see to it the new liner was installed in a timely manner and I was not forced to drive back and forth waiting in a Service room for hours. I am very happy to have done business with Bankston and look forward to my next purchase.

Mr. Walters was friendly and completely professional the entire time, which actually spanned a number of days as I am NOT an impromptu buyer.  Neither am I one that tends to negotiate with ""pressure"" sales techniques and Mr. Walters certainly did not pursue that approach.  Mr. Walters honored his commitment to have the headlamp surfaces buffed to remove a clouded appearance, even though the service technician was unavailable prior to vehicle purchase nor at purchase time due to a family emergency.  In addition to having the car detailed, Mr. Walters made certain the gas tank was completely fueled when I picked up the vehicle.  Mr. Walters has remained in communication via mail since the  purchase to state he hopes I am enjoying the vehicle, to stop by his office when I visit the dealership for my first service so he can introduce me to their service department and to contact him if I have any questions or concerns.

67,"August 07, 2010","Went in based on a used Equinox on the website. 4 of 5 reviews were bad and the dealer was a 40 minute drive for us so we were hesitant but still went. We were impressed by how quick and efficient everyone was here. After looking around the lot we discovered we could get a brand new one for the same price based on the limited number of used ones. Our salesman turned out to be amazing. We always worry about getting a pushy person. His name was Indika and he has been there for 6 yrs. Not once did we feel sold, pushed or even nudged in any direction. He didn't have the color we wanted so he had a guy drive 30 miles one way to bring the car back to us to check out. 
Even with this...the entire process took only 3 hours (including 45 min we went to lunch while he got the car) They offered me exactly what I thought for my trade in. There was no back and forth. The finance guy didn't mess around or attempt to sell us. He showed us upfront service that we could purchase but when we said no he said, No problem, we'll have you out of here in no time. My rate is low, the car is new, and so far all is well. I will come back and post here if anything bad happens but I wanted to let everyone know that my expirience was great!

68,"March 30, 2009","I was referred to this dealership and specific person based on good personal experience from a friend of mine. Upon going into the dealership, we had not searched current inventory because we assumed they would have ample inventory to take care of us and the experience was more important to us than anything since we have had terribly negative experiences in the past. Although the dealership was willing to go above and beyond offering me value for my trade-in (which I was not told about), I found that I was expected to understand that the car I was buying needed repairs and that despite the GM warranty, they were not willing to make sure the car was in excellent condition when selling the car. I was told that because of my mediocre credit and despite the fact that I was putting 5000 down, they would not replace the tired for new tires and would not balance them. I was given the used car as a test drive overnight and experienced a loud low noise that was constant and very apparent after going above 40mph. The noise was so apparent that once I got home, I ran a vehicle history report and found that the car was once used as a rental vehicle (I wanted to be sure this was not a lemon deal). Expecting that the dealership would promptly take care of this and knowing I was a 24 hour window before the sale was complete, I took it to them to have tires replaced and balanced..expecting no problems. Mike tried excessively to convince me that the used car I was buying was better than my trade-in and tried to have me agree that I would bring back the car in two weeks (once the warranty was in effect). I was told that if anything happened to the car, they would come bring me a temp vehicle and take care of the current one. Since I was spending 16,000 on the vehicle price and putting so much down, I didn't feel I should have to settle for a vehicle with issues. I told them that it was not acceptable for me to be buying a used car for that price and have issues with it less than 24 hours and to have the dealership say that I had to wait 2 weeks for repair..I insisted they have someone look at it (I finally had to ask Mike how much it would cost for me to have someone look at it..he kept saying they would have to stick the repair cost onto my sticker price..can you believe that?). I was told the dealership did not have another vehicle in my price range and that due to my credit, they would not replace the tires or even balance them. Not to mention, I was constantly told they were making no money off of this deal (do they think I'm an idiot or something?). Based on this information I was left to assume that if someone came in with perfect credit, they would replace the tires no problem and not argue. I was expected to take a damaged vehicle off the lot and have repairs done immediately after leaving! This situation was TERRIBLY stressful and I ended up in tears in the Used Sales Managers Office because despite being very reasonable and rational, the manager was pissed because they (apparently) had already gone above and beyond (in their opinion) to help me..even though I had not been explained in what way they were helping me..no figures were on paper or anything. From my perspective, I was being taken advantage of..with no explanation, this left me even more upset when the manager threatened that even though they had given me above value for my car (which I wasn't aware of until that moment), they were NOW giving me a less value for my car and the deal was off. I was very gentle, but persisted in asking for the GM..and at this point had been in tears. The GM explained that it would probably be better to get me into a new car and had the sales staff work with me. Unfortunately, after leaving the GM's office, there were more problems left and right...my paycheck stubs were now unacceptable and my husbands paycheck stubs were unacceptable. I ended up leaving, finally feeling as though they were really putting an attempt in to get rid of me. I'm sure GM is hurting with the economic crisis, but why am I supposed to pay for that when I am attempting to help them by buying a car from them? I needed a reliable car..and that is ALL I really needed...even though I was approved for a loan, they were unwilling to give me a reliable car.
