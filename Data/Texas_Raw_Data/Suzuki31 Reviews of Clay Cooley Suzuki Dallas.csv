0,"July 22, 2016","I was on the market for a car after I was tired of driving in less than luxury. I went to several different dealerships who all wanted such a substantial down payment that I did not want to pay until I found Jordan at Clay Cooley.  I went in looking for a 2015 Toyota Corolla because I was familiar with the quality of the cars they produce however, because I did not want to put a down payment and my credit was less than perfect Jordan showed me a Kia Optima. I was hesitant at first because I don't know much about their cars however Jordan assured me it was a great car. It also helped that it had about 30,000 fewer miles on it than the Corolla I was looking at. I went ahead and did a test drive because really anything would be better than my previous car but I think now I love it even more than the Corolla I though I wanted. It's more spacious and very classy looking. Everyone says it looks like me. When I was going through the process of trading my old car in I ran into some issues with getting everything I needed but Shannon and Jordan helped me throughout the entire process. I was so stressed out and they were there to help the entire way through. I am very pleased with my experience here and I LOVE my car! 

Thank you so much!",5.0
1,"June 17, 2016","Short version: Don't waste your time here. I had my vehicle damaged during their trade-in appraisal and had the classic jerk car salesman experience with the Sales Manager. Did I mention the price at the dealership was $1,182 more than the online price?
Longer version: Went in to look at a 2012 Ram with good mileage, looked clean and had a competitive price at $22,995 online. Floor Salesman, Jordan, was extremely eager, helpful, and professional. I have no complaints about any of the process there. Once Jordan understood I was going to leave to look at my options (and I advised likely come back), his sales manager came down from the box to start battle. He immediately became confrontational after a handshake and even more so when I didn't back down on any of HIS issues. Truck was listed at $22.995 online, but he advised the truck was now $24,177 because of ""custom wheels""--they were basic chrome from Dodge and a ""bedliner""--it was a flimsy tent-type plastic that would soon need to be replaced. He then argued that I didn't read the price correctly, advised it takes 24 hours to change online, then changed that to 48 hours. Online price later read ""MSRP $22,995. Selling price $22,995. Internet Price $24,177. So even after he blatantly changed the price--how does asking $1,182 more than BOTH the MSRP & Selling Price make sense?? Sales Manager was a self-righteous jerk. OH, and he was the same guy that both appraised and damaged my vehicle. Thanks, guy.",1.4
2,"December 29, 2015",We went to go cancel our insurance with the dealership and the front desk man was extremely impolite. He gave us an attitude and didn't even look at us when he talked.,1.0

4,"November 14, 2015","I was very happy with my purchase.  As a matter of fact I came to look at Clay Cooley only to purchase my daughter her first car, but wound up leaving the lot with a car for myself as well.  Fred was a great salesman and was very patient with my 17 year old and her need to drive car after car after car.  He never once pressured her to make a decision.  Instead, he let her drive as many as she wanted before she made a choice.  I will definitely return to Clay Cooley if I have a need for another vehicle.",4.8
5,"September 03, 2015",Fred Stevens at Clay Cooley Suzuki was the best salesman I ever worked with. He went out if his way to make sure I got the car I wanted even though my credit wasn't the best. He took his time showing me all the new gadgets in my new car which I greatly appreciated. I would recommend Fred Stevens and Clay Cooley Suzuki to anyone looking for a car.,4.8

7,"May 01, 2015","I bought a equinox here in 2013. They forced me in to all these warranties I didn't need. They told me if I didn't buy them my interest would sky rocket. Found out that is against the law. Now I bought a new truck from a somewhere else and I'm trying to get that money back. I went in there w all the proper paperwork. The guy Daniel swore up and down he didn't need them. A month goes by and I call. Well I was in for a surprise. he in fact did need those papers. I was treated horribly there. I was hung up on And talked down to. i then spoke to Donald. He promised me i would have the check with in next day. So i thought ok. Well its been 5 days i texted Donald and he barely responded and when he did it was ""let me check"" let me get back to you"". Come to find out he NEVER CALLED Cheryl  and I still don't have them i  called and spoke to Cheryl she said she needed the paperwork Daniel swore i didnt need to leave him or she couldn't release the checks.so i did his job fon him and got Cheryl what she needed. I texted Donald (who is a GM) and he said he'd let me know in a few Mins. It's been 2 hrs. They lie and deciete you if you can avoid them do it at all costs!!!! ",1.0
8,"March 18, 2015","Trickery. I called 4 hours ahead of time for the vehicle I wanted. They pulled my report prior to coming to let me know how much my payments and interest rate would be. Sounded good so I went in. The car I wanted wasn't there and was still at the other dealership location. The manager tried selling me another vehicle on his lot and I explained I didn't want. He boasted about how it was similar with a higher series vehicle, 3k more miles, one year older, $3k cheaper, and FULLY LOADED. I asked why the price was so high and he insisted because of the amenities. I test drove ""the vehicle"" but it was standard. He said he would have me a fully loaded vehicle. Right before I went into the office to sign the papers... they drove the test car to the back. After papers were final, they gave me the standard vehicle instead w/ the high price. When confronted by my salesperson, the manager said to him ""I did tell her that but all well she signed the papers."" Now I'm stuck with a car $10k more than what it's worth. ",2.2

10,"December 10, 2014","after going to a carlot that couldn't work, and had me running all over town. different ppl running my credit knowingly I won't get approved. disappointed I was until I went to clay Cooley. Nothing is perfect and the only thing that went as planned was me driving off the lot on my own. Thank you kurtis you really helped me.",3.4
11,"January 23, 2013","This was the absolute WORST experience I have ever had with a dealership in my life! They were rude, inattentive, dishonest and took forever to get me my car back. This place has absolutely no customer service or support for the owners of Suzuki cars. The mechanics pushed unnecessary repairs for outrageous prices and were untimely. The front desk was a complete joke and I felt rushed out the door and ignored. This place is like a bad boyfriend: never calls when they say they will, ignores you and screws you over when they get the chance. To top it all off they damaged and destroyed the GPS/sound system in my car that will cost me $1200 to replace and won't pay for it or even try to repair it. Possibly the most expensive mistake I have ever made and I will never go back to this place. I am giving a fair warning to anyone, especially women, out there that these people will try to take advantage of you. ",1.0
12,"September 18, 2012","My ex wrecked my car that I was 2 months from paying off with a tote the note lot. My experience with them was horrible so I was determined to not go through them again. I had terrible credit so I was looking for someone to finance despite that....Clay Cooley offers a credit rebuilding program called ""Fresh start."" Not only do they finance you in-house, but they report monthly to help build your credit back. The deal is that you buy a car off of the lot specifically for the fresh start program. You buy it 'as is' and in 18 months of good payments you can come back, trade in the vehicle and get financed for ANY car on the lot. Great deal right?? Wrong. I bought a 2007 Suzuki Forenza for $13000K, it didn't matter since I was only supposed to be in the car for 18 months?. I had to replace a wheel because the one it came with had a dent and kept leaking!. The transmission was randomly switching gears while I was driving so I poured another $700 into it'. I paid on my car for 15 months;. My credit score soared from the 400s to the 600s|. I was invited back to look at getting another car so I filled out the credit application online and was told I was approved for a 2012 Suzuki SX4,. Awesome, right? Wrong!. I got there got everything set up, switched my insurance/. Only to find out that Clay Cooley didn't keep my note, they sold it, so instead of being able to use my car as a trade in, the buy back would only be $7000 leaving me upside down $3000...IF I could come up with $2500 down payment. 4 hours it took to find this out, 2.5 of which I was sitting outside the finance office. I declined and was told to try back in another 18 months. WHAT?!? I am stuck in this crappy p.o.s car that I never even wanted, that is already cost me more in payments and more insurance than I was paying in my previous vehicle for at least another 18 months?!? FINE! I will work my hiney off save up the $2500 for a down payment and then everything will be fine, right? WRONG. This lady drove the wrong way down a 1-way street. My car is totaled. The insurance only paid the cash value of the car $6000. After the payout I still owe $4000. Now I have to find a car lot that will finance me, roll over my loan, and accept $500 as a down payment...Easy right? NO I AM SCREWED! Because Clay Cooley LIED in the first place, I am upside down on a car loan AND car-less. I know that they are not responsible for any car wrecks, but they are FULLY responsible for lying to me to lock me into a contract and then selling my note. WARNING YOU! DON'T USE CLAY COOLEY'S FRESH START PROGRAM. Unless you want your fresh new start to begin in HELL!!!!",1.8
13,"April 01, 2012","I found a car on cars.com at this dealership and with Bryan Wagner's assistance, I left with a better vehicle.  He kept in contact with me from the moment I sent a request for more information on a vehicle to the moment I walked in to purchase one.  His personality, professionalism, and empathy made the long drive to this dealership worth my while.  He was a joy to work with.  I wish my payment was a little less than what it is but I can honestly say Mr. Wagner helped me get the absolute best deal he could.  I am extremely appreciative for the help he provided and recommend any onlookers to visit him. 

THANKS BRYAN!!  ",4.8
14,"March 30, 2012",We are very happy with our new Suzuki SX4 Sportback. Bryan Wagner was very nice and knowledgeable. He explained all the features on the car very well. The reason we gave the rating we did was because this was the best car buying experience we have ever had. Everyone we dealt with at the dealership were all friendly and knowledgeable. Thank you.

15,"February 20, 2012","Tucker was great.. Abel was great... the only thing I was unhappy about was that I was lied to by another salesman ""not Tucker"" upon walking in the door way..and not getting any gas in my truck..""gas light was on"" ",3.0
16,"January 02, 2012","I had called that morning to schedule an appointment, the lady i talked to told me to come in at 2:30, so i get there about 2:15 and there is no record of me having an appointment.I thought this is not good. They did go ahead and do the work with no problem, so everything worked out. It started out bad, but over all it turned out to be great. Darrin was a great help. ",4.8
17,"October 07, 2011",CODY KEEFE IS THE EXACT EPITOME OF CUSTOMER SERVICE.  You won't go wrong with his level of service.  He's extremely flexible with your schedule and is always available and extend customer service to a 5-Star Level!  HE's AWESOME!  Check out CODY KEEFE for any questions on sales!  He's the man!!

18,"October 04, 2011",Everyone we encountered at the dealership was friendly and professanal no pushy sales people. Made us feel like our business was improtant. Respected our time didnot have us hanging around all day haggling over prices. I have purchased several cars and this experence was by far the best. Would refer others and be a returning customer.   ,5.0
19,"October 03, 2011","I bought a new Suzuki SX4 and in the first month had it in the shop twice for the AC. My tire sensor has been on constantly since Labor Day weekend. I have called all 4 of CLAY COOLEY's dealerships to talk to him and he wont even return calls. I was without my car 10 days and IF I had paid for the rental car they said ""they would provide"" it would have cost me more than my monthly payment. I called to get my plates after my temp plate expired and was told they had called me a month before and told me my plates were in? LIAR! Why would I wait a month to get my plates and why would I call to see if they had them? I would NOT recommend this dealership to anyone, customer service after the sale is horrible and they out right LIE to you!!",1.4
20,"August 22, 2011",Always very friendly service and willing to see that I am satisfied with the work performed.That was one of the main reasons for my purchase of a new vehicle from Clay Cooley Suzuki. The people their are always very nice. I would recommend Clay Cooley sales and service very highly.,5.0
21,"July 19, 2011","My experience w/ my salesperson Cody was AMAZING!  He is honest, and worked very hard to get me a deal and approval all via the internet as I am a busy salesperson thru the week myself. I would recommend HIM to anyone.

However my OVERALL experience was NOT good.  I am an industy professional myself and was HORRIFIED by my Finance and Insurance Experience, along with the attitude of the Sales Manager on duty the night of my purchase.

I bought a supposed ""used"" car with 987 miles on it...THAT HAD NEVER BEEN REGISTERED OR TITLED. It had been ""Warranty Registered"" early so somebody could make a quota. BUT WAS NEVER SOLD TO AN ACTUAL PERSON.  Just transfered from dealer to dealer.  I was FORCED to buy a warranty for a car that CARFAX says should still have a warranty for 83,000 miles.

I was Called NUMEROUS times by Abel in finance about a document ""I had to sign immediatly"" or we would ""NEED YOUR CAR BACK""  Well that was after he called me on a friday and said ""I will call you on Sunday and meet you""  NO CALL NO SHOW ON SUNDAY. Then you call and threaten me on Tuesday like i did something wrong. PLUS PLUS PLUS the paper we needed to sign sooooo quickly was because HE FILLED OUT THE WRONG PAPER.  

My ""Airbag"" light is on they said they would get me an appt and call..... I called two weeks later and made my own appt.  They ordered the part....I called 2 weeks later and ""Oh its here, YOU just needed to call..????"" Plus after the diagnostic appt my drivers side ""Side Airbag"" is FALLING OUT OF THE SEAT!!! It was NOT like that when we came in.  I call about that and its ""You have to wait 2 weeks we are booked solid""
WHAT???????? ARE YOU SERIOUS??? YOU SCREWED UP MY SRS SYSTEM ITS A LAW!!! IF THAT BLOWS UP FALLING OUT OF MY SEAT AND HURTS MY WIFE, DAUGHTER, OR DAMAGES ANYTHING I WILL OWN CLAY COOLEY SUZUKI!!

My Sales experience with Cody was absolutley AMAZING and he should get credit for that.  HOWEVER, EVERYTHING else was an absolute JOKE!!!

I will make sure that as soon as I can wash my hands of that place I will.",2.8
22,"June 27, 2011","Worst car buying experience of my life! Date of occurrence, 6/25/11. First we contacted the Clay Cooley Nissan location in Dallas/Duncanville to find out if the vehicles we wanted to look at were still available and on their lot. We were advised yes by two different people and drove out there. Once we got there we were told they made a mistake and neither were on the lot any longer. We then proceeded to drive to the Clay Cooley Suzuki location in Dallas off Composite Road where we began to enter into sales agreement  and had discussed and agreed on vehicle price to be purchased as well as value/price on trade in. AFTER running our credit, the finance manager comes to us and advises they shouldn't have made a deal with those numbers and tells us the best they can do, which was higher than agreed price. We are extremely disgusted by the fact that our credit was run and an uncecessary inquiry was made which can have negative impact on our credit score in addition to our time being wasted all while our 7 month old was with us. The fact that the numbers were changed after running our credit is an example of unethical sales practices. If there was to be a change in any prices it should have been discussed with us prior to the signing of any paper work or running of our credit. After this experience, I immediately came home and got on the internet and posted this review where ever I could. Found out the Better Business Bureau rating had been revoked. Not suprising after my experience.  WE WILL NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH THIS DEALERSHIP AND WILL MAKE SURE EVERYONE WE KNOW NEVER DOES BUSINESS WITH THEM EITHER!",1.0

25,"June 20, 2011","The staff, including Internet Sales Manager Bryan Walker, were all very friendly and helpful in closing a deal.  The negotiations were minimal, I laid out my acceptable terms, and they worked hard to get very close to those terms.  Quite a feat, considering my situation.  I feel these people care about you and your business, and work hard to make it a pleasant experience.",4.8
26,"June 10, 2011","It was time to purchase a new car, since I had an XL 7 and had been treated so great at Clay Cooley's Service Dept., I went back there to purchase a new vechicle.  To me the way you are treated in the Service Dept, sets the whole pace for buying a new vechicle, because they are the ones you have to go back and see on a regular basis.  If you are not treated right by then, the whole system falls apart.  The Service Dept at Clay Cooley is wonderful and has always been terrific to me.",5.0
27,"June 01, 2011","Best, easiest car buying experience I've ever had and this is my 6th new car purchase in 9 years. I will definitely go back for my new car. My credit is not very good and they were able to get me financed when the other dealership told me it couldn't be done. My interest rate is actually lower than my last loan. The whole process took just over an hour. They gave me top dollar for my trade. ",5.0
28,"May 31, 2011",Due to working hard to get the car that I wanted and making sure that I was told what was happening. He was friendly and made sure that I got the car for the right price and made sure that the deal went through with the specs that I had to put down. The showroom and test drive were above and beyond and the overall staff was helpful and polite.,5.0
29,"May 27, 2011","I had purchased a car from CarHop which is no longer working and they would do nothing to help me fix it so that's when I decided to try to find a better/newer used car. My credit is not all that great and it was very difficult finding another vehicle especially since I had 1 car in my name already. I was turned down dealership after dealership until I found Clay Cooley Suzuki. I began speaking with Rufus Banks, who is a very nice and helpful guy, and I explained my situation and he right away told me that he could help. At first I was a little skeptical since I was already turned down by multiple dealerships but he promised me a car and I got a car. I'm so thankful that they were able to help me and to give me a car that actually worked and was in excellent condition unlike CarHop. Everyone at Clay Cooley Suzuki was very nice and welcoming. Rufus Banks went above and beyond in helping through this process and if it wasn't for him and Clay Cooley I would probably still be car-less and in jeopardy of losing my job. Now I don't have to worry about those things and I can safely get to and from work in a reliable car, especially since I have two young boys to think about as well. I would definitely recommend Clay Cooley Suzuki to others because they made my impossible, possible. Thanks Rufus Banks and especially Clay Cooley!!",5.0
30,"May 26, 2011","Cody was extremely helpful, and I feel went over an above to help me on my buying experience.  This is the first time I have ever visited a dealership where I was treated like a person, not a stupid &quot;women&quot; that didn't know anything.  I do appreciate that.  I would recommend Cody and the dealership to anyone, especially a female customer.

Thank you.
