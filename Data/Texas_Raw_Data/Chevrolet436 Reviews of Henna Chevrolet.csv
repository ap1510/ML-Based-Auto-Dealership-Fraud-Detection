There is something nice about getting good service; so I will continue buying trucks from Henna.

3,"June 23, 2020",I bought a used car from Henna used section. It couldn‚Äôt have been easier. I was able to make most arrangements via text. There was no pressure at all to make a purchase and they offered me fair market value for my trade-in.  If they have the car you want on the lot its the place to go.,5.0
4,"June 23, 2020","I had a great experience at henna. I was tired of dealing with sharkie sales men who all they care about is that big commission. Calvin made my process pretty easy. The old dude is pretty chill. I called him up and spoke with him about a truck I was interested in. When I got there, he greeted me, handed keys off to me and let me go my way to test drive it. Personally, I liked his style, he wasn‚Äôt all over me, never felt any pressure to buy, nor did he tell me a thousand stories about how he‚Äôs had similar vehicle and then last a long time like many other sales men. He was straight up, here‚Äôs the truck, this is how much it goes for, and I bought it. I also got 2k more for my trade in than Leif Jonson ford offered me. ",5.0
5,"June 12, 2020","Contacted Henna re a shifting/lock in park situation. Randall Hilder provided the loaner, and handled the service problem in a professional and prompt manner He is a definite asset to Chevrolet & Henna. Car invloved is an 2018 Traverse.  Thanks to one and all. ",5.0
6,"June 08, 2020","In less than 75 feet the guy moving my car from the service lane to the bay for an oil change stalled it. Not once but twice....rather disappointing to hear and see your car buck and stop on the service drive.  Some simple driving lessons should be implemented before these employees are allowed to drive a customers car. Damage done, nope, but employee quality and customer care are damaged. I will not get my oil changes done there again. 
Also, at this same service when they brought my car to me they did not remove the paper floor mat nor the plastic protector covering the steering wheel. ( Carona virus protection,  they put it on to protect both the employee and the customer, that's good. But leaving it in the car for the customer to remove was not good ) I know, a rather insignificant item, but hey, after playing bucking bronco with my car it kind of capped off the day.",4.0

I waited in the comfortable waiting room for the expected four hours, during which I was updated several times by Service Rep Randall. Price was very satisfactory. I was very pleased with this experience.",5.0
10,"May 27, 2020","After looking for a couple of weeks at various dealerships in Central Texas, I located the truck I was looking for at Henna. Called them about 30 minutes from closing and Diana was able to take my info and get approved within minutes where I spent hours or days at other dealerships to just get a yes or no. Was able to set up a time to come look at the truck in person and drove home in it that day. Great overall experience.",5.0
11,"May 26, 2020",Very clean and respectful sales staff. They worked with me to get what I wanted. Buddy Brown was my salesman and did an excellent job as a outstanding salesman,5.0

14,"May 26, 2020","Initial encounter with employee was pressured and confusing. After details about appointment were acknowledged  no further Instruction was given other than to driver of shuttle will leave in 5 mins and consent for the shuttle.  More information came with what seems to be a manager coming to my side due to me standing there confused as another chevy owner stood there with more questions about their repair service, before even attempting to get into the shuttle. Manager texts is great for accessibility of car updates. Also great for to remind about problems forgetting to state in initial appointment setup. There were moments where managers did not come through with phone calls scheduled through texts. I waited until the next day to text first for the reason of no updates, no reply was made that morning. Called henna and asked for updates, educated to text manager. Informed employee about the actions taken that morning they said they would remind the manager to give me an update about the repairs of my car. Couple of hours later I text manager again due to confusion on what‚Äôs going on. Replied through text 2 hours later, followed by a call 30 mins after text. Since Manager called, updates were more clear understood the reason for longevity of repairs.  3 days pass (2 business days ) day of pickup I was  uninformed about shuttle pick up times. Had to pay for a Uber to go pick up my car due to lack of communication about transportation of shuttle times. Car repairs were successfully done, just a bumpy experience to the end.  (Also maybe stress was high for employees due to COVID)",4.0

I know there are some issues with my car that we‚Äôre not mentioned, like the nail in my tire but I won‚Äôt count that against them. As it was just an oil change and he did say I needed new tires.

21,"April 15, 2020","I had an issue with my car, the gas filler cover would not open.
I called Henna and made an appointment for the car to be dropped off and then my wife drove me back home. Within an hour of arriving home the service department called saying that they had diagnosed the problem and that they had the part in stock.
Got the car fixed and back within a couple of hours after dropping it off. 
In this trying time everyone was cheerful and kind. Something that I was not expecting, figured that everyone would be OK but the whole staff was absolutely cheerful...best experience I have had at the dealership, which has always been good.
Got to give all there a shout out for their kindness and service. ell done people!

23,"April 14, 2020","My husband has purchased many trucks with Henna but puts so many miles on them he always wants to upgrade to new ones. I've purchased a car, a blazer and now we just bought the Chevy TRAX Premier which we absolutely LOVE. It broke my heart to trade in my Blazer because it was an excellent vehicle but my husband always decides on upgrades: he really likes new models. We get all our service done at Henna and could not be any happier!",5.0
24,"April 06, 2020",My truck is about 18 years old and not really spent that much in repair over the years. This was a little expensive but boy did they do a good job and absolutely the easiest and nicest folks to do business with. Randall kept me updated and informed the whole time and he even had the truck delivered to my house when it was done. This is the place to take your Chevy for service. Ask for Randall when you drive in. ,5.0
25,"April 03, 2020","My purchase of a 2020 Chevrolet Equinox was a very pleasant buying experience from making the deal, determining the trade-in value and closing with the delivery of the vehicle. Most business, as far as I am concerned, is about ""making promises and keeping promises to the customer"" and Henna Chevrolet has mastered this better than any other dealer in the area. ",5.0
26,"April 02, 2020",I just recently purchased my 2020 Equinox there at Henna Chevrolet.  My experience was by far top notch.  I highly recommend this dealership.  Great quality.,5.0
27,"April 02, 2020","So, I went to a few dealers that were asking for 5 to 7k down. Given I just discharged out of a chapter 7 BK I wasn't surprised. I needed to get a bigger family car. I met Alan over there who wasn't just able to get me in just one car but two in the same day. 
I gave my wife the brand new 2020 and I took the used 2013. It was an amazing experience, the guy answered every question I had. Oh yeah, did I mention NO MONEY DOWN ON BOTH CARS??? 

Henna rocks! They really helped us out and I honestly can't thank Alan and the Henna team enough. 

Thanks for the help guys ",5.0

It was very quick and the communication was excellent. I have been to other dealerships for other service needs and have not had this great of an experience. Thanks.",5.0
38,"February 29, 2020",I worked with Josh (Sales) and Dean (Finance). They made the process so smooth. My situation was not ideal with negative equity and going through a divorce and they took what I wanted and made it happen from a distance since I am not local! I would definitely recommend giving Henna Chevrolet a shot if you are in the market for a new vehicle! I love my new 2020 Equinox! ,5.0

44,"February 15, 2020","Do not fill out the GM customer survey online if you have something honest or negative to say about service, or you may be punished, as I was. The last time I completed the GM post service survey I was sitting in my vehicle in the Henna service drive waiting on the fourth round of an oil consumption test. After I submitted the survey I walked into the service waiting area and was immediately challenged about my (thought it was private?) survey wording by Mark the Service Manager. Like challenged and chewed on loudly for ten minutes in front of staff, customers, god and technicians as they passed by. Although I tried to explain my review, Mark challenged every aspect and dared me to identify the service staff member who mixed up the transmission dip stick with the engine oil dipstick. I didn't see the gentleman at any of the service writer desks, but did describe him to Mark the Service Manager, and he called me a liar, said there was no one on his staff by that description. Then his associate, trying to calm him down, said softly the man‚Äôs name who did fit that description (another older Mark). Things got quieter after that moment of truth intervened.  I didn't expect to be harassed in person by the Henna Service Manager three minutes after completing an online survey. The incident was inappropriate, a customer with thinner skin would have been humiliated. But as for me, it was just gross unprofessionalism on the Service Manager‚Äôs part and I will move my loyalty and dollars where civility is the business model. I do worry about weaker souls who encounter Mark‚Äôs wrath. Also, if you have read this far and do not want to be publicly ostracized by Henna service staff, DO NOT RESPOND TO THE CHEVY ONLINE SURVEY FOR THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT LEST YOU BE CHASTENED BY SERVICE STAFF. Ridiculous!",1.8
45,"February 14, 2020","Like a lot of vehicle shoppers, I dreaded the process and had delayed looking for a new vehicle as long as possible. Before I entered the dealership; I was greeted by Mr. Buddy Brown; salesman. He was reassuring and accomodating and guided me through the  the entiire process of purchasing my new vehicle. Dispelling all my past fears that I had about the process. Thanks Buddy and team!!",5.0
46,"February 14, 2020",Marcos in sales and John in finance were great to work with. Marcos knew exactly what truck I had called about when I got there and John had me approved and out the door in no time. Great experience start to finish. ,5.0
47,"February 14, 2020",Mark and the service staff are always professional and courteous. They always make me feel as if I were a close friend or family member. The same applies the the cashiers. I recommend Henna service to everyone. ,5.0
48,"February 04, 2020","Second time in to get the problem fixed.  While my experience with Henna Chevrolet is good, my experience with Chevrolet vehicles have NOT been so good.  First Chevy new Tahoo and transmission went out at 3,100 miles and again at 61,000 miles (3 transmissions).  Second Chevy Avalanche and Master Brake Control Module went out.  Third vehicle another Avalanche and another Master Brake Control Module went out at over $1,100.  Also cannot get Chevrolet to fix safety recall on airbags.  Fourth vehicle Chevy Traverse and so far so good.  However I do not believe in Chevy's dependability awards.",3.2
49,"February 04, 2020","The first car I bought from Henna was in 1967...slipped away to other brands and dealers but never matched the service...came back and have bought 12 more cars.  Sales, service, parts, body work is unmatched...last week I called to get an appointment to service my Malibu and as soon as I gave my name Wayne said oh yes silver Malibu and friend of Tim Warren...never got that from other dealers.",5.0
50,"February 04, 2020",Took my truck in for a recall plus service and was told it would take about 1.5 hours it took about 45 min. Was very pleased the amount of time it took and was able to get to my appointment on time in another town. ,5.0
51,"February 03, 2020",Able to work with the most challenging credit issues.  Everyone said no but these people said we can and did. I will go back when I‚Äôm ready for my next vehicle. Even the finance guy was so nice. Thank you for putting me at ease.,5.0
52,"January 30, 2020",Worked with Josh for my new car buying process. Was not sure what model car I wanted just knew it would be a Chevy. Josh was patient and listened to what I wanted in a new car.  Josh was knowledgeable about the traverse and blazer. I will recommend Henna and Josh to family and friends..,5.0
53,"January 30, 2020","I traded-in my Bolt for the newer model, very thing was very smooth. We handled all the numbers and the drive-out amount via text, and I just went in there to get the paperwork done and swap the car.
I appreciated they give you $500 on top of carmax offer for trade-in's.",4.8
54,"January 30, 2020","Henna Chevrolet continues to be the best dealership in Austin. Always courteous and vigilant to the customer‚Äôs needs, I am happy to recommend both their sales and service. There is a reason they have been around for many years.",5.0
55,"January 30, 2020","Josh was my sales contact. He was very professional and helped through the entire process. I was looking all over the country for a 2020 Bolt EV Premier. Several dealerships sold the car right out from under me to an employee. They had at least one in several locations, but after talking for a few minutes, and learning the vehicle was available, I would start the process. Then out of the blue, a sales manager or a parts manager would ""purchase"" the vehicle.

I flew into Austin and Josh stayed in contact with me the entire trip. He had the vehicle fully charged and ready for my road trip back to Arkansas. He even had a map printed out with the locations and directions for al the necessary charging stops along the way.

When I am ready to purchase again, I will definitely use Henna. Even if my local dealerships have better deals,  I would prefer to have great service and travel close to 500 miles to buy from Henna than to be treated badly and lied to by local dealerships.",5.0
56,"January 28, 2020",I just called to get an estimate on having a transmission filter and all the solenoids replaced. The contact repair guy said he couldn't figure it out. He then proceeded to tell me that they were not taking any transmission work in anyhow because they were six weeks behind. You're a dealer who doesn't have any control of your repair business. So disappointing. What a major fail! ,1.0
57,"January 27, 2020",My RayBan sunglasses were stolen from my vehicle when I got an oil change. I was very disheartened! I didnt think to take them out of my middle console. I would hate to have that same person every service my car again!,1.0

59,"January 20, 2020","Bad as usual. I typically avoid this dealership for most maintenance. The employees usually seemed bother by you asking for assistance. The guy that came out to the express lane to ask what service I needed wasn‚Äôt friendly. I wasn‚Äôt aware my oil change expired, I was under the impression it was a free one a year. My 30k maintenance check was $390, went to Christian brothers and was quoted a $ amount at almost half of that for the same amount of work. Last time when I got my oil change the dealership dented in my hub caps on two tires. This time I get my oil change and tires rotated. Now my car is pulling left when I drive it. Will just avoid the dealership at all costs due to faulty work and unfriendly employees. ",1.0

61,"January 18, 2020","I wasn't expecting to buy a car right away, just talk to a sales guy to tell him what I was looking for and to call me when a car came in that fit my needs.  I found the car I was looking for in about 15 min. and Dustin Cannon answered all my questions so we made the deal right then.  Dustin worked with me to hold the car for me while I got funds transferred for a cash buy. It took almost a week to get the funds distributed. deposited into my bank account and ready for checking.  It was a pleasure doing business with Dustin without any pressure.",5.0

65,"January 13, 2020","My car has 17k miles on it, and is under warranty, and I wanted to check my transmission and my exhaust, as well as get an oil change. I scheduled services through the website, and since I would be without a vehicle for the bulk of my day, I took time off from work to get the car worked on. When I arrived they only had me scheduled for an oil change and would not work me into the other services that I scheduled because they were too busy. They suggested that I reschedule services for another day. I needed the oil change so I stayed and had that done, as well as replacing the wiper blades. While I waited I used my phone to go back to the website to schedule the services I need for a later date. I was able to schedule an appointment for the same day, even though I had been told that the service department was already too busy to accommodate me. When it came time to pay for the oil change and wiper blades the bill was $160 - $95 for the oil change and $30 each for wiper blades. Needless to say I won't be going to Henna again anytime soon.

69,"January 04, 2020","The dealership and the salesman was polite and courteous and provided everything he promised.  However, I do feel like I was duped out of about $5000.

80,"December 10, 2019","I called Henna with an A/C problem and was initially told that they were taking appointments two to three weeks out. I was concerned that it would be that long but I reluctantly agreed that I would have to wait.  Randall (the Service Advisor) started asking me some questions and looking on the computer and decided that I could bring my Silverado in that day to at least get an evaluation of what the issue might be.  When I came in he wrote up the order and asked about the latest recall and I told him that another dealer had reprogrammed something on the brakes per the defined procedure.  I told him that I thought there might still be a problem and I described it.  He immediately knew the issue and told me that it would need a new vacuum pump but informed me that the parts were being delayed due to a recent GM strike and couldn't promise how quickly it would be fixed.  He did give me a loaner and said I would have a loaner as long as the truck was in the shop. The bottom line is that Randall was very informative, courteous, accommodating, and knowledgeable.  The truck was fixed in a week and everything is good.  I was very pleased with the service that I received and with the attention and assistance I received from Randall.",4.8
81,"December 10, 2019","I have been using this dealership for quite sometime and have usually been happy so I have kept returning to it.  Flats, oil changes and recall work has all be great but this year I ran into some issues regarding a cracked rim.  I had taken the car in a number of times and in addition to other work I had a slow leak over a few months.  They finally identified the problem as a cracked rim and I was notified it was not covered under the warranty which does not make any sense.  I contacted Chevrolet and then heard from the dealership.  Long story short they worked with me and repaired the vehicle at a reduced cost to me.  I don't agree I should be liable for any of the repairs but I love the car and I was anxious to get it back on the road.  The car is back on the road and the weather has been nice.  I have taken it out for a spin pretty much every day since the repairs.  I will definitely visit this dealership again.  Thank you to the staff at Henna.",4.4

We called the placed in Houston to confirm the price in front of him. We asked the saleman and the manager if they could match the price. They snatched the paper out of our hands and rudely told us to go to Houston to buy the car. Saleman argued with us. Manager argued with us. They acted like they didn't care to sale us the car.

93,"November 15, 2019","Service at Henna has always been good to great. Having bought my Volt from them, I really appreciate getting a loaner whenever I need one. I truly enjoy driving my Volt but have had frequent challenges with it over the past three years (it's a 2017). I think this time, my troubles are resolved!

It seems that Henna has made improvements in how they service Volts (or possibly all electric cars). This November, unlike last, my car was looked at the same day and they didn't keep the car for 2 - 4+ weeks. This was a major source of frustration for me in the past. This time, the car was fixed in a day or two. They addressed a known issue of dead cells. What's more, I was informed that my new service manager Randall now handled all Volts. I am not sure what's happened, but Henna likely has either more experience and/or resources in addressing challenges with the Volt. I now have faith in them and the car. THANK YOU!

Specifically in regards to service manager, Randall, I appreciate his professionalism and his updates on the status of my repair. Excellent customer service.",5.0
94,"November 12, 2019","Scheduled appointment 2 weeks in advance and had the expectation that my vehicle would be diagnosed the day of my appointment.  It took over a week for my vehicle to get looked at.  I had to go around my service adviser to get that information.

When I dropped my vehicle off on my appointment day, the service adviser communicated it should be looked at on that same day.   So that reinforced my expectation and when it took over a week I was shocked.  

I have the expectation that my service adviser will proactively call and give me statuses.  It took 9 days to receive a phone call from my service adviser.

I have the expectation that when I leave a voice mail on my service adviser's work phone that my phone calls will be returned.  I left 3 or 4 voicemails and didn't receive any callback.

I have the expectation that when my service adviser says he/she will check with GM to see if GM will cover some of the cost, they actually do that before calling me with a quote.   I had to remind the service adviser that we had talked about requesting GM to cover the cost.

I have the expectation that my service adviser should proactively apologize and explain why it takes over 1 week to get my vehicle looked at.  Didn't happen. 

I expect my service adviser to keep a professional business like relationship with me.  So, when asked what I'm doing when called on Saturday I'm taken back.  I'm not your friend; I'm your client with normal expectations.  When I asked for an explanation on why it took so long and reminded the service adviser that they said the vehicle should be looked at on the day I dropped it off, I was surprised to hear ""I guess I'm a liar"" coming from my service adviser.

It will be hard to reuse Henna for service or buy another vehicle from Henna.  I'll probably look into non-GM brands down the road.

109,"October 07, 2019","Everyone was so helpful when the purchase was being done even if I did have to wait 30 minutes for the manager to get to me. I got very little assistance when time came to drive away. No instructions on how things work or where they were located or even how to find the answers to my questions. Am I supposed to call you every time a question arises? The only thing my salesperson did was ""pair"" my phone to the truck. Great, but how did he do that? Explanation of controls would be one thing.
Another is the service department. I called to make an appointment but couldn't be scheduled for several days. I came in without an appointment. When I got there the parking lot was being resurfaced. Great. How do I get to the service department? The lot was so congested you couldn't find your way around to get out. After backing up and moving so others could leave, I left and found the Used Car department. They told me I had to go out to the service road, go down to the traffic signal and turn right, go to the next traffic signal and turn right, go to the stop sign and turn right and the service department will be on my right. Clear as mud unless you consider the traffic congestion at the time. So NO. I'm not a happy camper. I will not be using your service department for anything. Not only that, When I read all the reports and comments, all I see are positive comments. Wonder why that is?

They are nice as they're helping you but the only thing I did not like was that they assume I was buying the car without ever asking me if I was. They already had it ready for me to go so I had to tell them I wasn't going to buy it yet and left. I also felt they didn't give me space to ask everything I wanted to know about this purchase. Buying a car is a big purchase for me so I wanted to make sure I was making a good decision. So before buying, I needed space to be able to ask everything (warranty, additional fees, interest rate, etc). I did eventually go back to buy the vehicle, after I had some time to discuss it with my family and give it some thought as to whether that was the right vehicle for me or not.

Immediately I noticed a weird grinding noise in the front end of the car. I told the shop and they brushed me off. My husband called the shop and they did the same thing. Their response was cars make noises. I drove my car to Henna for my first ever oil change and decided I‚Äôd bring it up to their service department. I was relieved when I saw Alvin would be checking me in. I knew he wouldn‚Äôt recognize me since he works with hundreds of people a day but I recognized him. He has been working with myself and my husband for the past 11 years we have been Henna customers. I told him about the noise and he said let‚Äôs jump in the car and see what‚Äôs going on. He didn‚Äôt question my concerns, it was a Friday so I know the schedule was full, but he took the time to listen to me. In seconds he confirms no your car shouldn‚Äôt be making this noise. I‚Äôll have the guys do an initial check while they change your oil but we may need you to come back in. I said no problem. I came back for a scheduled appointment the following Monday and Randall checked in my car. He was polite and listened to me re-tell the story and got me in a rental with a minimal wait. He also took my car for a short test drive and reassured me that they could fix the issue. What I appreciated even more was that they put me in a Traverse. The exact car that I drive. Literally the service department bends over backwards to make you feel comfortable and at ease. Three hours later Randall gives me a call and they have found the issue. He gave me an estimate and my car was fixed within the SAME day. I picked up my car the next morning and was relieved to be back in a safe car. I can not say enough positive things about the entire team at Henna. They listen, they work hard, they are polite, and every single person goes out of their way to make the client happy. Dealers get a bad rep, but I will never go to another dealership or shop. Henna is hands down the best in Austin.  ",5.0
156,"July 23, 2019","I took my 2018 Traverse in for the first problem since I got it.  The vehicle has been wonderful.  But to make this worse, the problem was intermittent.  The service writer was great.  He took the time to listen to my explanation and wrote up a good description for the mechanic who found and fixed it..  During my wait, drinking Henna coffee in the comfie waiting room, the service writer kept me well informed of each step in the repair process.  Very nice.  Why would I ever consider taking my Traverse anywhere else?  By the way, I always go to Henna for oil changes and that has always worked out very well also.",5.0

He understood my needs and circumstances and guided me through the entire process. We all know how dreadful spending half the day at a car lot can be, but I thoroughly enjoyed every minute due to Tony‚Äôs outgoing personality and his ability to deliver exceptional customer service.

This time I purchased a Grand Sport Corvette, key word ""purchased"" so this time I cared. I hear horror stories of bad dealer experiences especially with Corvettes. When I first purchased it I went in to see if they had a specialized Corvette service guy and tech. I met Mark Wilson, their Service Drive Manager and Corvette Specialist and he told me about his Corvette experience and how he deals with the cars from the time I drop it off to where it's parked and who his service techs are.  He then gave me a tour around the place and spent about 30 minutes with me making me feel comfortable with him, his guys and Henna. I can say without question that these guys take great care of me.

The sales person we dealt with was nice until we told him we weren't interested in the Enclave.  We stopped at Ford before returning and the salesman we saw was rude.  So, back to Diana we went, bought the car we wanted (red Traverse Premier), and then met with Dean Fuller to discuss finance options.

235,"November 21, 2018","The man in the used car department for Henna was disrespectful towards me. He kept saying"" when you people file bankrupcy, you want something for nothing"". I guess because I am a Black Woman that has filed banckrupcy(which people do all the time, including rich people) then I deserved to get talked to like that..NO SIR!! Then he kept trying to put me in vehicles I did not want and was saying the banks dont want to take a chance on me. They mailed me 5 letters to come to this dealership because they""specialized in bankrupcy"". I got NO HELP!! Then everytime I asked the salesman a question he claimed I was trying to debate with him because I wanted him to explain things to me. I guess if I were a White Woman it would have been different(no offence) but RACISM is ALIVE and GOD don't like ugly. ",1.0
236,"May 08, 2018","I recently purchased a 2018 Chevy Colorado. Throughout the process of buying the vehicle I could not get Henna Chevrolet to leave me alone. I've now had the vehicle for a few months and there is a rattling sound in the drivers side door. The ""soonest"" they can get me in is three weeks from now, they will not provide a loaner vehicle, and every time I call in they transfer me around until I get a voice mail.  ",1.0
237,"April 11, 2018","If you're looking to buy a used car that you will immediately have to sink thousands of additional dollars into, then this is your place. 

First off the salesman I worked with, Julian, was a snake who was less than honest on several instances. After asking numerous times if the car I was interested in purchasing had been inspected and checked over for any mechanical faults or issues, he assured me that ""yeah it's been looked over, oil changed, brakes, tires, etc"" and went on to tell me how good of a car it was, per usual of a used car salesman.

Not even two days after purchase I noticed the heat was only hot on the driver side and the air blowing out of the passenger vents was ICE COLD. Off the bat, I let Julian know, who of course knew nothing about it and made no attempt to rectify the situation. I told him I would take it to my local dealer to have looked at and let him know the outcome. After getting a quote to the tune of $3,000, I called Julian to ask why this was missed on their ""inspection"" he claimed was done. It was the middle of winter, you'd think you would check the operation of the heat. Then he started to tell me the technicians at the factory-authorized dealership didn't know what they were talking about. Strange, you'd think Infiniti technicians would know a thing or two about Infiniti's. I asked him how we were going to rectify this massive expense because I bought the car under the illusion that it was inspected and had no issues, and now I have a $3000 tab within the first week of ownership. He said he would talk to his boss and let me know. 

Of course days went by with plenty of ignored texts, phone calls, and e-mails. Finally after countless calls, Julian answered a phone call with an attitude and essentially told me, ""tough luck, you bought a used car, you can bring it back and we will give you fair trade in price on the car for another one."" I told him that was not happening and I wanted to speak to the GM, which he insisted was going to tell me the same thing, and then hung up on me.

After being hung up on, I called the dealership again, getting patched straight to voicemails over and over. I finally told the receptionist to patch me through to a real person, not a voicemail, as this had been going on for nearly two weeks now. Finally got through to someone who actually seemed to care, took down my info and said it would be passed over to the Used Car Reconditioning Manager, Tim Hoffmeyer.

Over the course of another two weeks, without heat on the passenger side of my new car in JANUARY, playing phone and e-mail tag with Tim and having to forward my e-mails every day to get a response, they agreed to split the cost of the repair per ""Industry Warranty Standards"" which essentially means I pay 60% they pay 40%. He acted like he was doing me a favor. Every time I asked why this issue got missed on HIS reconditioning inspection, he avoided the question like the plague. 

All in all, two months later I was out of pocket nearly $1500 to pay for additional repairs to a car I was told was inspected and good to go. Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.",1.2
238,"February 25, 2018","Purchased a new truck and the buying experience was great, quick, easy and fast.  Then I took it in for the first ""free"" oil change and will never go back.  I waited for 2 hours for a 1 hour commitment and left the dealership to get my work done elsewhere.  I contacted them to try to work this out and that was joke, voice mail and receptionists and promises to call me back - never heard from them.  Many friends really liked my truck and I sent a few referrals to them.  Not anymore; stay away from this company.  They are your best friend until they have your money; then they disappear.  Even my email got a response of a canned letter stating they appreciated my comments and compliments; in response to anything but compliments.  They only return calls, emails and voice mails before you buy; after you get nothing.  My free oil change -not.  My 6 month XM Radio, 4 months, my free wireless for 1 year; 3 months.  What started as the best new car buying experience ended with the absolute worst in my life.  I was/am highly disappointed.",2.6
239,"December 21, 2017","Wanted to buy my 16yr old her 1st car. Settled on a 2013 hybrid Honda. Had to buy new tire right away. Thought I could wait until first oil change for check up; I'm a divorced father trying to keep things afloat. Before her car has driven 300 miles, it breaks down, my daughter stranded. My Henna salesman tells me my $2000 warranty is useless in this situation. After lots of back and forth he reluctantly agrees to pay half of cost and ""You should be glad. Most people would have told u 'sorry you're on your own.' No, I still believe most people wouldn't screw me over in the first place. They refused to get my valve adjustment done; spark plugs only. All I have ever owned personally is GM vehicles. That's why I chose to buy a used car from Henna. They know Lemon law only applies to new vehicles and take advantage of this fact. Opinion spoiled! Worst experience. Next time I'll go to CarMax. Never had an issue there that they didn't remedy without hassle. Henna seems to do just enough to get the vehicle to pass inspection so watch out!

240,"July 03, 2017","These guys tried to sell me a pre-owned vehicle with frame damage, and other issues caused by the accident, without disclosing the damage or the accident. I went back hoping they would foot the bill for repairing the damage but they insisted ""that was no damage"" even though this was assesed by a auto shop. The manager was extremely rude and outright lied. I was never showed a Carfax report or their ""vcheck"" which did have the accident in the report. I wasted a lot of time and money, missed work and damaged my credit with inquiries to end up without the vehicle due to their negligence and shady business practices.

255,"April 26, 2016","I was looking to make a truck purchase and it came down the the Ford F-150 and the Chevy Silverado. I had been doing my research and went to TrueCar.com to see what others were paying for their trucks. Lo and behold and soon as I finished my phone started ringing off the hook with every dealer in town trying to sell me a truck.

I knew what I wanted so I told every dealer I spoke with that it was going to come down to who gave me the best price. As a Real Estate Broker when negotiating on a property we eventually get down to a best and final offer. I explained to the dealers I was looking for their best and final and I wasn't going to play one off the other.

Levi Durst of Henna Chevrolet understood this best and along with his manager, Brian Birdsell, promised me they would give me the best price they could possibly offer. I started receiving offers from several dealers and even met with another dealer. But once I received the offer from Henna they told me to come in and see if they had a vehicle I wanted and they would sharpen their pencil as best they could on that vehicle.

I went in and sure enough Henna's price was a good $1800-$2300 less than the next best offer. Deal Done! I appreciated that Levi and Brian understood where I was coming from and I wasn't looking to play any games. They respected my wishes and didn't try any of the usual high pressure tactics.

This was my second purchase of a vehicle from Henna and they really wanted to keep me in the Henna family. I will be recommending all my friends to Henna when they are in the market for a new vehicle. ",5.0

311,"December 10, 2015","Having recently had an unpleasant visit to a Chevrolet dealership in South Austin (one in which I left feeling as though they didn‚Äôt particularly want to sell me a truck), I was apprehensive about continuing my search for a new Chevy Silverado.

Late one Friday evening a few weeks later, I decided to spend a little time on Henna Chevrolet‚Äôs website. After combing through their inventory using a few different search filters, I came across a feature entitled ‚ÄúCreate Your Deal.‚Äù I chose a Silverado 1500 that interested me, submitted some of my information and quickly received an email welcoming me to the dealership along with a statement of goals from Levi Durst, the Internet Sales and Leasing Manager at Henna.

Saturday morning I received a phone call from Mr. Durst asking if I thought I‚Äôd have time to swing by and look over the vehicle I had researched. We chose a time and he let me know he‚Äôd have the truck waiting for me out front. My daughter and I arrived in the late afternoon and by close of business that day she and I were driving back south (past the previously mentioned dealership) in my brand-new truck.

Upon first starting the buying process with Mr. Durst, he stated his goal was to make my Henna Chevrolet buying experience as smooth and enjoyable as possible. Indeed it was‚Ä¶ The atmosphere was very welcoming and pleasant. And, most importantly, Mr. Durst was both honest and understanding as to my needs as a truck buyer.

Many Thanks‚Ä¶

317,"November 22, 2015","Wanting to buy a new vehicle for our daughter's college graduation was the purpose of  ""our quest for the best"". We wanted a reputable dealership, a knowledgeable salesman, and the ability to do most of our dealing by phone or email. We live in the New Orleans, La. area,  but our daughter lives in Austin...so we were not able to do  the majority of the deal in person. We also wanted a convenient location for our daughter to take her car in for regular servicing.  JOHNSMITH@HENNA.COM was our salesman. He went the EXTRA mile in helping us decide on just the right vehicle.  Once we arrived in Austin, we met our daughter at HENNA CHEVROLET.  She is now  the very proud owner of a beautiful 2016 Equinox.  A great car for our TEXAS STATE UNIVERSITY graduate!   John was so helpful ...explaining in detail to our daughter all about her car, how everything worked, answering all her questions, being so helpful in every way.  It actually ended up being the very best car buying experience that we have  ever had...seriously.  in fact, when we get ready to buy our next vehicle, don't be surprised if we do this again even though we live over 500 miles away !!

Although I had already obtained financing from my credit union, they were able to obtain a lower  interest rate through another credit union. After a few hours, I had traded in my existing vehicle and left with my new one!  John was most helpful with setting up my Bluetooth and other features of my car.

324,"November 04, 2015","i have to say that my recent purchase at Henna Chevrolet was one of the least painful car buying experiences that I have ever had.  I contacted Henna online to confirm advertised pricing.  Levi (online sales) was quick to respond and provided required info.  It prompted a visit to the dealership where Levi was very attentive to my vehicle requirements and my pricing expectations.  After looking at a number of different options (all of which met my requirements) we agreed on a price that met my expectations for a Silverado that has exceeded my expectations..  Levi was more focused on listening to what I was looking for than high pressure sales.

Final paper work was quick and easy with a pleasant surprise the next day.  The finance manager called to let me know that he had spoken to the financial institution that would be handling the loan and they had lowered the originally quoted loan rate by 1/2.  That doesn't happen often.

I admit I hate buying cars because I always get the typical run-around of haggling and ""let me speak to my manager"" over and over, and buying a car ends up taking all day.  Levi was very up front, not pushy in any way.  When the lease deal we were looking for did not pan out, we told him to let us know if he could get the sales price to a specific number.  He worked on it while we ran errands and went about our day.  Once he was able to make it work, he called us and gave us the good news.  We arrived back at the dealership about 2 hours later, and all the financing paperwork was ready and waiting.  The total time I spent at the dealership over the course of the day was about an hour and a half, including the test drive.

351,"September 07, 2015","Normally you go into a car dealership and feel immediately pounced upon by one of the salesmen standing around and pressured to buy a car.  This is SOOO not what it is like at Henna.  In fact, I went in with some pretty specific demands and outside of my floor switch (you know, the 1970's one to turn on your brights?) I got everything I asked for, even though I think some of them stretched it.  They valued my trade fairly, 1000 over Carmax, got me a great financing term and my payments under 300.  And I got a great car to boot!

I think that my Salesman John and the Sales Manager really went to bat for me.  I feel like I got the best deal I could have gotten on my Equinox 1LT anywhere and what I wanted for my trade,  I feel they were very honest and worked hard to get my business.  Go see them!  I bet they do the same for you!

352,"September 05, 2015","Upon initially arriving the dealer to peruse the inventory, we were paired with Cecil who struggled to answer our specific questions.  He opted to hand us off to Craig Martinez who was very knowledgeable and excellent managing our limited time.  As I got into the process of customizing the vehicle Craig introduced me to James Caramanica who patiently led me through the pluses and minuses of all that's available with a Midnight Edition.  Once ordered, we visited the dealer to take delivery where we were introduced to the vehicle by Raul Guzman.  It was clear Raul was very busy on this Saturday but took the time to run me through the vehicle top to bottom.  Afterwards, we sat with the finance department and Fernando Duran.  The paperwork wasn't exactly the way we needed it so we agreed to meet again a few days later which is when we ultimately purchased the vehicle.  

That's my experience.  In a nutshell, I would recommend this dealership as they were any but pushy and completely accommodating.  Maybe the key is landing with the right sales person so I would recommend Raul and Craig if you're making requests.  ",5.0

All of the employees were very courteous and offering us water, coffee or soda. They kept us up to date as when the truck was in make ready and time it would take.

He constantly facilitated our needs to others within the organization who would assist us promptly and very thoroughly.  Craig was an incredibly up front personality with a unmatched care for people.  He helped us out from everything from the test drive and letting us borrow his car seat for our toddler, to answering phone calls about questions we had and then promptly following up with an answer.  
Later we met Karl, who listened to what our needs really were.  He then repeated it to make sure he understood everything, and then he truly cared about us and our family with our situation.  He didn't give up and say, well ok thanks for stopping in, instead it was ""ok where did we mess up and how can we fix it?"".  There was never a doubt that Henna couldn't meet our needs.  He clearly listened and then he followed up.  He was very persistant with making sure we were happy.  It was very refreshing how simple the whole process was with him and the staff at Henna.  As a result we returned right away to get some additions put onto our vehicle.
Lastly we met Fernando which was our financial guide and manager.  He was spot on with his greeting and meeting us, he really made us feel comfortable and was very considerate of our needs and wishes.  He was patient with us and our questions.

394,"April 27, 2015","We went in looking for a pre-owned Captiva, we actually found one with an LTZ package in San Antonio, and just wanted to see if the Captiva was a good fit size wise etc.  The salesman put my wife in a Trax to get a feel for the size of that smaller car, and when she pulled the car back into the parking spot after the test drive she saw the Equinox.  She asked about looking at that one, not pushed into it by the salesman, and she fell in love with the car.  And Richard Vogler, our salesman, was fantastic to work with!!  Knowledgeable , funny and VERY helpful!

The process from there was simple, another test drive, review of the options and price, which was fantastic, and we were done.

The sales team there was NOT pushy, and all the staff, from the front door reception team, to the finance guys were all top notch, professional, but friendly.......the perfect mix.

If you're in the market for a Chevy..........go see HENNA!!!

395,"April 23, 2015","We had such a good experience with the last truck we bought in 2012 that we didn't even shop anywhere else.  Got the same sales associate we had, which was encouraging as the longevity of his employment at this dealership must mean he is well taken care of as en employee.  I believe this filters down to the customer.  He was very helpful and was able to communicate with me in a manner that was extremely convenient for me.  We will purchase yet another truck from this dealer and will continue to recommend them and Craig!",5.0

410,"March 16, 2015","I never thought that I would be able to get a new car.  I always thought that my past mistakes would prevent me from finally getting something new.  And Craig and Dean went above and beyond any expectations I may have had.  I have referred multiple people to Henna since I left the dealership on Friday, and will continue to do so if their car buying experience is anything like I experienced.  As the title mentioned, from here on out, I will only buy my vehicles from these gentlemen.  Their professionalism, service, and willingness speaks volumes to me and any of my friends.  I cannot express my gratitude enough- Craig and Dean were absolutely the best people I interacted with during my car-buying experience, and I will certainly be coming back to Henna in the future.",5.0

434,"March 30, 2009","I have a 1998 Camaro that is nearing the end of it's life, unfortunately and until about 10 months ago, was a great car. I had a good experience at Henna in 2001 when I had a belt changed and thus went back when my car started having trouble and do not believe in their service anymore- do not have you car ""fixed"" here. I have had a lot of work done (June 2008, September 2008 and March 2009) and they clearly have not figured out the problems. The car has been well maintained and I am tired of having to keep bringing it back. In September, it broke down three times in 12 days and twice in three days this month (the second within 30 minutes of picking it up from Henna). I am out of AAA free services until my membership year starts over in June and cannot put anymore money into the car, as it is costing me more to maintain it than it is worth. I have had the recommended repairs done (one elsewhere to save money) and it stil runs only for a limited period of time, maybe 20 minutes and then likely overheats and shuts down...Henna will keep taking your money, but never actually fix your vehicle!",2.0
