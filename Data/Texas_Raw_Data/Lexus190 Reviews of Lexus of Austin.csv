0,"February 13, 2020","Hello,

I would say when I was there on Monday the 10th of February outstanding service by Victoria Brown and my service guy. But today when I called to get information about using your service again I was confused about the limited radius if a loaner vehicle. Since the service will take about a day or so from what I was told but I am in the military and station at Fort Hood which is well over the 50-mile radius. I get a better deal by renting a vehicle. Therefore, I had to go with Lexus in San Antonio. It is funny that the Lexus in Lakeway had no miles requirement which has the same ownership as Austin. I guess I'll make my service trips to Dallas where I had great service before and San Antonio. I just do not understand some business on how they make these outrageous requirements. ",1.0
1,"February 04, 2020","Surprise car shopping due to an accident had us looking at used cars.  We found one at Lexus of Austin and happily so because Mohammed Merchant worked there, who we had bought our previous car from at another dealer in Round Rock.  Both of our experiences with Mohammed was great. He made what was a very stressful time much easier.  His easy going nature and no pressure style makes the process bearable. We will refer anyone we know looking to buy to Mohammed!",5.0
2,"October 17, 2019","I scheduled an appointment for our Lexus to get the 50K mile service which includes an oil change and tire rotation as well as a few other inspection items. My wife drops off the car and the service tech tells her that the fuel injector service is part of the 50K mile service. Hearing this, she agrees to have the service done because I had told her that she was getting the 50K mile service. She does not ask if it will cost more, she assumes it is included in the 50K mile service because that's what she was told. Well, we were charged $170 extra for the fuel injector service.

I reached out via email to Jamie Kandziora the service adviser to explain what happened. No response. The service manager, Penny Boos, was also included in the email. No reply. I forwarded it to the general manager, James Crawley, same. IF YOU ARE USING THIS DEALER FOR SERVICE, ASK QUESTIONS. BEWARE OF THE UPSELL AND BE CAREFUL WITH WHAT YOU MAY INADVERTENTLY AUTHORIZE. They use old school word play to trick people into paying more. They prey on individuals who don't know vehicle maintenance. Never going back. Horrible customer service and way expensive. Advice, find a Japanese car mechanic and use a local business.",1.0
3,"October 14, 2019",My wife and I are very grateful for the customer service provided by Mr. Mohammed Merchants. We felt as we were at home with friends. Most of all the conditions he gave us to be able to continue leasing with Lexus and being a Lexus family,5.0
4,"October 07, 2019","I would like to thank Mr. James Crawley (GM) for immediately handling a situation that I had with his Finance department.  He was very professional and made me feel like a valuable customer.  He invited me to reach out to him anytime I have any concerns.  

I would also like to thank my Sales Consultant (Jay Lord) for going out of his way to assist me and show that he appreciate my business.  I was at another Lexus dealership (out of town) and was not treated with respect, so I didn't do business with them.

I really appreciate the way my situation was handled!

5,"September 15, 2019","I would strongly encourage and recommend my friends and colleagues if they are shopping for a vehicle to reach out to Mohammed Merchant at Lexus of Austin. I have been looking into trading my SUV and visited various dealerships but was unsure of the RIGHT vehicle that would fit my need. Apparently, my stop at Lexus of Austin turned out to be the final destination. I met Mohammed and found him extremely customer oriented and eager to go above and beyond. He listened to and recognized our requirements and provided professional guidance with integrity to choose the vehicle that would perfectly suit our needs. Mohammed made sure that we test drive various vehicles before making a final call. He was polite and clear while answering all our questions. With Mohammed’s assistance, I am now ready to lease my first Lexus. Thanks a lot, Mohammed and Lexus of Austin!!

I was in and out , with my new Lexus, in half the time it normally takes. I highly recommend Mohammed Merchant, and Lexus of Austin ",5.0

8,"February 13, 2019","I would not recommend purchasing a car at this dealership. The customer service is very poor. I have been waiting for my license plates for over two months after I purchased my car from them. I had to call them several times to check up on the status. The sale person said she would call me back and never did. A week before my paper plates were about to expire, I asked about the status and about renewing my paper plates. She transferred my information to the accounting office and said they would get back to me. No one got back to me. Two days before the plates expires, I went by the dealership and asked for renewal of my paper plates. They would not provide them to me and said my metal plates would arrive the next day. The plates never arrived. I was not able to drive my car to work the next day because my paper plates were expired.  Their reason for the delay is because their dealership just changed ownership. I will never purchase at Lexus has this dealership again and will tell my friends to avoid. They don't care about the customer after they sold you their car.",1.3

11,"August 15, 2018","WORST SERVICE- spoke with parts guys about pads that I purchased 4 months prior, the first guy I spoke with (Richard I believe) said no problem I will get them warrantied, then was reassured by the Asst parts mgr (Ben McLemore whom the GM didn''t even know who that was at first) that we could get it done. So I went ahead and purchased all new pads a shims for the front and rear this time with the expectation that the fronts ($50) would be warrantied when I brought them back after my store installed them. Was then called by Ben out of the blue who said he couldn't get it done any longer, so I asked to speak to the parts dir. (Jason Thomas) who doesn't have a customer service bone in his body, he hangs up on me( great service right) o then I call to speak with the GM (Steve Walker) whom was very thrown back by Jason's behavior and defended him. He minimized the $50ish to something we would leave for a tip (great for a GM to do whom makes close to $350-450k a year). But to him seemed trivial. Now Steve won't return calls and and is gone in hiding over $50 and making it right. Stepping over dollar bills to pick up dimes. My store has done things for way more even not at fault just to provide the experience. this is the worst experience for a store much less one of the ""luxury"" status they pitch. GOOD JOB STEVE your culture is great!! apparently he doesn't realize a bad review is worth more than a $50 ""tip"".",1.0
12,"May 26, 2018","I am disappointed with service at Lexus of Austin. Thanks to this dealership, I will have to make a second trip to have my car re-inspected, and they told me the car had passed. 

My car needed wiper blades to pass inspection. I took the new blades to Lexus to install so that my car would pass inspection. I also bought two new tires and a tire pressure sensor. When I paid my bill ($844), I asked about inspection and was told it had been completed.  Turns out, the inspection was not completed after they installed the wiper blades. 

When my husband called to find out why I was given misinformation and Lexus failed to complete the inspection, Cory said he didn't think I would want to wait another hour or two for it to be finished. This doesn't make sense because I HAD A LOANER CAR. We live 30 minutes from Austin and now have the inconvenience of returning for a job that should have been completed the first time with a service consultant that has yet to accept responsibility for less-than-satisfactory service.

Cory, I think you should have taken responsibility for the mix-up and made it right. Instead, you tried to hurry us off the phone. 
 
I bought my car from my dad when he bought a new Lexus. He has purchased seven so far, and this is not the service for which Lexus is known. I will be looking for a new car in the near future since mine is a 2006, and I will be sure to look for a dealership that provides a quality customer service experience. 

5/28/18 UPDATE: Our service consultant, Cory, has taken responsibility to correct this situation and get my car inspected as quickly as possible, even though it’s a holiday weekend. I appreciate businesses that correct mistakes.",2.2
13,"March 21, 2018","This is the worst service department I have ever seen
After 4 hours and $800 later I didn’t even get a car wash, I was told it would take 2.5 hours, terrible service 
I rather take my car to jiffy lube then see this place again ",1.0
14,"October 03, 2017",Once again I was told it would be 30 to 45 minutes to get a loaner car.  After 1.5 hours I asked about my loaner and was told I was still in the line for a loaner just a couple of people in front of me.  I waited another 15 minutes then asked for my own car back.  This has happened repeatedly over the last several years.  I just have had enough of Lexus excuses so I will not ever use Lexus of Austin again.,1.0
15,"September 29, 2017","Nicole Nance in pre-owned sales treated me like a VIP. Every concern I expressed was addressed, and I'm thrilled with both the buying experience and my new-to-me Cadillac SRX. Nicole made me feel like I was her only customer. I also appreciated access to the complimentary and luxurious coffee bar. I would absolutely purchase from Nicole again, and the treatment I received at Lexus was 5-star!",5.0
16,"September 05, 2017","I evacuated from Houston to Austin during Harvey. The day before I was scheduled to return I had 3 warning lights on my dash. I called the 800 number was directed to Lexis of Austin finally got my car to them about 2:30. 
On Saturday spoke to the service mgr, Eddy Cooke, explained my situation. My car was ready for pick up by 3:30  Not only did they throughly check for a problem, found none, but they took care of 2 recalls. ",5.0
17,"June 24, 2017","I had an took an appointment for car service,and when I got there it took almost 45 minutes just to get me to a salesman.They were supposed to give me a loaner car, which they hadn't because they were not available. After a while, they called me saying that my car was ready, and they would wash it for me, when I got there an hour later they don't have any clue about the paperwork and my car, to top it all off my car wasn't washed, and to wash it... I would have to go through a 45 minute wait.This was a very bad experience for me ",1.4
18,"June 18, 2017","I bought the Lexus RX350 which had very high Fan noise whenever I used the AC at first they would not do anything but after I talked to the Manager they actually went above and beyond to solve the issue and exchanged the RX350 with another one that was about $400 higher sticker price for same price. Dean was great and I would recommend talk to him as he is very calm and capable salesperson.

20,"October 10, 2016","Lexus of Austin and Kyle Dern are wonderful to work with. In fact, they are so amazing that I considered applying for a job there and I recommend them 110%. Autocraft Bodywerks referred me to Lexus of Austin in 2013 with a nightmare situation related to my 2006 Toyota Solara. Kyle was very reassuring and walked me through every step of the process to replace the engine in the Solara, which was result of a known Toyota service bulletin due to faulty engines put in that year and make.  There are no words to show how much I appreciate Lexus and Kyle. In 2016, Kyle went to epic status and helped me to speak with the buyer of my vehicle about the work that the Lexus Master Technicians completed.  Thank you so much, Kyle and Lexus of Austin. It's refreshing to work with a dealership that stands by their word.  ",4.8
21,"October 05, 2016","I am so very disappointed in the recent service I've experienced with Lexus of Austin.  

Due to an airbag safety recall for which Lexus did not have parts available, my car was put into mandatory storage (mandated by Lexus).  While in storage, MOLD grew inside my car covering every internal surface.  It was horrific.  When I brought this issue to the Lexus of Austin Service Manager's attention, his response was to ""call 1-800-Lexus"".  I then took my issue to the General Manager who was also unsympathetic.  Therefore, although I was required by Lexus of Austin to put my car into storage which resulted in the MOLD, they are providing absolutely no assistance in cleaning the MOLD out of my car and taking care of me as a customer.  This is the third Lexus my family has owned and we will not be buying any more.",1.0
22,"August 01, 2016",The people at the front desk at this establishment are very rude. They like to hang up on you without giving you any further information they don't connect you to the right department and when they do you get hung up on there as well. They have no etiquette as far as public relations with their customers. This establishment does not make you feel comfortable or like they are there to help.  Don't go there,1.0
23,"July 30, 2016","I bought a new RX from Blake at Lexus of Austin last month. Now I know buying a car can be a pleasant experience! The service has always been professional, respectful, and courteous. The dealership is clean, spacious, and upscale - you will not mind waiting for your car during service. Highly recommended if in the market for a new Lexus",5.0
24,"June 19, 2016","We've been buying new and used cars for ourselves for over 25 years and never enjoyed the process or experience until this time. We were frustrated from all the time spent with a different dealer in another city, some was beneficial, but we still felt so uninformed and confused. Then the wasted time, sitting in a room, waiting, and waiting, then being told car after car was unavailable. Finally in frustration we contacted Lexus of Austin via website and text, yes, a simple text, which I feared at first. Within 30 minutes we had more of a car than we wanted and got a very fair price.  Upon visiting the dealer the next morning, the information the salesman gave us was priceless. We felt it was a win-win on both sides.",5.0
25,"June 05, 2016","We bought a new GX 460 from Jordan Wilson this past Memorial Day weekend.  The experience that we had was absolutely amazing.  The process the smoothest that we've ever had - from sales through finance, through delivery.

They also gave us what we feel was a great deal on the car, better than any deal that we've received from other dealers in the past (and for reference, we've bought from BMW of Austin and Mercedes-Benz of Austin in the past).

26,"February 11, 2016","Buyer beware! These dealership is borderline fraudulent. They'll mislead you buy giving you wrong info. about pricing and if you are trading in BE CAREFUL! 

They just assume you're naive and won't comparison shop. They cannot compete with Houston/Dallas dealers and when you try and tell them to match price they'll try and belittle you!

Just a horrid experience. I'm a local Austinite - never will I shop for an auto here.  A 2.5hr drive to Dallas/Houston is well worth it",1.5
27,"February 03, 2016","I don't have time to write a long winded story. The bottom line with this dealership is ""we could care less"". That's their motto, or so it seems. Extremely rude and unprofessional. Dealt with Jordan Wilson in sales but soon she referred me to Michael Cobb (mgr) bec. she could not negotiate price.  Mr. Cobb didn't even bother to return my phone calls! Unbelievable. Instead he had Ms. Wilson call me.

Never will I set foot into this dealership again - after nearly 12 years of being a loyal customer. Now I go straight to Dallas/Houston where it's much easier to get a deal. ",1.4

36,"August 08, 2015","We've been going to Lexus of Austin for 4 years now and just leased a new 2015 GS 350 on 8/7. The sales staff was great. The repair and service area of the dealership is always packed and we've noticed in the last 6 months to a year that wait times (even with a scheduled appointment) are becoming longer. We love the fact that we get assigned a personal service rep when we bring our car in but we find that they aren't readily available to discuss or return calls because of the volume of people taking their vehicles in. We know Austin is growing, but the dealerrship will need to figure out a way to meet the Lexus level of expectation with the increased volume. For example, we scheduled to take our car in for service and scheduled to have a loaner available. We should have been able to drop off the car and get the loaner within 15 to 20 min, but it was over an hour before we received our loaner so we could go to work. With that being said, everyone is always very friendly and helpful and they offer a wonderful facility with a nice snack bar. Again, the only improvement I see is with managing the volume of people receiving service. Austin is going to continue to grow steadily so it will continue to get worse if alternatives are not explored.",4.4

Yates Phillips was the technician that showed all we would needed to know to operate and enjoy the car--very well done.  Steven Kilpatrick took us through all the paperwork and made it easy--very efficient.

55,"March 20, 2015","I was dreading the process of leasing a new car, as most would, but my experience with Lexus of Austin made it absolutely worth it.  After many trips to dealerships of all types, Lexus was by far the best experience and, to my surprise, easily the best deal of them all.  I almost did not visit the Lexus by assuming they would not be the best deal or affordable.  I was absolutely wrong and I am so glad I gave them a chance,

Brian was the least pushy salesperson we encountered and I never felt overwhelmed or pressured throughout the entire process.  They gave me an extremely transparent lease offer on an RX350 from the very start that was more competitive and surprisingly more affordable than non luxury dealers we visited.  They also offered the most on my trade ins.  

I will be recommending everybody I know, who is looking for a vehicle, to give Lexus a chance.  We love our new Lexus and the buying experience was top notch.  We look forward to the continued excellent customer service.",5.0

He set up a test drive,on my schedule,with a close colleague who was very accommodating. Over the next few days, as I was in contact with Dean regarding questions and additional visits with my spouse, he answered every question cheerfully, politely and effectively, without the pressure or insincerity car dealerships are often are known for. I am also very pleased at the value for my trade-in. Additionally, every visit to Lexus was efficient - they did not try and waste my time with long waiting periods or delays.

60,"November 21, 2014","RK Johnston went above and beyond customer excellence. I had picked out a certified pre-owned silver 250h through the internet, due to my busy schedule I was unable to come in to finalized the deal between my bank and the dealership which was over the course of two weeks. Well the day came after 2 weeks of back and forth, I finally was able to close the sale my bank said the car was sold, I called the dealership and sure enough it was sold. I was upset because my bank was in communication with Lexus of Austin Certified Pre-Owned Department.   

OK sooooo what just happen, I proceeded to print out all my emails showing that I confirmed that the car in question (that I have test drove with my 2yr old and 5yrs old, not easy task) that indeed was the car I chose- vin and everything. After I got over the fact my car was sold, I called to speak with the sales manager- RK Johnston

So RK wanted me to come in to discuss the issue. Again I was furious and had a full time work and family schedule so I made time for this, I usually never get this mad but I spent a lot of time researching the dynamics of this car and really wanted it- plus I have purchased a quite a few cars before and never had anything like this happen ever.

Here is what makes the difference between a sales man and a fantastic customer expirence. 1.) RK let me vent, then assured me that he would get that the same car after 45mins. 2.)He then proceeded to call every dealership in the state of Texas to find me that same car. 3.) Well by this time I had been in his office for over 1hr we started talking about my family his family his years in the car business. He really was making a difference in my attitude toward my experience becuse by this time it was about 3 hours of his busy schedule he took the time to dedicate to me.

He did not get my car that day but I walked away feeling great about the leadership he refered my to Jeff Pray to contact, but he would personally call me as soon as he had a new car, well it took about a day and called me. The car was upgrade to the one I lost, wow. I looked great and was more than I expected for the exact same price, I was so greatful. I told RK how happy I was.

Jeff Pray then proceeded to close the sale, it was really quick in and out about 40 mins. Jeff was extremely nice and our communication was great! I would highly recomend this dealership, again because of the leadership. Thank you RK this was a long time coming.

Kept within budget, were able to give us several options and were all pleasant, knowledgeable and got us in and out with out the normal dealer issues we've had in past car buying or leasing experiences.  Tier one service matching the quality of the car's they sell.  One amusing example of going the extra mile service wise- my wife was out of town so Elisabeth picked myself and kids up at our home to get our car and on the way over my youngest had lost his tooth in the back seat which was nowhere to be found.

94,"June 15, 2014","Excellent Customer Service for Excellent Product

As a car brand, Lexus does not need additional proof that it stands above the rest in terms of luxury vehicles. What you may not realize, however, is that Lexus also provides excellent customer service that is as luxurious as its product, if not more so. Last week, I purchased a car on my own for the first time. I'd known I wanted a Lexus, but I'd never directly dealt with dealers; I always had someone do it for me. This time, I got pre-approved for credit online and made an inquiry into the vehicle I wanted. Ross Rountree promptly emailed, called, and texted to let me know he was available for any questions. I was both eager and nervous to begin the process.  Unfortunately, I had a meeting to attend and wouldn't be able to call Ross, so I texted and he replied. He answered every question, gave advice, and offered a great price. Before my meeting was over, I'd pretty much sealed the deal to buy the car. Who would've thought that I could make a car deal over texts!?!? It was awesome and efficient.

The next day, I reported to Lexus of Austin where I was greeted pleasantly and dealt with professionally by every single person I encountered from the moment I exited my car to the moment I drove off the lot in my new car. Ross worked with me to finalize the process and gave me clear expectations of my whole visit ahead of time. He worked with me when I'd forgotten to bring my car insurance, gave me a great deal on my car trade in, and helped me out when I'd forgotten my checkbook for the down payment. Lesser professionals would've been exasperated with me, but not Ross--if he was, I never knew it. He was professional, patient, calm, and friendly every second.

Megan McDowell guided me through the financial process in a pleasant, friendly manner. She was extremely professional as she explained every step in financing my new car. When I complimented her and the rest of the Lexus employees I'd encountered on customer service, she shared how that is a huge priority at Lexus of Austin. It showed.

I shared with Megan how my mother, a former Lexus owner, changed over to Cadillac due to the poor treatment she received at ANOTHER Lexus dealer in another city (not Austin). Poor treatment and no honoring her former loyalty to Lexus led her to leave the brand. She regrets it, but refuses to return to that Lexus dealership. Why don't all people or businesses realize how important customer service is???

Finally, I met with Geri Flore who led me through a technology boot camp. She showed me how to use every button and dial with a good-natured sense of humor and laid back yet professional style.

I have never dealt with Lexus prior to this experience, but I know that it makes me glad I chose them for my car purchase. I'm certain all future encounters will be of the same exemplary caliber. By the way, my mom intends to return to Lexus, but I'll tell her to use Lexus of Austin this time!",5.0

96,"June 06, 2014","I purchased a 2015 Lexus 450h on May 31st, 2014 and my overall experience working with Ross Rountree, Master Certified Internet Sales Manager, and all staff I came in contact with at Lexus of Austin was OUTSTANDING!  I say this with all sincerity.  I highly recommend this dealership due to the fact that they go above and beyond the call of duty.  I’m not only a current Lexus owner, but a former Lexus owner who lives near San Antonio, Texas.  

I had an opportunity to communicate with Ross via e-mail, over the phone and in person on several occasions and I found him to be a genuinely nice person.  He was very easy to work with, and not pushy at all.  He was also very quick to respond to any questions I had.  I requested a particular model, as well specific interior and exterior colors, which were not available on the lot. Ross and his team worked hard to fulfill all my requests.  Ross even offered to deliver my car when it was ready.  I did not take him up on that offer, as I had other business to tend to in Austin anyway.  

When I picked up my car, I had an opportunity to work with Megan McDowell in the Finance Department.  This was also a nice, comfortable experience.  I’ve never had this type of experience at any other dealership.  She was informative without being pushy and was able to make the process much quicker than I expected.  

Next, I also had an opportunity to spend some time with Delivery Specialist, Mary Martin.  She is full of life and information regarding the operations of my car.  She did an excellent job giving me an overview of the car’s features.  She also told me I could call her with any future questions.  

Once I got home, I realized I left the remote control for my gate in my old car, which was traded in.  I didn’t have time call Ross until 2 days later.  However, when I did contact him, he responded immediately, and was able to get it into my hands in less than 24 hours.   
I have to say that my overall experience was phenomenal! I felt I should take the time to share this with others.  If you are in the market for a new car, Lexus of Austin is the place to go.  Ask for Ross Rountree, you will be happy you did!

We were immediately greeted by Dean R who listened to what we were looking for and in our price range. They didn't have many options for us since we were looking to stay under 10 K, however, he showed us a really nice looking 2009 Toyota Camry. I was wanting either an SUV or Mini Van for the space and the vehicle was a little over our budget (12,9). I told him that we really liked it, but I needed to go around to other dealers to see if I could find anything more in our price range. He told us it wouldn't last long, and that for the amount of miles (65K), the quality of the car, and the space it offered, we probably wouldn't find anything better than it, but understood our position. 4 cars and 5 hours later, I was back to purchase the Toyota. We had financing through USAA that was previously approved, but only up to 11,300 so I tried to get him to come down on the sales price just a little, but after explaining I was already getting almost 2 K off market value, and that he could get me the same financing as USAA, we went ahead and did the financing through Lexus.

113,"May 02, 2014","I purchased a 2014 GS350 FSport + from Ross Rountree at Lexus of Austin on March 29, 2014.  I worked with Ross over the phone and emails during the preceeding week.  I also shopped a couple of Houston dealerships as well during the preceeding two weeks.   During the period Ross was not pushy and was always eager to respond to any questions or negotiations.  I had mostly made up my mind to purchase in Houston since it was closer and we dont have a local dealer in our city.  I kept going back to Ross because he made me feel like I was his only customer and would always have an answer or solution to any questions.  Ross just had the ""do whatever it takes attitude"" and I am glad he kept looking for a way to close the deal.  When we made the trip to Austin to pick up the vehicle everything was as he promised with no surprises.  This was my first Lexus purchase and Ross made sure I would become a Lexus owner.  In the end I was given a great deal on a fabulous vehicle.  

The rest of the dealership was just as impressive.  My finance person was Matt Rutkowski.  Matt was very informative and took time to explain and answer my questions about the lease and warranties.  I also felt he had my best interest in mind when recommending warranties and other items.  My delivery was also excellent and complete. The vehicle was immaculate.  The dealership was impressive.  I dont believe I have ever been to a more friendly and top notch dealership.

Even after the sale Ross is quick to respond to any questions and willing to do what he can to assist.  I highly recommend him and Lexus of Austin for your Lexus needs.  I wish we had a local dealership with the amenities and the dedication of the employees at :Lexus of Austin.

Ask for  Ross for your Lexus purchases.  You will not be disappointed.

114,"May 02, 2014","After shopping for a Lexus LX470  for 6 months we saw an Ad on Auto Trader, we decided to email the internet salesman Dean Royal.  Dean responded with the most polite reply!  After discussing the condition of the truck he told us that it was extremely clean and was purchased and serviced there at Austin Lexus.  We then asked him for all of the service records, he sent those right away.  Not knowing Dean, my wife and I live in FL & NY we asked him if he minded if we had a third party inspection done by Auto PI who is right there in Austin, Dean agreed.  After a 600 point inspection we were told by the inspector ""You will NOT find a cleaner one"".  Dean from beginning to end was extremely polite and 100% honest and never pushy.  I say this because of what we have experienced for the past 6 months.  I would highly recommend buying your next vehicle from Dean, he even followed up after sale.  I've never been treated so well!  Even though we live out of state we will go to Dean Royal first for our next vehicle.  Thanks so much Dean.",5.0

There has been a change in attitude.

LEXUS OF AUSTIN CERTIFYS VEHICLE WITH EXTENSIVE BODY REPAIRS AND COLLISION DAMAGE With Collision work of $10000+ VIN: 2T2ZK1BA6AC019717 2010 Lexus RX350 lease to Lexus of Austin in October 2012. The vehicle has had the following repairs done: Hood repainted, Front Bumper Replaced/Rebar Replaced/Drivers Side Fender Replaced/Painted, Passenger front Door Repainted/Blended, Rear Passenger Door Skin Replaced/painted/ Rear quarter panel Painted, Rear Bumper Replaced. Multiple Suspension Damage Also. This car has been to the body Shop 3+ Times with total amount of damages exceeding $10000.00. The collision damaged was disclosed to Randy Hoff our sales consultant. He gives us a VERY LOW trade-in value and told me that the vehicle would go to auction and could not be certified by Lexus. To my surprise I see it listed for sale on their website as “Certified Pre-Owned” I checked the service records and it was in fact certified by Lexus Of Austin. This Vehicle Was certified per service records on 10/22/2012. 




Absolutely the worst sales and service experience at Lexus of Austin. They will screw you over. The Service manager charges unreasonable amount for service concerns and is Arrogant and Rude. The Sales Manager will not match any prices and claims their service is the best in town and i should pay extra. He will not match surrounding Lexus Dealerships. Michael Cobb then told me i should trust his pricing and was ""insulted"" and Upset that i would show him a competitor quote. He tells me i should trust his pricing. He told me i should be able to afford the $6000+ difference in Price from Sewell Lexus Quote. The Service Department is a Joke. They Provide Old dirty Loaner cars (Soda Spills Everywhere, Dirty/Muddy interior, High Mileage old loaner with damage everywhere) when the top of the line New Lexus is brought in for service. They take forever to get me a loaner. They Took over an hour the last time i visited them.  They charged me a hour for labor to program a key and spent no more than 10 minutes  to program my new Lexus. When these concerns are brought to the attention of the general manager/Service Manager they told me I would get poor service when the vehicle is not bought from Lexus Of Austin. I recommend going to Sewell Lexus in Dallas. You will save Thousands by going to Sewell and get better customer service and not treated like Garbage. I have personally saved over $6000 on a single transaction by not buying from Lexus of Austin. Warning to others who purchase their vehicle from other  Lexus Dealers than Lexus Of Austin.

We could not have been more wrong. As I said to my wife, ""It is like hanging out in the first class lounge at an airport"". Daryl Do Carmo sold us a car not through sales tactics, but through his knowledge, professionalism and courtesy and it sure does not hurt that he is selling such a high-quality product. Mercedes lost a sale and has a lot to learn in so many ways from Lexus of Austin. Good on you!",4.8

169,"July 25, 2013","I came in to the dealership and gave Corbin and Randy the challenge of putting me in a new car.  Both were professional and did a phenomenal job, despite the obstacles (namely, my hardball-negotiating father).  They stayed with me through every step of the process, making sure I received the best service possible, up until the minute I drove off the lot.  They were fair and made sure I got a great deal, but above all else, they made sure I was happy with the entire process.  I have never owned a brand new car in my life until yesterday, and these two made it possible and made me actually want to buy a car again (though not right away, have to enjoy this one for a while first).

173,"June 28, 2013","Avoid service adviser - Jim T.  He was rude from the beginning and lies.  We filed our service request on the Lexus of Austin website.  When we got to the dealership we were rushed towards our loaner w/o meeting with the SA.  When we did receive a call from Jim we discovered that LoA had only worked on 1 of 3 service items requested... and they could not recreate the issue.  What about the other two issues?  Well this is where the ""blame game"" started.  Jim supposed could only see 1 of the 3 service items requested.  We checked their website and all 3 requests were still there so I visited him with a physical printout.  This time he blamed it on their IT department... and that we should have visited him before leaving the dealership in the 1st place... Agreed I thought that was strange but their service person handed us keys to the loaner car and insisted that we did not need to speak to the SA as they had all off our information.  Obviously following their service advise/direction is not the right thing to do... the only way to do business with these people is to second guess everything they tell you.  I did meet with his service manager, Paul C., but no real help here unless you consider his business card ""help""... seemed like we're just another unsatisfied customer to him... 

After we rec'd the car back from service we never saw a customer satisfaction request.  No phone survey from LoA nor from Lexus Corporate.  I contact their service manager again... ""customer sat survey's are random"" so we randomly did not get a survey... how convenient for LoA.  I emailed Lexus Corporate... no response.  We've been loyal Toyota and Lexus owners for 21 years with 3 Toyota SUV's/trucks and 1 Lexus SUV on our driveway.  We've also own a Porsche 911.  When my wife's Lexus GX470's warranty expires we'll be switching her over to Porsche.  It's a night and day difference with regards to the service experience there and vehicle performance.  Adios Lexus... Ironically we've see stellar service from Toyota over the years.  Go figure.  I suppose Lexus is banking on the fancy coffee bar at their dealership to cover up for the lack of service and customer courtesy.

174,"June 07, 2013","I recently purchased the 2013 Lexus 450h from the Lexus of Austin Dealership.   Prior to actually selecting a vehicle, I visited the dealership several times and quickly began to feel like part of the Lexus family.   Each individual I spoke with were very knowledgeable about the product and appeared genuinely interested in helping me select a vehicle that best fits my need.

Ultimately, I worked with Daryl Do Carmo.  Working with Daryl was an awesome experience!  Aside from being extremely knowledgeable about the product, he possessed a calm confidence that was second to none.  In addition, Daryl was patient to a flaw.  I called him regularly before and after taking delivery of my vehicle.  Each time Daryl showed the same interest and patience while offering many helpful suggestions to address my concerns.   He provided various websites which offered helpful information about luxury  vehicles in general. Since Daryl did not just show a bias toward the Lexus product it helped me to believe in the product even more.  

After taking possession of my vehicle, I was introduced to Mary and Ryan.  Ryan facilitated the loan process with ease.  My purchase took place after 6pm on a Thursday.   Although  I did not have all the documents handy that day, Ryan was able to work with my bank the following business day to complete the loan process.  

 Mary can only be described as the guru of all things Lexus.  Not only did she possess a superior knowledge about all the bells and whistles on the vehicle, she had a wonderful ability of sharing that information without making the listener feel uncomfortable.  Daryl, Ryan and Mary are fantastic employees and I highly recommend them if you are looking for a superior car buying experience.

175,"May 28, 2013","John Jenkins honesty sold me on this place! The moment we drove up he walked out to greet us, didn't judge us for wearing completely casual clothes especially since it was 90+ degrees out, and really took time for us. His associates I can't say the same for especially since they kept coming and inerrupting us to let him know he had other customers as if to say we weren't good enough to be there. John made sure we didnt leave with any unanswered questions and made sure we felt like family! 
The place itself is extreamly beautiful and the service department was top of the line towards all of their guests. (I stood there for about an hour and just watched them interact with the clients and each other.) If you are looking to buy a Lexus, honestly this is the place to go and this is coming from someone who didn't buy at this time. Will from this dealer if that is the route I go!",4.8
176,"May 16, 2013","We rarely write reviews but every once in a while you feel like you need to do something more than just shake a persons hand and say thank you. OK, here goes... My wife and I owned a Lexus in the past. The vehicle and service from Lexus of Austin were quite good. Our current car is from a three letter company that starts with B and ends with W. It's a reasonable car but far from the ""ultimate experience"" it's advertised as. Anyways, when the time came to look for something new we went back to Lexus to begin our search. If we had read the reviews here before arriving we would have asked for Daryl right away. We didn't, but lucky for us, he was the guy who met us at the door. Daryl is perhaps the lowest pressure sales person we've ever met. His knowledge of their vehicles is exceptional. The test drive and discussion of options went very smoothly. We don't make decisions quickly, that's me, but after a few days we had narrowed our choice down to a black IS 250C or 350C with saddle interior. Unfortunately there are relatively few of these available. So began the search. I really think Daryl is thrilled by the challenge of fulfilling his customers wishes. A car was located at another dealer. Before it was to be transferred we discussed price. After some research we made an offer which we thought was reasonable. It was accepted. Hurray, right? Unfortunately the other dealer wouldn't release the car as they had a customer interested in it as well. More searching turns up few options. Days go by. The prospect of waiting 3 months for a car to be ordered from the factory did not make us happy. Daryl persevered. Two days later we receive an excited call from Daryl. The other dealers customer had failed to get financing so the vehicle was available. In fact it had already been delivered to L of A. Almost done... We finally see the car and it's gorgeous. Except... It has a different set of rims than what we wanted. By now it's 7:30pm and the place is closing down. As I said, Daryl thrives at making his customers happy. ""Let me handle it"" he says. True to his word, we return the next day and the service department swaps out the rims at no cost. Buying a new car should be a special event and that's definitely what our experience was. Thanks Daryl!",5.0
177,"May 16, 2013","The Lexus dealer here in Austin Texas have shady people and practices. We went in for an advertised lease special and the offer on the car was nowhere near this price ($200 higher than the special).  We kept having to remind them multiple times we were there for the special advertisement and they kept coming back little by little with price breaks but still ended up nowhere close to the price of the special.  They were shorting us on our trade in value (5k less than it's worth according to several other dealerships) and then tried to put us in a demo unit that had scratches on it and had a sticker on the key FOB that said ""Smells bad"".  The sales guy tried to mislead us by saying he had the car there with the widows down for us ready to be inspected...said nothing about the bad smell and they were stupid enough to leave the ""smells bad"" sticker on the keys.  They also denied many times that this was a demo car and refused to even refer to it as a ""used"" car or ""demo"" car when it had over 1000 miles on it.  They kept trying to tell us that this is ""the"" car they use for test drives.  It had permanent dealer plates on the car and I suppose they are arrogant enough to forget we were just there the day before and test drove a different unit.   It is clear they do not have the customers best interest in mind. We ended up spending more money on a different brand car who made us feel valued and were honest with us from the beginning.",1.4

They don't bug you, but they do make you feel very welcome.  It is a very warm and friendly place.  After purchasing the car, we were introduced to a Lexus Technology Specialist, JORDAN OUBRE.  She was great!!
We are 60 years old and our new Lexus has all the toys on it - navigation system, bluetooth. Lexus Enform, etc.  JORDAN was so patient with us and explained everything so that we really understand it.  And if I did have a question on something, she showed me how it worked and I really understood  it.  I have to say, that I am enjoying all the technology on my new car because thanks to Jordan, I can work everything.  And it is so much fun - thanks Jordan.

179,"April 27, 2013","My husband was looking for a new car and we just couldn't find anything we just loved in our price range.  4 months ago we bought a new Lexus ES 300 H at Lexus of Austin.  We absolutely loved the car and realized we were probably comparing everything to this car.  We didn't really want to spend that much money on our 2nd car though.  After unsuccessfully looking around, I called DARYL DO CARMO who sold me our Lexus.  We had such a great experience with Daryl the first time, we figured we would see if there was anything he could come up with. He is a wonderful auto salesman.  He really knows his products and you can tell how much he loves his products as he is so enthusiastic.  He can explain anything about the cars to you and he is very honest telling us both the pros and cons of every car we looked at. Never in our wildest dreams did we think we would be buying a 2nd Lexus!  But thanks to DARYL we ended up with the perfect car for my husband.  He got the IS250 with the sports package and we were able to get a very affordable price.  Actually it is the same price as the cheaper cars we were looking at.  My husband absolutely is loving his new Lexus.  It drives like a dream and is just gorgeous - check it our on the internet.
DARYL - we just want to thank you again.  I still cannot believe that you were able to help us get 2 Lexus's! I know we wouldn't have been able to do this without you.  And we love having our cars serviced.  The Lexus dealership is so accommodating.  It is easy to make appointments and they are very punctual.  I have been taking advantage of the free car washes (they wash them by hand).  The waiting room is great, with all kinds of goodies for the customer.

However, from the moment that Daryl shook my hand---within seconds of me entering the dealership, I could not have had a better experience over the next few hours! Daryl was knowledgedable, courteous, and had MY desires as a top priority throughout the process.  He never pressured me, and he was a truely wonderful and genuine person.  He helped me every step of the way---to do exactly what I asked.  It began with a seamless test drive, where he answered all questions, and then he found my car!  He and Lexus exceeded all my expectations not only on the new car, but on my trade in ---a car very special to me for over 6 years.  Daryl kept saying ""Don't worry""...and he was exactly right.  It was as if he took me by the hand, and then made all my expectations come true.  By 8:30 pm, I was driving out in the most beautiful Lexus I had ever seen...and Daryl and the fabulous staff at Lexus made this all come true on my very first visit.  I had done my research on line, and I could not have been a more satisfied customer.    Thank you Lexus and Daryl!!!!!!

183,"December 22, 2012","I had a Lexus ES300 for 10 years.  Last week my husband said he thought I should get a new car.  I was resistant as I love my car and it still runs perfectly and have  had no problems in 10 years. We went into Lexus of Austin just to look.  We met Daryl DoCarmo right away and he showed us all the new cars and gave me a great tutorial on all of them.   He was very  knowledgable and patient and I could tell how excited he was as he was explaining how the car works to us.  I am very particular about color and details. Before we left, he was very conscientious about  letting us know what colors were available and what shipments were scheduled to be delivered.  After we left , I was waiting to get the ""sales job"" with phone calls, emails, etc.  Daryl never pressured us  - he communicated with us only to see if we had any questions or concerns he could address. We checked around at other dealerships before we purchased at Lexus of Austin.  Daryl emailed me yesterday to tell me the color combination I wanted had actually just  come in.  The dealership closes at 7pm and we didn't get down there until 6:45.  We loved the car.  We drove out of there at 8:30 with our beautiful new car.  Everyone stayed late to accommodate  us.  I told Daryl to go home as they showed us how everything worked but  of course he was the last one to leave.  He wanted to make sure we didn't have any questions.

185,"November 27, 2012","We just purchased a Lexus RX350 from Lexus of Austin.  I must say this was one of the most pleasant car buying experiences we have ever had.  Originally we went into the dealership just to size the different models and had expected to try a couple of other dealers before making a decision.  Daryl was great in that he made sure that the vehicles we looked at would meet our needs.   In addition to being very knowledgeable about the Lexus products he was patient and attentive.  This was rather different from some of the other dealerships that either tried to push features we didn't really need or tried to convince us we didn't really want the features we wanted.

Once we decided to go with the RX350 the buying process was very smooth and hassle free.  The finance department was equally pleasant.  The paper work went very quickly and we weren't bombarded with pitches to buy a bunch of add-ons.

We drove off very pleased with the new vehicle and very impressed with Lexus of Austin.
