Good afternoon sir, this is Kathy Fellows. 
I bought a 2019 Ram 1500 on March25. I traded my 2016 Jeep Wrangler white, and your financial managers didn’t take care of it til April 10. I was receiving phone calls about late payment. Not only they send the wrong amount, but to the wrong address as well. Now there’s a balance that still hasn’t been paid which is the interest from the two weeks it took them to payoff the car. Not only is the vehicle already posted online, but I have not gotten a phone call from Jeremiah or Bryan. They are always busy with a customer or at a meeting, the receptionist has send them multiple emails about my call. And not once have they called me. It’s 3 months later and this situation hasn’t been taken care off. This is the worse customer service I have received. I have bought 3 vehicles and never had this issue. So sad of a dealership to have managers not return your call and avoid you.Please help, get this situation fixed, I am not paying for someone mistake and being Irresponsible. 

Very annoyed Customer.

1,"July 02, 2018","The most helpful group of employees I have ever experienced in a car dealership. The quality of service is so outstanding I literally drive from Forney, TX to Carrolton to get both my car serviced. I purchased both my Kia's from this facility. This is by far the best dealership as it pertains to sales, car service/maintenance  and customer service. Every aspect of this facility is SUPER FANTASTIC! ",5.0

3,"September 29, 2015","Tony Bailey and Team where great to deal with.  Most all of the transaction took place over the phone and could not have been smoother.  I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a new car and a great customer service team.  I'm not one to write much online, and to read some of the negative comments kinda floors me due to our experience there.  Tony was the most professional person I have ever met and would love to have him on my own team at my work.",5.0
4,"September 03, 2015",Excellent I was very pleased with the whole outcome. Did not feel pressured into buying a car. My salesman was phenomenal in making sure I received the best deal that was going to work for me. He was very professional and very nice. I would definitely go back and buy another car from there with Alfonso as my salesman. I will most definitely recommend this dealership to people.,5.0
5,"August 29, 2015","If I could give zero stars I would Please do not buy a car from this dealership or use their service department better yet do not buy a KIA

My son has a 2014 Kia Optima -- engine died. At the time he took the car to this dealership he didn't know what was wrong with it but he knew there was something wrong since the car just died in the middle of a highway. 

He called all the nearby dealerships and everyone one of them said it would take a week just to look at the car because they are so busy. This one said they could look at it within two days.

They determined that the car needed a new engine and it took two weeks for them to decide not to honor their warranty. I have read on numerous sites that KIA will do anything to void the warranty so their whole slogan about having the best warranty is not to be trusted Do your research and you will find that to be the case.

After the two weeks, we were told that they would be happy to charge us $7,000 to replace the engine but that it would take 5-7 weeks to finish the work. That's in addition to the two weeks it took them just to figure out what was wrong with it and that they would not stand by their product.

Of course my son needs a car to drive to and from work so is he supposed to rent a car for 9 weeks while they get their act together? Can you imagine the cost of renting a car for that amount of time?  

It seems to me if the service departments in the entire area are so busy that they can't even look at a car for week, that the following must be true: Their cars break down often and/or  they do not staff the service departments with enough people to handle the demand.

Needless to say he decided to take the car to another mechanic who will fix the car within a week for half the price, The mechanic believes that the engine failure was not caused by lack of maintenance after looking at the car as KIA tried to tell us but the synthetic oil issue.

Note -- He did change the oil but was only able to find four receipts but I was told even with the receipts they would not have honored the warranty.

And as a parting shot they wanted $118 for the diagnostic work and I was told that the car was locked up in the back until we paid so that we wouldn't ""steal the car"" 

Really how can you ""steal"" your own car so we paid the ransom but we will tell everyone we know to steer clear of this place unless you like bad customer service and condescending technicians telling you that everything is all your fault.",1.2
6,"August 03, 2015","Bought a expensive used car got home and saw the back seat belt was broken when I asked them to fix it and the AC slider and had a chunk missing out of my tire and some weird defect on my trim that they hide from me ! they were giant jerks and said ""Nope we already lost to much money on this car"" which is a LIE no dealer loose money on a car sale ! And I asked for a air cap for my tires they brought me ONE !! And I needed 4. The sales man Alfonso said they'd take care of something minor like that but when I asked they refused !!!! I'm embarrassed to tell ANY ONE I bought my car here !!! But if it will save one person from making a horrible mistake to give this dealership money it's worth it to me I will never buy a car here again !!!  ! ",1.2

From Patrick C. in internet sales to Jack and Bill in service, to Jason in finance!  They have bent over back words to help with whatever I need.  I am without a doubt a customer for life!

H3 Hummer was costing me a FORTUNE. I knew I only had a few payments left, but really wanted something smaller and more economical. I received something in the mail for Central Kia in Carrollton and decided to see what they could do. I have to tell you that my credit is not good at this time in my life and I just started working for myself. Needless to say, I was a shot in the dark. Patrick Connolly was the sales manager helping me. I was treated with respect and understanding the whole time. They worked with me and had me driving off in my Kia Soul in less than 3 hours!!! Thank you Patrick Connolly and everyone else at Central Kia for helping me!! I highly recommend!

I worked with Patrick Connolly and Scott (finance) and they were both very friendly and caring to my situation. They explained EVERYTHING to me regarding the sales process and were able to really give me a great deal for my vehicle. This was my first new car purchase and I will definitly go back to Central Kia of Lewisville for my next purchase. Everyone was exceptionally friendly and I can say this was the best car buying experience I have had. Patrick was very respectful of my time and when I arrived to sign my paperwork, the vehicle was already washed, gased up and detailed...ready for me to drive home! I recommend Central Kia and especially Patrick C. to work with. It was truly the easiest transitions I have ever experienced. Plus, the vehicle I purchased is excellent and far exceeded my expectations. Thanks again Patrick! ",5.0
13,"June 19, 2014","My wife and I were looking for a new vehicle because our van was giving us a lot of problems. We went to see Tony Bailey at Central Kia in Lewisville and we couldn't be happier. We purchased a 2014 Kia Sorento which is absolutely perfect for our family of 5! Tony Bailey and the staff at Central Kia worked with us to find the best vehicle for us and we didn't feel pressured to buy a vehicle that was more than what we needed or could afford.

15,"June 03, 2014","We bought a 2014 Kia Soul + model last week. This was our first Kia purchase, and we were blown away by the level of customer service. Cornelius was very friendly, knowledgeable and patient.  He spent a lot of time with us explaining all the features of the car during our test drive. He let the car sell itself and was not pushy at all.  He was very respectful of our time and understanding of our situation.  When the deal had been agreed upon, Cornelius worked quickly to get all other team members working to get us out of the dealership as quickly as possible.  It was the fastest that we've ever gotten out of a dealership.  We’ll certainly be back to Central Kia the next time we are in the market to buy.  If you're in the market for a Kia, go here and ask for Cornelius Love.  You won't regret it!",5.0

28,"June 13, 2013","I needed a bigger vehicle because I have kids and my small car wasn’t cutting it anymore. I wanted a SUV but was skeptical because the last time I purchased a car I wasn’t able to get what I wanted, only what I “qualified” for. Also my trade in was upside down so I knew my chances were slim. When I pulled up at the dealership Ed was standing outside and he greeted me with a warm smile and shook my hand. I explained my situation and told him I needed help. He said “let’s see what we can do.” Long story short I came there in a 2010 Ford Focus and left in a 2014 Kia Sorento!!

Between him and the finance person, Chase Bradley, they were able to get us the make and model of Kia we REALLY wanted for the EXACT price we needed. Everyone was so accommodating. I have to eat every two hours, and ran out of snacks, so Harley went and got me lunch and provided us continually with bottled water throughout our experience.

42,"May 29, 2013","First off let me say that Ron Jackson was the most responsive salesperson I ever encountered. I received a text immediately after my inquiry online but chose to visit another Kia dealer first based on the negative reviews I read about Central Kia. However, that dealer didn't seem all that interested in helping me. I headed over to Central even though I had an appointment later that day and only had about an hour to spare. I was met on the lot by Kent Park who was very helpful and setup a test drive of a used Sportage. Darryl and Chase both stopped in the office to greet me to make sure I was being taken care of. Since I have been car searching for about a month (different ""brands"") and no other dealer would/could get the MSRP where I wanted or give me enough for my trade; I really didn't think the deal could happen. However, Chase and Ron came over and said we can make this happen on a NEW Sportage and get the numbers where they need to be.  So I left my information and within about an hour they had the deal ready. Not only did they get the numbers 100% right they secured a rebate from Kia. I picked up my NEW 2013 Kia Sportage on Monday. Ron allowed me until Tuesday to sign the paperwork so I could speak to my credit union about the pre-approved financing I already had and get all my ""ducks in a row"". I showed up Tuesday night and even though I had to wait for a finance person; Ron greeted me at the door and then another person stopped in the waiting room just to make sure I was ""taken care of"". In the end I wound up financing LESS than the original sticker price.",5.0

52,"March 04, 2013","If you are reading reviews I assume you are looking for a vehicle and trying to narrow down where to buy so my 1st advise to you ... please do not ignore the negative reviews , I did that and paying the price.  I ignored the negative reviews thinking that may be people who do not have good credit history or enough cash at hand get mistreated or taken advantage off..as I have neither problem and I went in ready to write the check in full , I thought I would  have no trouble ( I did finance as interest rates are so low but refinanced within no time at 1.49% as I didn't wanted to do anything with any of Central Kia affiliates based on my experience during purchase process ) .. I was wrong !!!! Bas people can turn a good deal bad in no time.

2nd .. if you have no other option but to buy from this dealership only .. keep enough money in pocket to hire an Attorney not because you want to sue them because they will make you ... Below is my original review I wrote ... the sales person called me within 10 minutes of writing the review ( didn't call for 4 days on follow-ups , they care more of the review than providing good service in 1st place so that people won't have to use this to make them do what they should have done by simple request ) .. but wait he didn't call me to say sorry that it took time and he was taking care of it  .. nope ..  he called me to tell me ""you will hear from my Attorney"" .because I wrote the review. WOW !!! I am waiting to receive the notice till 03/19/2013 to see who is suing ( the individual or the dealership) and for what damages to give them a proper fitting reply at appropriate forum.

After some 15+ email exchanges (I will rate some as borderline  hate mail)  out of which 8 were directly at their GM level, I have finally an email which states the original issue for which I wrote and followed-up will be fixed ( still waiting for updated docs to see that it really happened) ..  Hurray ... what victory !!! But wait .. at what price ?  What about the abuse and threat hurled at me ?  Their GM reply is that he doesn't have capacity to resolved it !!!! Well , may be the owner of Central Kia kept that with himself , I have requested Central Kia of Irving ( I understood this their Corporate office) to provide me his contact details so that I could understand from him if this is an acceptable behavior and this is how they really deal with clients.

Meanwhile, to setup the servicing of my Kia going forward, I contacted another Kia dealer in the area.  Without giving him any vehicle identifiable info but just telling if a bit of what was going on and why I wanted to setup servicing with them..  the person said ..  you must have purchased it from Central Kia ..  so this is the reputation they have among their fellow dealers.  During this conversation I learnt one more thing that if you are looking for a specific vehicle which is not available at a good dealer , go to a dealer with good ratings on websites like this and they have ways to arrange to get that vehicle transferred so that you don't have to go thru this kind of pain dealing with bad people. So you do have options , I wish I knew it earlier.

My opinion of Central Kia  of Lewisville based on this purchase is that this is very immature organization who is aiming at people with not so good financial condition as those are the people who could be exploited easily.  They use ""Blow hot & cold"" use ""Carrot & stick""  policy , got habitual of this behavior and now it has become part of their DNA and they can't even distinguish among clients on when they may or may not be able to get away with this. They need a overhaul or they will be out of business but after giving some more people unnecessary heartburn.

While searching for a Law Firm to defend me ( if and when I receive the legal notice Mr. Bradley threatened me with) I came to know of a Law firm in Dallas who seems to becoming experts dealing with Central Kia..  They have specially listed cases they have/had against them !!!! 

So if you can't afford an Attorney or don't want the unnecessary headache you would be smart to consider scratch/ delete/ skip options....  

Best of Luck with your vehicle purchase !!! Buy the vehicle but don't let dealership run it over you !!!!

Original review :

Except for having the vehicle I was looking for this dealership couldn't do a single thing right till now ..  Sell it and forget it is their motto ...  and then you will be dealing on your own with different KIA affiliates to get it corrected.  I purchased my vehicle on January 19,2013 ... the Kia roadside assistance plan documents I receive states that I purchased the vehicle on Jan. 1,2012 .. Till now I have been shunted between KIA Customer service , Fidelity extended warranty department and Cross Country Motor Club CS ... multiple time with nobody having a clue what to do.  Sent email to Mr. Chase Bradley, the person I dealt with for finance and paper work during purchase. After initial email that he will look into it .. no more response even on follow-up.

There are other numerous things ( e.g. They listed the vehicle have Bluetooth , but it doesn't and they want me to spend $375 to get it installed!!!) I can list which this dealership did wrong and I would term as deceptive business practices at the time of sell of vehicle but to save you time ..  I would just say to avoid this dealership at every cost.

I had good feelings about Kia based on my past experience of rental of a Kia Sedona and that is why I decided to purchase KIA.. but looking at their broken processes and if this is how their dealerships and customer service operates ..  this may be my last KIA  vehicle ... 

So if you don't want pain after buying a vehicle scratch this dealership from your list ...  ",1.0
53,"September 22, 2012","This place is HORRIBLE!!! On September 1st, I took my truck in to trade on a new Soul. My truck payment was due on September 5th. I did not have the money to pay the truck AND put a down payment on the car. So, the salesman suggested that I use the truck payment to put down on the car and that they would pay the balance of the truck to the other finance company. So, I turned over the keys to the truck and signed the paperwork, left the lot with the new car. I called the finance company I financed the truck through to let them know that I traded the truck in the day after I got the car. The finance manager said that I needed to bring in a few more documents to finalize the deal. I was two days late bringing the paperwork back to the dealership but when I did take it in, the guy I gave it to said that they needed it so fast because they had already sold the truck. Ok, great!! Well, here it is THREE weeks later.... I get a call from the finance company I financed the truck through today and she told me that I was late on my September truck payment. I asked her if the dealership has been in contact with them and they said that they have not heard a word from them. I called the dealership after speaking with the truck finance company and the people at Kia told me that they still have not gotten my loan for the new Soul funded yet!! WHAT???????? THREE weeks later and I have not been approved for a loan yet???? So, I told the guy at Kia that I was just going to bring the Kia back and that I wanted my truck and the money back that I put down on the truck. They said ok, come on in.... we went to the dealership and they REFUSED to give me the truck saying that I signed a BINDING contract..... What contract? A contract that I dont even have a copy of?????????? They say they mailed it........ What dealership MAILS a contract???? When we bought the truck, I left with a FAT thick envelope of paperwork INCLUDING the contract...... I have NO proof that I am even supposed to be driving this car if I were to get pulled over.... they guy in the finance dept says I told them my fiance and myself made 3800 a month PER PERSON (7600 per month) NO WAY!!! I told him that we had a COMBINED income of between 4000-5000....... These people at this dealership do not know how to do business. So I am driving a car that is not yet financed, they have NOT paid my truck off and the finance company is calling requesting me to pay the truck...... Then the guy at the dealership suggested that I pay the truck payment and that they would reimburse me.... LOL..... pay for a truck that I am not using????

Between Brad and Marcus, they made sure I knew how everything worked in the car.  This was the best car buying experience I have had.  No high pressure.

55,"April 27, 2012","The car buying experience compared with many past purchases was better than average. I'm a stubborn, tough, customer who will fight to the finish over $1.00. I've caught many adjusting the figures in the F&I office, and many other unethical attempts to pad the sale. I wasn't put through any kind of H3LL in the outright purchase of a used car.

 

The worst thing this dealer did wrong was run off to an employee meeting, leaving me standing in the lobby waiting for a trade in value.  After verbally beheading the general sales manager, I didn't abort the purchase. But, the GM understood how roasted mad I was to be left waiting on an answer, when they decide to call an all-hands employee meeting.  If they need to disrupt operations, they need to pay people to come in early or stay late, but do not impact the customer.  It came very close to their losing the sale.

 

I guess nobody pays cash any more, as closing the sale was comical and frustrating.  The lady in the business office was courteous and kind, but she was clueless how to handle a customer who intends to leave paid in full.  They kept giving me documents to initial or acknowledge making statements that I understood various terms and conditions.  I just wrote a huge ""NO"" all over them, refused to sign any of it, and handed it back to them.  Then, they wanted me to waive my right to a jury trial, and agree to an arbitrator in the event of a dispute. That too got handed right back to them with a scowl, as that's just under-handed and designed to make the ignorant believe they have to accept an unfavorable decision when by law, they do not. Never agree to an arbitrator unless you pick them yourself, and you pay them.

 

But, once we got through the part where I do not make monthly payments, and I pay for my purchase cash-in-full, the sales process was not grueling.  I looked at that car on-and-off for 3 weeks, and the dealership did not bombard me with unwanted calls and e-mails.  I looked at no less than 5 similarly featured units across the metroplex, and came back and bought that one.  The sales person, Ron Jackson, was a shoot-from-the-hip type guy, and very firm on what can be negotiated and what cannot.  Even though there was an identical unit down the street 1.5 miles away, I paid $1,500 more for this one because I truly believe it to be a much better car with a much less battered past.

 

I've bought so many cars, I couldn't count them.  Another dealer told me I'm one of the best educated buyers they can remember.  All that aside, I'd give Central Kia a grade of ""A-,"" and if you want something they have got, I'd not bash them.  I can't say I'd recommend any car dealer, but I left here with no negative feelings about the transaction.  I've had the car for a month now, and driven it 2,000 miles, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with it.  I bought a 6 year old Pontiac mid-size with 48,000 total miles.  The car is in good condition and performs as expected.

56,"October 29, 2011","We bought a 2011 KIA Optima LX in July of 2011 and was extremely happy with the overall experience of buying the vehicle. In October of 2011 the car was totaled and we were crushed. When we got the check from insurance it wasn't even a third of what we put down three months prior and were convinced a new Optima was out of the question and most assuredly out of our budget. We did research on other less expensive cars to buy we even did test drives, but we kept comparing everything to the Optima (the 2011 had took a $13,000 worth of damage impact, air bag deployed and had frame damage and my husband walked away from the accident uninjured) and comparing it to the level of service we received at Central KIA. So we decided to just see what was on the lot at Central KIA new or used that was within our budget. What we got was a new 2012 Optima for less down and our monthly payment didn't change, and we didn't leave with the usual car dealership feeling of did I just get screwed. What Central KIA did for us and how we were treated I don't believe we would have received the same level of care anywhere else. We have purchased two cars now through Central KIA and referred many friends and family who have also been impressed. We have become Central KIA customers for life!!!! Thank you so much to the staff who worked with us and helped us get back into the car we loved after what was a horrible and stressing time in our lives!!!",5.0
57,"September 27, 2011","i would not blame the sales person at all because he did everything to help us.
BUT the sales manager who we deal was very rude and thought he was some kind of 
person who knows us very well.

well first of all let me tell you this.
they asked us to come in 4 times because they will tell us over the phone
and give us the exact price amount we want and so we will go in there to sign the contract then when we actually go in there they will chance the whole story
and then just bring a whole another price.
we did that 4 times and we will never recommend this dealership to anyone!
and also the manager called me and was like yelling at me and was asking me 
if why i emailed the corporate office about them giving me poor service.
obviously he thought they gave us the best service.........
i even have a proof about the sales man saying a certain price and was so sure about it. anyways. i dont even wanna waste my time talking about this dealership.
overall dont go here if you want to walk out the dealership with a happy face.",1.0
58,"August 10, 2011","Do not believe the hype and rave reviews. My boyfriend and myself had the worst experience with their customer service. Sure at the time that you get there, there are like vultures preying on a dead animal. They want you to think that they are out looking for you and your best interest. I get that it's a dealership and that is how most dealerships work. But what changed my opinion about them is the many incidents that followed. My boyfriend and I had arrived there on a Saturday evening. He was looking for a newer car. The sales rep showed us a couple of cars and then once my boyfriend decided on the one car that was best for him, we went into the office to talk numbers. By the time that we had come to an understanding and agreement on the finance aspect we were prepared to sign the appropriate paperwork. By this time it was already late and all the banks were closed. The finance person stated that he will call them first thing on Monday morning and let us know if the banks have agreed and if the deal went through. He proceeded to take my boyfriends down payment money, said that the deal was pretty much closed and we should get the car on Monday, shook our hands and send us on our way. For the entire weekend we were under the impression that by Monday afternoon we would have a new car. Come Monday morning there is still no call. We decided to give them sometime since we thought he would be a little busy. We gave them until late afternoon to call us with any information, by that time we still hadn't heard from anyone. My boyfriend called them, and both the sales person and finance person said that they will have to call him back, that the bank was still looking it over, that they will give him a call before the end of the day. Sadly no call back from them. Tuesday rolls around and still hadn't heard from either the sales rep or finance guy, that had promised to let us know what had happened. Tuesday afternoon we call again, and neither are able to take our calls. We left a message for both to call us back ASAP, but still nothing. At this point we are livid, frustrated that they can't take a bit out of their &quot;Busy&quot; schedule, just to let us know a tad bit of information and keep us out of the dark. We continue to call every hour until we had some information. Tuesday came to an end and had yet to speak with someone. We called back Wednesday morning and it wasn't until that afternoon that someone had finally told us that deal had not gone through. At this point we were upset, not at the fact that the deal did not go through, but that they took this long to let us know. Kept avoiding us and left us in the complete dark. I have dealt with other dealerships and they are far more prompt in getting back to you about an issue. After getting the NO from them, we were told that we had to come by and pick up the down payment that we had left for the car. Due to work we told them that we won't be able to go until Saturday. The guy just said &quot;Saturday is fine. We will be here. Just make sure to bring your receipt.&quot; Saturday we got ready to go pick up the money. As soon as we get there we speak to the finance guy that had originally taken our down payment and handed him our receipt. He had the audacity to tell us that he can't give us our money right now. That they don't keep any cash in the office and he will have to overnight us a check. We said he can write us a check right now. He stated that he needs to get a second signature from the owner. It is now 3 days after they said they would &quot;overnight&quot; us the check and we have yet to receive it. This has us so dissatisfied with their services. We would not recommend this dealership to anyone. The run around and avoid someone has us beyond upset. We called the owner of the dealership several times and have left messages to call us back, sad to say we are still waiting on that as well. Worst customer service EVER!!!!! People be smart and avoid this place at all cost. They just want your money. Next step is to file a lawsuit against them. The longer they wait to get back to us, the more heated we get. They pride themselves in saying that they offer the best customer service. I beg to differ. To me avoid a customer and not returning their calls, or giving them back the money the is rightfully theirs is not good customer service. Just a bunch of theives.",1.3
59,"July 08, 2010","Central Kia of Carrollton made me feel very welcomed and appreciated upon my arrival to their dealership.  I felt that my business was actually being valued throughout the entire buying and delivery process and not that I was just another client.  Howard completely understood my needs and engaged me through a relevant and informative demonstration of my new Kia Sportage.  Regarding the paperwork process, Wayne clearly explained the terms and details of the sale, displayed honesty and integrity throughout the transaction and was very considerate of my time.  I would definitely recommend this dealership to a close friend or family member! Thank you so much guys!",5.0
60,"June 29, 2010",I have to give a standing ovation for the way everyone did their very best to help me out. I've hated car shopping because last time around 7 years ago I was sold a pos and transmission broke in 3 weeks! I had to pay for everything... now...I'm so happy that Central Kia wanted to help me out cause I got a brand new Kia Soul with 11 miles on the dash!!!! i've never even seen that in my life. They really help people in need and listen to what customers want.,5.0

62,"May 14, 2010","I came to Central Kia today cause I seen the commercial on tv and my mom and I said lets give it a shot since we’ve never been there.

My mom is disabled and we only have one car, thank god for Central Kia in Carrolton Ken over there really reached out to us and helped us into a brand new Kia Soul this is our very first brand new car and we soooo excited. God bless you guys for all your help, Ken deserves employee of the month for his customer service.  ",5.0
