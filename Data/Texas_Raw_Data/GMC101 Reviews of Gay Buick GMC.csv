Dishonest and deceptive finance personal.
I‚Äôm 64 y/o and have brought several trucks, this was a Disgusting buying experience from very dishonest people.  I traveled 250 miles because they had the color I wanted, and I love this truck. 
The dealership called me several times a day before purchase, once purchased and I reviewed the buyers order and called them about the unknown charges, no call back for 4 days and not until I call GM for assistants .  once they called they could not explain the charges except for ‚Äúit‚Äôs a high end truck‚Äù. Whatever that means..besides, why would they volunteer to spend money on a vehicle they haven‚Äôt sold yet.  The reason is they are dishonest, at least to me for whatever reason .  They kept telling me that they would ‚Äú take care of me‚Äù and I made the mistake of trusting them.  
I signed on the dotted line.. so that‚Äôs my bad, but shame on them for taking advantage of a customer that does not buy and sell cars everyday.  ",1.0
1,"February 25, 2020","Everyone was so friendly and went over and beyond to make sure that I was happy with my purchase. They even beat the financing through my credit union. I did not feel any pressure to purchase. They accommodated me in every way possible. They have been extremely helpful and understanding. Please go down and see Josh, Craig, Billy, and Carlos. My plans are to be a lifelong customer. Thank you for being so good to me. I cannot thank them enough for all of their help!",5.0
2,"January 21, 2019","Quite a long time ago I bought my first car here at 15 years old, about 8 years ago I bought my favorite pick up truck, yesterday my husband bought my first SUV which started with an email and then a phone conversation with Stevie, she was an absolute angel, she set me up with Pat my salesman, by the time we arrived both vehicles, I was interested in were waiting for me, I chose the one that needed one repair, well guess what it was fixed without any hassle, the Sales Manager Steve Cummings is an amazing man to work with, very honest and straight forward, once we all shook hands we went and did our financing with Miss Amy, what a delight she was very sweet and professional! They gave me a loaner for the night and scheduled me to pick up my new vehicle today at 1:00pm, which I almost fell in love with the loaner ;) From start to finish I have to say I would give them 10 stars üåü out of 10. Professionals all the way! They treat people like people not just a number or a dollar amount to their bottom line! What a great business that still believes in family first! Way to go team! I have been a lifer so far and yesterday proved I will stay with y‚Äôall forever! So to Stevie, Pat, Steve C. and Amy, thank you so much for an amazing experience!",5.0
3,"October 13, 2018","My salesman Monte Campbell was very helpful to me in picking out a new 2018 GMC Sierra. This is the 2nd time I have purchased directly from him because I can depend on his low-key approach to buying a new vehicle. He listens to what I have to say about my needs & reacts to help me without trying to push me toward other potential purchases. I bought from him in 2017 & again in 2018. I will continue to work with him on future purchase because I can rely on his cooperation before and after the sale. I was unable to take immediate possession of the new vehicle, so his manager (I believe his name was Brent?) allowed to return the next day using the truck I was trading in on the new one.  That allowed me to make the proper financial arrangements for closing the next day.  Steve handled the closing documents & was very efficient in making it happen in a very short time.",5.0

11,"December 19, 2016","What can I say, all the other positive reviews that you read are all on point. I traveled from Dallas to come to this dealership since they were the only ones in a 500 mile radius that had the exact BMW that I wanted. My salesperson David Cummings was great and I very much appreciated his honesty. He provided all the photos and videos I asked for and answered all my questions, and believe me I had a ton of questions for him, probably over 10 emails in one day and all were answered almost immediately. The excellent customer service did not stop there, I traveled to Houston and was picked up by their porter named Cole. He was on time and very friendly. Once onsite I was literally in and out within 30 minutes. The finance manager Mike was another superstar. The team knew I was going to drive the car back to Dallas and was hoping to beat the traffic. Awesome team work by everyone to get everything done quickly. I have bought from high end dealerships for the last 10 years, and this experience has all of them beat. I recommended this place to all my friends that live in Houston. I love the car and loved my experience with this dealership!!",5.0
12,"July 24, 2016",Bought my truck from Gay as a first time customer. I was reffered to Eddie who was on vacation. Even though he was out he took the time to help me get the vehicle I wanted through team work with Ricahrd. They were both quick on price and quick with answers/service. They made the experience easy. I went to Beck and Maston who tried to scam me but that's another story. I would recommend these guys to anyone. I could tell they liked the dealership they worked for and that told me a lot.,5.0

15,"May 17, 2016","Brad was awesome, he asked what I wanted & pretty much found it to a ""T"" & worked to get the payment to what we were comfortable with, not just what we were approved at. The difference in service & care between Brad & the team at Gay GMC is night & day between what we experienced on the island; we tried to keep it on the island but just couldn't & are so glad we made the short drive up the road on the mainland. We are very happy with the Terrain & will return for future cars & refer friends & family there too.",5.0

23,"May 01, 2016","I emailed Gay Buick that I was interested in one of their past-year, new vehicles. The sales person emailed me back with a quote that was $1400 higher than what was already listed on the internet! When I informed him of the internet price, he dropped the quote down to the internet price. When I informed him that there was at least a $2500 difference (increase) in his quote and a competing dealership's quote (taking into account the differences between the vehicles), he told me that he couldn't lose that much money and was not that desperate. The $2500 was 8% of the MSRP of $30,000.  He wouldn't drop the price a penny. I informed him that I was going to go with the competitor's vehicle even though I liked his better, due to the large price discrepancy. Six weeks later, he dropped the price $2000. So much for not being that desperate!",1.0
24,"April 23, 2016","I came into the dealership and came out a very satisfied person.  I had a 2011 GMC in mint condition and I only went to browse the new 2016 models, yea right!!!

25,"April 13, 2016","I can't say enough good things about Gay GMC. In 2012 I bought my 2012 Acadia, everyone was so helpful. When I returned 3 years later, they remembered me and I recognized most of them. It felt like family. They helped me find my new 2016 Acadia, which I LOVE! I'll be returning for years to come. Thanks Guys!",5.0
26,"April 11, 2016","Everyone was attentive and responsive until my son signed the paperwork.  We noticed a problem with the brakes prior to leaving the dealership and pointed it out to one of the sales managers that was helping us.  He claimed it was because the truck had been sitting on the lot. (we found out later the truck had only been on the lot a week). We questioned this again and he assured me that because the vehicle was checked under their certified pre-owned program that there wasn't anything wrong with the brakes.  WRONG!

We have been told by a reputable mechanic that the rotors are warped, and of course now being told this isn't covered by the wonderful certification program.  On top of that, one of the tires had a 3 inch nail in it and a quarter size chunk of rubber missing.  This could only be seen when under the truck looking at the inside of the tire. The used car sales manager claimed I\we did the damage, even though we brought the truck back to him the next day demanding they replace the unsafe tire. He was very unprofessional to the point of being rude - even walked away saying he wasn't going to stand outside while we were kicking and screaming.  The only thing that was a positive about this situation was that Mr. Billy Moore got involved when the used car manager asked his opinion about the tire.  Mr. Moore said that the tire very well could have been that way when we left the lot and suggested that they simply replace the tire with one of similar condition.  Mr. Moore actually took over the situation and assured the tire was replaced and that our issues were addressed.  The used car sale manager needs to take some lessons in customer care from Mr. Moore.

We have called and emailed the dealership and no responses. My son works out of town so we couldn't return to the dealership after finding out about the brakes, but we will be there as soon as he gets back home.

I am very disappointed in how things changed after my son's name was on the contract.  Now no ones wants to deal with the problems - BUYER BEWARE

95,"June 09, 2015","I have bought 9 cars in the past 25 years all over Houston and this purchase at Gay GMC is by far the best.  I started with an internet query and was met with a quick response and follow-up from a manager.  Then, I made an appointment to come by to test drive and I had no wait - I felt like I was a rock-star!  I had numbers from various sources on my goal purchase price and trade-in value and I ended up very close to meeting those numbers.  The financial paperwork was done with no pressure, and I drive home a short time later with a good purchase.  ",5.0

98,"September 20, 2013","Gay Family  GMC Dickinson, Worst experience ever. Rude arrogant Sales Manager, left the dealership and purchased 2013 GMC Sierra from beck and masten north that same day. ",1.0
99,"July 11, 2013",Brought a Kia Cardenza and experienced great service. The salesman Donnie LeJeune was outstanding. Not to mention love the car. This is our 3rd car purchase from Kia family auto. Was reluctant because the service used to not be very good. Though I must say the service has begun to improve greatly.,5.0
100,"June 30, 2011","Sales personnel not attentive when arrived, elderly salesman not professional, went to get auto to test drive and and he said, we need to hurry as not much gas.  We then left and he gave directions and we drive down hwy 45 less than 2 miles and ran out if gas at peak rush hour in a very busy intersection.  My husband had to exit the vehicle in 104 degree temp and assist the elderly sales person to
Push the vehicle approximately 200 ft to a gas station up an incline while I attempted to navigate a disabled vehicle.  I never in my 50 yrs of life have ever run out of gas.  The sales person or none of the employees were concerned or apologized, instead they had a conversation about it while we waited wuth no communication about what the salesman was doing.  My husband has a bad back and has been in pain since this occurred.  Then my offer to purchase a vehicle was declined and I am extremely disappointed and will never recommend this dealership based on their unprofessionalism and lack of concern for the safety of their clients as my husband was placed at risk for harm in that busy intersection.  I had unformed the salesman that the auto was low on fuel due to the technological message screen and he did not care.  The salesman provided me with another salesmans card and wrote only his first name on it.  Furthermore he was only concerned with the fact that HE had never run out of gas before.

Thanks
