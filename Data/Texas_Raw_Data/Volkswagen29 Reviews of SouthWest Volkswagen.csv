Mike Berry was easy to work with both on the trade and purchase of a new VW Cross Sport.. The manager was able to work with Mike and make things happen. I highly recommend SouthWest Volkswagen and look forward to doing business in the future. A honest reliable dealership.",5.0
1,"January 14, 2020","Just purchased a used vehicle from Southwest Volkswagen in Weatherford. Extremely satisfied with the entire process. I had a trade-in, which usually only complicates matters, and I drove 90 miles to do business with them. Marisol Fernandez and Chris Green were awesome! Would definitely do business with them again.",5.0
2,"October 28, 2019","I recently bought a Volkswagen Atlas at Southwest Volkswagen in Weatherford, Texas.  The salesman, Andy Kimball was very professional & knowledgeable about the vehicle. He made the process simple & easy for me.  Up until the purchase ofvmy new vehicle I have always driven a Chevy, no more. My Atlas is beyond my dream car & if I ever need another car I would highly recommend Southwest Volkswagen & Andy Kimball to everyone.  Thank you for a wonderful vehicle.

10,"April 29, 2018","This dealer practices the trick of bait and switch, I drove to the dealer based on a car listed on their website. When  I arrived the car did not exist, they gave me two different stories about the car? Kendy gave me a test drive in a similar car to the one advertised and said he would look for the same trim and equipped car as advertised and would give me the same discount from MSRP. The next day he sent a curt  email stating a significantly smaller discount would apply. When I asked him to explain the difference Kendy sent another email stating that they could change the price at any time. This is not the dealer I want to do business with.",1.0

12,"April 15, 2017","When going over the price breakdown 2005 Nissan Titan, the dealer tried to get me to pay a for a vehicle inspection they ""do"" on all of their vehicles that supposedly costs them 999.00!
Complete bs, I drove off the lot, ate lunch, and it wouldn't start. Another dealer, a ""manager"" said the mechanic thought it was the fuel pump, and that they didn't usually check it because it was usually hard to get to. He really said that to me! What a thorough inspection they did!!! Worth about .99 not 999.00. ",1.0

15,"February 17, 2017","No hassle, no stress, no games. Straight forward honest dealing. It was a very nice buying a car from 
South West Volkswagen. South West Volkswagen is an outstanding company.
Amy Crandall was very courteous, knowledgeable and helpful. She made the process of buying a car a great experience. She answered all questions at once and when she needed to verify anything it took only a few minutes. We never had to wait long for any reason. (less than thirty minutes on all issues)
We where very pleased with our experience  at South West Volkswagen.",5.0
16,"January 31, 2017","Heather was a very pleasant and informative saleswoman and made my car buying experience fun instead of stressful.  I was really able to work with her on getting what I wanted and she never missed a beat.  Their warranty and protection plan they offered is the best in the biz.  If you're in the market for a new or used car, then come visit Heather France at SouthWest VW and see for yourself why I chose to purchase my new truck with them.  I am a very satisfied customer!",4.8
17,"January 19, 2017","Heather France and the whole staff at Soth West VW were awesome.  Heather was a great help in helping find and purchase my car. She listened to what I wanted, asked questions to help me discover what I wanted in my next car and ultimately gave me the flexibility to try out different cars.....all without the feeling of being pressured.  
Awesome experience.  I'm glad to call South West VW my home station for all things VW. 
I'd like to give a special shout out to Ashton and Kelly in the service department as well. Thanks for all the the help and patience with my old car!",5.0

19,"March 12, 2016","I am very happy with Southwest Volkswagen,  when I go in to have my TDI Wagon serviced they always treat me like I am the only customer they have.  Their prices are very reasonable and they never do any work that is not needed.  I would recommend this dealership to everyone.  Fair, honest, and reasonable, what more could you ask for.",5.0
20,"March 05, 2016","My experience with the service department started out not so good however what sets these guys apart from other places was that they cared to make it better with me as the customer. I am glad I came here and also glad to know that I have good, honest and fair people like Shane (Service Manager), Mike (General Manager) and Ashton (Service Advisor) to take care of me and my Weatherford/Springtown neighbors.",5.0
21,"February 29, 2016","I walked in not wanting anything from Volkswagen but just to browse. I was in the market for a mid-size sedan and was leaning towards GM cars like the Chevy Malibu. I already done my research on getting GM car but Bill Barber convinced me on getting a 2016 Passat SE. 

I am so happy he did. I love it and it amazes me how many features you get for the price. I came in close to 6pm and after a test drive I wanted it. He did everything in his power to get me that car. It wasn't until 10pm or so that we finalized the sale and he was patient and empowering the whole time. This dealership actually lost money on this sale to gain me as a customer. I am shocked and equally impressed from this amount of customer satisfaction. 

This was my first car that I bought on my own and I always heard horrible stories about first time buyers. This is not the case with Bill Barber and Southwest Volkswagen. They had made my year through their amazing customer service and offered me an incredible deal I couldn't refuse. Don't hesitate to come by. It'll be worth it. ",5.0
22,"February 19, 2016","This was the best experience purchasing a car I have ever had. Our consultant, Krystie Parra went above and beyond to answer all our questions and ensure that we got exactly what we wanted. The whole staff was professional, knowledgeable, and pleasant to deal with. I would recommend this dealership and this sales consultant to anyone. Thank you Southwest Volkswagen!",5.0
23,"January 04, 2016","The staff at Southwest VW is amazing!  They were informative and so very patient.  I have never owned a truly ""new vehicle"", but Gary, Stephen & Raleigh worked with me and were able to get me into my dream car...2016 Touareg.  I am so happy to have this dealership close to my home.  Thank you again, Stephen Gilchrist!  You run a very impressive dealership!",5.0
24,"January 02, 2016","I am very pleased with the recent purchase of my new 2016 Volkswagen Passat SE. Sales Consultant, Billy Barber, was very knowledgable and facilitated a smooth transaction! The entire team was dedicated and willing to ""earn"" my business. I would recommend this dealership!",5.0
25,"December 10, 2015","I purchased a new Jetta Sport, Bill Barber was my salesman and it was the easiest car purchase I've ever done. Bill and Raleigh worked extremely hard to make my experience go smoothly. They kept informed thru out the entire process. I will be back when I'm ready for another new car.",5.0
26,"July 25, 2015","I recently totaled my 2014 Toyota Corolla.  I became aware of a new VW dealer in Weatherford and visited it while I was waiting on the insurance to settle out.  I dropped into the SWVW dealership, just to look, and was very happy with the sales team's NO PRESSURE pitch, and great hospitality by everyone employed at SWVW. I purchased the 2015 Passat and am extremely happy!  Cody Wiggins, my sales rep, was a great help in getting me into my vehicle with, and without, all the features on my checklist and it was the best car buying experience that I have ever had.  They know how to treat you right at SWVW.  Even Stephen Gilchrist, the Manager/Owner came to introduce himself and welcome me to the SWVW dealership family of car owners!  I highly recommend this dealership for a great car buying experience and the the outstanding product that they sell, the Volkswagen!

27,"March 02, 2015","Together with a price estimate from a reliable source I shopped several metroplex dealers. Though it was the farthest from home my travels to Weatherford, TX turned out to be worth the drive time. My communications with the dealership were mainly via the internet. I also visited twice on the lot over the course of about a month. Their facility was somewhat cramped - under construction, you see - but I found a decent selection of cars (chose a blue Jetta) and even had fun when test driving cars with my salesperson, Ms Abbye L. She and the sales manager made the close about as painless as it gets when buying a new car. I feel I got a fair deal on my trade (better than what I was offered privately) and the financing terms were more than agreeable. Various dealer added options were quoted but there was no pressure to up-sell. Follow-up service has been attentive and I look forward to doing more business with these folks.

28,"August 04, 2014","My family and I live in Wichita Falls, TX.  We called the Volkswagen of Weatherford, TX dealership on Saturday morning while searching for a a Volkswagen Golf.  We had the pleasure of speaking with Abby.   She was very friendly, patient and professional through out the many back and forth  phone calls while negotiating pricing on a couple of the cars they had on the lot.  I have never negotiated a car deal over the phone, much less with a dealership 120 miles from  me.  Everything went very smoothly and when we got the last call from her saying that they would sell the car at my offering price, we immediately hit the road for the 2 hour drive.   Upon arriving at the dealership, we were greeted by Abby and after test driving, began the process of financing, at which time we also had the pleasure of meeting Seth and doing the final paperwork with Raleigh who was an absolute joy to work with.  Happy to say one of, if not the most pleasurable car buying experience we have ever had.  
Great job and thank you all.
