Keep in mind, I'm grading on a curve based on the assumption that all used car salesmen are at least a little shady.  I bought a car from them and before doing so, I was in contact with the salesman for about a week discussing the price of the car.  We finally settled on a price and he had me sign a document the spelled out the price of the car plus any applicable fees, i.e. taxes, document fee, etc.  Then I was sent in to talk to the finance director.  Immediately he had me sign an electronic pad which applied my signature to various documents.  I was a bit concerned about doing this but he assured me that my signature was going on documents that I had previously agreed to with the salesman.  He said this would speed up the process.  I finished the rest of the paperwork and left with the car.  A couple of weeks later, I received the documents from the US Bank, whom I financed the car through.  To my surprise, the amount financed was $3,000 dollars higher than what I had agreed to and signed for.  Come to find out that my digital signature was applied to five different warranties totaling $3,000.  Now, I will say after trying for months to get in touch with anyone that could help and turning them in to the Texas DMV I was able to recoup $2,301.  However, the remaining warranties totaling $699 could not be cancelled.  So, in a nut shell, Granger Chevrolet basically robbed me of $699!  Thus, this brings me back to my original assessment... extremely shady!  Don't believe me, that's okay.  Go buy a car from them... you'll see!

4,"March 15, 2019","My Cadillac ATS gave their service department a run for its money with the problem it was having.  They worked diligently and solved the problem.  A huge thank you to Bobby, Kasey, Mallory and the service department.",5.0
5,"March 01, 2019","Being approximately 125 miles from this dealer, my initial correspondence with Johnny Sanchez (sales) was through emails and phone calls which were geared around a used vehicle I had seen on their website. The pricing was clearly outlined and Johnny was up front about what sort of help he could lend to help get me into this vehicle.
After a few weeks, we made the 125 mile trek to the dealership, met with Johnny, and were delightfully impressed with overall process of purchasing our vehicle. It was a flat out 'no-pressure' purchase which took us no more than an hour or two before we were driving it off the lot. 
After then taking this vehicle in for what I was told (at another Dodge dealership near our home) was required maintenance, Johnny put me in touch with Joseph McArthur (Service Dept). Joe was extremely helpful, wasn't in a rush to simply get my questions answered and off the phone, and even went through to look up actual manufacturer's maintenance recommendations and history of maintenance items which were performed on the vehicle I purchased. Through it all, Joe provided a level of service over the phone that would have never been expected. 
All in all, I have to admit that the people I have dealt with at Granger Chevy prove that you are not at any ordinary dealership. I have been treated above and beyond what I ever expected...even after my purchase.
Thanks to Johnny Sanchez and Joseph McArthur for their great continuing service.",4.6
6,"November 09, 2018","They sell extended warranties that don't cover anything. Everytime I bring my truck in for warranty work it's always ""not covered"" So I wasted my money buying thier extended warranty.

7,"October 26, 2018","Dropped my car off with reduced engine power. They charged me 150 just to tell me the computer that diagnoses to car is out (Ecm). Wanted to charge 950 to replace that so they can find out the problem with the car and this is not even getting to the reason I dropped off the car which would be additional fees. Liars, scammers and bad business. Save yourself time and money and DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THEM.",1.0
8,"October 09, 2018",Contacted sales dept about a vehicle listed online to confirm that they had it and to set up an appointment. They said Tony would have it ready at 6:00. We get there after leaving work early-Tony’s off and car sold 3 days prior. Absolutely no respect for other people. I read other reviews and thought it was just a problem with the service dept. Unfortunately it’s a management problem. ,1.0
9,"January 07, 2018",I was absolutely blown away with the service I received here. The salesmen Cowboy and Jimmy are hands down the best!! Definitely genuine people who actually care about their buyers. Them two along with Cody in financing really went out of their way to help me out of a sticky situation and climb into an incredible car! ,5.0
10,"May 11, 2017","I bought a used truck that  supposedly went through their inspection process, I had to fix the Cruze Controal, and the ball joints less then a week after buying it, and all they said when I called was, "" o well"" don't ever buy from here there  Business practice is sucks. ",1.0
11,"November 07, 2016",Bait and switch sales tactics on used vehicles. Advertise with no price and then as you inquire they lie to get you to the dealership.,1.0

13,"January 04, 2016","My boyfriend had a censor go out on his 2014 Chevy Cruze and it was towed into Granger on Friday. He called in today to check up and see if they came up with a final diagnostic on the car. The advisor Cody called back saying that they are unable to drive the car because the tires are bald and offered us a quote on new tires. You're telling me that a 2014 that was purchased a year ago this month tires are so bald that you are unable to drive the vehicle and can't touch it because the tires are too bald? I'm baffled. I work for a dealership in Silsbee and our techs have to drive beater cars with 200,000+ miles and transmission issues for a UCI and you want to tell me that your techs are worried about bald tires? HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. Jessica in the service department told me they expect gas in the car and the car to be safe on the road in order to service it. ISN'T THAT WHAT A SERVICE DEPARTMENT IS FOR, TO MAKE THE CAR SAFE ON THE ROAD? If cowboy had a tech for the issue we are experiencing I would have had him go the extra mile to go there. Thanks for the xxxxty service Granger! I'll make sure to let all of my friends and family know how well you treated us.",1.0
14,"August 31, 2015",Granger Chevrolet was the best buying experience I've ever had. I had spent a week traveling for work and wanted to have the car for the weekend and they delivered the car to my home in Houston!! The Suburban we wanted was also hard to find and they were able to get us just what we wanted and at a great price!! I would highly recommend them to anyone around for a new car or any type of pre-owned car. They even have a Bentley!!,5.0
15,"August 25, 2015","After picking up a screw in a tire on our brand new car, we took our car in to see if it could be patched or if the tire needed to be replaced. I asked to see the screw out of curiosity, but the screw brought out to me was not only completely different (and much larger), it also showed NO wear from being driven on. I told them this was not the screw in my tire, so the technician went and got the tire and was able to provide me with the actual screw from the tire. He then told me that I actually had two screws in the tire, which was not the case. After speaking with the manager, we were able to determine that the technician had apparently put an additional hole in the tire which did pierce the belt (the screw that WAS in the tire had not). I did get a full refund and didn't have to pay for the new tire. However I would be very cautious bringing your car here for any kind of service.",1.8
16,"July 07, 2015","Offered me 6000 less than any other dealer for my trade.  In addition, an elderly male salesman was talking to 2 coworkers and 2 younger men about masturbating.  People were also using foul language.  People of Orange...if you want a new Chevrolet, leave Orange and go elsewhere.",1.0
17,"May 01, 2015","I recently called about a used vehicle i saw on auto trader, i called the dealership on Saturday April the 18th and spoke to a Brittany in used cars.  She was nice and i continued to ask her questions about the vehicle i was calling about.  She said she would call  me back on Monday with more information and would go from there.  There was one problem, she asked for my name but not my number.  Whatever.  I called again on Tuesday April 21st and this time spoke to a JImmy in used car sales, he seemed more the eager to help with what ever questions or concerns i had about the vehicle.  He asked for my name and phone number and said he would send me some more photos of the things i was inquiring about.  When all was said and done we made an appointment for Saturday April 25th to test drive the vehicle and if any plans changed between those two days to call and let him know to reschedule.  Between those two days i never received one picture or a phone call to atleast check to see if Saturday was still a go.  Heres where it all comes down to, I live 4 1/2 hours away from Orange Tx i am not simply going to drive there to test drive a vehicle for about 30 minutes to find its not what i expected.  That was the reason I called and asked the questions i had and also for the extra photos so i would know what to expect whit as little surprises as possible.  Nice people yes but could be better at helping people with concerns.  I wasn't expecting the vehicle to be perfect just didn't want hidden surprises.",2.8
18,"March 09, 2014",Great car buying experience. I'm from Lubbock TX and found the Ford Excursion on AutoTrader. There were no surprises when I got there as Memory answered all of my questions. When I got there the vehicle was not detailed so Memory took me out to lunch while it was getting done. This experience was everything you would hope buying a vehicle is like. I would recommend anyone to Granger Chevrolet.,5.0
19,"February 24, 2014",I felt like the car was way overpriced and the salesman made me feel like my car was worthless and that my credit was bad. A 2013 kia 11k miles total purchase price 24k??,1.0
20,"February 18, 2013",We purchased our 2012 Chevy Tahoe LTZ from Granger and had the best experience we have ever had buying a vehicle.  Our service was amazing from the moment we walked into the door.  They treated us like family and have even called several times to make sure that everything is going good with our new Tahoe.  Thank you Granger Chevrolet Staff.  We will definitely return.,5.0
21,"August 16, 2012","We bought a used truck from Granger recently and within two days, we started noticing all sorts of problems. First of all, they did not refuel it, let alone WASH it (which I think is a common courtesy when buying a ""new"" car). Secondly, the oil had not been changed in God knows who long...it was the most disgusting, dirty oil I've ever seen. And most surprisingly, the radio didn't work so we spend two days working on installing a new one, only to find out the truck didn't have any speakers! Sounds pretty fishy, doesn't it? We think so too!!

When we test drove the truck, everything ran well and the under the hood looked beautiful, but I wish we had climbed under and taken everything apart.

I don't care if you're selling brand new vehicles or used ones, you need to treat everyone the same, and we definitely didn't feel treated especially well. They made us wait an ungodly amount of time to do the final paperwork (and the salesman wasn't much of a conversationalist...so it was quite painful).

Unfortunately, we're stuck with an 'as is' sales agreement...but this truck really feels like a LEMON.

This is no way to run a business.",2.0
22,"January 19, 2012","I am writing to express my extreme disappointment and utter frustration with Granger Chevrolet in Orange, TX. Throughout the process of purchasing my new GM vehicle, Granger Chevrolet staff demonstrated a low quality of service, used unfair and deceptive practices, pressure and coercion, and stalling techniques.

On 11-8-11 I arrived to purchase a new “IN-STOCK” 2011 Tahoe, only to be told that the specific vehicle had “just been sold” to another dealership. The salesman Jeff Thibodeaux said that he located a similar vehicle and would proceed with a dealer trade in order to procure it. I was pressured into paying a $500 deposit to secure that vehicle; Mr. Thibodeaux explained to me that the $500 was completely refundable. On 11-14-11 I received an email from Mr. Thibodeaux stating that our vehicle had not yet been procured. On 11-15-11 I received an email from Mr. Thibodeaux stating that a different vehicle had actually been procured (email documentation available).  

Once that vehicle arrived at Granger Chevrolet, I went in to test drive. After I questioned the rebates and price of this vehicle, Mr. Thibodeaux called in the GSM Kevin Speight.  Mr. Speight proceeded to argue with me, saying that the $500 was non-refundable. In a very coercive and aggressive manner Mr. Speight claimed that several “fees” were incurred for procuring the vehicle. However, I had been told previously it was a “straight-swap” and no additional fees were ever mentioned. Mr. Speight refused to refund my deposit. A sale price was finally negotiated and a finance appointment was scheduled to close the deal at 3:00pm on 11-18-11.  

When I arrived at 3:00pm for my finance appointment the Granger Staff used several stall tactics, keeping me waiting for over 3 hours; never did I meet with the F&I manager Joe Isebell. Finally I had to leave for a prior engagement, and another finance appointment was rescheduled for 1:00pm on 11-21-11. On 11-21-11 I arrived at 1:00pm and was forced to wait over 2 hours before the F&I manager Mr. Isebell would meet with me.  

While waiting I explicitly told Mr. Thibodeaux that I did not want the optional VIN etching (Universal Security Guard). He acknowledged and assured me it would be omitted from the final purchase agreement. Forty minutes later, I observed Mr. Thibodeaux attaching the VIN etching decals to the vehicle. I immediately confronted him and stated again “I do not want the VIN etching,” to which he smiled and replied “Don’t worry about it.” Even after I stopped him, Mr. Thibodeaux continued to place the remaining VIN etching decals on the vehicle.
When I finally met with the F&I Manager Mr. Isebell to close the deal, I explained to Mr. Isebell what had happened. Again, I stated that we decline the VIN etching option. Mr. Isebell insisted that the $299 VIN etching was non-negotiable and automatically included in the price of all vehicles. I pointed out that it was an added option and I witnessed Mr. Thibodeaux attaching the decals. However, Mr. Isebell refused to remove the fee.

Mr. Isebell then proceeded to coerce me, stating that in order to qualify for the best loan terms and lowest interest rate I would be required to purchase add-ons such as Vehicle Service Contract and GAP coverage. Mr. Isebell explained that if I declined the additional products, the interest rate would increase. Mr. Isebell’s claim that the customer’s interest rate is somehow contingent upon the purchase of dealer add-ons is a lie.  This deceptive practice is dishonest, unethical, and unacceptable.  

Upon taking delivery of the vehicle, I noticed a hairline crack in the windshield and contacted the dealership immediately on 11-23-11. I was instructed to bring the vehicle to Granger Chevrolet.  Mr. Thibodeaux admitted that no pre-delivery inspection had been performed on the vehicle.  No customer walk-around or vehicle orientation was offered upon completion of the sale. In Addition, the On-Star welcome presentation was never conducted. Mr. Thibodeaux informed the GSM Mr. Speight of the issue. Mr. Speight said that the vehicle was sold “AS IS” and the dealership would not replace/repair it. Overall, I was extremely disappointed in the way I was treated by this dealership. ",2.0
