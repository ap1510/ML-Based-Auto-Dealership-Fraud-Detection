6,"January 26, 2020","I recently purchased a new Accord from Howdy Honda.  I worked with DeJohn Reeves who provided a great purchase experience. He was very patient, professional, and personable--not pushy at all.  He listened carefully regarding our preferences and he was very considerate of our needs. A couple of weeks after purchasing the car, I contacted DeJohn about replacing the rear window tint (which was very dark) with a lighter one.  He was extremely accommodating in making arrangements for that and Oscar did a great job with the removal of the dark film and the installation of the lighter film.  I give DeJohn, Oscar, and the dealership an enthusiastic 5 starts for a great overall experience. ",5.0

12,"September 26, 2019","I was negotiating with several dealers for a new Honda CR-V. Although Howdy Honda did not have the lowest price, they were ~$150 more than the lowest, my daughter had good experience with them before. Plus, I could visit my grandchildren while picking up the car.

I was ready to travel four hours to Austin to buy the car when the sales manager called and declined to send me a written quote for the vehicle and demanded that I finance through the dealership. Although he claimed that he would relent on the written quote, we didn't get past the in-house financing demand.

So I will buy the same car from Honda of Fort Worth without any hassles tomorrow for ~$150 less. And the drive is only 2-1/2 hours. But i won't get to see my grandchildren.",1.0

17,"May 27, 2019","We were so happy with the purchase of our 2016 Honda HR-V from Edward Kwak that we just purchased a 2019 CR-V from Edward.
Edward spent a lot of time showing my wife the features of the car so she would be comfortable with it. He also showed us how to go online to see videos of the operations if we forget something.
The very next day we drove our new CR-V to Tucson, Arizona, 1,000 miles each way. The car was better than we expected and Edward‚Äôs coaching made us very comfortable with our CR-V.
We will definitely be seeing Edward Kwak for our next Honda.",5.0

Salesman Brad Plauche listened to my needs, quickly answered all my questions and worked to provide a deal that met all my parameters.

32,"March 28, 2019","Judy and I have purchased a dozen Honda from Howdy Honda.  Originally our first sales person was T. J. Nissen who was superb and anchored us to Howdy.  But our long term pleasure in dealing with Howdy Honda was bonded by Brad Plauche who is as good at his craft as anyone we have ever met!  

The strong points of T. J. and Brad from the sales side are personality, follow through, knowledge and focus on making the customer feel important.

The other piece of quality is the Howdy Honda Service Department.  We have dealt with the service department for more than 30 years and not once were we ever displeased with our service.  Not a bad track record.

Howdy Honda has been the standard for what a dealership shoud be.",4.8

Ron jumped through hoops, even though he was very busy, to get us  behind the wheel of exactly the truck that we were looking for.  We also worked with Justin, Brad, TJ and Brad.  We couldn't ask for a better crew, they were all very knowledgable and answered every question we had.  We feel like we made some new freinds working with these gentlemen.

42,"February 25, 2019","My wife and I recently bought a Honda CR-V from Edward Kwak of Howdy Honda. It was a totally hassle-free experience -- very pleasant and efficient. We requested quotes from 3 local dealers using kbb.com. Howdy Honda and another dealer provided real quotes, and the 3rd one just replied with something like ""come on in, and we'll take good care of you"".  But Edward's quote was the most reasonable one based on the research we did. So we went to see Edward and was able close the deal very quickly... Thank you, Edward.

I used to live relatively close to this dealership.  Since then, I've moved and now drive about 30 miles to this specific location because they have been so good to me and have done excellent work.

They were knowledgeable and attentive, and I am grateful for the service they provided me. As a single woman, I am nervous about what kind of experience I will have when purchasing a new vehicle. Past sales reps have discounted my knowledge and been deceitful, or have tried to ""mansplain"" things to me. That was not the case at all with Justin and Jorge.

During the visit he was extremely attentive to our needs as a family, my Husbands vehicle requirements and embraced the crumbs our Toddler left on his carpet. Johan worked diligently to ensure we stayed within the finacial bracket we desired for monthly payments and even discussed potential trade in options for our secondary vehicle. He throughly explained all of the details related to the car we decided to purchase and more importantly he never pressured us into making a decision that day.

87,"November 08, 2018","Found Jorge Benavides' name via Google reviews and have to say I made the right decision in asking for him personally. He was incredibly professional, courteous, and knowledgeable in Honda products. Jorge had the Accord ready to test drive for me when I arrived and went through exterior features, interior features, buttons, the Honda Sensing safety suite, and even took me to test the Accord's turning radius (in an empty parking lot), the Accord's feel on a bumpy road, and followed through on my request to parallel park in a nearby neighborhood. 

Prior to going to Honda, I checked out Toyota, Kia, Buick, and had my eyes set on Mazda. Working with Jorge sealed the deal and I decided to go with Honda. Working with Jorge, I never felt pressured to buy and I felt like every need/request/question I had was answered.

He seemed to not mind taking the time to show us the car we were interested in and then give us important information about the vehicle. We appreciated the fact that he even stayed almost an hour after closing to get our information to start the financing process for the vehicle and we did not feel rushed or like he was annoyed. Second day we worked with us to make sure we got everything in order to finalize the purchase and again never felt rushed. Over all, we felt he was very honest at what he was telling us and was looking for our best interest.

After immediately stepping foot into Howdy Honda, I knew this was the best place to be. The second I walked into the showroom, a man named Chris Jackson literally jumped out of his chair and hurried to my side.  Eager to help, he listened to every detail-  my needs/wants/price  and he said ""I got this, don't worry about those other dealers, I got you""  from that point- there was a sense of comfort and trust- a relationship was forming...I wasn't just an opportunity and he wasn't just a car salesman.  There was a level of respect. Chris was attentive and caring.   Where other dealerships would be vague and play pricing games, Chris was a straight shooter.   He says, ""come in, let's work it out, let's get you in a good place,  and at the end of all of this, I want you to be a customer for life"".  The car  I wanted wasn't on the lot.  Other dealers missed the opportunity because the car I asked for they didn't have and that was that- they tried to push me into something else.   Chris knew what I wanted and got it on the lot and ready to go (a turn around of 2 days!) Since then Chris follows up to make sure I'm aware of using all the features and reminds me that he's always here if I need anything!  I've sent my own mother in law to purchase a car from Chris because he's just that good!  Thanks again Chris and thank you Howdy Honda for getting me into a loaner and working with my circumstance.

My daughter knew she wanted a Civic. So, when I contacted Howdy Honda I did a lot of the shopping over the phone with Diane. She was friendly, well-informed and listened to our needs. She didn't sell us; she guided us. On her day off, Ron stepped in and didn't miss a beat. The car and price they quoted me were exactly what was waiting for my family and me when we showed up at the dealership. The price was excellent! As an extra note: she was not due to come in early, but because I was headed out of town by noon, Diane came in at 8 AM to accommodate us.

She guided us through the paperwork, the service department, the dealership and the car in a very friendly way. No condescension. No BS.

The financing manager was terrific to work with, as well.

I highly recommend Diane Hadley and Howdy Honda.

187,"July 22, 2018","I worked with Diane Hadley to buy my new 2018 Honda Accord while I was in the midst of a cross-country move from Chicago back home to Austin. Of course just buying a car is a stressful experience on its own, but doing it while moving added a whole other level of stress. Fortunately, Diane took care of all of the details, making it very clear what she needed from me when. We were able to find me a car, land on a price, and confirm my loan and insurance details before I even arrived back in Texas. The day of my car purchase, everything went very smoothly and Diane worked hard to keep the process moving. It was fun to meet her after communicating with her for several weeks by phone and email. She wants to deliver what you need and in the way that you would like to be treated. But the relationship didn't suddenly end after the purchase because Diane has kept in touch to help replace some tint that had a few bubbles in it when I purchased the car. Instead of delaying the purchase, she gave me an IOU and got everything set up so I could bring the car in to get the tint replaced. It's been so nice to see her smiling face each time I've come into the dealership as then I know everything is getting taken care of.

However I‚Äôve given 4 stars for the dealership, as we got into a little bit of an issue with a rep from the fianance department. We already had our check to purchase our new car, however when it came to the fianance portion/total of the vehicle, the representative said they only were going to price match the car because we were going to finance through them at Howsy Honda. My husband stated this was not the case, and we even showed written proof from the email Howdy had sent to us stating of such price match. Of course, anyone who has purchased a car can understand how frustrating it can be when you are told one thing, then stated another. My husband explained this bluntly to them, and the rep then transferred our transaction with another person.

Everyone at this dealership goes out of their way to be courteous and to promptly meet your needs.

Ron Victorino was our salesman in 2014.  He is now a sales manager and helped us with this purchase as well.  People like Ron make the world a better place.  So it's no stretch that he makes everything about car buying better.  It's always good to know there is someone trustworthy working to make your experience better.

I also would like to commend Rex Flaczynski and Ed Kwak for being so patient and helpful through every aspect of this process and for going above and beyond to make our buying experience a good one.

In addition , Andy Tuerck took the time to walk us through every aspect of finance, extended warranties and additional coverage.  He did so patiently and made our concerns and goals his priority.  He did not attempt to sway us in any regard but asked us what we wanted and completely answered our every question.  He too is an asset to the Honda corporation.

I would be remiss if I did not rave about everyone in every department at this dealership who has attended us for the past 4 years: Service, parts, reception, every department I have interacted with.

He fully discussed the remaining warranty and where the car came from and that it had been a leased car. We were really buying for a member of our family and he was very helpful on our options. We decided to get the car, but wanted to see it first. It was late in the day, and he said they needed a small, refundable deposit (applicable to the final cost) to prevent someone else buying it. We went in the next day and, after seeing and driving it, we made the deal. Johan was very meticulous, patient, and friendly as he took us through the closing paperwork. There was absolutely no pressure to buy. Never once did we have to question anything he told us about the car in earlier conversations.

I specifically looked for Brad not only because of my experience with him in 2008 but also because of what he did - or did not do - these past 10 years. 

In the past 10 years I brought my Honda  to Howdy Honda for its maintenance service and ran into Brad while waiting for my car to be ready. All those times Brad would come and said Hello and asked me how ""everything"" was doing but not even once he mentioned the fact that I've had had my car for 5.,6, 7, 8, 9, 10 years and perhaps it was time to get a new one.  Not your ""typical"" car salesman. 

Brad also guided me helping me would with a model that would cost less than my previous model and would better fit my current lifestyle.

I came to Howdy Honda to see if ther was anything to be done about a recently expired warranty on the engine block and because I was a returning customer, they were willing to go to bat for me with Honda corporate. We ultimately decided not to because the likihood of getting the value back in the trade in for what I‚Äôd likely have to pay for it to be fixed was not worth it. I did browse their lot because I always like to support businesses that give EXCELLENT customer service and decided to buy my pre-owned with them. It was a quick and easy process that they walked me through step by step, answering any of my questions along the way.

Jorge met me at the door as I already had a good idea of the vehicle I wanted (Manual transmission Accord) so it was just a matter of test driving to confirm, and agreeing on the price.

Now, with any dealership it's important to go in prepared and Howdy is no different. As long as you make sure you're pre approved with another institution and know about the rate you should be at all that you have to focus on is price.

Throughout all this, Jorge stayed very patient, and when I left for the day let me know he would be in touch while we worked on whether Honda Financial could beat the rate I was given.

At the end of it all, he even came in on his day off to make sure everything was just as it needed to be.

462,"April 01, 2018","EXCELLENT 5-STAR EXPERIENCE AT HOWDY HONDA.  Read on for exhaustive details!!

Chris JACKSON (all-caps b/c there are multiple Chrises ...Chrisses... Chrisii(?) at Howdy) and Chris Hobbick... DYNAMITE team!  i‚Äôm now a born-again Honda guy thanks to the all-new 2018 Accord.  My friends are all laughing at me because i just gave up my fully-loaded 2015 Tesla P85D ($130k purchase price) at the end of its lease... and moved to the 2018 Accord LX (~$22-25k).  Yes, the base model.  With cloth interior.  And a seat ya gotta jack up and down w a manual handle (i‚Äôm single, and its only driver. After adjusting the seat ONCE, when do i ever adjust it again other than to lie down?).  In gray.  So i don‚Äôt have to wash it too often.  With not one single additional add-on.

i LOVE(D) my Tesla but it was getting to be a pain because my stupid HOA couldn't figure out how to get charging installed in my building even after pre-warning them for 1.5 years before I leased, and now still after 3 years through my lease!  I'd be using public chargers and the supercharger in San Marcos, grabbing Taco Bell twice per week and sitting there through my lunch break... not ideal.  Still, i got to sit on my high horse and say i was driving an all-electric, environmentally friendly car‚Ä¶ yada yada (and, yes, I'm fully aware of allll the arguments about electric NOT being all that environmentally friendly as it's just pushing the carbon emissions elsewhere... a discussion for another place).  Anyhow, electrics aren‚Äôt in my near future again until my HOA gets their act together‚Ä¶ so looked for an ICE w good mileage/emissions ratings.

FYI, i usually/historically HATE auto dealerships. This is one of the reasons i loved Tesla... no real 'dealership'... one price for all... but Tesla is a different beast then the rest anyhow, so if you're in that market you're probably not in the market for a Honda as well.  i‚Äôm different than most. A rare bird.... i got RANGE!!  :-p

In any case, not sure if the others are all awesome as well, but Chris JACKSON is the sales guy i was lucky enough to be plugged into when i headed into Howdy... and he knocked it outta the park!  i hate, Hate, HATE when i see salespeople that don't know their own products, let alone some products from their competitors in the same class/space.  A few days ago, i had called ahead to Howdy to let them know i was heading their way and they put me through to Chris JACKSON.  i told him i knew it was getting within an hour of closing time, but was interested in checking out the Accord‚Ä¶ but possibly the Civic as well (they've updated these a lot and they've gotten a lot better too).  When i got there, Chris had already pulled the keys for 4 or 5 cars and had them ready for me to check out.  He had solid knowledge of both models, and the various trims and packages.  A few things he didn't know (he's only new to Honda as of 2 weeks ago, coming over from Nissan)... but he didn't BS me and instead researched the questions in a short time and gave me the correct answers! Go figure!?!!  On top of all that, was pleasant to chat with, and had a great sense of humor.  All around great sales guy!

With other dealerships i went to (this time, namely Toyota (for their Camry), and Hyundai (Sonata)), i did the same... but when i would get there and sit around forEVER and have them offer me a bottle of water 10 times before they managed to find ONE xxxx key and pull around that car.  30-45 mins to check out ONE car?!?  God forbid i should want to check out a second! Ain't nobody got time fo dat! On top of all that, both of those cars still have quite a bit of catching-up to do w the new 2018 Accord (and even the Camry despite it being a class lower).

At closing today, i dealt with their Finance Director, Chris HOBBICK.  Also a great guy.  We very well could have knocked out all the paperwork in probably 20 mins, 30 at the most.  But we had a great convo going, and ended up chatting for prob another hour on top of the actual paperwork.  Like Chris JACKSON, Chris HOBBICK had excellent organization skills.  He had the paperwork done properly to minimize confusion, and clearly explained what all needed further detailing.  i had some questions which he could not answer (due to it being more of a sales/product question rather than a finance issue)‚Ä¶ and like Chris JACKSON i‚Äôll be damned if he didn‚Äôt find the right answers out from the correct people!!  He also talked me through a few things i probably should (and did) buy, but was not at all pushy about them nor for the other products in which i had no interest.

Lastly, i will direct y‚Äôall to see my picture: i‚Äôm Indian.  Honda (though Toyota as well) is encoded in my genes about as strongly as the Taco Bell gene.  Being Indian, i also know my pricing.  Like REALLY well.  They were able to hammer out a great price for me, and for that along with their great salesmanship have earned my business for years to come (as if this glowing review didn‚Äôt already give that away).

They presented me with the highest numbers of any of the dealerships that had emailed me pricing, and when I told him that I was going to need better monthly payments, he came back from speaking with his managers and told me, ""You need to either pick an LX, this is the best pricing you're going to get, or you just can't have the civic.""

476,"March 29, 2017","Test drove a new Odyssey and had great service. After reviewing all the used inventory online, I analyzed KBB and Car Gurus, and I went in to see a specific used 2014. We were not allowed to see the car closely because it was in the workshop--the sales person did see the car more closely. The sales person let us know we should put a deposit on the car if we wanted to hold the option once it was cleaned up. We agreed. Then he told us we needed to decide on a price. I was surprised but based on all the research I had done, it was only $300 above my target price. I asked for a break and they said no. Still an okay deal, so I signed the price. 1 minute after I sign they say that now we can see the car but that the mileage was wrong--instead of 10k, it is 23k. I was disappointed, the low mileage was a key reason I was interested. KBB suggests that the price difference for that mileage should be a little more than $1300. Bait and switch. I asked to discuss if there was something they could do since our deal was based on very different mileage. They pulled the classic ""I'll ask my manager, oh wait, he says no"". The manager, Billy Watson came out and said, that the error that was mysteriously in their favor, was an accident and that I should expect him to compromise (even though the deal the sales person and I had agreed on we negotiated under an assumption of less than half the mileage). Billy might be right though, I may have expected a typical employee of Honda (which is a brand I love... or loved) to have compromised or to have behaved with more integrity, but I guess it was naive of me to expect a sale manager that ""accidentally"" posts low mileage which ""accidentally"" accrues to his favor and only reveals the information 1-minute after the price negotiation is finished to have compromised.",1.8

I called the day before about getting my car serviced (a prior mechanic already told me it was my radiator fans) and the service tech JESSE told me the job wouldnt take longer than that day that diagnosing it would be in and out and they would be able to tell me what the problem was. I then told him that it would be fine if i left it as long as they would be able to get me a loaner. JESSE without even checking quikklu told me there were none and he didnt know when some would become avalable. FINE. I took my car in as early as they opened (7am) to give them enough time.
I called at 3pm because i hadnt heard from them (this is after getting a ride to work) and i was told i would get a call back. 4pm comes along and THEY HAVE STILL NOT SEEN MY CAR. 
At this point im thinking why in the world would this crooked sales tech give me the impression it would be done and it hasnt even been seen??? He then tells me he leaves at six and someone else would have to help me after.
At this point i am DONE. I find a ride to go pick up my car because i cannot be without my car another day as my job is very demanding and i still have to wait 20 minutes to get my car which has not even been seen and was parked somewhere. 
I was furious and just wanted someone to listen so i got passed onto CLINT COLLINS the ""service manager"" who was looked like a deer in headlights when i was explaining my entire problem with the way HOWDY HONDA performs service.

The computer diagnosis was ambiguous about the malfunctioning part, but they were able to make an educated guess regarding the power control module. Honda no longer manufactures this part, but they were able to get an aftermarket part. As it turned out, there was a control relay that was malfunctioning in conjunction with the PCM. They replaced this part for only the cost of the part (i.e. no labor charge, since this wasn't in their estimate).

498,"November 14, 2012","Howdy Honda's Service Dept. Simply Rocks 


My dealings w/ H. H. actually had to do w/ a car my mom had purchased from them back in 2003. It was an 04' Honda and her warranty had passed by over a yr . Her problem developed after having the car approx. 3 yrs. , it was the paint job and it started to flake badly and progressively worsened unfortunantly she allowed the warranty period to pass by with out resolving this issue. During a regular service maintenance visit I decided to go into the Service Dept. and see if we might still have some sort of recourse with our paint issue. This is when I first was introduced to Mr. Jeff Dahl ( Parts and Service Director ) . He came out and closely inspected the damaged paint ( knowing that the Warranty had by this time expired ) . Without hesitation expressed his concern and added his disire to escalate the issue , as something he felt that H.H. Regional Mgm should see. After this took place, they asked me to get an estimate for the repairs needed to correct the paint which we did. They got back to us and let us know that the Honda Corp. declined to assist us in this matter but that they ( Howdy Honda ) felt as though something should be done on their part to help us out and in a good faith gesture offered us $2000 towards a paint job. I happened to have a close friend here in austin whose in the autobody repair professional, and Honda had no problems with me allowing this friend to perform the work. I can't tell you how shocked I am that all of this played out like it did. I would definitely support and reccomend Howdy Honda's Service Dept. to anyone that might find them selves in need of honest work for their car, and fair pactices during negotiating a resolution for their problems they may encounter.

500,"October 16, 2012","I took my S2000 to Howdy Honda for expert diagnosis of a check engine light (CEL). I was told it needed a new air pump and relay. Cost of parts about $900. Plus about $400 for labor. Total repair cost about $1300. (Plus $110 for the expert diagnosis.)

Instead, I ordered the parts from a Honda dealer in California, saving $300. I had my neighborhood mechanic install them. He charged $80. Savings = over $500. 

Or so I thought. Replacing the parts did not cause the CEL to go off. Took the car back to my neighborhood mechanic who diagnosed the REAL problem as a vacuum leak. Cost to diagnose and repair air leak: $100. 

I brought the old air pump home, applied 12 volts to it, and it spun like a top. (The relay also must be working, because a failed relay burns up the pump motor.)

I was left wondering if: (1) the Howdy Honda mechanic was incompetent (researching that question, I learned online that a vacuum leak is ALMOST ALWAYS the cause of my particular CEL, and that a trained ear can easily hear the pump running); or (2)  the dealer was trying to up-sell me a costly repair the car did not need? 

After writing this review, I was contacted by Howdy Honda's service manager. He explained Honda had issued a technical service bulletin (TSB) which stated that if there was any sign of overheating, the air pump should be replaced. The service manager believed the mechanic must have seen some sign of overheating. (I don't see any, but he offered to look at the old pump if I brought it by.) He also stated that --- had the repair been performed at Howdy --- the CEL's coming on after the pump was replaced would have tipped off the mechanic that it didn't need an air pump after all, and so he would have put the old pump back on the car and started looking for the vacuum problem. 

To address my concerns, the service manager is refunding the $110 diagnosis charge and giving me a $150 credit against the cost of a future service visit.

501,"October 16, 2012","I bought my car from Howdy Honda about 10 years ago, and they've always been wonderful.  When I take it in for service, they communicate constantly and accurately - you don't have to chase them down to find out what's going on with your car or how long it will take or how much it will cost.  Having the 7am opening for dropoffs is very helpful, and they've got a great arrangement with the local enterprise rent-a-car that makes it easy to get a loaner car if your car has to stay for a while.  

Recently, I had the most amazing stellar experience there, far above and beyond the normal excellent service I expect from Howdy Honda.  My S2000 was making a horrible screeching noise, and it sounded just like one that it had made about 18 months ago.  I took the car in, and the mechanics found that a part in the rear wheel bushing/axel area was failing.  This was the exact same area that they had been in about 18 months ago, but there's no way to tell if the new failure was just luck of the draw or actually had anything to do with the service 18 months prior.  After all, I had driven some 8000 miles without any issues....  But the good folks at Howdy said, ""Hey, it could have been our repair - or it could not have been - but we'll make the fix anyway for free.""  That's absolutely amazing!

To top it off -- as if it could get any better! -- the mechanics also helped me out by making a simple fix to the front bumper, which I'd pulled out by catching it on a curb.  I didn't have the leverage or the strength to push the bumper piece back into alignment - but they did, and they just took care of it without saying a word about it (or charging me anything for it either).  

If Honda still made S2000s, I'd buy another one from Howdy Honda in a heartbeat.  In the meantime, I'll keep going to Howdy for service when needed.",5.0
502,"July 04, 2012","On Saturday, 6/9/2012, I purchased a new red 2012 Honda Civic EX.  I chose Howdy Honda because it is across Ben White where I work and I wanted the convenience of being able to just drive over after work if I had problems or needed anything done to my car. Steve was my salesperson. Nobody appeared to notice me as I initially walked the lot looking at cars. I wanted a white one, but I did not want the navigation. I went inside looking for Jeff because 5 years ago he was the salesperson who let me test drive two cars, an Accord and a Civic. He wasn't available so I just sat at one of the tables waiting for someone to help me. Finally, Steve saw me. He paused, stepped away as if he didn't have time, then he changed his mind and said ""come on over"". He was concerned about some other customers that were supposedly waiting. I didn't see anyone else there waiting for a salesperson. 

I told him I preferred a white one and he said that the sales manager, Jon, said that he would like to sell that red one to me. They had me thinking I was going to get a good deal. I had a 2011 Kawasaki Concours 14 to trade and I had sold my 2009 Kawasaki Vulcan Voyager the same day to Wood's Fun Center. Steve asked me how much I wanted for the bike. I told him that I wasn't sure. I immediately lost his attention and he gave me his card and told me to come see him when I found out. I started talking on the phone to the same buyer at Wood's Fun Center and he started talking about how ""I work on commission"" like I was wasting his time. He tried to be nice by retracting it. As I got a price and we began doing the paperwork, he told me that he has a place to be and how he had to get out of there. He said it more than once. That is when I should have run out of there.

I tried getting him to throw in some wheel locks but his sales manager Jon Fitzpatrick refused. I did not realize what a bad deal I was getting either. After the deal was finalized, the only thing he helped me with on the car is the Bluetooth connection to my Android phone. That was it. I drove home not realizing how much wax was all over the vehicle and I found a small paint chip on the right fender when I was wiping it all off. Before buying the car, I found that it had a crooked glove box that stuck out on one side. He assured me it would be taken care of.  

A week later they touched up the paint chip area and made the glove box ""better"". It was more sunk in on the left side, but it did look better. Otherwise, the car was just okay. I did my research backwards on the Civic.  Right now it is in the garage and I have not driven it in a week. They sold this car to me for $20,287. I found out that Round Rock Honda would have sold it to me for around $19,400. Edmund's True Market Value right now is $19,741. Texas Honda would have sold it to me somewhere between $19,400 and $19,741. My car has window tint and it wasn't the best job either. The $20,287 included the tint.  It was my fault that I let my guard down.  I did too much that day by selling/trading two motorcycles and purchasing a car in the same day. This was an expensive lesson well learned.

Honda already gets 2% holdback money and you never see it in the MSRP. It isn't negotiable most of the time. I found out, after the fact, that Honda gives dealers $500 in ""dealer cash"". Texas Honda and Round Rock Honda pass that on to the buyer. Howdy Honda does not. When I brought this up to Jon in an email, he dodged the subject and said ""You paid 6.25% sales tax, but I bet you're not emailing your congressman"". This is when I realized what a mistake I had made in purchasing this vehicle from Howdy Honda. They sold me this car at a premium price. The MSRP when I bought it was $21,275. Honda raised it to $21,445 around the time I bought the car, but mine still had $21,275 on it. You should never pay MSRP for a car. Window tint is cheap. Even if you count the $299 they included in the $20,287 price, I paid AT LEAST $600 more for the car than I should have. Jon told me that I got a great deal on the car. Yeah, right.

I found out later from another Howdy Honda employee that they lost 2 people recently.  This person said that the new car sales department was short staffed. I found out that these two people now work for Round Rock Honda. He apologized to me for what they put me through. I never heard a word yet from my salesperson or the sales manager. I also emailed the general manager and he didn't reply either. A few days ago I called Honda in Los Angeles and told them the whole story. I did the survey from Honda via email. I also did the phone survey from the third party that Howdy uses for their surveys. I've asked for call backs but 3 weeks later, nothing.  Someone at Round Rock Honda told me that Howdy Honda has lost 3 sales people in 18 months due to the management at Howdy Honda.  

In another email from Jon on 6/21/12, he had this to say about Edmunds:

""I am truly sorry you have so many concerns about this new vehicle.  Once again, I think you are putting way too much faith in what these third party companies like Edmunds.com are saying.  The way their business is modeled throws actual selling prices out the window.  If they consistently show the lowest prices, then they get more internet traffic.  When they get more traffic, then they get more advertising dollars.  Hondas have a total mark-up of about 9%.  There is very little margin when buying or selling them.  I don‚Äôt know first hand how your car purchase was arranged, but I seriously doubt you paid above what the manufacturer, Honda, suggests unless there were additional accessories involved.  I will look into the matter further, and if I see anything out of the ordinary I will contact you.

Thanks,Jon Fitzpatrick""

I went to Howdy basically for a second opinion and felt I needed to do that!  The problems were always different so lemon law didn't qualify!  My dealership always took care of the problem, always gave me a loaner but went for second opinion and to get a repair done!  

1st off they fix the strut b/c of knocking noise, called to tell me I needed to change the brake fluid, transmission service, brakes needed replaced and other stuff looking at almost $500.00  well... I did the brake fluid service, transmission, oil change , tire rotation and they repaired the strut.  Mind you I arrived at the dealership at 645 am and the loaner car wasn't available that I was promised so I had to wait till after 8am in order to get a rental. But it was provided.  There was an accident so I basically spent 4 hours trying to get out of Austin.  Got all the way back to my work 70 miles away and the car was ready.  Got off and back to get the car.  

Started driving out and roaring noise.  They said it was the tires.  Warranty doesn't cover tires only the part that was broken.  Cupping was the problem with the tires.  Went to discount and they warranty the tires for the amount of wear! (at least they can be count on)  I bought brake pads and went to replace brakes to find they didn't even need to be replaced they were way over half way !  Funny how I passed a checkpoint a few weeks prior to this visit.  Glad I didn't pay them the $300 to change them.  

Now I still had the problem with the knocking sound in the car.  Emailed Jeff b/c he had spoken to me and promised he would help me get where I liked the car.  I sent him service records and called and left messages with no return call. I started looking for new cars and a lady called me to talk to me about sales but if the service department won't respond to emails and calls I won't do business with a company that refuses to help me get the situation resolved!!!! 

I will never leave my dealership for a second opinion.  After 10 years I should know they have my best interest and Howdy is exactly what the reviews say CROOKS, liars and only want the $$ from the customers they don't care about fixing issues or resolving anything!  I thought it would be different but I was proven wrong! 

I don't expect much but a return email, phone call something is nice!  I don't complain and would give the best reviews ever with a little consideration!

Asked the salesman who sold us the car last year to provide an independant opinion and possibly help escalate the issue with the dealership.  Is initial reluctance turned to rudeness/ insults.  ",1.4
509,"October 22, 2005","I have owned 3 Honda vehicles, and Howdy Honda tops the list in dealer ships.  I recently purchased a new Honda Element from Howdy Honda, and the level of customer service was excellent!  Our sales associate was knowledgeable and friendly, and I especially appreciated the no pressure sales (really!).  Prior to this purchase, I had used Howdy's service department, and had nothing but good experiences.  Now that I have purchased a vehicle from Howdy, I even plan to have oil changes at the dealership, in spite of the fact it is on the other side of town.  Their prices are reasonable, and the service is great!",4.8
