0,"June 19, 2020","After two separate visits in which we were provided a documented quote by two different managers, the dealership informed us that they would not honor their quoted price when we decided to buy the car. Robert Archer III, the first person to write up the original quote, claimed that the quote was based off of a lower trim model and he couldn’t match the deal despite the fact that the number originally quoted was right in line with KBB’s fair price and what other dealerships are offering around the nation. The only reason why we didn’t move on this car earlier was because something seemed off about the dealership even during our first visit. Their sales staff is at best lukewarm when it comes to how they treat others and it is now abundantly clear that their financial and managerial staff is a joke.",1.0
1,"April 14, 2020","Deceptive dealership
This dealership deserves its 2.5/5 rating. They lied about the actual car price (even though we could check it online), they had us sign the papers without stating the required advisories-- 72 hour return policy,  GAP insurance is optional and they added $1,290 for new car bumper to bumper warranty even though this was a used car with 82,000 free miles left on the warranty. Hated the experience. Stuck with it because they had the car i wanted but can't recommend them. When I called the next day they wouldn't return my call; I had to show up and confront them. When I told them I left something in my trade - in they wouldn't let me back into the old car, saying it already went to auction. It was the next day - they can't send it to auction for 3 days or 72 hours. They were awful. ",2.0
2,"December 11, 2019","Although I had a great experience when purchasing my vehicle at Archer VW I recently had the worst experience of my life when taking my vehicle in for service. On the morning of November 12th on my way to work, I received a check coolant light on my dashboard and saw an increase in the vehicle temperature. I quickly dropped the vehicle home and had it towed to the dealership with no problem at all. I called them to make an appointment and they said just bring it on over and they can help me. When I arrived there, nobody greeted me or said anything until I asked for the person I spoke to on the phone. I was told they would look at the vehicle and give me a call the following day with updates. The next day around 4 pm, I have yet to receive a phone call so I called them and they said they have not figured out what the issue was with the vehicle yet. I told them that would be fine, but I would be in need of a loaner car as I have no other way of getting to work and my service advisor said he would find me one. I call again the next day November 14th and they say they have found the issue to be with the cylinder, that it is covered under warranty, and that the parts have been ordered and should be there within a few days. I once again expressed my need for a loaner car and he responded with I just don’t have one. I ask him what the alternative is and he says there is not one. I ask if I can get a rental from a car rental agency and if they would pay for it and he says yes we can do that but that is a worst-case scenario. He then tells me he is going to look around for a loaner car. I told him that was fine and that I would call him at 5 for an update. When I call him he tells me he still has not found a car and I told him I needed a car and would be coming down to the dealership and if he has one great and if not we can go to enterprise for a rental vehicle. Sure enough when I get there he found a loaner car for me, which was a VW Jetta, although much smaller compared to my Atlas and though it does not fit my needs I told him that this would be fine if my vehicle would be done in a few days. As I get ready to leave the dealership, I ask for the Service Managers name and phone number and he walks me back into his office just to tell me he does not have any more of his cards, but he will get the service manager to call me tomorrow. To this day, I have received no phone calls from the service manager. The service advisor calls me the following week to tell me that my vehicle should be done the Tuesday before Thanksgiving November 26th, as they want to get my vehicle out before the holidays. From the 14th to the 26th, I get no phone calls no text messages no updates to what is going on with my vehicle. On the 26th I have to call him and he states that their technician has been out and they vehicle will not be done till later. No projected date just later. At that time I tell him I am in need of a larger vehicle to accommodate my family and he said they don’t have anything larger than a Tiguan and I tell him I need a 7 seater vehicle and he said he will find a way to get one to me on Friday November 29th. We switch the Jetta out for the Atlas and this vehicle is filthy. It has the previous customer belongings in it such as umbrellas and is filthy with crumbs, chip bags, trash, etc. We ask for a quick wash and he said there was a 45 minute wait time just for a quick exterior wash. Monday December 9th I receive a voicemail stating that my vehicle has been done since Friday and that I need to come in and pick it up. I received no phone calls or voicemails on the previous Friday from Archer VW. When I picked up the vehicle yesterday, I was stuck with a bill for $150 for an oil change that I never approved or discussed. When I dropped off the vehicle I told them that I thought it was almost time for the service to be done, but the charges associated with that were never discussed with me and I was anticipating a phone call to authorize these charges before the work was completed, but nothing. This is my first and probably my last Volkswagen not because of the vehicle but because of the disrespect and terrible service I received when taking my vehicle in for a warrantied issue.",1.0
3,"November 28, 2019","Watch out when you are buying a used vehicle from this dealership. Very unpleasant experience at this dealership who uses after market parts (instead of factory parts) to cover their warranty on their used problemed cars. I drove from Sam Antonio to Houston to look at a Jetta TDI at this dealership. Dealership claimed that the vehicle was in perfect condition and with no problems what so ever which was not accurate. I decided to look, drive and bought the vehicle after the dealership assured that this was completely checked and perfect to go. On the same day of the purchase and on my way back to San Antonio the air-conditioning went out of cool air. I called the dealership and they decided to take a look at and fix the problem so i had to drive back from San Antonio to Houston to get this checked and fixed. The same problem continued to occur with the cold air and after 3 trips from San Antonio to Houston and many complaints on this issue the dealership decided to change the AC unit. I found out from one of their employees that the parts used to fix the problems were after market parts instead of factory parts. One year after I still continue to experience the same problem over and over and the dealership is now refusing to take responsibility for the problem and their poor mechanical service. After complaining with VW corporate the dealership has confessed of using aftermarket/refurbished parts instead of VW Factory 

I also found out that the dealership did not placed the emissions sticker on the vehicle when sold. They finally did this.

In seconds, I had a response from Chris and he was able to make the deal happen in two days, not two months.    I drove to Houston and got the car.  I was in and out in an hour.  They were honest and even talked to me about what I actually needed in the way of warranties.   I can say without a doubt that this dealership is amazing.",5.0

9,"July 12, 2018","I purchased an Atlas. At the time I made offer to buy the car, no one disclosed to me the car has 671 miles on it. The car was delivered without all options listed. I have to tell my sale lady and talking to sale Manager, Steve to get all options listed delivered. The car delivered missing 1 key. I have to go back the next weekend to get the key. I went home and checked, the car missing wheel locks key. If I have a flat tire, I cannot change my tire. I called my sale lady and sale Manager. They told me I have to bring the car in again next weekend for service to remove the current wheel locks and installed new set. I felt this dealership just want to sale car not care about customer service. I will never recommend anyone to buy or service vehicle at this dealership. You never know what you driving off missing.",1.0
10,"June 18, 2018","Recently I need to have oil and filter change. As I purchased my car here I thought it would be a good idea to have the service done at the same place, so I planned to have the maintenance done at Archer, even though it is almost 4 hours drive round-trip for me. 

Before going I contacted them trying to schedule an appointment for Saturday, but was told that the oil change service only takes only 30-40 minutes so I could just stop by before 2pm, which is when they close. And after I got there at 1:05, I was turned down for the service because they wouldn't take any more cars. And it was only 1:05.

So I drove another 2 hours all the way back home and have nothing accomplished. 

But I really trusted Archer VW, so I decided to give it another try. I called the service again and explained my situation, and the service person on the other end of the phone was really impatient with the conversation. He said they don't take appointments on Saturdays, so I thought ""should I just spend every Saturday driving there wishing myself good luck without knowing whether my car will be taken care of?"" Why isn't making an appointment an option on Saturdays? The service person didn't seem to care my difficulties and answered ""just come early."" 

Like how early exactly?? And it's not even guaranteed that I will have my service since I cannot make an appointment. 

If they mean to stop service before 2pm, they shouldn't have said they close at 2pm, because they basically close at 1, or even earlier.",1.0
11,"May 15, 2018","The staff upon walking in was generous. We went to speak to Clyde who we were referred to, and he was kind and helpful. We told him the kind of car we were looking for and he brought us back and said go explore and choose what you love. We did, and found a beautiful Passat and bought it. Clyde was incredibly helpful in getting us to the price we want and working with us to see what we could do to arrange payments. We had gone to West Houston Volkswagen who were incredibly rude and left us upset. Here, it was a whole different experience ",4.6
12,"April 05, 2018","I purchased a 2018 Tiguan on Feb. 17,2018. The sales experience was seamless and quite enjoyable. Ricardo, Patrick and Jeremy have been stellar.  However the service team is loaded with snags to say the least.  My vehicle has been in for service twice for the same issue. The first time I took it in on Feb.27,2018 it was there until I called on March 5,2018. to see if service had been completed. On March 9 I returned back to the dealership for the same noise in the driver side door. After consistently calling the service department and being avoided by Ivan Wong, Gary Harriss , and everyone else in the service department, and  35 days of waiting, I finally get to pick up my car. Hopefully it is fully repaired and I can enjoy the vehicle I purchased 2 months ago. ",1.0

14,"January 04, 2018","1. Bad customer greeting/service- I had an appointment for service at 8.30 am today; got there on time; 2 service agents were at the window, but no one come and ask for help. I waited 5,6 minutes and went inside.
2. No knowledge of their work field- They checked 2 of my tires and said all 4 are worn out. I was okay to change my tires as well as 10k mile service.I have claim for tire replacement from a third party company whom I pay monthly for service.  They don’t have any idea how does this claim works and showed no interest to work with it. I gave them the claim# and the phone number to call that company and I went to work. After an hour the service agent Marc called and said that claim didn’t approve. I called that company and they are okay to pay but they need to get details from the technician. I called Marc and told this again and he said he will call the company again. After an hour, Marc called and said the claim doesn’t work and I can pick my car anytime I am ready. I asked them about service and they said they didn’t do and I need tell them to do service if I need (what the xxxx? I drop the car for 10k mile service and this tire case is an addition to it) I told will call them back in 10min.as I have to ask my husband because we were completely upset with them since morning. I called them  back at 12.30pm. The receptionist Janice said Marc is busy and I can leave a message with her. I told her to tell him to do the service.
3. No responsibility- I called around 3.30pm again to see the status and couldn’t reach him. When I went to pick up the car at3.45pm, they didn’t do anything, no service at all. 
I went to a tire shop right away. The claim works and replaced my tires. 
I will find someone else to do the 10k mile service, but never ever go back to this Archer Volkswagen.",1.0
15,"October 18, 2017","We recently purchased a used Passat from Archer VW.  The entire process was a giant pain.  We were originally quoted a price on July 18, 2017.  I looked at the car on July 22.  It took until August 2 to complete the paperwork on their end and to complete the purchase of the car.  During the paperwork process, the price of the car increased several times with them trying to sneak in different charges and warranties.  During negotiation, our salesperson promised to order us a paint touch up pen and mail it to us.  After numerous phone calls, emails and stopping by the dealership, it is six weeks later and we still do not have the promised touch up paint.  I also had to go to the dealership to pick up the license plates because they did not mail them to us in a timely manner.  I would NEVER work with this dealership and especially not the salesperson, Matt Collins, again.  ",1.6
16,"June 12, 2016","My wife and I drove cross town to see a GLI Archer had in stock and to see what kind of an offer they could make us for our trade.  We were met at the door by Kirk who was very welcoming and extremely patient with us while we had to call our insurance company to have an insurance card faxed in.  Everyone we met was extremely friendly and you could tell that their staff was very close knit - just a different vibe entirely. 

The very first offer they made us was equal to the best offer we received the day before at another dealer after an hour and a half of haggling....  My wife is extremely conservative and responsible which naturally makes her a tough sale and always inclined to ""walk""; but, Patrick was determined to make us an offer that would ""knock your socks off"" and make your ""can't do it yet"" into ""I can't leave without it"" and he did.

Every person we dealt with was extremely courteous, friendly and you could tell enjoy what they do.  Jeremy explained that MANY of their staff have worked for Mr. Archer for 10 years or more and it shows.  I love buying from a family owned business rather than a huge corporation - that still means something to me.

In my almost 40 years of driving, I've purchased numerous cars; but, yesterday's experience was the easiest, least stressful and most fun auto purchasing experience of my life.  I could not possibly recommend a dealership more highly and if you don't give Archer a chance on your next purchase you will be doing yourself a disservice.

22,"August 04, 2014","I went to purchase a 2014 Jetta before making my decision I asked the salesman what are the benefits of purchasing from his Dealership.  He then asked what he can do for me to get this sale completed. I advised him to take of a few hundred dollars.  So he took it to his Manager and he returned with order which the Manager wrote  a note on the order ""this is the best deal we can offer :)"".  The agent stated the note was written by the general manager.  I believe it was unprofessional and that he should have come and spoke to me.  I however,  purchased 2014 Jetta which showed 77 miles on July 29th.   Since it was my first week in the area and did not have an apartment and left the car at the dealership.  Upon my return to collect my car on Saturday it showed 288 miles. The agent stated my salesman was out of office.  I asked for the Manager he stated that would be Jeremy.  The agent went on to say that he believes it was an error as that happens all the time. I went to see Jeremy but saw another guy who stated Jeremy has left.  He did not introduce himself but asked how he can help.  I advised him on the situation which he too stated that it's an error that that occurs regularly. The other issue I had was that the car was  full of sand, hair etc although they claimed it was clean. I found out the guy I was talking with name is  Patrick who had know empathy.  He called another guy Matthew who gave me some mats for the car and then I started asking about the various upgrades for the car.  I advised Matthew since it was another $1300 I would take that he stated to talk with Patrick.  Of course helpless Patrick kept saying the same think we cannot take the car as it will now be a used car and that all information is already punched with  Volkswagen.  I also told him that I had a coupon from my job and if he could honor that he stated again it was already punched.  So here is a manager that put customers last.  He stated I will have Jeremy call you and that Jeremy maybe able to give a refund or help me upgrade.  Of course, Jeremy has not called 3 days and I am still waiting and he has not return my calls.  I thought the dealership is in business to make money but Patrick has refused me from getting an upgrade, or to use my coupon.   Patrick's customer service is extremely poor he did not budget to assist the customer.  Oh I forgot to mention when I asked for the second key for the car I was told the salesman took it home.  Of course, I believe they just needed to blame someone since he was not there.  Still waiting for key and call from Jeremy to get the upgraded car.  I must say Karim was extremely nice.  I must say my uncle was also looking at a car here but now will not be purchasing.

23,"June 26, 2014","I was driving on the freeway and the next thing I knew my car stopped working, so I pulled to the side of the freeway. I found an oil leak. But 300 miles before that I did my service at Archer for 40,000 miles. I towed the car to the dealership, and the next day I got a call from Marc and told me that there was possible water damage. I drove to the dealership to ask for the manager and he said that there was damage because there was a possibility that I drove through high water. Since I didn't like his answer, he told me that he will push my car into the parking lot. I went home and called VW of America to ask for assistance, and they gave me a supervisor to open my case. The next day, I received a call and a VW representative came to inspect my car. He found out that the turbo seal failed and said that I will get a new engine for free. Since they said that I could get a loaner car, I told them I would be there by 3:30 PM, but I got there at 3:15 PM. Marc was at lunch, so another service advisor called him to tell him that I arrived. I saw him, but he went to talk to another customer at 3:20 PM. After that, he called me and started yelling at me and told me I messed up his lunch. A week later, I got a call that my car was ready, so I went to pick it up and found some damage on the hood and foot prints from the mechanic on my white carpet, I tried to contact them and nobody answered or called back.

Bill worked with me to meet my price expectations, and had my Golf TDI ready for drive-out when the paperwork was completed.  

Karim Altbaughlma was professional, efficient, and friendly.  All closing documents were accurate and quickly prepared for signature - - no lengthy 'sitting around' - - .

I made a 200 mile trip specifically to trade my Dodge Charger for a Volkswagen TDI.  My time was limited, and my 'let's do it, or not do it' attitude was respected. (Thank you!)  I was not interested in a new vehicle, preferring a 3-4 year-old vehicle in excellent condition.  I understand there is more to consider in a used car trade than a new car trade - - but - - I had researched pricing and trade-in values.  I was ready to close!  I was very pleased to see that Archer Volkswagen was also prepared!

I am very pleased to recommend the used car arm of Archer Volkswagen as an efficient professional group who are ready, willing and able to make decisions.  As an overall impression of a 'car-buying experience' I would rate my experience with Archer ""As good as it gets"".

35,"May 11, 2013","When my wife and I first started shopping for a car 9 months ago, we stopped at all the dealerships on car row, on Hwy 59 between Beltway 8 and Bissonnet. We were shocked at the cost of 2-3 year old decent used cars with high miles and limited warranty, if any at all!  After an exhausting 5-6 hours of car shopping that day, we decided to head toward home, only to see one last dealership that we hadn't stopped by yet, Archer Volkswagen. As soon as we pulled onto the lot, my wife said, that's my car (a brand new 2012 Jetta). Sales consultant Johnny Bass greeted us, showed us the vehicle, we made an offer, they accepted the offer, we wrote them a check and picked up the car. The purchase process was hassle free and very enlightening! Since then, we sold the 2012 Jetta back to them recently, and bought 2 more 2013 Jettas, one for each of us, and we love them. We highly recommend purchasing your next new vehicle from Archer Volkwagen.

38,"April 25, 2013","Purchased a 2013 tiguan sel 4motion in march 2013.
Many may not know that its almost impossible to find 4motion tiguans in the houston area since dealers generally dont like to stock them as they cost more and the climate does not warrant the need.
But like the car enthusiast that i am, i felt like the 4 motion cars are better balanced and inspire a higher level of driving confidence.
Archer told me that it was no problem to get one since there were plenty inbound to the port of houston that they can trade for, so all it took was a painless phone call saying 'yes, pls get it for me in this color combination' and the dealer went to work getting the trade.
Delivery went smooth and finance was simple and no upselling of aftermarket accessories or warranties.
If you need a vw, go ask for david at archer vw.

42,"January 06, 2013","My wife and I went to Archer to perhaps purchase a Honda CRV (used).  Overall, we liked the car but it had an obvious problem with the right rear wheel that the salesman (can't remember his name) acknowledged as we drove it AND again once we got back into the offices.  There was a deep rumbling sound and vibration that was definitely not the tire.  We were still willing to consider purchasing the vehicle provided they would offer us some sort of incentive to get that wheel fixed.  Our salesman said he'd see what he could do and as he ""went to talk to the manager,""  and he came back and said that he and the manager would take it out to see what was wrong.  It was no time before we didn't see him again and we were speaking only to ""someone higher"" who was slimy.  This guy (I think his name was ""Sayeed"", but I'm not sure how to spell it), showed us all the work they did on the vehicle and said ""they fixed everything"" wrong with it.  I then explained that they obviously had not only NOT fixed everything (and that I was not the only who was quite aware of it) but that by his insisting they fixed everything, one of them (our salesman or him) was not being truthful. Since they would not work with us and were being deceptive, we walked out.  We are so glad we did, because we drove straight from there and went to Champion Nissan in Katy were we purchased a newer CRV with fewer miles for less money and no slimy salesman.  Do NOT trust the folks at Archer!",2.0
43,"December 18, 2012","STAY AWAY from this place!!! I would give zero stars if I could. Made an agreement Saturday night 12-15-12 to purchase a 2012 Honda accord. Called salesman right after we left the dealership and told him we would take it. He said great that when we got home to fax him our credit card and drivers license to hold it. When we got home I faxed it in. I called and texted the salesman to make sure it was received. I spoke with the salesman and he said he received it and he would move the car around back so no one else could get it. 
On Monday morning I sent my salesman a text to let him know we were lining up financing and insurance and would be in. I received a text back saying no problem. About ten minutes later I received a text saying it had been sold. I was then told another salesman sold it to someone else Monday morning. I then received a call from Ken the sales manager. He was very unsympathetic and offered to sell me an 2011 accord with twice as many miles for the asking price.  My salesman wasn't such a bad person but this Ken guy was something else. He acted like I was bothering him about complaining that he sold a car out from under me. The salesman did try to rectify it and still make a deal. I don't want a used Volkswagen and that was about all they had besides some worn out cars with over 100k on them. 
I spoke with a Jeremy Ortega this morning and he wasn't much help either. It seems like the only one trying to save the deal and keep me as a customer was my salesman.

44,"August 29, 2012","The sales person and his manager at Archer VW sadly personify all the sterotype of a used car salesperson.  They are tricky, sneaky, and dishonest. I found a Mazda 3i that they were selling via car.com.  I went and test drove it and came to a price agreement with Jad, the salesthing. I verified the agreed price several times before going into the dealership to pick up the vehicle. When I arrived at Archer, Jad had me sign a liability agreement for the car before they would release it to me to take it to my mechanic for inspection.  After I signed the document, Jad disappeared and came back seconds later with his manager.  His Manager, on cue, apologetically explained that they made an error in agreeing to the price and wanted $200 more. Now, $200 doesn't make or break a deal on a $12,000 vehicle, but lack of honesty and integrity does. Sadly, honesty, trust, and a man's word is an extraterrestrial term and concept to these Aliens.  The entire stage was set up to manipulate me into their office for an extra pathetic $200? Really? All that drama for $200??? Needless to say, I walked out, thoroughly disgusted. I'm going to another dealership for a new vehicle.  I'm sure they thought they had me when I walked in and signed that liability agreement.

I live 400 miles away, so I called the dealership and told them that this was the exact truck I was looking for at a great price and I was willing to make the drive to pick it up. I then asked them to please walk around the truck and describe every square inch of it to me before I drive 400 miles to purchase it.  One of the salesman walked around it on his cell phone and described it to me as ""Flawless, one of the nicest trucks he's ever seen"".  Well, I get there, the truck is definitely NOT flawless.  The inside of it smells like an animal shelter, the passenger side door had bondo putty smeared all over it (poor body repair job from where the truck was wrecked), the brakes needed to be replaced, and the front bumper was crooked.  These are all things I could not see from the pictures they had online.  However, this experience got much worse when I met a guy name KEN ADDISON, the Used Car Sales Manager.  This guy was extremely rude, and told me that ""It wasn't his problem"".  He offererd no apology for the waste of time and money I incurred to get there.  Ken Addison at Archer VW in Houston is the stereotypical Sleazebag Dishonest Used Car Salesman.  Maybe it's a good place to buy a new VW, not sure, but don't buy a used car here, they can't tell the truth.

47,"March 06, 2012","   This all started a year ago when I saw a Nissan Xterra on their web sight I went and asked for it, Mike Lewis was the one that hepled us, he could NOT find any info on it and could not find the car,I told him it was outside blocking a gate on the other side of the lot adjacent to them, he could not find the keys to it but promissed he would get it in a day so he took my name and #, never called me back, so I called 3 days later wouldn't you know, they had no info on it! That Xterra sat on that same spot for a YEAR! A year later I went back and they finally found the keys and let me test drive it,it sounded awful!The other reason was we also had our eyes on a Nissan Quest we explained to him we were intersted in buying the car with two thousand down he ran our credit and told us that once we get the money we all go talk to Bart to work on a in house finance we came back in five days to talk to Bart only to find out that they had sold the car without calling us knowning we were intrested then in an attempt to get our business Mike found another Xterra for me and called me before they did an inspection on it or put a price on it, I got to test drive it and told him I would be back to test drive it again. He said to be back the next day when Bart the general manager would be there and the Xterra would be ready for me. Well two days later and he could not find the car anywhere!!! Mike Lewis spent 45 of my minutes looking for the car!!When I told him he does not know his inventory and he told me he works in new car sales and not used cars, I asked why am I dealing with you for? He answered I have been working with you for a year and I want to put you in a car! Finally he tricked me into going across the freeway to see if the car was there, well it was only to see Bart! Bart approved me, but when I asked for the price, Bart said he needed to wait to see what their cost would be, but wanted my down payment to sell the car to me, NOT to place a hold on the car, but to put down as actuall payment on a car I have no idea what the price is! I asked them to call me when they get their stuff together and Bart said "" I don't call people back, you see my phone rings costantly. If you want it come back with you're money."" I left thinking Mike will just call me with the price, when I called him that evening for the price Mike said "" That's between you and Bart, I am out of this, I know it sounds wierd, but that's how it's done!""

49,"March 06, 2011","I did extensive research and decided on the exact vehicle, options and color I wanted - 2011 VW Jetta Sportwagen TDI DSG, reflex silver.  I then began price comparison/negotiations with the internet sales managers of most of the VW dealers within 150 miles of my home.  Archer VW's Internet Sales Manager, Johnny Huynh, responded immediately to my phone calls and emails and offered the best price right off the bat.

I didn't want to leave anything to chance since I was to travel three hours to the dealer and it would have been a significant inconvenience had everything not gone as expected when I arrived to pick up the car.  In my emails to Johnny, I asked for the total ""drive away price"" and all the particulars about the car, VIN, stock number, exact list of options, etc. - essentially everything in writing up front.  Johnny quickly and pleasantly provided all the requested information.

My first contact with Archer was on a Tuesday and I picked up the vehicle on the following Saturday.  I arrived at Archer at 3:30PM, met with Johnny, inspected the vehicle thoroughly, test drove it, met with the finance guy, reviewed and signed the sales documents and I was back on the road in my new Jetta at 4:30PM.

Overall impression: sales dept. barely knows what they're doing out there....service dept. is a bunch of half-speed mopes....Gary, the service dept. manager looks like he's counting the days to his retirement party.

I had the car towed back to the dealership and demanded my money back.  If they sold me a supposedly certified car and it broke the same day, I want nothing to do with it.  Later that day they called me to tell me that it was my fault and that I broke the clutch and that, even though I had been told otherwise, there was no way I was getting my money back and that I was locked into the contract.

When I finally got in touch with a manager after the weekend, he confirmed that I could cancel my contract but that the dealership would be filing a claim with my insurance for the damage I caused.

Luckily, the tow service took us to Archer, where , exhausted, we dropped the car.  We rented a car to return home (we live about three hours from Houston)..

The damage was great (new head needed).  Tim communicated well, and as soon as we demo'd that we'd done all our warranty checks, what would have been a VERY expensive repair was taken care of by the old 10/100,000 warranty blazingly fast.  The car came back to us quickly, clean and with an excellent job done.  I feel like I have a new car, despite the 86,000 plus miles on it.

One of those times they told us the car was ready, we returned (and paid for) her rental, went to pick up the car, and it wasn't actually ready.  We had to go back and rent another car for another day.  This last time they actually paid for a rental, which was surprising, but we had to make all the arrangements - pick up, delivery, etc.  One time they had to order a part that would take over a week, so they gave us the car back until it arrived.  Two weeks later we finally called to check on it.  The part had arrived, but no one bothered to call us.  Another time we requested a 15K mile maintenance.  They performed the 5K mile maintenance!  When we called about it, the service tech said the 5K and 15K maintenance were the same, which they are not.  How hard it is?  We requested a 15K maintenance, the car has 15K miles; this isn't rocket science.  Another time a power window broke on the passanger side.  When we went to pick it up they said nothing was wrong with the driver's side window!  Somehow, when they discovered one window worked correctly, it didn't occur to them to try the other three, just in case.  We had to leave the car another night.

Archer, its really very simple:
1.  Listen to the customer
2.  Fix it right the first time
