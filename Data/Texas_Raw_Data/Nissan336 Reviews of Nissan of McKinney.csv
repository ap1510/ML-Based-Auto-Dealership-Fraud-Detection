0,"June 08, 2020","I just want to say THANK YOU to the salesperson that went above and beyond to bring paperwork to my house for me to sign to finish up the deal with my daughter, Because of health reasons, I was not able to come to the dealership. The drive one way is almost a hour., so it was not a quick drive for him. Thanks to him the deal was sealed and my daughter is now the proud owner of a Jeep Cherokee. I would also like to thank the finance department who worked with her until they were able to reach an agreement that she was very happy with. I will definitely refer anyone to your dealership for their next vehicle.",5.0

2,"March 20, 2020","When my husband and I are in the market for a new/used vehicle, he does a great deal of research and shopping before deciding to make a drive to a dealership.  This was the case today.  After much online shopping, he found a vehicle that was worth taking a look at, a specific vehicle... not just any car on the lot.  We made an appointment.  We had to make an almost 2 hour drive.  When we were 30 minutes away, we let the salesman know so that he could have the vehicle ready.  He agreed he'd have it out front ready for us.  Five minutes after that email, he sends a message saying that someone is test driving it.  Literally two minutes before we arrived, he emails us to say it has sold.  We were LIVID.  This transaction went down a little too quickly and coincidentally.  The car had been listed for around 3 weeks according to CarFax.  It seems unlikely that two people would show up within minutes to look at the same vehicle.  We had an appointment and had to take a day off of work.  This is deceptive and underhanded.  We feel like this was used as a hook to get us to the dealership when it was never really available.  If a person has an appointment for a specific vehicle, it needs to remain available, particularly when that person has to a)travel some distance and b) is already on the way and almost there.  This is not good business practice, and we will never use this dealership in the future.",1.0

4,"January 19, 2020","For such a big dealership I can't believe that they would bring themselves down so low! I just bought a car a month ago from David McDavid Acura in Plano and I wish they had the car that I was looking for because I would reccomend this dealership a million times more! This Nissan did not honor what they agreed upon! I went to this dealer to check a Suburban, I test drived it and came down to an agreed upon price with tax, title, and reconditioning. The next day, we were going to stop by and bring the check. They said that they did not agree upon that price we had agreed upon. I was actually trying to negotiate to get it lower. And I have text recipts of this promise of theirs to back it up! So, I don't know what to say except that this is a dealership full of lies! Additionally, I talked to 2 different sales people for the same car. And don't ask to finance through someone else because there will be a total change in attitude. I will not recommend going here to anybody. I haven't even had someone call to see how everything went. By far the worst experiance!",1.0

6,"December 02, 2019","Francis made my first car purchase the best experience ever! I been looking for a car for the past year and every dealership I’ve been to in Tyler, tx I was walked away from and not welcomed. I went online and saw a car at McKinney. Y’all It was worth the two hour drive all the way to McKinney. Thank you Francis!! He answered all my questions and all my concerns. He made everything hassle free and everything explained in detail and all the employees I talked to were very welcoming and I’ve never seen a dealership like this one. I can’t emphasize how worth my two hour drive was. I left driving back with my new certified pre-owned car! Thank you Francis for all your excellent work! ",5.0
7,"November 12, 2019","This was our third Nissan purchase, second from Nissan of McKinney. We have been very satisfied with the reliability of the vehicles. 
Unfortunately, this time we dealt with an individual named Oscar. After a back and forth hassle we agreed on a monthly rate and a down payment. We both signed on the offer and moved forward on the purchase. Oscar was kind enough to charge my card and shortly afterwards infotmed me that the monthly rate increased. I was not happy, we agreed on a different number. Oscar never apologized, acted completely unprofessional whenever I confronted him about the issue. 
I would be very cautious closing a deal with Nissan of McKinney. They will try to increase the closing price if you do not pay close attention.

8,"November 01, 2019","Overall I did not expect this kind of unprofessional from this company.

To start with, even the very first experience was not awesome.

I reached them to appraise my car for sell. The entire process was not informed in the beginning and sales person did not even have a courteous gesture. After the appraisal, first they confirmed 13,200 but after immediately a director full of attitude(to show us that buying a car is big favor to us), reduced the quote to 11000 giving few reasons. Not sure why they could not do enough due diligence in advance and present me the final number. Looks like its all a game to show the customer that its all favor whatever they offer.

Though they commit to meet KBB numbers, even though everything was excellent in the car, they couldn't keep the KBB sale price offer of 12,300.

As I could not have any other deal in the meantime, I approached sales person over e-mails and he confirmed (sales agent Aaron Bantu) 11,500 as the final offer after negotiation.

When I arrived to sell my car, there were many surprises -

After half an hour of starting the process, sales person tells that they cannot provide the check upfront. - Why this could not be told in advance, I am not able to apprehend.

By now, they knew, I need to sell the car that day due to my international move. After some more time, the manger or director full of attitude, comes up and tells that they can only offer 11,300 and totally negates what was committed over e-mail, putting all the blame on sales person who was interacting. It was all appearing as acting and pre-setup.

The other senior person when I approached to verify about any other possibilities of getting the check upfront, did not loose any opportunity to convey again that's its favor not the business and told, I am still open if don't want to sell my car since they already knew it is the last minute deal for me. I could not expect this entire setup and game played by the entire team.

Finally, they did all the paper work but NOT even provided a receipt first till asked in number of ways to a number of people. There is not bill of any sort for this transaction.

WORST EXPERIENCE INTERACTING WITH THEM!!!",1.0
9,"October 22, 2019","Our entire experience with Nissan of McKinney left us so frustrated.  They deceived us about what the extended warranty covered.  We were told we would get a rental car whenever we needed service and they fought us or tried to charge us for a car each time we brought it in for service.  It was brought in 5 times because they wouldn't give us a rental car, they would take days instead of the hours they said it would take, they had the wrong part, excuses, excuses, excuses. After 5 months, 5 visits, the car still isn't properly fixed so we traded it at a different dealership.  What a waste of time, money, energy.  Now they won't answer the phone so I can fight to get my full refund on my extended warranty that they never honored. ",1.0
10,"June 30, 2019","My wife and I had originally gone in to get an oil change on our 2018 Frontier. She has always liked the Midnight Edition Frontier but we couldn't afford it first time around. We talked to Curtis, the dealer there, who shuffled numbers and finally got her the truck she's always wanted in the price range we could afford. Curtis was not only very nice, courteous and helpful, he really went out of his way to understand our needs and work within the very tight budget restraints we had. I told my wife on numerous occasions there was no way he was going to get that truck for us and I'll be damned if he didn't do it. Curtis is our man now and we will make sure to deal with him anytime when we have vehicle needs.",5.0

13,"April 18, 2019","I shopped for a used car and had a wonderful experience. Abraham Awkal was very helpful and made the process painless and quick. I even had two crazy kids with me during the process. I highly recommend Nissan of McKinney and Abraham. He answered all of my questions through text throughout the day and had cars ready for me to test drive when I arrived. I was able to leave with the vehicle I’ve wanted for the last 15 years with payments I can afford in record time. Thank you, again! This is the 3rd car I’ve purchased from them.

16,"February 15, 2019","I wrote below review and gave one star to dealer a few weeks ago.  I wanted to give 4 stars now, because service manager Mr. Clint Givens and I had a discussion.  Mr. Givens is decent, fair, and professional. He gave me full refund.  The only reason why I didn't give 5 stars is because I believe dealer should improve its electronic car key testing process.  I still don't understand why dealer did poorer job than locksmith.

 would put no star there is an option here.

I am driving a Nissan altima I purchased from them. The electric car key stopped working, so I took it to them hoping them they can repair it. They charged me $154 for telling me my car key was not repairable, and need a new key with price of $350. I took the same key to a local locksmith. After putting a new battery, the car key works fine.

Bottom line: don't go there, they are not worth your trust.",4.6

61,"February 17, 2017","I am a widowed grandmother and I went to Nissan to buy my second used vehicle from them.  First I looked online at the certified cars, found one I liked and went to purchase.  I thought everything was going fine.  I was told what my monthly payment would be but since it was late Saturday night the paperwork would be ready Monday morning.  Oh, and they wanted time to ""get me"" the 7 point or something warranty.  I was assured by the salesperson and this finance person that the car was certified.  It had a little more than 7,000 miles on it.

No one ever called me back on Monday.  They had insisted on Saturday that I take the car home on Saturday because it was a ""done deal"".  I called on Tuesday and someone told me that until there was a final finance agreement I couldn't come and sign the papers.  I was confused because I thought it was all done.  I became irate and asked to speak with a finance manager.  Ron Gibson came on the phone and apologized for no one calling me back and blah blah blah.  I made an appointment to meet with him.  The appointment was made because I did not have another 2-3 hours to spend in their waiting room again.  I arrived on time and was seen 1 hour later.

Mr. Gibson was very nice and we reached an agreement.  He told me that they couldn't get me the 7 point warranty included but the car was certified.  The salesperson had told me that I would receive the 2nd key fob when I came to get the tags.  I didn't get a 2nd key fob and when I asked the salesperson he called the finance department and told me that I would have to pay hundreds of dollars for it.  I was in a hurry and just thought oh, well and left.

When I took my car in to get it serviced I was told that I would have to pay for the oil change and tire rotation and I disagreed because the car was certified.  They said no.  I asked to speak with Mr. Gibson.  He was with a customer and I waited for two hours to speak to him.  He could not remember our deal and said he would have to check the records and would call me the next day.  He didn't.

I called on Wednesday and asked to speak with someone and was referred to Brandon Galvan.  He said that he would look into and call me back on Friday regarding the paperwork.  He didn't.  I call the next Tuesday and could not reach Mr. Galvan but Mr. Gibson did come to the phone.  I asked why he hadn't called me back and he said that the service person was supposed to call me back and tell me that the car is certified.  I told him that he hadn't and he said he would check it out and call me back in 20 minutes.  He didn't  (surprise).  I called back in 4 hours and was directed once again to Mr. Galvan who told me that he had checked into it and the car wasn't  certified.  I asked what was the recourse because I was assured that it was certified.

I mentioned at the beginning of the letter that I am a widow for a reason.  As a single woman it was mandatory for me to have a car that is certified.  I do not know how to work on them and don't have lots of money to spend on repairs.  So when I tell people that I made sure that the car was certified, I asked several times and was assured that it was certified.

Mr. Galvan said that it came down to one person's word against another person's word.  I told him again that I was not lying and I knew what was said during the finance agreement.  I then asked him why did Ron Gibson tell me earlier that  same day that it was certified.  Mr. Galvan said he didn't know why but there was one more place that he could look.  Guess what??  He looked somewhere else and said yes the car was certified.  He even told me ""You are not crazy!  We are the crazy ones"".  He told me that he would contact the salesperson regarding the key fob the next day.  Did I mention that I had purchased the vehicle in September and this has drug out since then?  

That was two weeks ago and I still haven't gotten a key fob.  I called again and was directed this time to Ron Gibson.  He said he would let Mr. Galvan know that I had called when he came in at noon.  That was four days ago and he hasn't called back.

So basically I have been called a liar, given the run around, assured that I wasn't crazy by the sales department at Nissan of McKinney.  I haven't received a key fob or an apology for all of the arguing and time spent of attempting to get something that I was told I had.  

I am sure that I will get the standard response ""so sorry we couldn't"" and contact the manager.  I will be contacting the manager and I will also tell people of my last experience with Nissan.",1.6
62,"February 04, 2017","The service representative has zero customer service I had so bad experience since we bought two cars from them last year one of those car Sentra one. Has different problems since we bought it 
It's 2014 we have service contract with them should cover any mechanic issue ,so when we had problem we went to them between two service representatives we lost they keep telling us we are not covered and your car is fine 
Was so rude since Chad fixed it I forget to say the first problem happend on the same week we just bought it 
After all today I went over there I had another issue in my car loudly voice come from the car so 
I went at 6:15 met Derck he was a sales representative so when I started to tell him what's happen he pointed to me with hand to just wait because he has to make this phone call , then after I told him what's happened to my car he said we will not be able to assist you today or tomorrow may be feb 12 k said it's too far I can we find something close, he went to my car to see what's going on then he said I think it's transmission we will have it at least 10 days 
Then he pulled up my contract then he said I see you have 2 warrants but you will pay $146 to diagnose the car 
I asked him why we should covered he said even though we are not open the light and open the business for just nothing you have to pay 
Was so rude I told him please I need you to give me reason in contract say that 
He said why we have to argue in so rude way

64,"January 20, 2017",I went to Nissan of McKinney to trade in my truck with the attention of flipping out my truck for a Nissan Pathfinder with no downpayment. Of course with challenge credit that was impossible plus I was going to have some negative equity left from my truck. But the Pathfinder had lots of rebates to override my negative equity. Cool I knew that. Nissan came back with great news. I was approved for a 2017 Pathfinder. But I had to give them $2000 downpayment. I told them I didn't have the money right then but I can come up with $1200 next week if u work with me with the $800. They said fine. Then I was asked can u right a post dated checks. I told them I don't do checks and I don't have checks. They said OK can u get a temporary check with your route number and account number. I said yes I can do that. So I went to my bank and got it drove back to the dealership and the owner said no we need a check with your name on it. I said my bank don't do that but the other information u needed is on the check. As I waited I signed papers and everything they came back and said we have a problem we ran your check and it didn't go through. I said why would u run my information on that check. They said well can u get an overhead letter stating that this is your bank account. I said yes I can do that. So I went back to the bank and got the letter and even got bank statements. Went back to the dealership and the owner said no we can't accept that. So I said okay. Then I received a call from one the sales reps and he told me man just come in next week with the downpayment and we work with the rest of the stuff. Guess what I back out of the deal because they put me through too much run around for a new ride. You don't do your customers like that. You take care of them. I was so disappointed that I just said forget it it's not meant for me to get that ride in the first place. So I kept my money and put it elsewhere important. Too bad for the sales rep because he got screw over his commission because of an owner that is greedy for money and want the money right then and there after I told him and gave him my word and even sign a promising note that I will bring the downpayment in the date I was going to bring it in. Thanks owner. Job well done. You done screw over that man's bonus.,2.0

66,"January 01, 2017","I wish if I can give Zero rating or even negative for this record. My experience with Nissan of Mckinney pre-owned department was not only unprofessional but humiliating. In the process of shopping for car I went to Nissan  Mckinney on Dec 31st. While I liked Nissan Sentra there and quoted a price, sales rep made a counter offer and said that he cannot match our current price. I went ahead with my wife to shop any other better deals at other dealers. So far all OK! In few minutes we got a call from sales rep saying that they have a ""GREAT"" deal and requested us to come back. We asked about great deal but sales rep refused to disclose the details and insisted us to come back. We went back and the ""GREAT"" deal was $50 less than what Nissan offered earlier.

I was flabbergasted that these people made me travel back to Nissan showroom for $50. But this was not the end of their unprofessional and slick behavior. I still agreed, hoping to end my search here and was ready to make the compromise w/ the deal. When I started asking about Nissan Warranty details, sales rep smiled wryly and said that because Nissan has reduced price further from their original counter offer by $50, they have removed Nissan warranty. I was shocked and asked but when did you tell this, on the first place. He has pretty standard response that my manager asked me to do that and further suggested very comfortably to buy it separately for $399. 

The very first reason, I along w/ my wife agreed to go for buying the relatively costlier car from Nissan was its mechanical warranty instead of other dealers. We talked this w/ rep multiple times during original conversation and he knew very clearly that it is the most important deciding factor for us.  But Rep (along w/ their manager) reduced the price and conveniently removed the warrant without even caring to mention it once  from their ""great"" offer. This was not only slick marketing but a very self defeating and humiliating experience for us. 

We walked out of store with out any further word. In next one hour I received more than 5 calls  and text messages from Nissan salesperson. No apologies were offered in those texts.  But NOW Nissan Mckinney is ready to provide us warranty also along w/ certification as his manager agreed for it, BUT I need to rush to their store in 30 mins before 9 PM because this offers is valid till 12/31 9 PM and I started receiving those texts around 7:30 PM. 

Please hear this out very carefully Nissan reps. Probably you can make few dollars with deceit practices and insensitive marketing approaches but in many ways you will teach same values to your kids, and brothers and sisters and many others  and when they will go through same experience, you will have no answers for them. Because it is your who are making this world darker.

First off, James was patient and accommodating...had no issues with him. I pulled the price off USAA first then found a cheaper price on Autotrader. I asked them to go $1800 less than the Autotrader number. Jeneva gave me a number that was over any price that was advertised. When I discovered that, I asked to talk to Jeneva and find out how she came about that number. I also mentioned it seemed dishonest. When she came over, she completely avoided my question and just said she cannot come down from the Autotrader price. Instead of pressing my question I asked why they would not budge on price. She said it was what they would get at Auction and I left. Being bothered as to why I received an out the door price above what was advertised, I called and asked for her manager, Julian. Julian also avoided my question and proceeded to sell me stating what if they could go down $1000 from what she quoted me (finally back to their Autotrader price minus $100). Being frustrated and knowing it was closer to where it should have been, I asked for another $100 off. After siting down, it really was only $200 off their asking price. Knowing I was supposed to receive $500 off for being a USAA member, I asked why I didn't receive it. Julian explained that the Autotrader price was $600 less than USAA and it didn't apply. Disappointed in their service at this point was an understatement. I know someone who looks over contracts and they looked at the listing for me. It stated the vehicle was Nissan Certified and it included a 7 year/100,000 powertrain warranty along with roadside assistance. It was even stated in Carfax that it was certified. Their response was that they did the inspection to get it certified but costs them to register it with Nissan. You don't get the warranty without the registration. The beginning prices was $2000, then $1000, then $500, then $399. I finally paid for it but was told by another dealer that it wasn't more the $300 and again I lost money and they dishonestly made more. While I was trying to figure out the legality of listing the car as Certified, I had Julian come over and very rudely remark on how I've been there for hours and he wasn't going to take any more money off and that I agreed to the price. He said someone was on their way to buy the vehicle and I needed to make a decision right then. If I hadn't returned my rental car, I would have walked out immediately. His attitude and demeanor was extremely uncalled for. I had never been treated so poorly in a dealership and I was not even working directly with Julian. Needless to say, I feel the dealership was dishonest on several occasions through the transaction, the manager (who should have been better mannered than anyone else) was extremely rude, and I drove away with a car but was unsatisfied on all accounts. I felt as if Julian was stating that I was wasting their time. I did not have James go talk to him or ask him to talk to his manager. I urge others to avoid this dealership as I would not normally take the time to write up a review this extensive should I have only been slightly upset. I feel others need to know what kind of people work there and what you may be up against as well.

80,"August 14, 2016","After 10 hours of working and negotiations, we find out that one of the deal-breaking answers to one of our initial questions regarding the vehicle was a lie. We had researched the towing capacity of the vehicle and had asked 10 hours prior, what the capacity of this specific vehicle was, since most websites cited a range for this model. The towing capacity was vital since it was one of the main reasons for the purchase. We asked the sales associate and manager who both assured us that it was the full amount without properly investigating it (they looked it up on a third-party website trusting their word over what the Nissan website stated). In fact, we asked on 5 different occasions because this issue was key. We decided to come in to the dealership, trusting their word. This was after being jerked around for 3 hours over email and text with a slow response time. I get the dealership is busy, but maybe hire more people rather than jerking around customers. Needless to say, after giving them multiple chances, we drive all the way up to McKinney only to find out that what they had told us to begin with was a lie. We got some cheap apologies and the manager who said he was overseeing the sale, never even offered an apology—even after texting him directly. This was a customer service fail—through and through, and a HUGE waste of time. This dealership should be ashamed of how they treated us… not that it makes any difference now. ",1.4

95,"March 16, 2016","So i was looking for a car for my brother and been to other dealerships to see who will give me a good money for my trade. Since i live in the area i decided to give these guys a chance.. It started off really good with Edwin the Sales Manager he worked a great deal and gave me exactly what i wanted for my Trade for the first vehicle... While i was there i have decided to drive a AUDI Q5 they had and since He had given me such a good deal i decided to buy that vehicle as well.. And it turned out to be the worst mistake and the biggest nightmare.. The car was listed on there website for $30K ... i offered $26,500 For the Car and he accepted and shook my hand and also had me sign his sheet with me and him agreeing on the terms and price. Keep in mind this was all happening at around 8:00 PM . They did all the paperwork and as he was getting ready do send me to finance he saw that the guy who was my Sales agent ( Oscar) pulled out in the Q5 to get it cleaned and  Edwin the manager Ran to me and said oh i thought you were buying the AUDI A5 and he had worked the numbers on that and not the Q5 ..Oscar even told him he doesn't understand why he would do that when i did not even test drove the A5 and even the carafax information and everything i signed it had Q5 viN number on it... so he said he cannot do the deal  at this point i have already been at the dealership for about 2 hours and it was 10:00 PM at night .. I was so Frustrated that he made the mistake and he should of honored what we agreed on. But Rather he didn't care if leave both of the cars and take my business elsewhere. So he asked me the lowest he can do is $28,500. And that was it at this point they have already taken my Honda accord V6 in for a trade took all my stuff out took my license plates my Toll Tag everything.. So i was frustrated that there word meant nothing . i decided to go ahead and buy the car anyways as i felt my time was too valuable and i have already wasted 2 hours with these people..

Then i go to the Finance just to find out they can't even do financing that late. Yet they didn't inform me that when he was trying to negotiate deals with me to get 2 cars from him. So  they inform me that i will have to come tomorrow to sign up the paperwork  but i can take the cars home.. Which i did next day around 9 AM i call the dealership and ask to speak to the Director of Finance Jason Reese..  and was told that they are still trying to close out February and he haven't even ha da chance to work on my file . I was a victim of identity theft so i had Fraud alert on my credit file which i have listed for these guys and i was informed that they are only going to send my credit to NISSAN FINANCE< CHASE AND CAPITAL ONE BANK.. Later that day i had 9 new injuries on my credit report and when i called Jason Reese again he said he doesn't know what happened.. How can you be a director or finance and don't know what happen .. SO around 1 pm i called again to see if my paper work was ready to sign and Jason Reese told me he will have it ready by the end of that business day or give me an update before he leaves.. I never got any emails calls or anything from him at all. SO i call the dealership at around 6:30PM speak to Edwin at this point i was extremely frustrated and he told me that the paperwork was ready and i can come pick it up. While i am driving to the dealership OSCAR My sales agent Called and told me that the paperwork was not ready and i was given a false information and i will have to come the next day. So Next day i call and speak to BRANDON IN finance so far he was the only person who has been helpful and i went in and got my papers finally around 1pm the 3rd day .. And these guys quoted me and on my paperwork i signed it says my interest rate is 4.49% on Audi and 3.99% on Nissan but then when both of my accounts were opened the interest rate is different  much higher which i am still trying to fight with both banks to get it corrected.. I was not going to write this review  at first because i felt these people have already wasted my time enough and they don't really care anyways .. But then again today when i got a call from the BANK telling me the VEHICLE i have traded in the loan is still not been paid off and it has been over 2 weeks.. SO THE REASON I AM WRITING THIS I WANT ALL OF YOU TWO KNOW THIS DEALERSHIP IS A TRUE DEFINITION OF BAIT AND SWITCH AND TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT .. ANOTHER KICKER THE NISSAN I BOUGHT WAS CERTIFIED WHICH THE SALES AGENT TOLD ME IT INCLUDES IN THE STICKER PRICE BUT NO THEY ADD ANOTHER $2000.00 TO THE TAG PRICE TO MAKE IT CERTIFIED SO DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE STICKER PRICE....PLEASE TAKE YOUR BUSINESS TO OTHER DEALERSHIPS WHERE IT WILL BE APPRECIATED AS I AM SURE YOU ALL WORK HARD FOR YOUR MONEY LIKE I DO.. THEY NEVER HONORED THE PRICE THAT WE AGREED ON NEVER OFFERED ANY COMPENSATION FOR ALL THE RUN AROUND NOTHING. ... SO PEOPLE GO ELSEWHERE DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH NISSAN OF MCKINNEY .. THANK YOU ",1.0

97,"March 14, 2016","By far my biggest regret is purchasing a vehicle from this dealership. The minute after I signed the papers for my used 20K 2012 murano I had nothing but problems with this dealership. They wouldn't release the car the next day saying it hasn't been certified yet (I purchased it certified). Then the license plate fell off because they did not replace the anchors and the screws were too loose. Next the seat warmer button broke stuck on the ""on"" setting and fell into the console, which has to be completely removed in order to fix.

Then I had to take my vehicle in YET AGAIN (3rd time) since purchasing 5 weeks ago. I had to pay to replace the driving belt. Because of ""wear and tear"" it wasn't covered in the dealership OR additional bumper-to-bumper warranty.

Additionally this dealership charged me a $1300 reconditioning fee and a $700 certification fee. I wonder what exactly they reconditioned? When I asked for a print out there were only minor repairs that added up to $650. 

To top it off I purchased the $2700 bumper-to-bumper warranty that does not cover anything apparently. 

The management team has been extremely unhelpful and my salesman disappeared after my sale was complete. I DO NOT recommend purchasing a vehicle from here.

126,"August 04, 2015","If there was a no star rating I would use it here.  I HAD purchased three cars in a row from them.  A 2007 Nissan Altima, a 2011 Nissan Frontier then a 2013 Nissan Altima.  The sales group is good and for the most part I always had good experiences with the Service Advisers.  Actually even though I will never go there again and never buy another Nissan, the Service Adviser was always honest and good at his job.
So over a period of 12-14 months as I was paying thousands of dollars for recommended maintenance on my 2013 Altima, I mentioned two or three times I thought the transmission was slipping and not working correctly.  I mentioned this again at about 100k miles before the warranty went out.  They kept saying the transmission checked out on the machine.  Then 4 thousand miles after the transmission warranty went out the problems got worse.  I brought it in again and told them about the transmission problems.  I also expressed that if the transmission is bad, they needed to take care of it as I had told them on previous visits it was messed up.  The service adviser stated, he was sure Nissan and the dealership would ""work something out"".  It should be noted I put a lot of miles on a vehicle.  The 4k miles over the warranty was about 2-3 weeks for me and about 5 months from 95k miles (pre warranty please check my transmission again) and when it had its final visit 124k miles.  So they finally agreed with me AFTER the warranty was up that the transmission was bad and needed to be replaced (4 thousand miles after the warranty was up).  They were going to submit the stuff to Nissan and include my previous visits where I believed the Transmission was going out.  I was told they believed Nissan would work with me.  After several days I got the news.  Nissan would cover all but about 1500 dollars.  At this time based on the fact that I had purchased three cars there and spent thousands in the service department over the years, that the dealership would surely pick up the 1500 left over to keep a good customer happy.  But NO the dealership was not willing to spend a penny, even though they were the ones who did not find the problem that I told them was there (and was confirmed to be there).  I was told by my service adviser that in the meeting after getting approval from Nissan to cover all but 1500 of a 3800 dollar service, he brought up the fact I had bought three cars there in 7 years and spent thousands in the service department.  The dealership still decided they would not cover the 1500 left.
So I went and picked up my car and traded it in the same day.  It is unfortunate that they not only lost a customer for them, but a whole family that will never buy another Nissan. ",1.8

There were several times that he would allow me to stand silently and contemplate for long periods of time.  He didn't push me by throwing more statistics at me.  And he never walked away.  He stayed with me and listened in case I had a question.  This kind of sales experience is rare and noteworthy.
I also especially liked the way that he solved my desire for leather when I finally decided to purchase the Juke.  It had cloth interior and I really wanted leather.  Wow!!  Now I have an amazing car with exactly the right color, interior, features, and price.

It wasn't going to be easy given limits on the amount of $$ I could put down, current credit situation and negative equity on the car. After a couple failed attempts @ 3 other car dealerships, I resigned myself to the fact that I would be stuck in with this car for the foreseeable future. My friend recommended I go see William Forrest @ Nissan of McKinney. She gave him my # and he called me, took some information and asked me to come in and see him @ the dealership. I went to meet with him and went in with very low expectations for positive outcome. After a few hours @ the dealership, I drove home with a barely used (less than 3k miles) 2015 Nissan Altima. WOW! Not only was my experience a pleasant one, but William was attentive and a pleasure to work with. He listened to all my concerns, was very personable and truly made me feel like he cared about my experience/ my needs/ concerns and not just about the sale. Although it was a few hours @ the dealership, I didn't leave feeling like I had been taken advantage of. And the icing on the cake was the Finance Manager Vernon Downes, who, not only was able to get my monthly payment lowered, but was able to get an excellent warranty package included in that reduced payment. WIN-WIN. Both William and Vernon were professional and certainly made my business with them feel valued.

With a little over 38000 miles. After two months I heard louder sound coming from the vehicle. I called service at Nissan, because I purchased a warranty, they told me to bring it in. I could make it to the dealership that week and planned on taking it in the following week. 
I went to work and as I was about to leave the car would not start. I had just worked a long 12 hour shift; it was late  and I wanted to get home. I called Nissan that night and was told by their used sale manager to bring the vehicle in. They provided me with Nissan Towing but they could not help me. I was told I would have to pay for the tow. Then Nissan give me Ford's towing number. They could not help me. So there I was stuck late at night with no way of getting home. I finally got a jump from someone. This same problem occured the next morning, that night and the morning after. I missed two days of work with out pay. It turned out that the battery did not have wanted, and that is suppose to last for a year. I was livid. My kids missed school, I missed work, and I had no way of getting around. Although I had warranty neither Nissan or Ford could help me. The manager Max Mehmet Arabaci basically told me there is nothing he could do. 
 I asked if they could somehow work with me to get another vehicle because this Ford just left a bad taste in my mouth. I wanted something else even if it was slightly higher in price. Max Mehmet Arabaci had the nurve to ask me for more miney down on another car. Max said there was nothing Nissan could do for me. He is a disgrace to that company. I have to pay over $100 for battery. There are also other issues with the vehicle. So much for warranty. They told me everything was checked check out but the battery had no water.

165,"January 29, 2014","Bought a 2009 Ford Focus on Jan 1 and on Jan 23 it broke down a day before a FINAL contract was delivered to a new finance company.
My son's dad co-signed for a used 2009 car. They walked out with a contract and the Ford Focus. Nine days later a finance person from Nissan of McKinney called and said they had a better deal, so, come sign a new contract. So dad did, but the finance person had to mail the contract to my son. My son then mailed it back to Nissan on Jan 17. On Jan 23 the car broke down and it had to get towed to the nearest dealer. 
We informed Nissan of McKinney on Jan 23 via email, phone, and we personally went there. They agreed to pay. The certified Ford mechanic with 27 years of experience (where the car was towed) stated that the problem of the wear and tear of the car was severe, and it would cost nearly $2K. Everyone at Nissan of McKinney that we spoke to (I have a call log) tried to blame it on my son by saying he had no experience. They also said the other dealer misdiagnosed the problem (I have an email) to that effect. 
Mr. Kelley, GM of Nissan of McKinney spoke to the other GM and Service Manager on Jan 28 and told them he was not paying for any further repairs. The car was driven less than 900 miles and they want to blame it on my son. The service manager at Ford said there is severe wear and tear on the Ford Focus.  It is a miracle my son did not get hurt or killed by this lemon.
Nissan of McKinney technically still owned the vehicle on Jan 23 when the car broke down because they kept switching contracts and finance companies (which we did not agree to the new finance company (We found out it was changed to Capital One  on Jan 27). The contract shows two finance companies and two loan numbers. They fast-tracked the deal to Capital One on Jan 24 after they knew the car was in the shop needing repairs.
I supposed they thought the car would not break down within 30 days of the initial sale and one day before the contract was sent to Capital One.

I was told they would order me another one and it would be there in 5 days. 2 1/2 weeks later, I called to see if it was there yet. Dealer told me they didn't have to order one and could use the key I returned to them. So, I went up there and waited for an hour for them to get me the new key. Come to find out, they told me they had to order a new key!!!!!!! Needless to say, I was very unhappy and left the dealership. I called back to tell them to mail me the key when it got there and I would have it programmed somewhere else. Terrible customer service and obviously no one knows what they are talking about. ",1.2
168,"September 19, 2013","I have never been more harassed and turned off by a dealership than this one. I was simply interested in buying an used Nissan vehicle, but the customer service quickly turned me away. For being a Nissan dealership, I found it ironic that they only had ONE used car available for sale and purchasing a new vehicle at this location would have really make my wallet cry. I believe I collected at minimum 5 business cards within the 15 - 20 minutes I spent there, of which none of those 5 representatives followed up with a phone call after I left. However, I did receive 10 voicemails and who knows how many missed phone calls within the past 2 weeks all from a gentleman I never spoke in person named Jim Adams. Jim said he just wanted to 'touch base' with me and to call him back-- as each voicemail became more and more short, less friendly, and almost demanding that I call back now. So, I called this dealership back to remove my number and 20 minutes later, guess who called?! -- Oh Jim, you really shouldn't lie to customers saying ""you are having a really hard time understanding me over the phone because there is a muffle or some static noise in the background"" ... This was said of course after I had broke the news to him that I had already requested for them to stop calling me. I would have to say Jim that you failed on your customer service duties and left me speechless after that phone conversation. Besides Jim, I was extremely offended when I filled out a form to see if I would be financially approved due to the fact that the guy basically said straight up to my face that I can't afford the car I wanted and that I should really start looking at a cheaper car ""at least half the price of the used vehicle I'm wanting now"". Thank you for your brutal honesty, but you don't know me or what I can and can't afford. At that point, I wasn't even interested in submitting my application anymore to ugly ruthless people who would seriously say that to a customer. As far as your 'Top 10 reasons to purchase at Nissan of Mckinney', I would have to say numbers 1,3,4,6, and 10 are all lies; numbers 5,7,8 and 9 can be found at almost every high-end dealership so no need for explanation. It's disappointing that such beautiful vehicles are placed in the hands of sale representatives like Jim Adams. Best of luck.",1.0

173,"April 15, 2013","Found a 2011 pre-owned certified Pathfinder on their internet site. Pricing was OK so I did not haggle on the price. The overall buying experience was pretty good until after the purchase had been concluded. I live in Washington State and the vehicle was purchased for my 22 year old son about to graduate from college in New Mexico. All sales discussions were over the phone. When my son flew into the Dallas Ft. Worth area Chris Hughes was kind enough to pick my son up from Love Field and drive him to the dealership. Upon inspection of the vehicle my son found the passenger side floor mat and the owners manual to be missing. Chris searched the dealership but could not find the missing floor mat. No additional attempts at replacing the missing floor mat were made and my son was sent on his way back to Las Cruces NM. On his way back he noticed an ever increasing smell of cigarette smoke in the cabin. By the time he travelled the nearly 700 miles back to New Mexico the stench of the cigarette smell was almost unbearable. The next day my son went over the vehicle with a fine tooth comb and found that both the cabin air filter and the engine air filter were both completely filthy and virtually useless. My son immediately replaced both filters and looked into ways of alleviating the cigarette odor in the vehicle. I contacted Nissan Corporate and was advised that both the cabin filter and the engine air filter were not part of the pre-owned certification process and that, as well as the missing floor mat and the cigarette odor should have been addressed by McKinney Nissan. I was told that they considered this a customer service/satisfaction issue and that these problems should be handled by the dealership. I contacted the dealership via email (with photos of the dirty air filters) and my concerns about the cigarette odor and received nothing in the way of a response. They returned all my phone calls and emails while negotiating the sale but are completely silent in regards to my current inquiry and concerns. I feel that their silence is a measure of the level of customer service this dealership will provide anyone purchasing a used vehicle from them even a certified pre-owned one. Let the buyer beware is certainly someone thinking of purchasing a used vehicle from this dealership should be cognizant of. Especially if the vehicle is to be purchased from their internet sales department where kicking the tires is not something one can readily do especially if one is an out of state customer. Overall I am sorely disappointed with this dealership and would not recommend them to anyone. I have purchased numerous vehicles from various dealerships and would rank this buying experience as my absolute worst. ",2.8

But one of the reasons I came to the Used Cars of McKinney Dealership is because we have a Nissan Quest and we love the service department.  Brad Reed and the entire crew over there have consistently taken great care of us, and many times have gone above and beyond the call of duty.  

When we went to the preowned section to get us a newer used car, they were so-o-o accomodating...  Chris Nix showed us around, a bunch of cars, were incredibly patient as we changed our minds a million times and were completely unclear about what we really needed...  

Adam came out of his glass room and visited with us... We never, ever felt like we were getting the &quot;hard&quot; sell, and every car that they presented seemed like a great value...  Also, Raul in financing was super nice, and took great care of us...  He made the financing part easy, and again, accomodated our desires to spend as little as possible, and understood our &quot;big picture&quot; ideas to financing.

178,"December 17, 2012","I'm so frustrated with Nissan of McKinney. We tried for about a month to buy a (used) car there and it was a horrible experience. Sales people not returning phone calls, being put on indefinite hold when calling the main number, etc. At one point they tried to sell us a car that had some sort of mold problem and smelled HORRIBLE. They tried and tried to sell it to us and insisted the smell would go away. We refused and a week later when we went back they admitted that it still smelled terrible.

Obviously we should have stayed away. Unfortunately, they had the exact car we were looking for (for our business) at a good price and we needed to get it done. So we finally just walked in one day and forced them to sell it to us. 

That's where things went from bad service to, I think, fraudulent. We took a finance letter from our bank to the dealer with us. The finance manager tried to have us sign some blank documents, but we insisted that they fill them out and include our bank name. He did, we signed and drove away. Then a week later we get a call from another bank telling us they had our auto loan. When I called the dealer (after being put on indefinite hold twice, the third time insisting they find me a live person right away) the guy was belligerent, told me that they could finance with whoever they wanted, etc. When I told him my contact specifically named my bank, he didn't believe me and told me to come in and show him the paperwork. Unbelievable. Finally, he told me he would have to do some research and would call me back in 20 minutes. Would anyone like to guess if I got that call back? Ha ha.

Go to Nissan of McKinney at your own risk. If you can fight through the horrible service, they can't be trusted to honor a signed contract.",1.6
179,"December 10, 2012","The absolute WORST dealership I've ever set foot into. I drove from Houston to see a car that was posted online. When I called Chris concerning this vehicle, I asked him to email me pictures of any defects (interior and exterior) and he sent pictures, but conveniently decided not to send the pictures of the DEFECTS. Instead, Chris Hughes sent ""pristine"" pictures of the vehicle and recommendeded it highly. When I got there I found that the 2007 Ford Explorer Eddie Bauer that I thought I'd be buying was actually a COMPLETE disaster.  The front and rear bumpers were scratched and cracked. The interior was leather, but was mistreated and was scratched/holey/etc. The driver's side back door wouldn't let him out after our test drive and he kept reassuring me it was just the child safety lock (NOT the case...and was proven with no apolgoies or explanations from his end concerning his lie). The radio wouldn't work AT all. The back hatch was missing a clip and the interior of the hatch was banging the whole time during our test drive, but he claimed it wasn't doing that when he drove it.

Basically, he was a liar and manipulator and his boss was even worse. He came out (disheveled and unprofessional looking) and asked what the issue was. I told him flat out I was disturbed by the treatment I received from Chris Hughes concerning this vehicle and he looked at me and said ""Well, we aren't going to fix anything on this car for the price it's at."" and walked away. That was my cue to leave, and I told them this review would be posted. They didn't care one bit. 

Take a look at other ""bait and switch"" reviews that have been posted, and you'll see that I'm not the first or last to comment on their tactics.

Attitude goes a LONG way, and this dealership has one of the worst.

I had a brand a used car which I bought from them that died after a year. It only had one owner previously and they swore it was fine. I later discovered that it had major issues and I had to pay $7000.00 to fix it. They refused to help with the cost to fix it, but offered to sell me a new one and add the old payments to this one. I was in a tough situation, and I gave in, I started taking it regularly for servicing, it started having major issues not too long ago and they said it was an engine problem, even though it was new, I paid $1000.00, to pay for it to be fixed, afew months later, they tell me that my engine needs to be replaced, and that it will cost $9000.00 dollars and the corporate office might help. They gave me a no to call, I did but the gave me a run around. I wrote to the ceo in an email and he didn't respond, instead, he asked the servicer I was working with at the time, Jordan to communicate with me. He told me that Nissan was willing to pay half, if I came up with the other half and they would put in a new engine. In the mean time, I haven't had a car for months.I even have this in an email. Half $9000.00 is still a lot, but I came up with the money. I started making payments, and when I was almost complete, my initial servicer, Jordan had quit and the one who took over, Brad told me that there is no such thing, they would put in a used engine on my vehicle for the half that I had come up with. I was extremely frustrated and I requested for a refund of the payments I had made thus far. They only refunded part of the money in my account and the other part of it that they are saying they refunded hasn't shown up yet, it's been four days. When I called to find out what happened to the rest of it, Brad said, oops we didn't refund the all of it, i'll go ahead and ask the cashier to do so.

So, we received rude voice messages even though we gave them our finance company's phone number after calling them ourselves and being reassured the check had been sent.

Sean was able to pull a list of the cars available and created a line up of cars for the price range we were looking to stay within. Sean’s co-worker Chris kindly greeted us at the door and even though we told him we were here to look and not buy, he treated us as if we were about to buy the whole lot. He was never pushy and took the time and patience to show us a plethora of cars. We finally found a 2012 Nissan Versa that my wife loved and the fuel economy was great. They were able to put us in the car that day with a low interest payment that we could afford, even with our strained finances.

I am personally displeased with the way things went in Nissan of mckinney. The Sales man above is only interested in Quick sales and even though I came into the shop with a list of cars he quickly discredited them and pushed me to buy a Buick Le sabre 2005 with few miles. The car had Just Got into the yard. he is very pushy and more interested in Sales only. This salesman ignored all emails and phone calls after the sale was made. Ge only communicated when he discovered that the car was not road worthy and could not pass state inspection. He had promised to send me list of repairs being done.

As it were the car never even passed the state inspection and would not be sold to me. He told me that there just being honest and would have sold me a damaged car. I am convinced that if that car  passed the state inspection it would have been sold to me anyhow without the repairs that had been agrred.Texas legislation does not allow for cars to be sold WITHOUT PASSING STATE TESTS.  Thank God for the protection from getting a car that would have been very bad to me.

He was nice and pleasant to deal with.  One of the items I don't like about this car dealer is not having any prices on each car.  That means you always have to go into the dealership office to get a price. Once inside I was introduced to a ""sales manager"" and he's response to my question of what were the prices being asked on the two 2009 Nissan Maximas was ""What is the maximum price you are willing to pay.  I have to know that number before I can help you.""  All they seem to be able to deal with is either the amount of monthly payment you are looking to have or the maximum amount you have to spend.  There does not seem to be any room in their business model for a customer that is smart enough to determine if a car is outside of their price range by themselves. 

When I explained I was just shopping and price comparing and only needing to know what was their ”out the door price” on the two cars I was interested in the ""sales manager's"" attitude turned rude.  He just kept repeating he could not help me if I would not tell him the total amount I wished to spend on a vehicle.  Again, I explained I was looking for prices so that I could do some price comparison and research.  Finally I was giving a total price but not told what items made up the price.  They seem to want to add on a large amount to cover the cost of ""certifying"" the car.

When I asked for some details on the numbers given me, I was told by the ""sales manager"" that he could not help me anymore.   So, I walked out of the dealer’s office.  Danny, the salesman, followed me out hoping to salvage a deal.  I shared with him I understood the game being played by the ""sales manager"" and would not be drawn into playing the game so that I could be overcharged for a car.
During the entire process the salesman, Danny, was nice but the ""sales manager"" type was very pushy and rude the entire process.

I have been contacted several times via email and phone calls from Nissan of McKinney asking what it would take to earn my business but no one from the dealership has bother to contact to ask about my bad experience.  If they wish to ""earn"" my business it requires having the issues I experienced addressed.
 
I would be happy to work with Danny again, no issue with the way he dealt with me.  The issues are/were with those above him.

What I am upset about is the quality of service I got.
After paying them $180/- for 37500 miles service they were supposed to top up all the fluids. I had specifically asked for the same. The coolant was very low when I got back home. I had to purchase the same and fill it up myself. 
When I sent an email to Vernon his response was sorry.
There was a small coolant leakage which was pointed out when the vehicle was given for service. The report they gave me pointed out the RPL sensor and the hose needs replacement and it will cost me fortune. I did not get it done. Came home and searched on the internet, found that the parts are only a fraction of cost. It also showed me how to fix it as there are only three screws holding the sensor in place.
I took the tools and looked at the screws, one of them was loose. I tighten it and the leakage stopped.
I am very disappointed that they do not even bother to see if some thing is loose and fix it. They either want to make money or do not want to do any thing.
They also gave me a detailed report on my vehicle condition and I am having hard time believing that report as for sure I know that my viper blades are worn out but report says they are good.
I believe they never even looked at it. ",3.6

220,"March 19, 2011","Short version: Nissan of McKinney went out of its way to reaffirm why everyone hates buying a used car. 

Long version: I had visited Nissan of McKinney in the past to test drive pre-owned Rogues. Didn't find what I wanted but kept an eye on their web site. Finally saw the perfect car: right model, right miles, right price. It was advertised at $15,947. There was even a little button that said: Get the ePrice now. Went in with wife and kids in tow to find the dealership had sent out 75,000 mailers offering a chance to win a free car. The place was packed. No big deal because I had already worked with a salesman. He grabbed the key to the car and my wife and I took it for a drive. So far, so good. I was ready to write a check on the spot. Turns out the advertised price ISN'T the price. My sales guy (who seemed like a nice guy--I don't blame hime) did the obligatory &quot;Let me ask my manager&quot; when I quoted the price I had seen on the internet. He actually seemed fine with it and even wrote it down on a piece of paper for me to sign. He came back and told me that simply wasn't possible but that they had other cars that they could sell me for that amount. Say it with me: &quot;Bait and switch.&quot; Turns out the price was actually $19,999. That's a pretty big difference. When I showed the salesman the advertised price on the internet he grabbed the manager. The sales manager came out (after about 20 minutes) and explained that the price online is where they start, it's not really the price. He explained they then add a &quot;reconditioning&quot; and &quot;certification&quot; fee. Apparently that's $4,000. He even wanted to show me the fine print online. I'm sure they expected me to bargain from that price, but I walked out  after having spent two hours waiting while playing the &quot;Let me ask my manager&quot; game. (The 100 people walking in trying to win a free car didn't make the experience any more fun.) The conclusion: I will make sure to tell everyone I know to avoid this nasty place. And I will be calling the Texas AG on Monday.",1.0

225,"February 28, 2011","I was in the market for a new Rogue and went to Nissan of McKinney but their sales practices are very deceptive and pushy. The first thing that bothered me is all the add on items that they supposedly include with all their cars. Namely some paint protection package, interior protection package, tints, pin striping (which wasn't on the car) and nitrogen filled tires. All these additions added around 2k or more to the MSRP. I immediately mentioned that I did not want any of these items and the salesman dismissed me saying they come standard and I pretty much have no choice in the matter. These are simply price inflating items so that they can negotiate down from them. The pinstriping they mentioned wasn't even done on the car and the tints didn't even line up properly. 

When it came time to negotiate the price, the first thing he did was ask us to fill out a finance application. I refused stating that I didn't even know how much they're selling the car for, so I didn't want them to run my credit. He tried to push it again and finally gave up after I refused a third time. 

The negotiation process was not pleasant at all. His initial offer was $1000 more than MSRP. I had been shopping around to other dealers and received offers of invoice price on the exact model and features we were looking at. I told him this but he just ignored it stating that they can't sell at invoice because they wouldn't make any money. He then wrote down my asking price and had me initial it stating that if they honored it, I would take the vehicle today. He took that to his sales manager. 

After a few minutes, he returned with a filled out sheet with their counter offer of MSRP with some set money down (even though we said we weren't putting anything down) and a very high interest rate of 14% (even though we stated we were doing the 0% APR incentive). After some more back and forth with him not coming down from MSRP, we decided to leave and the manager of course comes over and stops us. Now the manager tries to talk to us to see how he can get our business. 

Let me say that the sales manager was far worse than the salesman. He was rude and very unprofessional, acting very arrogant and condescending. He asked me where I got my offer amount from. After mentioning it was the invoice price I got from Edmunds, he told me he would show me the invoice. This is where I believe there was some shady business going on. He brings over an invoice sheet but the numbers add up to more than what I was quoted at another dealer. 

Luckily, that other dealer had sent me their invoice numbers as well on the same exact model and options. This number was the same as the ones I found on Edmunds so I believe them to be the actual invoice numbers. Nissan of McKinney's base numbers were $1000 over what the other dealer quoted. The manager had no explanation but was willing to let us buy it for $500 less than what they quoted, still $500 more than I was quoted elsewhere. 

After refusing that deal, he kept pushing, even trying to convince us that $500 wasn't a lot of money at all and that I would be wasting another 3 hours going to those other dealerships and they would maybe go $100 lower. 

Needless to say at this point we didn't even want to deal with them anymore even if they took our offer of invoice. We left and at the next dealer we went to they took our offer of invoice immediately with no hassles or pushing any useless ""extras"". 

I would not recommend going to Nissan of McKinney but instead go to one of the other numerous DFW Nissan dealers. If you do have to go there, do not let them add on any protection packages or $400 tints and $400 pin striping. Be prepared to be treated rudely if you do not immediately accept their offer of MSRP.

Bought a brand new Nissan Altima back in august. Let me just put it this way. Before you pay, you are the king, they are friendly and trying to please you as much as they can. BUT, After you purchased the car, their attitudes turn 180! While buying the Altima, we test drive one and really liked it. But we wanted a black interior instead of the gray one we test drove. They said they will find one, it will be exactly the same but the interior. They led us to a resting area while they process all the paperwork. They found the car, we completed the purchase. However, that car had about 400 miles on it. They told us that it was an auto trade from another location and it is a brand new car. So we believed them. After a couple days, we found a service record under the passenger seat. With records of cleaning and purchase in May. We went and they were rude to us, telling us that we agreed to purchase the car with the mileage on it and that is it. The whole experience was horrible and they were very rude on the whole situation. They were telling us that we had to leave because we didnt know what we were talking about. The only reason we purchased the car was because that they told us, these mileage were from autotrade and test drives. Now that we found out that it is not this way, somebody already had the car for a while (400 miles is a lot for test drive). The reason they gave us was that they couldnt pass the finances test, that why the car was returned. WHY DIDNT THEY TELL US THE FIRST PLACE? WHY DID THEY TELL US IT WAS FROM AUTO TRADE?

Also, when we are purchasing, the saleman tried to sell us A LOT OF stuff. When we told them clearly that we didnt want any extra stuff. They tried to ""brain wash"" us and convincing us to add on extra stuff when we were not interested at all!

The general manager Chris Godwin was the one dealing with us, he was not a nice person. 

It has been half a year, the car runs great, but I wouldve picked a different dealership if i had known about the horrible ""after purchase"" service they provide.

The only good thing at this dealership is that they wash your car (just basic cleaning) for free.",1.8

The service was exemplary, far beyond professional.The entire staff were deeply involved in listening and catering to the needs of me and my granddaughter.. 

I brought my granddaughter in to purchase a car, she had a very poor and negative experience at another dealership, but this dealership helped her quickly recover by offering her a ""red carpet"" experience!

She was granted the opportunity to choose cars within her budget and the size, color and style preferred.. She was also allowed to drive her first choice home, when she returned the car the following day, Mack, one of the salesmen had the ""out the door"" figures calculated and printed for both choices. After deciding upon the second choice, which was more within her budget, she was encouraged to ""test drive"" it also.

We were given a tour around the entire facility, along with a review of the function and sevices provided and introduced to the staff in each section. This was truly an outstanding experience for me and my granddaughter, who was simply facinated by the entire encounter and attention received.

I walked in and told him exactly what I wanted in the vehicle, and how much I wanted to pay.  He showed me to the car I wanted, without trying to upsell me or change my mind.  We went for a test drive and within an hour, I was signing the paperwork on my brand new Nissan.  Even after the sale, Gene was always available and truly went above and beyond.  At dealerships I dealt with in the past, once the salesman got his commission, that was the last you heard from him.  That was not the case with Gene.  He called me a few days after I bought my car, just to make sure everything was working and I knew how to work everything. As long as I buy Nissans and Gene is there, he will be his customer!",5.0

I was looking for a replacement for my gas hungry suburban and didn't have any intentions on buying a new car.  I had a used car that I had already picked out and was just looking before I finally made up my mind.  I am glad I did and glad I met Norris there.  I have been around the car business all my life and was expecting to be tried to talked into something that wasnt right for me and my family.  Norris made every effort to understand what we needed and found us a beautiful pathfinder with only 10K miles on it.  I didnt realize that I wouldn't have been satisfied with the noisy old Honda minivan that I had picked out.  The difference between driving the Pathfinder and the old minivan where totally obvious. The Pathfinder will keep my family much safer with driver, passenger and rear passenger airbags and all the changes to make my family secure as possible.  I think Norris was looking out for me and my family and wanted to make sure we where safe and happy with the choice in the long run.  I can't say enough good things about Norris.  He was low pressure and very knowledgable and led us to the right decision.  I also think the dealership as a whole is the most top notch dealership in Texas. And I have been to a lot of them.

257,"January 17, 2011","Simply the Best ~ is NOT just 3 words of motto for this business.  It is a daily commitment of journey, relationship, and achievement.  Excellence is the result of this commitment.  When I see the employee's of Nissan of McKinney in the community, they know my name and my family.  They care about and remember our conversations.  They are always ""giving"" to others.  They are always raising the bar of what it means to be the ""best"".  What they don't tell you is the word ""simply"" is a head-fake.  They make is look easy...but anyone knows that great effort and detailed planning is happening behind the scenes.

I have purchased 3 vehicles from Nissan of McKinney in the last 4 years. [O.K. technically 2...but I convinced my mother-in-law]  When she heard my stories of how this business was unique in caring for not only its customers; but the community; the kids in McKinney schools; and the needy...that was it.  She became a family member of Nissan of McKinney too.

As a high school choir director, I have many dealings with kids; parents; and other teachers.  I find myself telling someone every week it seems of some experience I've had at Nissan of McKinney.  From the free food...to the free coffee and hot chocolate...to the attention to every persons needs as seemly random people walk by.  I swear, at one point in the span of 3 minutes last time I was in for a carwash...I had 3 employee's walk by and ask if I was doing O.K?...or can I help you?...or do you need anything?  Each person seemed to ask the question differently.  If it was scripted...it didn't feel that way.  I excused my self to the men's room and looked in the mirror to make sure that I didn't look like the Elephant Man or something.  But, no, it wasn't me...it was just there way of ""being"" the best.  It isn't just words...it is caring enough to be...simply the best.",5.0
258,"January 14, 2011","About 2 years ago I visited Nissan of McKinney to get a quote on a new 2009 Nissan Altima.   I had previously visited other Nissan Dealers.  It was at the McKinney Dealership that I met Gene Price.  I was not yet ready to purchase a car, however I left the Dealership with a great purchase, Nissan Altima.  I live 21 miles from Gene Price’s Dealership.  I know that I can get my car serviced just a few miles from my home, however I found the McKinney Dealership provided everything I wanted from a company to proper care for my car.  Even though I drive very little, 14,000 miles in 2 years, I feel right at home at McKinney Dealership.  I admire the services & Community support they provide.  It is great to go into their waiting room and read all the letters from young people that have received scholarship support.  Gene has called me on occasions to come to events at their Dealership.  I have enjoyed the educational classes on my new car, hot dog & drinks evenings, and most of all their giving away automobiles.  And each time I go for scheduled service I always see Gene Price.  As a result I have added items to my car, because of his suggestions and the Dealership’s ability to do wonders with an automobile.  Where Gene Price was the reason I purchased at Nissan of McKinney, I have to say that the Dealership is not made up of individuals, or departments.  The reason I take my business to Nissan of McKinney is that they function as a team – they all work together to provide the best service to anyone that comes to their place of business.",5.0

 I had spoken with Jonathon Clayton before and was never pressured into purchasing or even buying , he is very courteous and holds a high sense of professionalism in his explanation of aiding you in finding the vehicle  you are purchasing. I was interested in a truck or SUV type of vehicle . I have owned Nissan's in the past , so I knew there quality and workmanship that they offered.  Not only did Jonathon give me the information I requested , but he went beyond the expectations in helping me get the New Altima I purchased this day .. Both himself and Josh where pleasant in the dealings of ""haggering"" price , but made it a pleasure to feel that you  are important enough to listen to when final dealings arrived at the table .

289,"December 29, 2010","*** Update - PJ had the repair made to the satellite radio without charge and took care of everything relating to that repair, including a loaner car while the car was getting fixed.  We really appreciate the extra effort to which he went on that.  As a nice bonus, our car was detailed to showroom perfection when we got it back.

Our original issue was a repair to the front seat (design flaw - metal bracket broke).  We fundamentally believe it's a safety issue that Corporate Nissan should address as a recall.  That said, we chose to have the repair done because a front seat that can move around while driving is a danger.  The price we paid is higher than we feel we should have to pay, so we're not thrilled with that, but at this point we had no choice.  The dealership did replace the bracket with a newer design that should not have the same problem.  When the car was returned to us, the satellite radio was not functioning.  After some back-and-forth, Nissan of McKinney has agreed to take care of that repair at no cost.

Long after the new has worn off of the new car (now 75K miles) the service experience is the largest contributing factor to long-term, overall satisfaction with the vehicle (read here likely to buy another Nissan).

The reason for the high rating is simple but significant:  They do what they say; when they say; for what they say!  They further give me options and ""warnings"" for upcoming, expensive maintenance which is a tremendous advantage to managing my vehicle maintenance budget.  A recent example was to advise me that tires would need to be replaced in the next few months but that within two weeks there would be a ""buy 3 get one free"" promotion coming that would make them the most competitive tire retailer.

Since I didn't need a lot of bells and whistles, but still wanted leather (I have a 3 year old) he found a base model that was still well equipped and added leather for me.  When my vehicle was done and throughout much of the process I also dealt with Mack.  Both Daniel and Mack were very attentive to my calls, as I had a lot of questions.  I'm sure I annoyed them, but they never were anything but pleasant!  They got me a great price and even found me an extra rebate because I was trading in a Chevy!  All in all this was a great experience and I will definitely do business with Nissan of McKinney when I buy my next Nissan!",5.0
307,"February 01, 2010","I wanted to take the time and talk about the service I received at Nissan.  I bought my Nissan from another dealership and I usually go there, but I was out in the McKinney area and decided to get serviced there.  I was provided excellent customer service from Vernon and because of the interaction with him, I will continue to bring my car there.  Thanks and keep up the good work.  We need more companies that provide customer service like this.

308,"January 19, 2010","I have purchased several cars from Nissan of McKinney and each and every time I buy a car they are nothing less than fantastic. When I am done with my paperwork there is always a lady or my sales person to sit in my car and go over the features with me again.  The service department is awesome too.... they always take good care of me.  I see lots of the same faces when I go in to buy or for service.... never at other places.... seeing the same people over makes me feel like Nissan of McKinney knows how to take care of their customers.

309,"January 15, 2010","So I came across a 2009 Nissan Maxima SV with 12K miles online at cars.com. The price seemed very low ($23963) so I checked Nissan of McKinney's website and found the same price. I called to inquire about the car and the salesman started telling me that the price in their system was $25900. On top of that, there was an $1895 fee for Nissan certification and $895 shop charge that werent included in the price. This brings the original $23900 to $28900. This is an obvious bait and switch tactic and I wouldnt ever trust this dealership to be honest. Matt kept trying to get me to come in and even offered to buy me a tank of gas to get me in. My guess is that he would try and pressure me beyond belief until I finally gave in. I would definitely steer clear of these guys.",1.3
310,"January 14, 2010",I purchased a new Maxima and am very pleased with the outcome.  The customer service was fabulous!  The car was delivered to me and every detail of the vehicle was reviewed.  The financing was also reviewed in detail and all of my questions were answered.  The staff went above and beyond to ensure I was satisfied.  I would recommend this dealership and would purchase another vehicle from them in the future.,5.0
311,"January 13, 2010","I bought an Altima from NO McKinney in 07 because a freind referred me and had such a great experience that I just bought a '10 Maxima.  Becasue I live in Houston I had to do everything over the phone and internet.  My experience with other dealers has been that if you are not at the dealership then you are treated as if you are not seriuos.  So, I went online and filled out a request for a Maxima and the equipment/colors I was interested in.  Within an hour I was contacted by Adam in the internet department and he confirmed the details of what I was looking for and told me he'd call me back.  Usually you don't hear back if you tell them you aren't looking to come out right away.  Adam called me back and let me know he had what I was looking for and offered to work some numbers.  The price and monthly payment came out to exactly what I was hoping for and I asked Adam to send me some pictures.  Daniel, his partner in internet, later sent me the pics and asked if I needed any further details and if the vehicle was what I was looking for.  I told him that it was and after agreeing on terms they agreed to deliver my Maxima to me in Houston so that I wouldn't have to drive up to Dallas.

The next day Roy, a salesperson delivered my shiny new gray Maxima to my office with paperwork in hand.  Everything on the paperwork was exlactly what was agreed to with no hidden surprises.  I thought the overall experience was fantastic and I can't say enough good things about the entire process.  This experience was much better than I've had with other dealerships in the Houston area.  I definitely reccommend this dealership to anyone looking to buy a new Nissan, or a used vehicle!",5.0
312,"December 10, 2009","Ok, I'm back!!!  I am happy to report that my issues with this dealer have been resolved.  Chris Godwin (Owner) took the time to listen to my concerns and he came up with a way that he could make things right with me. Tonight I went to the Nissan of McKinney New Owners Dinner and was pleasantly surprised at the abundance of ""giving"" that took place.  They had a steak dinner catered in and gave away tons of door prizes... nobody walked away empty handed.  I learned that Nissan of McKinney gives away a FREE car to a needy family every Friday.  Being a single mother, I still remember what a blessing it was to receive such a gift myself from an anonymous couple at my church; but who would believe that a car dealership would have that same spirit of helping the community.  We live in a world that breeds selfishness... I wish more people would realize that, success happens when people invest in others. THANK YOU Nissan of McKinney!",4.3
313,"December 01, 2009",Great experience! Matt Scarlett was very informative and did a wonderful job helping us find the perfect car for our family!

315,"October 28, 2009","Total ripoff.  Price advertised is NOT the price they sell the vehicle for.  Plan on paying an extra $1500 over advertised price.  This is supposedly for value-added services, like cleaning the car, the scam of nitrogen in the tires and maybe replacing worn items.  You know, the thing other dealers would include in their advertised price  Only a moron would fall for their scam.  I cannot believe they are still in business and actually sell cars.  Other dealers do not do this ""value-added"" markup scam.  Only a classless organization would pull this crap.

I highly recommend staying away from this company and buying from someone else.  I did and do not regret it at all.",1.4
316,"October 17, 2009","I spoke too soon....On 9/30/09 I purchased a new vehicle at Nissan of McKinney.  As part of the deal, the dealer owed me an upgrade of leather interior.  I asked if the car would be detailed before I took delivery of it and Jonathan Clayton (Sales) stated that it would be fully detailed for delivery after the purchase was final and all papers were signed.  Yet, as I’m sitting inside the dealership for almost two hours, I arrive to the vehicle at which time it was noticeably not detailed or washed, as promised (Strike #1).  After I pointed this fact out, Jonathan Clayton (Sales) told me that Nissan of McKinney would give my vehicle a full detail after the leather installation.  I agreed and drove home in my new car (with 111 miles on it).  

On 10/3/09 I arrived back at Nissan of McKinney at 8:05 am to drop off my vehicle for the leather installation.  The vehicle had approximately 198+ miles on it.  

On 10/7/09 I returned back to Nissan of McKinney to pickup my vehicle with its new leather installation.  At this time, my car had 394 miles on it.  I protested this immediately and was never, ever given an adequate explanation of the disparage between the number of miles on my vehicle when I dropped it off at Nissan of McKinney for the leather installation and the now 394 miles on the vehicle after being in the possession of Nissan of McKinney.  The only explanation I was given was that Nissan of McKinney uses an offsite service company for their leather installations and that in order for vehicles to receive service, Nissan of McKinney has to drive vehicles to the offsite service company location and back.  Nissan of McKinney attempted to console me by saying that they would top off my gas tank on my next visit.  Gee, thanks!  I can buy my own gas, thank you!  Their offer of one tank of gas was largely disproportionate to the number of miles now on my vehicle.  After my continued expressions of displeasure, Nissan of McKinney gave their poor explanation of the almost 400 miles now on my new vehicle, I was then offered two full tank of gas on my first service visit.  Again, I can buy my own gas!  I would rather someone tell me who Nissan of McKinney gave possession of my vehicle to and how did my vehicle incur such high miles while it had been at Nissan of McKinney for 5 days.  I demand an explanation.  How does one buy a new vehicle with barely 100 miles on it and when left in the dealerships' possession racks up almost 400 miles in just a 5 days?  Then, the next morning I began to notice damage to my vehicle after the service installation of my leather.  First, I noticed a large mark and discoloration on the interior driver side door.  Also, I noticed many black smudges from dirty, greasy fingermarks on the newly installed light tan leather.  There was also, a Craftsman tool left in my vehicle from the leather installation.  My son found the tool in the back seat of the car, which was there by the company that installed the leather and that Nissan of McKinney Service Department would have found, if they had performed QA/QC on the work that they contract out for service by other companies Nissan of McKinney did not take responsibility for these huge service oversights and gaps in their quality of service.  My 2009 Nissan Versa was damaged while in the care of Nissan of McKinney service department.  Also, my vehicle did not receive a detail or courtesy wash even after Jonathan Clayton (Sales) was so insistent that it would be, after the leather was installed.

On 10/08/09 at approx. 11:30 am I placed a call into Nissan of McKinney Service Department to inform them of the damage to my vehicle interior and the mess the car was left in.  My first call, I left a message with the receptionist for Dan Irwin (Asst. Service Manager) to return my call.  I went most of the day without a return call from Nissan of McKinney or Dan Irwin, so I placed my second call in and asked to speak to Dan Irwin (Asst. Service Manager) again.  I received his voicemail and left him a message.  After my call was not returned, I called Nissan of McKinney again and asked for an available Service Manager.  I got his voicemail again so I transferred out to the receptionist.  I then asked to speak to another manager in the service department.  I was then transferred to P.J. Neher (Service Director) who did take my call and asked that I return to the dealership so that they could see the damage.  I arrived at the dealership between 7:30-8:00 pm.  P.J. (Service Director) and Dan Irwin (Asst. Service Manager) looked at the vehicle and asked that I schedule another service appointment and leave the vehicle with the dealership (again) to repair the damages.  The appointment was scheduled for Tuesday, Oct. 13, 2009 at 8:30 am.  Dan (Asst. Service Manager) asked for my work address and telephone number so that they would have the location information to pick up my vehicle and leave me a rental.

On 10/9/09 I placed 5 telephone calls in to Nissan of McKinney for Chris Godwin (Owner/Managing Partner), and Tracy Suggs (Customer Loyalty Manager), and Dan Irwin (Asst. Service Manager); it seems that everyone at Nissan of McKinney was in meetings from noon until approximately 3:00 pm.  The receptionist was polite and was aware that I had constantly been trying to reach someone for roughly three hours.  Finally, around 3:30 pm I called again for Chris Godwin (Owner/Managing Partner) at which time I was told that my messages for Chris Godwin (Owner/Managing Partner) were delivered but that he was still not available.  My call was then passed on to Tracy Suggs (Customer Loyalty Manager) who began to discuss with me my complaints as Dan Irwin (Asst. Service Manager) had magically appeared in her office at the exact time someone finally took my telephone call.  Tracy Suggs (Customer Loyalty Manager) immediately goes into this dissertation about how this was an oversight by Nissan of McKinney and that Nissan of McKinney would be putting measures in place within the Nissan of McKinney organization to prevent this type of ordeal from occurring to other customers.  Overall, Tracy Suggs’ (Customer Loyalty Manager) explanation for the entire ordeal I had experienced was in large part due to the fact that Nissan of McKinney may have used a new company to perform the services and that somehow Nissan of McKinney Service Department had not inspected the work or performed a thorough check themselves of the vehicle before returning it to me.  During what amounted to about a 20 minute telephone conversation, Nissan of McKinney only offered to make amends for their gross neglect and oversight, the inconvenience to a customer, and the loss of time with an offer to top off my gas or fill my gas tank up at my next visit.  What an insult!  At this blatant, discourteous behavior by Nissan of McKinney, Chris Godwin (Owner/Managing Partner) , and Tracy Suggs (Customer Loyalty Manager); I became very agitated .  Several moments during the conversation Tracy Suggs (Customer Loyalty Manager) became rude and aggressive. I ended the conversation abruptly and did not speak to anyone else from Nissan of McKinney on that day.  However, later that evening, and after my unpleasant altercation with Tracy Suggs (Customer Loyalty Manager), I received a voicemail and text message from Terry Gilliam (New Car Director). On his message, he stated that he had heard about the conversation between Tracy Suggs (Customer Loyalty Manager) and myself and he wanted to get this resolved.  

On 10/12/09 I returned Terry Gilliam’s (New Car Director) message.  We discussed the inconvenience to me (the customer) and how poorly Nissan of McKinney had handled the situation.  He confirmed my appointment for Tuesday, Oct. 13 and the conversation ended.

On 10/13/09 at approximately 8:45 am from my work telephone, I called Dan Irwin (Asst. Service Manager) to get an ETA on his pickup time since he was already 15 minutes late and I was needed in a meeting at 9:00 am.  This service appointment was set and confirmed on Thursday, Oct. 8, 2009 so I was confused and irritated by their tardiness.  At approximately 9:30 am (now one hour past my scheduled appointment time), I sent Terry Gilliam (New Car Director) a text message indicating that it was now 1 hour past the scheduled appointment time and no one from Nissan of McKinney had arrived to pickup my vehicle.  These continued mistakes made it very evident that Nissan of McKinney lacked real integrity and excellent customer service.  This diversion was a complete lack of respect of my time.  Terry Gilliam (New Car Director) said that Dan Irwin (Asst. Service Manager) had called me at work to confirm if the scheduled appointment time and location was still good. What? My position at work is very demanding of my time.  Nissan of McKinney chose the appointment date and time almost a week prior, so the fact that they didn’t keep the schedule disappointed me and interfered with my workload.  Nissan of McKinney’s Service Department operates in a dysfunctional manner.  This is very unprofessional.  At approximately 9:05 am on Oct. 13, 2009 Dan Irwin (Asst. Service Manager) left me a voicemail that was sending someone out to my location to pickup my car and to see if it was still a good time and location. Nissan of McKinney are BIG LIARS!!!!!!!!!!  At the same time Dan Irwin (Asst. Service Manager) and Terry Gilliam (New Car Director) were telling me that someone had already left, when in fact, no one had been sent out to pickup my car.  Eventually, Dan Irwin (Asst. Service Manager) arrived at my location 1 hour and 30 minutes late, at which time, I had to be paged and called out of an important business meeting. There was no small talk, no apologies, nothing; just a quick exchange of keys.  In my haste to return to my business meeting, I forgot to remove my toll tag from the vehicle.

On 10/15/09 Nissan of McKinney was scheduled to return (drop off) my vehicle at noon.  I received a telephone call from Terry Gilliam (New Car Director) at approx. 11:15 am to say that stating that someone was on their way to drop off my car to me at work.  Terry also stated that since it had been raining, my car would not be washed but if I brought it back to Nissan of McKinney on a better day that it would be detailed and washed, as I had been requesting since Sep. 30, 2009 (the purchase date).  Terry asked if this was ok with me and I stated that had I been given a choice I would like for the vehicle to be cleaned and washed.  He agreed and said that this would delay the delivery somewhat but that as soon as the car was ready, he would send someone out with it.  Geez!  Is it so hard to expect professionals to be professionals?  Am I really asking too much from a dealership?  The staff at Nissan of McKinney are not reliable, undependable, and do not go above and beyond for a customers.  I finally received my vehicle on Thursday, Oct. 15, 2009.  I hope I never have to go back or deal with Nissan of McKinney again.  

The ironic thing is, I love the vehicle!  My family, friends, and coworkers like the vehicle too.  This circle of people all knew that I had been in the process of buying a new vehicle and asked for updates all along the way.  Unfortunately, I could not recommend Nissan of McKinney to any of my family, friends, or coworkers due to experience that I endured with Nissan of McKinney.

My closest friend actually bought a 2009 Nissan Versa just like mine weeks after seeing and riding in mine.  This is just one example of how one bad experience can influence trends, patterns, and perception.  Until, Nissan of McKinney makes restitution to me for what I experienced at their lack of service, I will continue to tell others of this horrific experience.  Buy a Nissan, just don’t buy a Nissan from Nissan of McKinney.",1.8

318,"August 21, 2009","I went there to buy a new Altima. I knew exactly which one I wanted, but they add over $2k of extras to EVERY car, including ugly painted on pin-stripes, crappy tint, and a spoiler.  I was fine with the spoiler but my tint has bubbles and a small tare in it.  The pin-stripe isn't even straight and its painted on so you can't have them take it off.  Also they charge $75 for putting nitrogen in your tires, the biggest rip off ever.  There were also some marks on the side of the car that needed to be fixed that they said they would fix for free along with the tint.  We scheduled a time for them to come pick up my car to get it fixed, well that day has come and gone and I now can't get a hold of my sales person and the sales manager just puts me on hold for over 15min. A week after they said they would pick up my car I finally got them to reschedule a pick up a week later.  They were suppose to pick up the car at 8am, they never showed, so I called at about 12 and asked where they were but again I couldn't get a hold of Oliver.  The sales manager said he was getting the paper work together and he would be out to get my car after his meeting that after noon.  They also want me to come and get my car from them the next day because they wont be able to get it all done in one day, because they are picking it up late. They also still have my extra key because when I bought the car Oliver couldn't find the extra key, he said he would fedex it to me the next day but its been over 2 weeks and he still hasn't even sent it yet.  When asked about it he said I would have to come in to get a new key programed, when I told him I still haven't even received my first extra key he ""remembered"" and said he would send it asap.  I still don't have it.  This place sucks and I do not recommend Nissan of Mckinney to anyone, you will have the worst experience of your life after you buy your car.  ",1.2
319,"July 07, 2009","Nissan Of McKinney's General Sales manager(Jonny Cantrell) called me on Thursday  June 25th to offer me a deal for a rogue I have been looking at. On June 29th we went in there and accepted the deal. It was $500.00 down and my monthly payments would be $585.00 a month and my trade in value was $9,500.00 and interest rate at 13%. They told me I was approved and we signed contract but nothing financial yet. they gave me the keys to the car and they had my Lancer that I traded in. A week later July 6th they call my husband to tell him we found someone to finance you come in and sign the papers. We get there and they tell us o ...we found someone but you have to pay 4,000 down and even then your payments will be a lot higher then what we said. SO they blocked in the Rogue and told me if I left in it they would call the police and they would report it stolen. SO they give me back my lancer and the stereo I originally had in it( I have receipts and the sales person saw it in there) was stolen and REPLACED with a cheep crappy looking one. Mine had the dvd c/d player. SO I called the police and reported it stolen as the owner was pretty much o well this happens all the time. And he tells me that its not his problem because it was still in my name. When we called the dealership to let them know what kind of stereo it was they were like why do we need this ..are you not going to claim it on insurance?

It's their added features, however OFTEN the features aren't on the car.  There are other dealers that don't have these. Basically it jumps the MSRP another $1500 to $2000 so they have more room to negotiate and get over the original MSRP. What happend to us is we negotiated the hell out of them because of the addendum but they didn't have the color we wanted. They ordered one with none of the addendum options and kept the price the same and the kep the options. So I asked for a refund of the addendum items and they refused. They wouldn't even give us the addendum options that was on the vehicle we negotiated and drove. I would have loved to take these cheaters to court but I honestly don't have the time. I can take them for more money telling people how aweful they are.

Service has been equally horrible. They don't return calls, they order parts, they never call. Service people drop like fly's there. I have gone up their now 5 times for a gas door that just wont shut. 

I spoke to the owner and he basically says the addendum is fair and its the way they make more money because of low margins already.  That is BS because I have been to many other dealers in Mckinney who don't need them and make profits. ",1.6

The salesman lasted about 2 minutes with us on his own before a ""Manager"" swooped in to be friendly.  The ""Manager"" has mastered forked tongue speak but it was friendly.  He was friendly when he stated there was no rebate on the truck even though the Nissan website, Edmunds and Kelley listed one.  He was friendly when he quoted a ""smokin"" interest rate that was the best rate going.  I somehow don't think 7.2% for an 802 FICO score is exactly ""smokin"".  They were really friendly about the Dealer Installed Options.  I did not want Dealer Installed Options.  Is the paint so lousy that I must have over $1000 in paint protectorant?  Why do I have to pay for $100 in wheel locks that, if I wanted them, I could get at Pep Boys for $20?  $100 in tinting on windows that came from the factory already tinted?  I don't know how many times they would rush away to find some new discount to reduce the price on a new piece of folded paper.  After more than an hour of this nonsense I was far more interested in lunch than a new truck.  I went to lunch.A day or two later I get a call from Sean1 offering me new numbers.  They were incomplete and I ask for the complete number package.  Nothing tough just MSRP, my net, interest, duration, down payment and such.  He had to call me back.  He calls and does not have all of the numbers.  3 times he called and still was missing something.  Finally, he quit calling.A day or two later I get a call from Sean2.  They seem to hire a lot of Sean's and Shane's.  He has a ""smokin"" deal on a 2004 Titan that they are anxious to get off of the lot.  I told him I would consider a 2004 if the numbers were right and I asked for the same numbers as before.  It only took 2 times for him to come back with all of the numbers.  This ""smokin"" deal was almost exactly the same as a 2005.  I asked him why I would even consider a 2004 at the same price as a 2005 and it appeared they were not all that anxious to get that 2004 off of their lot.  I told him to go back to them and when they were really motivated to sell we could discuss it.  He never called back.A couple of days later we get a call from Kyle ( General Manager?).  We were out for the evening and he was insistent that our houseguest contact us and have us call him immediately.  She didn't and we didn't.  The following day I returned his call.  He was busy and would return my call.  I never heard from him and he never heard from us.All of this has a real kicker to it.  I qualify for the employee price on the vehicle.  I know what it is.  They know I qualify for this price.  But, we never got there.  It should have been an in and out deal.  For some reason they needed to jack up the price with nonsense.  For some reason they needed to jack up the interest rate.  They lost a sale and I got a great truck.",5.0
