1,"June 21, 2020","Baytown Ford and our salesman were very patient with us while we were shopping for our new truck.  When we came in, we were not very sure about which vehicle we wanted but they showed us several trucks in different ranges before we decided on the truck we liked and best fit our budget.  There was no pressure and we drove away satisfied with our deal on our new Ford.",5.0

8,"April 21, 2020","I've brought 5 cars from Baytown Ford in the past few years and have always had a awesome experience. From customer service to the staff and more. This time with the Cadillac it's a different story. Cadillac has had many issues since I've gotten it. 1st issues brakes were squealing the 3rd day, they would not repair or help. I had to pay out of pocket to get the brakes fixed. Now the air conditioning has went out still wont help going to cost me $1000 to get it fixed again I've had the car a month! No help at all... this is sad and to treat a repeat return customer like this is disgusting. not only have I brought 5 cars but my family has purchased 3-4 cars as well. We are done with Baytown ford from this point on. I guess they got their money out of us anyway already. ",1.0

12,"April 11, 2020","The managers here lie and do not commit to what they said. They put up a car at sale without photos. I was interested in it and when i looked at the car, there was a fender bender. I liked the rest of the car so , we decided that I ll buy if they replace the fender. Then when i was finally about to sign paperwork they said not replacement just going to fix it . And then another manager stepped in to say that you are only buying a used car . Take it or leave , it does not matter what salesman promised to you . Then they said that we will put this car on lot and sell it as it is , which is fine i don’t care . But there carfax says no damage and has no photos. I actually have text from the salesman promising to replace fender on a agreed price . Finally on integrity , I rate them zero . They will make you feel small if you are not buying  an “expensive car”. It is a sorry thing to see. In addition there is a foot long damage on the alloys of both the wheels in front . Please be aware everybody .On the top of all the lying , they said sign the paperwork for actually buying the car before we even lift a finger to fix the dent .  Additionally, I was told to my face that you have to trust us that we will fix the vehicle but we can not trust you to buy tomorrow even after I i signed the price document and was willing to do some kind of deposit amount. Eventually its not the price , but the egoistic and disrespectful behavior. You guys should Understand , a deal is less important than a customer who will spread good word about you . I hope you take this in the right spirit and work to improve",1.0

14,"March 31, 2020","Took days to get them to honor my warranty. The finance department ""messed up"" when they sent my warranty in. Don't think it was ever fixed. By the time they agreed to fix what was wrong with it, my warranty didn't cover it so they tried to charge me. I've been to low life dealerships, but Baytown ford takes the Cake as far as service goes. ",1.0
15,"March 27, 2020","After another Ford dealership and an independent shop told me I needed a brake job to which I declined. The other dealership actually told me I had rusty rotors. After explaining the noise and my frustration with incompetent shops Baytown Ford found a bad  front wheel bearing, bad iWE (hub actuator) and a bad vacuum check valve (4x4). With 41000 mile and 4 months left on factory power train warranty Ford covered the repairs. Thanks David and service dept!",4.4
16,"February 24, 2020","I went in for an oil change, and my experience was very pleasant.

Dawn was extremely knowledgeable, and courteous.   She assisted us with all the questions we had regarding other service needs.  On top of her wonderful service, she added a coupon that I wasn't aware of, so that saved me a little money.

I really want to commend her great customer service!

19,"January 21, 2020",Every experience I've had over the past two years bringing my F150 to the dealership for maintenance has been a positive one. This last one was the best so far; the service rep that took care of me was very detailed and thorough in explaining what maintenance was needed and why. He was very attentive and answered all my questions. I will definitely keep bringing my truck for all maintenance ,5.0

21,"January 14, 2020","My car was towed in when it wouldn't start at work.  I had to call service repeatedly several times to get anyone to check on status of my car.    They didn't even look at my car until it had been in their shop for 4 full days and it took a lot of nagging to get it looked at on day 4.  It was finally fixed on day 7, only needed a new starter.  They did not call me to let me know it was finished.  Very poor customer service in the service department.  I would never recommend this service department.",1.2

The financial manager, who's name I forgot (Sorry), was awesome also. He was very helpful & easy going, I respect the fact that he didn't try to sell me a bunch of unnecessary stuff, being a woman making a purchase on her own.

40,"September 17, 2019","When repairs are performed at Baytown Ford, I believe those repairs are done properly because of the confidence I have in the Service Department. I did not have that confidence in the previous dealership that I used, and knew I needed to change.",5.0

43,"July 26, 2019","I was on a road trip from Corpus Christi, TX to Orlando, FL and we had an issue with our Ford F-150. I did not buy my truck from Bay Town Ford. The service team's reaction to our situation was nothing other than brilliant. Not only did they tell us they were uncomfortable us driving 1200 miles without them checking out the truck, they moved our vehicle in front of the line, skipping several customers that probably purchased their vehicle from this dealership. 

I have never experienced service like this. We are in the market for a Ford Expedition and we will be making the drive from Corpus Christi, to Bay Town Ford to give them an opportunity to earn our business due to the outstanding service provided to us on this day.

I highly recommend this dealership and it should be used as a model to ALL branded dealerships, not just Ford.

Thank you Team Baytown Ford!",5.0
44,"June 01, 2019","I was working with Davis Simpson on a new Ford Edge.  They had several in stock in a myriad of colors/trim levels..  We test drove the vehicle while my trade was being evaluated.  I found the perfect Edge in the exterior color, interior color, trim level, and most importantly a great price.  My trade appraisal was completed very quickly and was a fair offer.

David and all of the staff I worked with were extremely knowledgeable, friendly, and listened to what I wanted.  They went the extra mile in working with the credit bureaus (problems in lifting a credit freeze).

I will definitely recommend to my friends, that they check with  David and Baytown Ford the next time they need a vehicle.

Make it to the dealership, to find out that the person I'd been speaking with (Matt), wasn't even there, after he'd texted me a couple hours prior, informing me he was. Then, find out that the car I'm coming for isn't even there! They loaned it out to someone having service down on their vehicle, the day prior. I was put under the impression, that I'd be signing papers and driving off the lot, as quickly as possible. After having us wait for over an hour, we were told that our payments would be much higher than previously quoted. It was a complete bait and switch. These people are completely unprofessional and I recommend them to no one. No one even introduced themselves to us. Customer service is obviously dead at this place. I was flat out lied to throughout the whole process. I wasted an entire day and a tank of gas on this, and time is money. BUYER BEWARE!

The level of disrespect for loyal customers amazes me and will definitely prevent me from ever doing any kind of business with this establishment ever again!!",1.0

91,"August 17, 2017",After visiting other local dealers Johnny Luna did a great job of giving his best price without haggling.  His price was several thousand under other dealers and the best part was he didn't change the price when I showed up.  I highly recommend Baytown Ford.,5.0
92,"August 02, 2017",I did a lot of research on the Ford Explorer and the average salle price . Our salesman Johnny Luna was honest and  we got it  for a two thousand below average price. Very smooth experience. Will use again in the future! ,5.0

97,"January 09, 2017","
I purchased a 2008 Ford Edge LTD from Baytown Ford dealership.  The vehicle was not inspected and I have not received my title or plates.  I have received 4 paper dealer plates since I first purchased the car, but no help with the inspection or mechanical issues.  I have called each month about the issue.  I have had serious issues with the vehicle since I began the purchase process.  I have had to take the vehicle in to a dealership here in Austin 4 times for major mechanical issues totaling more than $5000 dollars in damages.  The vehicle is now in the shop again.  The service department mechanics stated that the vehicle has more damage which totals more than $3000 and is not able to be driven for safety reasons.


When I spoke with Jim Lusson in pre-owned today between 5:19 pm and 5:30 pm, he initially answered the phone by saying, ""I know who you are.  You're the one that still hasn't got the car inspected.""  I asked him today (after several previous attempts over the past 6 months) why the car was not inspected before it was sold.  He stated that the vehicle was not inspected because there was no inspector on duty the day the car was sold. Jim said that ""The car must not have had issues that were that bad.  You made it to Austin.""  I again explained all the issues that I have had with the vehicle and the cost of all the repairs since I purchased the vehicle.  Jim stated that, ""We just sell the cars, we do not worry about repairing them after they're sold.""  He told me that if I could get the car to Baytown Ford's lot that they would be happy to inspect the vehicle and make sure it passed (as is).

98,"December 25, 2016",Had some stuff to do so I dropped my explorer off for a oil change. Came back a few hours later and it was done and they washed it. Thanks ,5.0
99,"October 08, 2016",First time buying a car  here but had an awesome experience. Everyone was really nice and willing to help. We had a great salesman  named Armando. Definitely reccomend.,5.0
100,"September 18, 2016",We bought 2016 f250 from Johnny Luna he was so nice the day we bought it we got home and found the raido/ GPS cluster wasn't working and since we bought at dusk we missed 2 small dents on the tailgate so called the next day Johnny said drop it off ( Oh and they took out floor mats out and forgot to put them back in had to call and ask and drive back up to get them) and they would get the dents out. When we got there ohnny pulled my husband aside and said just tell me what did you do I'll still fix it just be honest.   He accused him of denting it. So we drop it off next day to fix GPS and dents at7 am. Johnny calls at 9:30 am says it's done. We go to pick it up at 5 pm after work and the never looked at GPS so while we wait another 45 min we find out the module needs replaced. If they would have looked at it in the morning if they could have ordered it and had the part the next day but instead they had to order the part the next day fix it the following day and then we could pick it up the following day so two days after buying the truck we did not have the truck for an entire week Johnny said when we picked it back up for the inconvenience it would be detailed and a tank full of gas we got it back it was dirty and it was 76 miles left till empty. So we talked to the manager named Joel who told us to bring it up he would fully detail it and fill the gas tank so when I brought it up of course it was full only a quarter of a tank needs to be filled they filled it and the detail job was the worst thing I've ever seen I'm actually taking it back tomorrow to tell them that they need to train their people to detail there is a mud handprints and say and still all over the vehicle I would never recommend Johnny Luna as your salesman or Baytown Ford to anyone and all they kept asking during the whole sales experience was please give us a good survey please give us a good survey we have yet to do the survey but after I go there tomorrow the survey will be done and it will not be good! Do not go to baytown ford,1.4

103,"October 03, 2015","My clutch got stuck on my gt500 car that I rarely drive so I have extended warranty so of course I take it to the nearest Ford dealership baytown Ford says supposedly warranty didn't cover but my friend who works at Ford in Mission said it did.  to take it to him,  every time I take it to baytown ford it never gets covers always gets denied 4 times different problems at one point I went to get new replacement decals for my car ?? guess what baytown Ford says that is hard to get them wanting time month's lol I go Pasadena Ford they get them in less then a week. Back to my clutch story before getting denied in fixing my clutch the want to test drive it I say ok I go with him omg he didn't know how to drive it switch seats with me and I drive it lol later he tells me to leave it and he call ?? me with results ok I do 3 hours later he calls me that they took the car for another test drive and lets me know that the cat almost didn't make it am like what!  I took it driving I know is not 100% in a good shape but really and after another hour he calls me again saying I was denied by Ford to fix it and he then offers to give me a discount that i only have to pay 2,050 to get it fix lol by than am mad and call the dealership in Mission tx where I bought the car tell them what happens so they say don't worry we got u! now I have to .   take it to mission tx there  I have no problems there same warranty covers it really what are the odds worse place to buy or take ur car ?? for service",1.0
104,"August 03, 2015","I bought a truck from Johnny Luna which seemed to be a great salesman until we had issues with the truck.  Then he could not answer any of the questions or provide us with any help.  The service department was even worse.  They told us we could drop off our truck to get in line and they could maybe get to it on Monday.  I ended up going to a ford dealership near Fairmont parkway and they got our truck in the same day.  I would not recommend this dealership for sales or service.  Also beware of their maintenance agreements.  They told us we could get the oil changed at any dealership.  When I got my oil changed at a different location, they said I did not have a maintenance agreement.  When I called Baytown Ford, they then told me it was only for the Baytown Dealership.",1.2
105,"December 03, 2014","My wife dropped of her car on a Saturday. Was told the problem was a seal put on backwards on Monday . Two days later with car still in the shop,..my wife was informed that it's a pump that went out. I called and vented my frustration about the service not allowing a loaner car knowing that it's a warranty issue on a 2014 Ford Fusion. Danny told us that he would get back with us about a loaner car. A day later,..no call back from Danny about the loaner car or status on the vehicle. Worst experience ever!!!!!",1.0
