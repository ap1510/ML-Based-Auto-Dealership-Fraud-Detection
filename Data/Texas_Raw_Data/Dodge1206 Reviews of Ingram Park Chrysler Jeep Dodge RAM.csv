0,"February 09, 2020","Not impressed. Have purchased a new vehicle every 18 months since my first in 1978. Everything was unprofessional, and misstated. Then I lost 2,000 worth of CD‚Äôs in my trade in and 20 minutes later the salesman couldn‚Äôt find them. Financing was misstated as well. Total mess.",1.0
1,"January 28, 2020","Bought this new Jeep in early November 2019 and just now after 5 times at dealerships here it is the last of January 2020 and finally Discount tire has handled the problem with tires that had BELT PROBLEMS?  Had to take this vehicle across town to Ancira to get this resolved?  The service MANAGER at Ancira found the problem in ONE visit there?  This vehicle was found to have set on IPAC's lot for more than a year and in the severe heat last summer of which ruined these tires? Why am I upset??? A new vehicle with less than 1K miles when this all came about and they had the guts to make me pay $76.00 for the tires that had to be junked and replaced?  WHY should we be paying any such thing on a brand new vehicle?  To top it all:  I'm a retired Chrysler Employee (mechanic) myself and all they had to do on the 1st visit was to get the tires replaced!  
TAKE NOTE OF THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT: MR. Charles Kersch The service writer flat out busted his tail doing every thing he could to get this taken care of! BIG KUDOS TO CHARLES!  Why his superiors did not heed his input and just fix the very evident wheel/tire shake and have a happy customer is a big question.",2.2
2,"January 22, 2020","This dealership is terrible.they will first charge you a fee to inspect your vehicle, then continue to add to diagnostic fee. Brought my vehicle in for air ride repair, first the tech said it had a slow leak, but couldn‚Äôt find any leaks. Then goes to tell me that 2 fuses where blown. Only thing that seem to be wrong was the fuses and they wanted to charge me for the air also which it didn‚Äôt need. Please save yourself time and money. These people are crooks down to the service advisors. Mechanics are trash. ",1.0

4,"January 07, 2020","I had an emergency today and it was bad. A horrific blowout that left me afraid and confused. I contacted my dealership and Marco took charge. He verified my vehicle mileage ensuring that I was covered by Chrysler roadside service. A phone number was provided.  Marco also texted me the information as back-up. I waited only twelve minutes and help arrived. And just like that my son and I were removed from a very bad situation. Marco started providing customer service even before I arrived at IPAC. (How impressive). But once there, he took charge again. My needs were met; new tires mounted, oil change, and additional information was afforded concerning future maintenance. I felt alone and afraid on the roadside. Knowing that Marco took an interest in me over the phone proves service is his passion. I recommend you ask for him when having your vehicle serviced. My law degree has taught me how to analyze people and situations. Marco is exceptional, one of the good guys. Everyone needs a Marco in their corner. He understands that service is KING. Thank you, Marco, for taking care of me and helping me when no one else would. I will remain with IPAC because of you.",5.0
5,"December 24, 2019","They are not customer service oriented. My truck was in for repairs and complete on Monday but they failed to notify me. They didn't tell me their service department was closed on Christmas Eve. They chose to inconvenience me by not inconveniencing one of their employees to come in and give me my truck. They chose to leave me stranded over Christmas without a vehicle. A 'manager, "" Chris Nunes claimed to be in charge but didn't have anyone's phone number because he had only been there for 1 1/2 months. What kind of manager doesn't do his due diligence and make sure he has appropriate phone numbers in order to take care of the customer. He was very rude and disrespectful. I would exercise extreme caution before conducting business with IPAC.",1.0

It was great that Robert Sumpter recognized me as Chief Master Sergeant (Ret) US Air Force. I told him One Team, One Country, we all serve for our Nation the United States of America. üëçüëçüëçüëç",5.0

11,"July 22, 2019","2. Time ive been here looking for and car and it is most definitely the last time. 1st time was a few years back and they were just rude. Went the other day for specific a vehicle i want, i know how much i want to put down and where i want my payments to. I know it can be done because a different dealership did it. However at ipac the sales rep knew NOTHING about the vehicle i wanted. processed to tell me i needed a 750 or higher with 5 to 6000 for a $17000 and my payments still wouldnt be where i want them.  They then tried to get me into a completely different type of car and was really rude about the whole thing.  Idk if they thought i needed a car so they were going to try and force me into something i didnt want or if they just suck that much. I will never go there again and i will tell as many people as i can to never go there.",1.0
12,"July 02, 2019","I found a vehicle I liked and set up an appointment. Drove it and agreed to pay the asking price. no haggling or talking them down. When it came time to sign, they added over $4000 before TTL to the price and refused to sell the vehicle for the advertised price. It is a bait and switch. They never planned to sell it for the advertised price and were simply driving traffic to the store. Horrible. ",1.0

109,"December 03, 2018","My brothers dodge caravan was towed in on October 28th because it had no power. Our service consultant was Charles. Communication between Charles and us was about as minimal as you can get. Unless we called him we could never get any information. The vehicle is a 2017 Dodge Caravan with a full bumper to bumper extended warranty mind you. On November 13th we were told that the warranty would not cover anything on the vehicle and we would need to pay the entire $5000+ service bill before we could take the van. When asked how this could be Charles told us ""because your warranty refused to cover the repairs"". I contacted the warranty company to inquire why this was. So on or about the 8th of November they (the warranty company) sent out an inspector who took pictures of everything but couldn't approve the needed repairs because the mileage couldn't be validated. They needed the van to power up to verify that we were within the mileage to approve.  So IPAC did the repair and the warranty company sent out a 2nd inspector to approve the completed repairs. When the 2nd inspector got there and he inspected the vehicle he could tell that the repairs that IPAC said they did, they didn't do. So they refused the repairs and that's when they tried to get us to pay for them. After almost another 2 weeks back and forth with IPAC and the warranty company come to find out IPAC never did the repairs they were trying to charge us and warranty company for. They told us that the service tech had lied to all of us about completed repairs. Today is December 3rd. we have been without a vehicle for over a month because they were dishonest. My suggestion is that if you need a repair done. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!!",1.0

122,"October 17, 2018","I have had the worst experience as a car owner at IPAC. We purchased and serviced our vehicle at IPAC  and little did I know that was a HUGE MISTAKE. If you want your vehicle to be well serviced and taken care of DO NOT take it to IPAC, in fact I would recommend you not buy any of their warranties to prevent their horrible service. The other day my cars engine randomly seized. I took it to the manufacturers dealership to get a full diagnostic and they found that our vehicle was 2 quarts OVER the recommended amount which they concluded caused the engine to fail. They could not find anything else wrong with the car besides that. We checked oil change records and IPAC had been adding way more then required for the last 2 or 3 oil changes. I've heard that their service department DOES NOT care for vehicles properly but gave them the benefit of the doubt... When you take your car in for service you expect the service to be made exactly what is required, nothing more nothing less and it's obvious that doesn't happen at IPAC. To make matters worse when we confronted them about the issue they told us that they MIGHT be able to cover a measly 20% of the damages but before that they had to escalate the situation to management. Two weeks pass by and I'm told employee that IPAC will not help with the repairs after all and that it was my fault because I should have checked to see that the service was properly done. I was also told that if I knew the car didn't require that much oil then I should have made a special request to get the correct oil amount and oil filter on my vehicle...I was never given the opportunity to speak to a customer relations person or a manager. We all own vehicles that mean a lot to us but no one deserves to be talked down on like that.. if you plan on buying a vehicle here just consider this experience they could easily do the same to your mother, your son or daughter, even your wife.",1.2

130,"September 19, 2018","This dealership is full of liars who promise you incentives for buying with them and not fulfilling them. What they do is tell you it's part of the deal and when you make a deal they dont include them in the final paperwork. And of course theres so much to sign that you cant keep track of what your signing. Then when you realize it wasnt given to you they tell you theres nothing they can do for you because they cant see it in the paperwork. Not only that, I purchased a brand new charger and not even 2000 miles on it the skid plate breaks on the bottom of the car. Apparently it cant take the force of a puddle. I take it to service and after being sent back and forth from the sales guy to service blaming it on each other, service tells me its wear and tear and I'll have to pay for it. How the xxxx can you say wear and tear for a car with not even 2000 miles on it! I could understand if I ran over something but it was a puddle!!! This dealership is by far the worst dealership I've ever seen and this is my right car. All they do is play the blame game and give you the run around!

255,"June 16, 2018","Don‚Äôt take your car to get serviced here. We took our daughter‚Äôs Dodge Charger for service repairs and it took 7 days before we received an estimate. After we approved all of the dealer‚Äôs recommended repairs ($2,000), we picked up our supposedly repaired vehicle only to drive it home and realize it was driving worse than before. After speaking with Jared, the service manager, he informed us the exhaust pipe somehow cracked on the short 20 minute drive from their dealership back to our house and wanted to charge us $1300 more to fix it and an additional 2-3 days to get the work done. I find this extremely hard to believe given the fact that my teenage daughter heard the noise as soon as she drove off the lot. Obviously they did NOT properly inspect the vehicle before releasing it to us. I am thankful that my young teenage daughter did not get in an accident on the drive home. They refused any compensation or responsibility. We will NEVER purchase nor service a vehicle with IPAC again.",1.0

469,"February 12, 2018",I am writing this review because I have received 0 response after the multiple tries reaching out to Chrysler/Dodge at Ingram park. In December I had my car serviced due to every time it rained water would leak thru the roof leaving a stain and the smell of mildew. When I called it was my understanding it was under the manufacturer's warranty but was told they wouldn't work on it right away so I decided to bring it after the holidays. When I dropped off the vehicle it was suddenly over the manufacturers warranty and they made me pay out of pocket. Then when I picked up the vehicle I noticed a huge scratch on the door. I told the worker that scratch was not there and took a picture of it right in front of him. He tried to say it wasn't a scratch but if it was I could call and bring it back. Well I called and they told me to send an email to chernandez@ipacchrysler.com. Never got a single response. Called back again and was told to send an email to the head of the service department jwilde@ipacchrysler.com. After serval more emails still no response. I just want the scratch fixed. So people beware their service department has been more than just shady. I would never recommend them. Avoid at all cost. ,1.0

473,"February 07, 2018"," I would first like to state that I am in sales and have been for over two decades. I have been purchasing Ram trucks from a trusted and regular source for the last seven RAM's that I have owned. I went into the dealership against my seasoned sales knowledge and doubtfulness.  I was welcomed by Roger Astudillo. I was up front in what I wanted and what my numbers looked like. He recognized that was what I was interested in and nothing else. Roger was extremely observant of what my needs were and went right to work. It was right to the numbers as I asked. The most important aspect of being in sales is recognizing what your client wants, needs and does not need. He addressed all three of those needs without hesitation and with superb skill and intuition. I have no problem saying that I did not purchase the truck but, without a doubt. I have no problem saying that Roger went above and beyond what most would have done. Thank you, Roger for giving myself the best experience that I have had being a walk in client. I highly recommend that if, you do choose to buy a new RAM. Do yourself a favor and ask for him. 
Sincerely,
David Johnson

Took my truck to get washed from the IPAC Detail/ wash care center and it came back with black finger mark smudges on the interior of my fold down mirrors and roof. The vacuum they used had grease on it so my carpets and back sides of my seats had lines where they drug the vacuum nozzle. My door handle had a scuff on it that went all the way down to the primer. I mentioned it to the management and he said that my kids made the finger marks and i prolly hit my door on something. This truck is garage kept and rarely driven due to my job schedule.

Looks like I am just reiterating what everyone else has experienced at this dealership but here we go.
After inquiring (via ramtrucks.com) I was called by the dealership (Judy) and setup an appointment.  I drove an hour to make my appointment on time and on schedule showing the respect for their time that I expect to be shown for mine.  I was introduced to Judy (gatekeeper) and was quickly assigned to one of the hoard of salesmen that stared lustily at any potential victim who drove into the parking lot.  It was strikingly reminiscent of a combination of ""The Walking Dead"" and picking up day laborers in the HomeDepot parking lot.

I was then informed that the particular unit I had inquired about, being the only unit that met MOST of my requirements and all of my preferences, was unavailable as they were lifting it and putting oversized tires on it.  Since I am simple man who has come to terms with my stature, hairline, and masculinity I had no need of a lifted truck.  

I was at this point very incensed asked why I had been invited to drive an hour for no particular purpose.  The salesman assured me they had lots of units that would meet my needs even though he had no clue what those were.  He invited me to get into his vehicle and wander through their remote lot looking at random trucks.  I then recommended we complete a computer search of their stock with my particular requirements.  He was a confused by my idea of using tools to expedite the process and insisted we go wandering about in hopes of stumbling across something that might interest me.
At this point I was done with them and walked away.  I was glad I still had my keys and could make a speedy get away before the minions revolted and feasted upon brains.",1.4
524,"August 28, 2017","Took my vehicle KNOWING what the problem was, and they still charged be a $150 ""Labor"" fee for diagnostics. Part back ordered, they don't offer service loaners which I already knew. However I had to contact Jeep directly for any assistance in trying to speed the process up. No calls back, left messages with no response. Got tired and decided I'd be best off taking my business elsewhere. They wanted to charge $900 for parts and labor on one part. They think their clients don't know anything about their vehicles and still try to get over on the ones that do. Such a shame because this is seriously affecting BRAND perception as a whole.",1.0

533,"March 10, 2017","My wife and I were looking into replacing my totaled out 2014 Dodge Charger.  We went to several other dealers to meet their staff.  One place the people didn't even meet us or even care to help us find what we wanted.  When we came into IPAC Larry helped us at first.  We explained that we were waiting on the final word from the insurance company on the Charger but we wanted a Durango.  They had an R/T that was similar to what we wanted minus the color and package we wanted.  Larry wrote info down and told me to call as soon as we found out about them totaling out my car.  I got the call on a Friday the next week about it finally being totaled out.  I called Larry to follow up with him to find out he had been promoted.  He asked Josh Giehll to take over and help us.  I spoke with Josh going over what exactly I was looking for.  He said he didn't think he had one that matches but wanted us to come in and meet him while he also looked to see what he could do to help us.

Here is where you could see the awesomeness.  We told him we would try to be there between 6PM - 7PM because I had a few events to be at that as part of my volunteer commitments.  Josh said that was not a problem but to ask for him when we walked in.  We came in and Josh was busy with another customer and while he didn't want us to wait long he asked another gentlemen to help him out.  While this gentlemen was nice, pleasant and helpful we really did prefer Josh.  Once Josh got done working with the other customer he came over to help us.  

The three of them got a list of what we wanted and they were able to find the Durango we wanted.  The color, the appearance package, tech package, and the entertainment package.  He and Larry worked with us on the price.  We were able to get what I would consider the best and most fair deal on a car I have purchased.  They had to get the car from the other dealership but they didn't see a problem with it.  Josh kept me well informed of where we were in the process.  He called me when they got the Durango and that they had to do a switch and that it should be here on a Wednesday.  On Tuesday he confirmed that it would in fact be there Wednesday.  They got the Durango in on Wednesday he called me to let me know it was in.

When we got there to pick it up Josh was with another customer.  After about 20 minutes we had been taken for the process to show us how the car worked with all the features.  Josh came out and let us know he was still working on another deal but that he would be back.  We found a minor scratch on the back before we signed the paperwork.  Josh got a cleaning solution that he uses on his vehicles and spent had to have been about 20 minutes working to clean the few fingerprint spots we found and this scratch.  He was able to take care most of the scratch area and thought he fixed it but they didn't.  He had it added and told us to follow up with him.

Josh and Larry both went out of there way to make sure we were taken care of.  They did a deal that was I strongly believe in my favor.  My wife and I were both extremely happy and pleased with their level of dedication and help.  There was not any true pressure or force to get the car.  If there had been we would have left.  But we had gone to every dealership in San Antonio and found IPAC the ones willing to put forth the effort and had the care, respect, and honesty to get us in what we wanted.  

We appreciated the experience and would buy another car from them.   ",5.0

551,"September 16, 2016","Purchased my 2013 Challenger new at this dealership.  The buying experience was fine.  At first i started off taking my car there for service.  During an oil change and tire rotation somehow one of my rims was chipped.  Service department said they didn't do it and that was that.  I quit taking my car there for service.  Then I get a recall notice for the timing chain recall on my car.  I call the service center to make an appointment and they tell me no appointments are taken but that my repair would be done in 3-5 days.  I drop my car off at dealership and they tell me 6-10 days because of delays at machine shop.  I call on day 8 for an update and learn that nothing goes to the machine shop for this recall and that the delay was at the service department.  I take this in stride.  Now on day 9 I get a call that the car is almost complete but they found a leak in the radiator that would be almost $800 to repair.  I tell them that the car didn't have a leak and that it was services less than 300 miles ago and had no leaks.  I remind them about the rim and the fact that they just did a bunch of repairs that were right up against the radiator and that they must of caused the puncture.  I am told that they need to talk to a service manager and get back to me.  It's been about an hour now and no call back yet.  UPDATE:  After about an hour and a half of waiting I finally got a call back from the warranty department.  Very nice lady that agreed to replace the damaged radiator on their dime.  She said she would call me back right away to let me know if it would be done today or not.  Been a couple of hours now and no call back.  Not sure what's going on at the moment. UPDATE got a call that car should be done today.  Will update this review after I see the car and verify all is good.  I feel they are trying to make things right but for the time being I've lost some trust.  If all is good when I pick up the car I will change this review to positive. UPDATE:. I didn't get a call saying my car was ready so I called service department at 6:30pm to check.  Becky (service writer) tells me she got busy and then had a meeting so she forgot to let me know my car was ready.  So..., Again with the lies.  I asked if they would wait for me to get there because they close at 7pm, nope won't wait.  I make it there right at 7pm and get my car.  Things look okay but hard to tell because it's filthy dirty.

558,"August 14, 2016","The sales employee falsified information when quoting an online price for a 2016 dodge challenger. The online prices after rebates quoted the vehicle around $26309. Over the phone, Josh, the internet salesman informed me that with all rebates included that the vehicle was less than the online price. The salesmen quoted the vehicle, Stock # C264248, for $24400. I informed the salesman that I was going to quote him. When I arrived to the dealership, the salesman had me work with another employee in sales who provided me with the actual price for the vehicle (ranging around $29,000). When discussing aobut financing the new vehicle, the new salesman appraised my trade-in real low (even though it was a 2014) and but was willing to negotiate with me but deferred other resources to validate true value of the vehicle (Kelly Blue Books). The next day, on another phone call, the initial salesman (Josh Giehll) was then working with me again and appeared very pushy when it came to his preferred monthly price. Josh was not willing to negotiate with my initial monthly pricing (when discussing financing the vehicle) and refused an increase on the value of the trade-in-vehicle. Josh then recommended me to search banks to inquire if I would be able to seek a less stringent auto loan. It appeared suspicious of the salesman asking me to seek banks for such due to that being a part of his job description. Staff (Manager Johnny Sias and another salesman) at the dealership had already ran my credit to obtain my score. I informed Josh that such a recommendation would jeopardize lowering my credit score if I submitted various applications to other banks. It appeared that Josh at this point did not want to do his job. I then informed Josh to submit our numbers to the bank that collaborate with the dealership and to follow up with me. The following day, Josh did not follow up with me. I contacted the dealership and staff members falsified information to me when I was inquiring if the Josh Giehll had submitted our initial inquiry to banks after negotiating. Staff members stated that Josh had already sent my information to the banks and was waiting for the results. I then received a phone call from Josh stating that he did not submit my application to the banks. When I confronted Josh and told him that he had lied and falsified information to me since the beginning, Josh then appeared irate and yelled stating he ""has never lied to his clients"" and praised for being a Christian and a devoted salesman. I was confused as to why he provided this information of his religious background to me, which had no relation to the conversation or his ability to negotiate as a salesman. After I ended the conversation (due to Josh getting too personal) I was contacted again and was offered a lower price of the new vehicle and a $1000 increase on the appraisal. However, the monthly payment was still the same from Josh‚Äôs initial recommendation. I then agreed and informed josh if such could be considered with the GAP. I came in the next morning and was informed from Josh that the financial department was already submitting the financial recommendations to the banks. Josh also noted that the price ranges needed to increase an additional $100 due to not implementing the APR and other charges for the new vehicle. I was also informed to arrive back to the dealership when approvals and recommendations from the banks have been acquired. I was informed that I was going to receive a phone call or text message. It was around 6:30 in the evening and I did not hear back from the salesman. I contacted Josh and was told that he was waiting for the financial department to locate a more preferable bank due to interest. I declined services after that due to repetitive activity and falsified information from Josh Giehll. It would be best for the dealership to withdraw indefinitely him from sales.

I have taken meticulous care of my car, - clean, regular maintenance and we've even named her.  My daughter thinks she is her sister (and accuses me of loving her more).

I have been trying to get the Takata airbag recall fixed for  a year now, and every time I call, I either get put on hold so long that the phone disconnects, been told that they will call me back (which they never do), or told that they are 2-4 weeks behind, and when they can get to me, I will have to leave my car for 3-5 days to get it done IF they have the parts.  Being a single parent with one car, I found this incredibly inconvenient, but willing to do considering i BASICALLY HAVE A 12 GAUGE SHOTGUN ON MY STEERING COLUMN.  But they never seem to be able to fit me in.

Today I called NORTHSTAR DODGE about the recall.  They said - and I quote:  ""drop it off at 7 and we'll have it done by close of business"".  I responded with - ""no xxxx, you're serious"".  I then excused my language and explained my situation.  The service rep told me (on the sly) that the dealerships get the parts free,  and have plenty in stock, but they just don't want to give the free labor.  Wow...somebody that is frank.  To me that shows a commitment/responsibility to customers of the brand.  Not just a blow off because they got their money and want to be done with it.  

It was the same story with Ancira Chrysler.  They are probably the same company seeing that it's the same lie being told.  Don't go to either.

I have talked to Chrysler Corporation about this, and I have filed a complaint with the National Highway Transportation Board.  It is a deliberate attempt to vacate themselves of any responsibility with a safety problem. They are putting their customers in danger without accepting any responsibility for fixing the problem.   My complaint can be found at safecar.gov and search for 10872481.

I will never go back there, and advise anyone I know to no go anywhere near them.  I don't expect car dealerships to be honest, but when it comes to a matter of life and death, I do expect them to have a bit of decency.  These people have neither.

576,"April 27, 2016","With dealing with Ipac, there has been a terrible experience for me as the consumer. With a blatened disrespect heightened with sheer arrogance of misleading information . That arrogance 's name is Charles Morgan.  The manger there in sales within Ipac. I found it hard to believe this has not been done before, due to Charles non chalant nature  of comfortable behavior. This my story I came to Ipac seeking a buy back of my 2012 Dodge Journey due to constant  repair. The person I spoke with directly was Scott  G. a sales Rep  pleasant guy, he replied he would  get a quote for me..Well he brought the quote and he brought this from Charles Morgan the quote given was 10,500 for my vehicle. So this is where Charles Morgan and I begin our contact. I ask Scott G. the Rep to send for Charles Morgan. So the Rep does and Charles returns. Charles tells me that he came up single handed with this price and that is the only price (10,500) that he can give for the Dodge Journey. So I begin negotiating he says no. I ask for he's boss he says sure. So at this moment his boss Mr. Jex comes out and is very warmful and explains the reasoning on why the price is firm (10,500). So even though I was not happy about the price,  I have accepted the price (10,500). Afterward,  the boss Mr. Jex smiles and gives me back to Charles Morgan. Natrully at this point I'm overwhelmed because my car is in service as we speak with a bill of 1,075 and my pay off for the Dodge Journey is 12,400. Math wise, that is roughly 3,100 dollars difference and I don't know how I'm going to come up with this money. Nonetheless,  I come up with the whole amount asked of me. 3,100 in a 2 week span. Just to give an idea of how this money was gotten. I borrowed, begged, and worked countless hours to produce the money that was needed. Only to come back to Ipac yesterday Monday April 25, 2016. To meet with the same manger Charles Morgan and to say he didn't  remember me. Not only did he say he didn't remember the conversation we had with his boss Mr. Jex and I. Charles replied,  you will need a new quote and the boss Mr. Jex is no longer with the company Ipac. SMH  My heart sunk. I questioned him why, and replied we discussed this two weeks ago and you were firm on the price (10,500) and said at this point he (Charles) remembered. I felt relieved but one thing still bothered me he still wanted the quote and gave me a Rep name Andrew Shook . Andrew Shook gives him the new appraisal  same information and he come back with Charles and a new quote saying 9,000 dollars. At that point my emotions were in my throat and tear streamed as he walked away. Basicly if you are not following  after the firm quote Charles gave of (10,500) and all the blood sweat and tears I out in to getting the money required to trade in my Dodge Journey Charles single handed change quote to 9,000 dollars 1,500 less then he originally quoted. Fast-fowarded to now, me writting this compliant. The reason for this compliant isto protect other consumer from a tear dropping, hair pulling moment like this. Oh and did I mentioned, because I believed what he said about the (10,500) so much so that I got a new car  because I had no worry so I thought of sailing it back... Tears streaming  and I now have two cars and no way to pay for both with the arrogance of one man CHARLES MORGAN,THE MANGER AND FACE FOR INGARM PARK CRYSLER SAN ANTONIO to be continued..........",1.0

582,"April 04, 2016","They have horrible customer care. I purchased a used vehicle from IPAC in 2014 and since have had a few minor problems. I recently went to get service for a recall and my check engine light. They never answered any of my phone calls or returned any of my calls. I even attempted to make an appointment online and over the phone, but was not successful.  That should have been a red flag, but I still chose to take the vehicle in because it needed to be done. They said they were busy and were just servicing vehicles as they came in. They checked out the vehicle without once telling us of any charges they required. Typically in the past if I needed a vehicle serviced I would receive a phone call with the pricing of services and agree or not agree to have the vehicle serviced. No not with IPAC, they called to let us know they were going to charge close to $400 for a service that on average cost closer to $200. We obviously decided against the service and when we went to pick up the vehicle they charged $115. When we told them not one person told us of any pricings of services that were being done, and they responded that was just the price. 

Overall it is definitely not a customer friendly dealership that I want to ever work with in the future. I would never recommend their services to anyone. 

I never did feel completely confident when I made the purchase at IPAC and told my husband I never wanted to go back in the future when it came to purchasing or servicing a vehicle. ",1.2

We went by on a Saturday around noon and throughout the day visited 4 other dealerships test driving different cars.  Our sales associate was Greg Galindo and he was professional, knowledgeable and cordial.  Unlike some of the other dealerships we visited he was not pushy and did not pressure us into a sale.  He educated us on the vehicle, highlighted the advantages of owning a Jeep and carried on a conversation with us that made us feel like he had a genuine interest in more than just the sale.  In addition, his follow up skills during and after the sale have been excellent.  Omar Campos, the sales manager, was an absolute pleasure to deal with.  My wife and I had some particular features we wanted in our vehicle and Omar/Greg helped us locate the perfect vehicle.  When the car was located it was slightly above our budget and Omar really worked with us to come to a price that fit within our budget.

As I pulled into the dealership all the sales guys were hanging out outside and I just new I was going to be swarmed as soon as I stepped out of my 2010 Jeep.msure enough Allen M walked right up to me. All I can say it was a great experience from that moment on. I told him I was just looking to see what I could get for my vehicle and what vehicle I was interested in. He drove me around all of their lots in a new Chrysler 300. He even kept the car running as we got at to look at some of the vehicles, it was a very hot day and getting back in a cool car was very nice. After driving all around and after all my questions he drove me back to some of the lots so I could narrow down what I was looking for. After finding the vehicle I wanted, we took for a test drive and I was sold. After some back and forth negotiations, which were handled professionally and in a friendly manner, I made the deal. It was after 10 pm by the time I was done with all the finance paperwork, which by the way was also very patient with me with the many questions I had. So it's now after 10 pm and Allen gives me the keys and he shows me the features of the car, even helps set up my cell to the connect system. I was there pretty late so they didn't have time to wash it. I went back the next afternoon and they detailed the car. 
Allen was great with everything from start to finish. I did begin my search online and Scott was very helpful and even came up to me a few times during my expeience to see how I was doing. Omar worked with Allen to ""seal the deal"".

Had a bad experience at World Car, where I had bought my car so decided to go where someone had such a good experience. Bottom line is this, I was a female alone, not knowing much about the car buying process so even in 2015, that old cliche still stands, they took advantage of me. Larry was good at showing me exactly what I was looking for and it was something I had not thought of, a Jeep Cherokee. I just loved it. We started the process and I knew that I had worked hard on my credit and my bank had already approved me for an amount, so I felt good. First they showed me my credit score much lower than what I know it is but I was still ok. They convinced me to put $400 down and my payment was close to what I was paying for my Sentra but this was a much nicer car so I was fine with it. I drove it home very happy. A few days later, Larry calls me to tell me they ""forgot"" to have me sign a couple of things for the loan. I went in that Saturday and as soon as I sat down, I knew it was not about forgotten paperwork. My bank did not approve the amount of the vehicle for me. I knew it was more but I thought these ""professionals"" knew what they were doing. So they had to go through another bank and got the approval at a higher rate with me paying $30 more a month. I was furious and told them to give me my Nissan back. Of corse it's too late for that and I love the car so I had no choice. Lying to get me to come in was the worst and they way they handled it, I will NEVER go back to them nor will I recommend them to anyone. Even the people who refereed me were upset and will think twice before sending anyone to them. What sucks is being made to feel so stupid as a single female trying to buy a car.

I never received a phone call. I had to call multiple times, each of which I never got thru. I finally just decided to show up at the dealer. after I picked up my car and drove to return the rental car. the airbag light turned back on. literally 20 min after I picked it up. not only that. the back padding on my seat where they were working. was broken. I had to return back to the dealer and there we were with my family and children waiting for them to try and figure out why the light came back on. it turned out that the wire harness that they replaced for my seat airbag was a ""defected harness"". so they had to do the entire job all over again. I also made them replace the back padding that they broke.  so I drove away with my jeep until the new parts arrived. once they arrived they promised to have the work completed the same day so that I wouldn't have to get another rental. we made the appointment for a Thursday morning drop off that way I could pick up my vehicle that same night after I got off of work. at 4:30pm Thursday afternoon I still hadn't received an update. so I called and he told me that they were just barely going to start working on the car but that they promised it was a fast job and that they could still have my vehicle ready by 6pm.

708,"October 15, 2014","We purchased a used truck.  The first time my husband drove to work the engine light came on.  We brought it to the dealership to be serviced.  They told us that if it wasn't covered by warranty we would have to pay out of pocket but couldn't even tell us how much it would cost to diagnosis the problem....even though we told them what the problem was.  We spoke to sales, they said there is no way to know if it was broken before we bought it so it was our problem.  I wrote a letter via the ""contact us"" on the website.  Nobody ever responded.  I had a different salesperson email me about purchasing a vehicle, I replied that we just purchased a truck and told him the problem, never heard from him or anyone else ever again.   On a positive note, the price was great.  The salesman I had, who was great, is no longer working for the company.

This was the second vehicle I purchased from IPAC but my first time to need service.  I was about to purchase a new Jeep from them too but decided not to.  I would suggest you use a different dealer....(on an additional note, Red McCombs is also terrible.  They sold me a Certified Used Hyundai with a rebuilt engine and a car accident on the record - not reported on the CarFax until 10 months after I purchased it, but I was aware something was wrong with the vehicle after a few days)

709,"October 14, 2014","Larry was the first to call when I made an internet inquiry. After arriving, he treated me and my son very well. He answered all of our questions and was very knowledgeable about the car and all of it's features. He let my son drive three different Challengers; none of which were an exact fit. He worked tirelessly to put the right package together will the features my son wanted. He was fixated on giving my son the right car and giving me the right price. Best car buying experience I've ever had.

Thank you Larry. Top shelf all the way.",5.0

727,"June 28, 2014","I recently had yet another great experience in purchasing my new Chrysler 300. I can't think of any other Dealership i would rather do business with. I had previously purchased 3 Cars from IPAC and this recent purchase went without any difficulties. I dealt mainly with Todd Waldo and He showed he has considerable product Knowledge and professionalism.He was able to answer all of my concerns, helped me in every way possible and always kept in touch with me as needed.I would not hesitate in doing business with Him again.

I also want to thank Charlie Morgan for making my deal possible and all of his efforts in seeing that I was able to get the exact car I desired at the price I desired. Charlie is indeed very professional in every aspect.

Additionally, I had formally dealt with Larry White during a prior visit. I was so humbled that he immediately recognized me as i entered the Dealership and called me by Name. That really meant much more to me than i ever could express as it proved to me that I was more than just a 'number' to Him.
He offered to help me as He was able as well as continuously checked on me to insure my needs were being accomplished.

Lastly, but certainly not forgotten, was my interaction once again with Victor Blades during my finance meeting with Him. He already had all of the paperwork prepared and made a stressful time very easy for me.He had remembered me before from my last purchase 3 years ago and after our initial conversation, felt as though we had never parted.

All in all I would highly recommend IPAC to everyone in the market for a new Car. Each Employee is very knowledgeable and accommodating to your needs. They are much like a family who strives to earn your respect and continuous business.

Thanks to each of you for making my new purchase such an excellent experience for me. I look forward to many years of continued business with you . I pray for Blessings to be extended to each of you and your families.",4.8
728,"June 27, 2014","Working with Larry was an outstanding experience. He is an excellent, personable salesmen who was reaching out to me from start to finish to make sure I am happy and comfortable with my purchase!

Normally, the financial side of the car business is just that.....business, and that what I have come to expect. However, it is well deserved that I mention Louay also. He went more out of his way to work with banks to get me the best loan rate, beating my pre-approved rate by over 2.5%
 
In summary, I will definitely come back to IPAC, and I my experience with the has made me a promoter for them! ",5.0

733,"June 19, 2014","I researched and choose a vehicle. Corresponded with Internet sales team and went in to look at the vehicle. Tony Ruiz was unavailable so Scott Gonzalez helped me. I was there 4 hours for a purchased that should have taken 30 minutes. Scott left every time I asked a question and took 15-20 minutes to get someone to answer it for him. I know the sales tactic is to stall and make people wait but the reason I went through Internet sales was because I didn't want to spend all day sitting around a dealership being asked constantly what monthly payment would you like and what can we do to get you in this vehicle. The salesmen are so well programmed they don't even listen to the customers. I have had more productive conversations with telemarketers reading canned scripts.
   Even after I had purchased a vehicle from the dealership I continued to get e-mails from Tony Ruiz asking when I was going to come in and test drive a vehicle. I could tell the e-mails were pre scripted because I would receive the exact e-mail from other dealerships. I finally informed him that I had already purchased a vehicle and he still couldn't figure out I had already purchased a vehicle from him just a few days earlier. After he got upset because he thought I had purchased from another dealer I called him to explain I had purchased the vehicle from him at his dealership. He quickly used the I thought you were someone else excuse even though I had been corresponding with him by name.
   I purchased the vehicle on a rainy day and was asked to bring it back and they would wash and detail the truck. I took it in on a Tuesday morning with hardly any customers in the dealership and still watched my truck sit for 45 minutes before it was taken back. I then had to wait 2 more hours and listen to countless excuses about why my truck hadn't been cleaned yet.
   I also had to wait almost a month to receive my plates. I finally called the dealership and magically they had just come in the day before. I asked if I was on a call list to be informed of my need to pick up my plates and the receptionist could not give me an answer.",2.2

My son and I both took it for a test drive.  I made a minor error in slightly overestimating the loan value of the car, but to keep things simple, when Larry asked what it would take to earn my business, I gave Larry a number.  Within 10 minutes, Larry came back and said that number was a deal!  How's that for service?  Then I asked to inspect the car over, under, end to end and Larry assisted with all our questions. I can't say enough about how painless this car buying experience was.

And Vince?  Super efficient with the paperwork, even when I requested a redo two days later due to wanting to put additional money down.  Professional and done within 10 minutes.  Can it get better?

Not only Roger, but in general the sales associates checked on me, asked me if I wanted something to drink, just overall very friendly and at a busy store, they could have just ignored me and went about their business.  The entire dealership not only had friendly people, they had a wide selection of vehicles and best prices (based on the Ram 1500's I had wanted).

769,"March 24, 2014","Purchased a new Pacifica from IPAC.   Also punched bumper to bumper warrantee.  Since we've had the car if you need to use the warrantee, you need to have a deposit because work will not even be looked at unless you have a deposit.  Why?  Because it's not covered.  

But the car was in a wreck and we wanted it to go back to dealer so we could insure the work was done correctly.  BAD decision!   The service and body department are under two separate umbrellas and all that happens is one blames the other.  Plus they want YOU to drive the car between the two shops while they argue over who is at fault.   The biggest person to pass the blame or to explain in a very loud voice why they don't stand behind their work is Paul Vega.  I took the car to a different dealership and was told the car wouldn't have been allowed to leave the department in the condition the car was given to us in.   We have a new Honda Fit Sport and a new Nissan Truck, a ford, a Hyundai and a Chevy and have not had this problem with the other dealerships--that was why when we needed two more cars, WE DID NOT BUY at IPAC!

This was by far the best experience I have had when it comes to the purchasing process.  Larry was a really friendly and extremely patient associate (my wife and I have dealt with him in the past) so we knew right off the bat what to expect once we walked in.

The sales people were very friendly and you have to go in there telling them what you want and they will work with you.

I left a phone number and email address as requested and promptly received a reply via phone call from Justin Rodriguez and made a visit to the Dealership. I was introduced to Omar Campos (Justin) was helping out a customer. The personnel throughout the whole buying process were very courteous and professional. There are a lot of horror stories about the bargaining process between the salesman and customer. That was not the case here they were honest upfront and flexible on the numbers presented by both the customer and Dealership (Salesman). The dealership was very clean and presentable and the staff went out of their way to make my wife and I comfortable. I would like to commend your staff from beginning to end on their outstanding customer service skills.

776,"March 15, 2014","I had a friend that purchased a Dodge Ram from IPAC and he recommended coming to check them out.  I was in the market for a used full sized pickup and when I saw that there was a used Dodge Ram online. I called and asked about it as it had no picture.  Frank Z. ran out into the rain to send me a text with pictures of the truck within the hour.  Another dealership took 4 days to send me a picture of a vehicle and by the time they did, the vehicle was sold a couple of hours later.  Needless to say, I was impressed with Frank's quick response.

When I received the pictures I loaded up my family into our Jeep and I took my old Dakota (trade-in) and traveled to the dealership.  When I got there, Frank explained to me that the vehicle had just been traded in over the weekend so it was still a little rough around the edges (still needed to be detailed, washed, still a sticker on the back window, etc.) I told him that it was not a problem and we took the truck for a spin.  I was impressed with the truck and decided that I would take it.  Frank was accommodating and answered all of my questions while we worked the numbers on the truck.  It was getting a little late in the evening when we finally finished everything up and I could tell that Frank was feeling a little rushed, but he hung in there and didn't let it show too much.  Frank even went out to scrape the sticker off of the back of the truck when I was finalizing everything with the finance department.  When we were transferring the personal contents from the trade-in to the Ram I only had one key in and and asked about the second key.  He told me that there wasn't one.  When I asked him how much it would be to get a second one, he told me that it would be about $150.  I asked him if they could throw another key into the deal, and he told me no.  I was a little upset about that but I understood.  

On the drive home, I noticed that the light coming from my side was a little dim.  I didn't realize that one of the headlights were out until I got home and upon further inspection, there was a giant star in the center of the windshield (didn't see it initially because of the rain), one of the fog lights were broken out too!  I also had to stop off and get some gas as I was left with a little more than 1/8 of a tank. I replaced the headlights but called Frank and asked him about the fog light and the star in the windshield.  He told me that they weren't going to do anything about the star, but to bring in the truck about the fog light.  They will be replacing it on Tuesday or Wednesday.  

All in all, there were somethings that IPAC could have done better, but overall they are a good dealership and understand that they are operating a business.  I would recommend them to a friend, but would caution them to make sure that they check every nook and cranny of the vehicle before they take it off the lot.

Larry has kept in touch with me since the sale and has assisted in getting an appointment for a very minor imperfection in the window tinting.

That along with the recent passing of my husband I was not in the mood for haggling. Well from the moment we stepped on the lot I already felt good that the sales reps didn't swarm to us like vultures. We walked in an were welcomed with a warm greeting by Larry White and already felt at ease, but still at that unsure moment. I already knew what I wanted and did my research on pricing and what I wanted to pay. Larry showed me a few in my price range and I had given him a number and with the incentives and other features he honestly told me that may not be realistic. It was then I knew I could trust Larry. I felt as though he was looking at my best interest and not the money I was gonna spend. I could have easily paid cash for the vehicle but he advised me for what I wanted and additional incentives I should finance a certain amount and this could also help my credit. I can honestly say from this point it was easy sailing, from getting insurance, finance and the whole atmosphere of the dealership everyone put me in a great mood and for the first time since the passing of my husband I was smiling. While in the process of the paperwork I was still in a state of disbelief that I was purchasing my first NEW vehicle and it wasn't until Larry handed me the keys and I sat in it and started it that I realized this was mine. It was an emotional time for me and I was very glad that Larry was there to help to make this process as easy as possible and I would like to not only thank him but the whole team at the dealership for all their smiles while passing by and just pleasant and upbeat attitudes throughout our visit.

First of all, I had the check engine light on and it took them 1 week to look at it. 
Then once they discovered what it was. They said it would take 1-2 days to get fixed. 
After making an appointment to drop off vehicle, they finally take a look at my car on the fourth day.   Even though they claimed that they were working on it since day 1. 
I know they weren‚Äôt working it from day 1-3 because on day 4 they said they just discovered something else was wrong when they opened it. 

On top of not looking at my car till the 4th day, now they claim my battery is dead and needs to be jumped started to start the car.  I had no battery issues before this point at all not even a flicker of any light or dimness of any light within the car.  When I told them that they must have left something on they claimed they didn‚Äôt, but were quick to want to charge me nearly $300 for a new battery.  They refused to admit they did something wrong and correct the issue by replacing my battery which had no issues when it went in.  They claimed it was the cold front.  That is ridiculous I lived in weather would drop below 30 degrees for at least a month and I never once had an issue with battery on either of my cars and neither did any of my friends and co-workers.

797,"January 28, 2014","Robert was a great salesman; he was very friendly and helpful with very little pressure.

The finance department worked great to find me the best deal possible; by that I mean they did find me a good deal.  They took FOREVER to do so.  It was 3 full hours from the time Robert took the paperwork to the finance guys to finance being ready to sign the papers.  It was such an ordeal that we didn't even discuss the after-market items I wanted to add to the vehicle.

From the time we got there to the time we left, it was over 5 hours and I had my 3 young kids with me who were now starving and VERY restless.  So, rather than wait 2 to 3 more hours for the make ready, Robert suggested that I bring the car back later for it.  The car was very dirty, inside and out, and I hated taking delivery of a vehicle that I could not see if there were scratches or anything, but with the kids, I agreed and went on.  I went back the following Monday first thing.  The ""Make Ready"" was HORRIBLE.  They took just over 2 hours to do a job I could have gotten at any gas station with a drive through car wash in 5 minutes.  There were still scuffs all over the passenger seat back, and both passenger side doors leading me to believe they only cleaned the driver's side.  The dash and console were not cleaned.  On the exterior, there are dirt and marks all over the place, some of the marks look like primer that rinsed down to the trim that was not cleaned off. They left a spray cleaner and rag laying on the back seat.  

I would have sent it back for another washing, but I had already wasted 2 hours waiting for the first pass, I didn't want to wait again.  I cleaned the inside yesterday and plan to detail it myself this weekend, hopefully all the marks come off.

I also found someone else's CDs under the front passenger seat and 2 phones programmed in the Uconnect.  This makes me think that someone had bought the vehicle and returned it.  This was not mentioned to me during the sale.  When I asked about the excessive mileage (320 miles), I was told it had been on the lot for a while; the inspection sticker is 5 months old, so this seemed plausible enough at the time.  Did they sell me a used car as a new one?

In the end, if you decide to buy from IPAC, go early, try to leave the kids with a sitter, and plan for it to be a full day event.


UPDATES:  

I also did not have the full down payment they wanted, so they suggested that I give them a check and they would hold it until the date of my choice; I chose the following Friday when I was to get paid.  It is now Thursday preceding the Friday for them to deposit my check, I woke my kids early to take them for breakfast, placed the order, gave my debit card to the cashier, it was declined.  The check they were going to hold until tomorrow cleared my bank last night.  1 overdraft fee so far, and 4 transactions pending that may get overdraft fees of their own.  I called and spoke with Wes, he was very helpful and had a check cut for me very quickly for me to go deposit and write him a new check for the down payment that they will hold until tomorrow.  This still ate up my entire lunch break and 2 full gallons of gas, and now I have to keep my fingers crossed that their check clears my bank before my other pending transactions.

Regarding the poor Make Ready, Johnny has given me two basic washes at the Wash Tub and 8 gallons of gas.

Regarding the possibility of my new car having been used, Johnny explained that it was transferred from another dealership and may have been used as a loaner.

Robert has continued to be helpful throughout this process and I would still highly recommend him if you do go with IPAC.",2.8

799,"January 26, 2014","I had submitted an online inquiry advising of the specific vehicle I was interested in.  After communicating with the salesman via email all day.  I set up an appointment to see and test drive a 2014 Jeep Cherokee 4WD.  This location is approximately one hour from my house.  I had a check in hand and ready to buy.  When I got there, the salesman initially told us that it sold that morning, although it was still listed on the website and that I set up the appointment with him.  We gave him the opportunity to see if he could locate another exact vehicle.  But then he didn't even know what options I wanted after I had contacted them directly with all those specifications before I made an appointment.  Before going to search for one, he wanted me to sign some paperwork and value my trade in.  He also kept pushing me, asking ""if I find one like it today are you prepared to buy?"".  Pretty bold considering I hadn't even seen or driven the vehicle.  After he leaves us for a while, he comes back stating that it actually hadn't sold but that it was the General Managers new demo vehicle and that he took it for the weekend.

ended  up doing the washing himself!  And we had to leave San Antonio without owners

818,"December 14, 2013","This has been the best experience with a dealership in my entire life. Robert Ortega was the most pleasant and helpful salesman I have had the pleasure of meeting. We live in Chattanooga, Tennessee and were here visiting our grandson who joined the Air Force and decided we need a vehicle to pull behind out RV. We looked through several adds on the internet, stopped at a few places we had chosen, and finally chose Ingram and we are glad we did. Hands down there were no comparison to this dealership, from Robert all the way to finance, even with our constant changing minds they never grew tired of us and treated us like family. If I could carry them around in my pocket and pull them out when someone needed a car I would. I can't say enough good things about them.

I'm so let down by Ipac service and ivan (in charge) of service.... When buying the car they made me feel line they were really gonna take care of me. We've had the 2013 dodge dart for 7 months now. Ever since we has the vehicle we has problems with the front tire sensor... After taking the vehicle there three times for the same problem they never fixed it... Finally I went to discount tire and they showed me three tire were bad, and the sensor fault was a loose sensor just laying in the tire, with a regular valve stem !!!! Not a tire sensor stem !!!! They opened the tire right in front of me ! I was needles to say shocked and pissed ! I went back to Ipac and Ivan basically just laughed at my face.... And the sales manager told me to call continental tire !!!! Or buy the tires from them and they would send them in to see if continental would warranty them... Yeah right buy more has tires !!!!

Charlie Morgan is exceptional in his professionalism and exceeded our expectations in his assistance, he is a very respectful and has a comfortable disposition. This made it so comfortable to go through this process with Charlie Morgan.  Annette Arellano's disposition allowed us to feel like we were part of the IPAC family.

Annette Arellano made us feel like old friends.  I have and will continue to recommend IPAC, Charlie Morgan and Annette Arellano to family and friends.  
Our first time experience was amazing because my husband and I had and have only one vehicle, the one vehicle we had decided to finally break down at a very bad time, Charlie Morgan was highly recommended by our friends and a couple of family members and their experience so we went to see him.  Charlie Morgan and IPAC helped us when we needed it the most, and Annette Arellano assisted in putting our mind at ease about the whole process.

When I first went to Ingram Park Dodge I really wasn't ready to buy yet but, wanted to test drive a Challenger and see what they were priced at.  I was met by Larry Gillman at the dealership and he was very welcoming and attentive to everything I was looking for in a Challenger.  Once he knew what I was looking for he immediately took me to every Challenger on every lot.  He worked extremely hard and diligently to find exactly what  I wanted in the Challenger Redline edition.  He found the exact year, color, and options I wanted in the vehicle and he was able to work a perfect deal I couldn't pass up.  He got me within $30 of my current trade-in car payment which was a huge selling point for me.  Larry was able to negotiate the Redline racing stripe installation for me that was the icing on the cake.  I am thoroughly impressed with Larry Gillman's  professionalism,  courtesy, and willingness to negotiate a good deal.

842,"October 01, 2013","We were very pleased with the assistance provided to us by IPAC's employee Charles Hutchings during our recent vehicle purchase.  Although we selected the dealership because of its closeness to our neighborhood and ease of access for any future vehicle service trips, we were very surprised by how easy the process was this time around.  Our prior purchase experience at a local Kia dealership in 2006 left us with a very bad taste.  But our trip to IPAC was completely the opposite.  Our salesman was extremely patient with our constant inquiries, testing of numerous vehicles, listening to the spouses haggle over special features, and the bouncing back and forth in our choices of final vehicle.  His willingness to go back and forth to the office for keys to the numerous vehicles we tested was greatly appreciated.  He never lost his smile, and we never felt rushed.  When it came time to close out the paperwork, Annette in Finance kept her sense of humor when we had to completely re-do the paperwork because we had, again, changed our mind on the final vehicle at the last minute.

This place is shady right down to the GM.  I wonder what kind of incentive you offer to your employees to sell crappy maintenance plans that are not worth what you are charging.  I say this because even though we told your financial guy we were moving in less than a year, he told us that we could still use the plan no matter where we went.  LIES!  Also, think it is pretty shady that you don't give your customer the paperwork until the plates come in, hmmmm...could it be because you don't discuss ANYTHING with the customer.  I did not find the interest rate or number of years on my loan until we picked up the paperwork.  Shame on you and your company.

847,"September 25, 2013","The best part of the experience was Chad Tucker. He was very knowledgable about the vehicles and he was overall very pleasant. I had done all my research on my TWO trade ins and was ready to talk with this dealer about a new truck. 
Tucker met me when I came in on Saturday and we took another test drive. He then looked over my truck to get a trade in estimate. Then ran my credit score which was great. Then I met Mr. Jex. He is the numbers guy. He asked where I wanted to be on my payments and I told him. He took all the trade in information on my two vehicles and left.  When he returned he low balled me on my trade ins and wanted me to put down a lot of money. I questioned him over the tradein value and he gave me some BS and started showing me a lot of chicken scratch numbers that he had done. Since I was trading in two vehicles I asked how much he was offering for each and he would never say. I also asked about the interest rate I could get and he would never answer the question. He left again, then returned and offered me a little more on my trade ins. I told him that wouldn't work. He then told me that the only way I could get the payment I wanted was to look at a 2013. I said maybe I should wait until some more 2014 trucks came out. He then brought up another vehicle that Tucker and I had discussed and said he might could work  a deal on this one. After being there 5 hours and feeling like I had been put through an interrogation I gave in and made a deal. When it came time to give my down payment I asked if I could use the $200 dollar coupon towards the down payment. Tucker went to check and returned to tell me that it was applied to the discounts already. I said no one told me that. Tucker also gave me 8 gallons of gas. I said you mean after paying this much for a truck I don't even get a full tank of gas. He said the dealership no longer gives you a full tank of gas. I finally made it to the loan officer. I asked her about adding my wife to the title and she said someone should have asked me that earlier, she was alittle put out and said she would have to redo the some of the paperwork. I started signing documents and noticed she spelled my wife's name wrong. I brought this up and she seemed a little more put out. Long story short it was a very long day, I got low balled on my trade ins, I got 8 gallons of gas, but I did finally leave with a new truck.

848,"September 24, 2013","I recently moved to San Antonio from LA and came without a car.  After having a nightmare experience at Boerne Dodge trying to buy a Used Jeep Grand Cherokee, I thought I'd give the new option a look and see if I could make it work with my budget.  I found a few lower cost 2014 options in Ingram Park's inventory online and sent an email in explaining that I was planning on purchasing pre-owned in the $25k range but might be interested in considering a new option if the price was right.  Larry Gillman emailed me back almost immediately introducing himself and explaining what they had in inventory.  Two days later I went into the dealership to look at some of the model's Larry had been emailing me about, the entire time Larry is friendly, not pushy at all, and generally seems like a nice person.  A few hours later Larry and I had reached a deal on a new 2014 Grand Cherokee with modest, but still very nice options for right around $30k, the factory invoice on the vehicle.  Maybe modestly more than I had wanted to pay but I definitely feel great with my purchase and was very happy to give Larry my business.  I was incredibly impressed with his commitment to his customers, and even after he had made the sale, he helped me obtain the best insurance quote and followed me to the Avis rental agency all the way by SAT airport to deliver me the new vehicle.  When it was all said and done it was well past 10PM when Larry finally was able to go home, and he invited me back the next day to gas my tank up on the dealership and take me through a few more of the features in my new vehicle.

When I started calling dealerships to have them assist me in my search, Larry White from IPAC told me over the phone that there were two vehicles on his lot that were EXACT matches to what I wanted. When I arrived at the dealership two hours later,  Larry greeted me nicely and walked me over to the lot. When we arrived near the new grand cherokees, I asked him where the two were that matched what I wanted. He immediately started looking erratically in the windows to see  which ones were 4x4, when he couldn't find one that matched what I wanted, he started trying to dissuade me on buying a 4x4 saying things like ""c'mon man...do you really need four wheel drive?"" Long story short, he never found the vehicles he said he had on the lot. We ended up going back in his office and doing paperwork for the Jeep that he was going to, as he stated ""do all the legwork"" to find for me. He stated that he would search for a Jeep and call me soon. I called him the next morning and he rushed to get off the phone with me saying he'd call me back in a little bit. It's been 3 days since I was in the dealership and Larry has not once called my phone, even after he stated he would. From the lying to get me to go to the dealership, to trying to convince me to not buy the car I wanted, even though I'm planning to spend over $40k. My experience with this dealership and with Larry White was horrible. Another Jeep dealership in Boerne helped me find and secure a 2014 Jeep GC and it is on the way here to San Antonio.

862,"August 19, 2013","Some background to my review: I had paid off my 08 Charger on a Friday, and that next Saturday, totaled it. 

I knew I wanted another Charger, and decided to upgrade to an SXT with the Rallye and Nav package. In researching prices I came upon the TrueCar website. Basically, you put in what you want, with what features, and it will show you the local dealers who will honor that price. IPAC was one of the dealers, and as soon as I submitted my query, Frank Z sent me an email asking what exactly I was looking for. I replied, and he sent me a stock number to look at. Last Saturday, I went in with the expectation of having to haggle. I even brought my dad, who LOVES to fight and argue as my backup. 

I probably didn't need to bring him, which speaks very highly of the sales staff at IPAC. We walked in, asked for Frank (didn't have an appt.) and he remembered me from my email and took us out to look at the car straight away. He showed us two, I picked one and we went in to do the paperwork. I showed him the certificate, with the TrueCar price, which was $4,273 under MSRP and he worked it so that was the exact price the car was. 

We then went over to Annette in Finance, who was a dream to work with as well. Since I had totaled my previous ride, I have a sizable settlement coming in, but I didn't have it in hand yet. Annette said this was not a problem, and is holding a check until I let them know to cash it. She also worked out a FANTASTIC rate for me at 1.75%.

I can't speak highly enough of the staff at IPAC. Thanks guys!",5.0
863,"August 19, 2013","     I have been looking to purchase a Dodge Charger for the last several months.  We went to San Antonio just to visit but then we decided to just look to see what Chargers were available.  We looked on the internet and discovered IPAC so we decided to go there.  When we first got there we got out and started looking at the Chargers in the lot.  To our surprise, no one came out to help us.  We walked all through the lot and then decided to go inside to see if someone would assist us.

     We waited inside when Aaron Plunkett came in from the outside (it seemed as if he just finished helping someone else).  He greeted us and said he would assist us.  We explained to him what we were looking for and he was able to show us several other Chargers that we did not see.  He was also pointing out the differences in each one and explaining the cost.  When we located one that I wanted, he took us for a test drive and was very knowledgable about the vehicle and explained all the features thoroughly.  When we went back to the office, Mr. Plunkett worked with me and was able to get me to the monthly payment that I needed in order to purchase the vehicle.  Mr. Plunckett was courteous and professional and did an excellent job even staying after hours.

     I was very satisfied with the sale and the vehicle but it didn't stop there.  I was then introduced to Annette Arellano to finish up the sale.  She was also very courteous, professional, and efficient.  Not only did she get me through the process smoothly and offer the products I needed, she worked extra and informed me a couple of days later that she found an even better rate for me.  I am very pleased and thankful for the work that she did.

     Needless to say, my experience at IPAC was outstanding.  I am extremely satisfied and I am recommending IPAC to everyone else.

Tony always went above and beyond, making sure to answer any questions before and after purchasing a vehicle. We trust Tony, his opinion, and all the options he provides toward our desired vehicle. I can't say it enough Tony always follows through from start to finish, even at times answering via phone and text messages on days off. If anybody has had a bad car buying experience go to Tony he puts the fun back in the car buying experience that so many other associates take out.

901,"March 19, 2013","Amanda was a great salesperson.  She really wanted to sell us the car we needed--she didn't try to oversell us, but she made sure we understood our options.  She listened when we told her which features were important to us and which were unimportant, and she spoke to that when we talked about any vehicle.  She seemed eager to make a sale we all could feel good about.  I particularly appreciated having someone whose approach was that I, as the buyer, was the expert on what I wanted, and that her job was to show me all the different ways I could get that, rather than implying that I was in over my head.

A manager (it may have been Walter) worked with us on the price when we really were not interested in haggling but needed to bring down our monthly payments a bit.  Phillip was the one who dealt with our financing, and he was both clear and fast.  Financing a car always takes forever, but we got right through it.

I took a half day vacation and went there which was very far but he said it would be worth the trip.  I took my husband who is handicaped and it is very hard to get him around but if he had what he promised and a good deal as it is end of the month so they would be very aggressive to make us the best deal around..  When we arrived not only did he not have the vehicle he said he had but then tried to sell us another vehicle we really did not want.  He said he could get us a great deal so I asked what the price was and he would not give us a number just that they would work with us on it.  That sent some red flags because I want to know that informaion before we start serious discussions.  He never would tell us and sent in the finance man and he said it was $27,999 and then would not give us a fair price on our trade in.  When I got home I went online and looked up the vehicle and it was listed for only $23,949 so he tried to add an extra four grand to the price. Before he sent in the finance man I asked our salesman to look up the price on his smart phone and he said he could not find it listed which was a lie.  I could not beleive that they would not give us any prices on any vehicles only that they would work with us.  I feel we were brought in on false pretense and he never had the vehicle he said he did.  Did he think we would not look up the price to see if we were being treated fairly?  Very dishonest and I will never deal with that company and will advise everyone I know to stay away.

He listened attentively to my needs in regard to the type of car I was looking for. He met and then exceeded my expectations by finding the perfect fit for me.Larry is very knowlegable and professional in his approach.

We filled out all the paperwork with finance, set up payment arrangement only to be told a week and a half later that we were being re-contracted.  Re-Contracted meaning we either had to put down $1500 to KEEP original payment arrangements or leave at no money down put our payments would go up another $34 and our interest rate was going up as well.  We obviously were upset as to why we were not informed sooner and the Sales Manager said they did try to reach us, and we informed him that the first time we received a phone call was 5 days after we turned in loaner car and picked up our vehicle.  Basically we were told we had three option, pay $1500 down payment, put no money down and have our rate and payments go up or leave the car....we chose to leave the car.  We were so upset that we were deceived and treated like second class citizens I will never recommend IPAC again.  This is very upsetting to both my family and I due to between my parents, my brother and his wife, and my own family we have purchased 5 different vehicles from IPAC in the past 12 years with the most recent being a 2012 Chrysler Town and Country which my mother was also disappointed with the customer service.

Ok then they want me to pay the price of the truck in full before it was even inspected. I said i would put a 500 dollar payment and thats it. After three days they say that this truck has problems. Ok i said then i would like to cancel the deal. The gm calls and says he would call me back and doesn't. I go to the dealer and i cant get a refund until tomorrow due to the business center being close. Then the seabolt guy says to leave him the receipt and he will get it for me and i can pick it up tomorrow. Over all this was a very shady deal, they want money for a vehicle that you cant drive and then they dont want to give you your money back. Through all just a bunch of lies.

915,"February 20, 2013","First of all this was our second visit buying a vehicle from IPAC.  Our 2nd visit was not to buy but to get our first vehicle serviced that we had just purchased 3 months ago.  When we spoke to Annette in financing department, she informed us we could upgrade to another vehicle.  From there she introduced us to our new saleman Rob Sumter.  Rob who sold us a 2013 Dodge Avenger was very helpful from the beginning.  He acted like a friend and not like a salesman.  He took his time in showing us the vehicles.  One thing we liked about Rob was that he told us it was about us and not about him making a sale.  He did not pressure us and we didn't feel pressured.  We had a ready great experience the 2nd time around.  Rob told us to feel free to call him no matter what and Johnny Sias was good in getting the price down to where we where comfortable with.  Annette in financing was also very helpful with our paperwork, making recommendations on our warranty and explained everything that we did not understand.

We are very satisfied with our new Dodge Avenger!

We will not hesitate in recommending IPAC to anyone or Rob as a salesman.  Rob and Annette made it possible for us to own a new vehicle.  Something we could enjoy for a long time and feel safe for our whole family.

Initially, Larry kept frequent contact with my husband, texting him images of vehicles we might be interested in purchasing.  That was really helpful since my husband and I both work full time.  He allowed us to ""shop"" while working!  He also did a great job, selecting cars that were a perfect match for my husbands requests.  Once we actually visited the lot, he was immediately available, took us for a test drive.  When we heard a less than desirable sound coming from underneath the car, he let us know that he would put it in the shop immediately to find out what was wrong with it.  He didn't pretend like he didn't hear it or that it was no big deal.  He was not pushy, annoying or condescending when we said we wanted to visit a few more dealerships.  When we came back to the dealership that afternoon to make the purchase, he made us feel comfortable and didn't make us wait while he ""pretended to work his magic"" with the sales manager (as experienced with other dealerships in the past).  He sat with us, never making us wait alone in an office for more than 10 minutes or so.  Because our car wasn't going to be ready, he arranged for us to use a loaner car to avoid any inconvenience.

IPAC also adds items to the vehicle like scotchguard, locking wheel lug nuts, etched windows,recovery tracking etc; raising the cost of each vehicle $1500 before you even look at them. This added cost is not disclosed on their web site, nor can you refuse the extra items since they add them before you even see the vehicles. They also didn't seem to be giving the same discounts as other Dodge dealers.. I went to another dealer and received $2500 more for my trade, didn't have to worry about dealer add-on's (which really are a waste of money for the consumer and a big money maker for the dealer...) and we purchased a very simulair 2013 Caravan for less cost.

The IPAC service department was outstanding in maintaining the car. When we decided to get a new Town & Country Larry Gillman from the IPAC sales department did a wonderful job in guiding us through our search and decision process. His superb care lead us to become the proud owners of another Town & Country. We appreciate knowing IPAC will give us and the car the best of care.

931,"January 15, 2013","Problems receiving vehicle requested, but eventually was able to obtain a vehicle i liked. Justin was very helpful and friendly. He did everything he could to make sure i was satisfied at the end of transaction. Daniel at first was very helpful, but toward the end almost seemed once papers where signed could care less about me and customer service went out of the window. He also had argument with my friend who took to me to pick up vehicle. I was given a ""window sticker"" to review for vehicle to be picked up from different city. Not knowing there was a 8.4 unconnect system option with no navigation option, and that the 1.4 liter engine was available on a non-rallye version of the dart, i agreed on the vehicle since everything else matched my needs. When car arrived after the vehicle was driven 500+ miles, it was a sxt not rallye, and no navigation, again, not knowing there was a 8.4 uconnect/nav option. The whole reason i wanted the touch screen was for the navigation, and could car less about satellite radio or a back up camera. I signed the papers wiling to deal with the fact not rallye since liked vehicle and had engine and rims i wanted. Once Justin was helping me set up the bluetooth to the vehicle, inquired about how to use navigation since didnt see on touch screen. This was when justin went inside to check the ""window sticker"" that i had viewed. However, no ""window sticker"" was brought just daniel jex. At this point was where daniel tried to make it seem like it was my fault since i reviewed the ""window sticker"" rather then trying to work with me to find a solution. I was paying alot for this vehicle and wanted to make sure vehicle i liked since will be my form of transportation for many years to come. This was the point and time i began to call my mother who knows many people at the lot, and my uncle sits on their board of directors, to see what action i should take. While i was on the phone daniel and my friend began to argue and it got to the point where daniel took the keys from me and said we just wont make a deal on the vehicle. Once this took place i spoke with bob ralph and explained the situation with the vehicle. He and justin did everything they could to try to fix the problem and assist me. The where able to find me a rallye dart, with NAVIGATION, sunroof, and upgraded speaker system in San Antonio for me, not the color i originally ordered (but liked red car also), and didnt have the same black color seats i liked (but still nice color grey), also had about 150 more mile then red one (~800 miles when i got vehicle). The very next day i was able to pick up the new vehicle from the lot and all was well. I love the vehicle and it has every option i could possibly need.",4.4

I was impressed with the customer service I received from Walter Koch and Amanda Guzman.  Walter also impressed my boyfriend who in turn forwarded the information regarding the vehicle to me.  Walter immediately called me and we set up a time for me to come in.  Amanda took over from that point and also offered great service.  I was very pleased with her and everyone else I came into contact with from the time arrived at IPAC until the time I drove off with my new vehicle.  Since thein Amanda has gone above and beyond to answer questions and provide follow up information.  I deal with vendors and sales people on a daily basis and am not easily impressed.  Your employees at all of the delearships should be commended for thier friendly non-aggressive customer service.

933,"January 03, 2013","I stopped into this dealership while I was looking for my new car.  My salesman, Chad Tucker was great.  Took his time to show me the vehicles I wanted to see, even in the rain.  I was very direct about what I wanted and how I was going to finance my vehicle.  Chad respected my wishes and was very professional.  Daniel Jex only talked to me briefly but the short time spent was comfortable and he seemed willing to help.  

Dealing with the finance manager, Phillip Espinoza, felt rushed.  He fired off forms at me at a ridiculously fast rate and hit me with &amp;quot;sign here, sign here, sign here&amp;quot;.  Mr. Espinoza, while professional, really didn't seem to care either way about my purchase.  Probably because I brought my own financing.  When my wife went back to sign the paperwork later he told her &amp;quot;don't worry about what your signing, he already read it&amp;quot; referring to me.  I understand that most car dealers make their money on financing, but I still feel that I should have been treated with a little more respect.

Overall my experience was pretty good but the finance department kept this rating at a 4 rather than a 5 across the board.  If I could rate individual departments sales would get a 5 and the finance department would get a 3.

Going forward I will probably shop somewhere else the next time I am in the market for a new car.  The probability of me recommending this dealership to friends or family is also pretty low, probably around a 2, just because I don't want someone else to feel pressured.

934,"January 02, 2013","Worst experience after the sale. Finance department did not mention options that we could opt out of, incorrect spelling of our address on contracts, shady financing (asked numerous times about interest rates, no response), also lied about service contract and told us it was valid at any dealership when only availabe at IPAC. Sales manager never called back when he stated he would. Have not heard from our salesmen since sale. 

Nice customer service after the fact from Lorna Stevens, who was a great help and got our refund done quickly as promised.  GM, Wes and Bob were both accessible and listened to why my husband and I were upset. Even though I dont' think anything can be done to change my opinion about the dealership, I am glad that both GM's took the time to listen to what happened, and I hope that they make the changes in they need to.  

I would suggest going here, they have great jeeps that you cannot find at other dealerships.  I would just tell you  not to trust your finance person and don't be afraid to ask questions.  Look at everything carefully.  I should've known it was too good to be true and asked the questions and gotten the answers I wanted to. ",1.8

After submitting the request online for pricing Ashley Mendoza called within 5 minutes and offered any assistance we might need.  Later in the day we decided to make the 60 mile trip to view vehicles.  Ashley had left for the day and we were referred to Larry Gillman who handled the transaction and completed the sale.

Larry and the whole IPAC team were great and worked hard to get our business.  Larry saw my defensive posture due to other ""New Car Dealer"" experiences and quickly let me know that his philosophy is to treat every customer the same way he would like to be treated.  The ""GOLDEN RULE"" approach was much appreciated and after a few hours a great deal was made on a new Jeep.

941,"December 08, 2012","     Ms. Amanda Guzman made me feel very comfortable throughout the process that led me to purchase my 2013 Jeep Compass. Ingram Park was my fourth Chrysler/Jeep dealership that I had visited. The other dealerships just wanted to sell me a vehicle and nothing else. They were OK, but nothing like the comfortable and professional atmosphere that Amanda brought to every meeting we had that led to the final deal and sale. I was looking for a new Jeep for over four years and almost decided to wait another year, but Amanda and Ingram Park Chrysler/Jeep made it happen. It's always a tough choice to make a decision to choose a new vehicle over your current vehicle (2002) which is performing well and is paid for. Amanda guided me thru the new selection, the trade-in process, the finances and incentives in a fair and balanced way. I had all of my own concerns considered and approved all the way until the finel paperwork was signed.
              With the help of Mr. Daniel Jex in the final stages of the sale, Amanda made this a very pleasant and successful experience for me. I believe I received the best deal I could have gotten anywhere and I look forward to the great service after the sale. Besides, with the short time I have had this vehicle, I love this Jeep Compass. Thanks again, Amanda.

When I arrived I got to talk to Walter who is a blast and was introduced to Amanda.  Both are great, outgoing and very personable.  It is nice to meet people that you can immediately feel like you form a bond with and both are extremely ready to put the customer at ease and do all they can to find the particulars of a customer's needs and try to answer them.

He was very professional and listened to my concerns and understood what I was looking for and what I wanted to spend. He knew that the information I gave him was solid and what I could and could not afford. He did not push anything on me just showed me what I was interested in.

HE EVEN DROVE WITH ME to the dealership that had my trade-in to MAKE SURE they didn't try to pull something over on me and made sure they gave me the keys to my old car. This really went above and beyond his spirit to serve me, and it was good knowing I had someone who had my back the whole time.

No one would claim resposibilty and even suggested that I should go to other dealerships for my oil change. Such as; like I have removed them from auto and left these items at home or that someone else in my family had removed them. I informed that I am a single woman and no one else drives my auto. These items such as the safety bag with items for emergency sitations I carried in my trunk all the time. Other personal items such as my sunglasses, my windshield sun visor, and other items were missing. Anyone that owns a auto carries personal items in their auto which remain in your vehicle.

While I am happy with the deal I received on the vehicle I purchased I felt a little unsure that none of the 3 vehicles that I had seen online that brought me into the store were available on the lot. I was told that they had plenty, so many that the internet sales rep could't find the information on that precise model, but insured me and I quote ""if you saw it online then that is what we have."" I also did not like that the ""service contract"" was not even mentioned until the finance part of the transaction. I may have felt different about it had it not been ""tacked on"" at the end of the transaction after we had already settled on a price for the deal. I was also told that I had 24 hours to decide on the contract and was only offered one type of contract when in actuality there are several options to choose from and 4 years or 48000 miles to purchase one. I was also told that the price would be more if I chose to purchase it in cash versus financing it with my vehicle. I did not like that considering that the service contract is a 3000 dollar option and when financed at 4% is 3120 dollars and increases the monthly payment significantly. Everyone seemed very friendly, and accommodating. I thought the sales manager telling me to keep the additional 600 dollars that I was willing to put down on the car to make the deal happen was a bit rude, and that I should make the deal that benefits me in the long run.",4.3

I just came back stateside from serving six years overseas in Germany including two tours to Iraqi, one Afghanistan, and am just back in town for leave before I go carryout my orders as a Drill Sergeant.  So, I take my car in for regular services and Darwin sees me looking at a truck.  As soon as he introduces himself you could tell he is genuine good people.  I wasn't even looking at buying my truck at this time at less not for another year or two but him being family orientated, he worked it to get my Family and me the best deal I have ever seen.  So now I can say I'm a proud owner of my 2012 Ram 1500 (HEMI 5.7 liter) which the family and I have already enjoyed down at the lake fishing and etc.  The way Darwin treated us keeping our best interest in mind ensuring we are happy gave us that Family feeling, and when he said something he made it happen.

1082,"April 27, 2012","After visiting a couple of dealerships I decided to go with IPAC for my purchase.  I decided to do this despite the fact that the other dealership had a slightly better deal.  I purchased from IPAC because of customer service.  Tony Ruiz was my main point of contact and I could not have asked for a better salesmen.  He was very honest and straight-forward from the beginning.  He didn't try to play the dealer games nor did he put pressure on me to buy immediately.  I very much appreciated that.
Walter and Frank were also very friendly and personable.


I will say that upper management was a little difficult to deal with when I presented them with the offer from the other dealership.  Same truck with almost exactly the same options but with 4000 miles (theirs) vs brand new (the other guy).  They wanted to charge me the exact same amount as a new truck.  It was like pulling teeth to get a deal but we got one done.  Long story short, stick to your guns and you should be able to work something out but I would recommend going to another dealership to compare prices first.

Overall, although I didnt feel as if I got the absolute, bottom line best possible price, their customer service made up for the difference.

However, this was not the case. We told him what we wanted and we where given exactly what we asked for. Just two days before when we where at Ipac Nissan and they completely wasted or time and after two days they gave up on us and told us they could do nothing for us. Disappointing to say the least. We are extremely grateful we ran into Darwin and he really took the time and effort to give us exactly what we wanted. We both feel he went above and beyond what any car dealer in San Antonio and Houston Texas had done for us. I am recommending him to my family and friends.

At the end of the day we walked In with the idea of a challenger, but left with a jeep wrangler opening our minds to a new experience. These gentlemen deserve a lot of credit and these are not just words coming from anyone it's from a loyal and now repeating costumer.

1124,"February 24, 2012","I came to the dealership and was introduced to Darwin Gomez.
I have been at many dealerships and have had sales associates that were very pushy just to make a sale. I was looking at the new cars and even brought someone else with me who wanted to purchase. Mr. Gomez was very accomodating and was very interested in listening to why I was there, what information that I wanted to know about the cars and did not feel pressured at all. He was there for the customer and the feeling of not hurrying me was a plus in my book. Usually sales associated are pushy, try to make a sale and after a while, they tend to either dismiss themselves to go to another customer whom they think might buy; but not Mr. Gomez. He listened, was attentive, professional, curteous and felt that he was a relative or that he treated me as though I was a family member. I really felt as though I was part of a dealership that treated me like family or the way that they want to be treated if they were in my shoes.
I would like to say that I was very impressed with this gentlemen, for he made the differance in wanting to come back and purchase cars from him. My husband and my daughter love jeeps and know that we will come to the dealership knowing that Daniel, the manager, introduced us to an employee who is an asset to the dealership at Ingram.
I use to be District Mnager of a company and I will certainly tell you that if he was my employee, I will give me a good position in the company, for he truly knows how to effectively communicate with people and deal with their concerns and their need.
I am in psychology now and can appreciate the psychology that goes into selling.
I commend this dealership very highly and am happy that Mr. Darwin Gomez is part of your sells team. I would highly recommend this dealership, but also recommend Mr. Gomez very highly to my friends and family, for I was very impressed with his manner of handeling his customers with the upmost of respect and how he represents the company for whom he works for. A big thank you and will definitely come back especially knowing that I can count on him to be honest and taking care of me as a customer now and in the near future.",5.0

The sales team at Ingram Park Chrysler Jeep Dodge of San Antonio worked very hard to negotiate a deal with my credit union which in the end left me dissatified and I told all of them that I don't the SUV. This team then decided to work with me directly. At first I hesitant to work with them because I felt that without my Credit Union backing I would be taken advantage of, but Mr. Sias assured me that this would not happen. I told him what my credit union said they could do for me and if they could not match or do better then I would not I would purchase the vehicle. What must be noted is that I had never seen this kind of vehicle at all so it was completely an unknown to me. When I next heard from Mr. Sias he said that he and his team work very hard to give me every discount they could to match my Credit Union's preposal. I was impressed so much so that I made the trip to they're location the next day to closed the deal. We met with several dealers to include the General Manager Bob Ralph who all made us feel so unique and special. I was also met by Mr. Maurice who explain to me what took place to bring about this phenomenal deal that made me and my wife very happy. He gave us a minitour of the plae and went over ever feature of this SUV. We purchased the 2012 Dodge Journey which had a hugh amount of features which was jaw droppers to me because I thought this would be a basic vehicle with maybe only one nice feature at best.

I had called Danny and explained to him that I was currently at the time in a bit of a financing dilemma with another dealership (which by the way was Danny's former place of employment) trying to get approved but that something minor from my divorce was a small obstacle that wouldn't let me get financed from them. Danny then talked to his manager Daniel and he had Scott step in and help us out, as Danny was tied up with a previous engagement and wasn't able to be there at the time when my girlfriend and I showed up at the dealership. Not only did Scott help make the deal happen, but the little problem that had come up from the financing dept. at the other dealership wasn't a factor and never brought up, and the payments fell within our budget! Financing dept. was awesome to work with and helpful. Cudos to Scott, Danny and everybody involved in our purchase of a brand new 2011 Dodge Ram 1500 Hemi single cab truck, which only had about 17 miles on it when I drove it off the lot and been lovin' driving it ever since! I never once had any doubts from Danny, as he had put my girlfriend and I in a brand new 2011 Dodge Caliber just exactly one year ago today, and just knew that the time was right to let him do it all over again.

1144,"January 17, 2012","Matt was great!  He was very friendly and very helpful.  My lower score on the overall experience has to do with a finance representative; nothing to do with Matt in sales.  I believe the finance representative's name was Victor. I am unsure because he did not leave his card with me. After getting my paperwork and looking over it a few days later, I found a service contract for $550 for oil changes that he completly did not mention when buying the car.  When I called to get an explination from him, he put me on hold for well over 5 minutes when another representative picked up.  She indicated he was with a customer!? I let her know I had already been speaking with Victor and he had placed me on hold...how could he be sitting with another customer?  She interupted them and came back with a half explination that I did not actually pay the fee (though it was in my itemized bill)because he gave me a lower interest rate.  At this point, between being placed on hold several times from three different representatives, I had been on the phone for 20 minutes.  I let her know I was upset with the entire situation and wanted to hear from HIM exactly what I did or did not pay for.  She said he would call me back later that day.  In the mean time I called the number on the oil change service card to find out I had free oil changes.  I looked over the paper work and found my monthy payment was the same and the interest rate a bit lower.  All of this would have been fine and I am smart enough to understand, if he would have just MENTIONED it in the meeting!  Now it is two weeks later and I still have not heard from him.  I would think spending over $35,000 would atleast warrent a call back. Overall, this was a horrible customer service experience!

TONY IS ONE OF THE NICEST CAR SALESMAEN I HAVE MET. HE GOES OUT OF HIS WAY TO ASSIST YOU BUT AT THE SAME TIME NOT TRY TO FORCE YOU INTO A SALE YOU MAY NOT BE READY FOR OR WANT.

1178,"September 02, 2011","I am new to purchasing a vehicle via internet sales but I am confident this will be the way I purchase our family vehicles in the future.  The level of customer service I received was exemplary and should be the standard to which service in any field is held.  Any question or concern that I had throughout the entire process, whether through email or telephone, both Walt and Len were always available to answer, assist, explain and most of all instill confidence in me as a consumer making a purchase through other than traditional brick and mortar methods.  Although I live in Missouri I felt confident in doing business with both Walt and Len thanks to their friendly positive attitudes no matter what small concern I had or time of day I had it.  Walt even called to see how my son did in Tee-ball!  They ensured every detail was taken care of and I can honestly say the price we paid couldn't be matched by the local dealer in my area.  Overall I was extremely content with the level of service and overall quality of work with the internet sales department and my family thanks Walt and Len. ",5.0
1179,"August 25, 2011","Our treatment when buying a pre-owned Chrylser 300 was excellent. The staff we worked with was very professional, very courteous, and worked with us throughout the entire process. Rob and Alex were our sales associates. BOth were very personable, very efficient, and very professional. There was no bait & switch, just straight up taking care of business. The sales manager, daniel, was very professional, worked out the pricing to fit our budget and was very professional. The finance person, Phillip, was also very professional. No B.S., presented all of our options, got what I feel is the best interest rate, and basically worked with us throughout the process. Overall, it was a great experience. I would definitely recommend IPAC Dodge, Chrysler to anyone who would ask. Great experience.",4.8
1180,"August 23, 2011","Dear Mr. Ralph,

No doubt you remember me. We talked about several issues regarding the brakes on our 2009 Jeep Patriot.

Lloyd Chrislip was able to pinpoint the cause of excessive noise in the brake pedal and had it replaced. He worked with the parts department to see that the correct parts were sent.
Design changes in replacement parts and revised brake light switch mounting and wiring changes hampered a quick resolution. Taking a picture of the old pedal assembly and sending it to the parts warehouse was an innovative idea.

The result is we are now satisfied customers. My Son will soon be in the market for a new Dodge truck. We intend to shop your dealership first.

June asked me to thank you for helping her with the backup camera. It has removed dangerous blind spots. She feels relieved to backup with no fear of injury to pedestrians or property.

1186,"May 13, 2011","Very upset with my purchase at this dealership all i get is the run around and bs excuses. They screwed up the paperwork with the wrong vin number so i could not make a payment to the finance company ally. It has been a hassle dealing with ipac and the finance company ally, I will never buy anything in the future from ipac and will let everyone know the hassle and stress I have had to go through and will not recommend them to anyone. After all the mess and stress it has been about 2 months and i still can't make a payment and keep getting ""they will call you back""  and "" there is nothing else we can do it's out of our hands"" it's complete crap. It's just a major screw up n ot only did we have to re-do the paperwork after already buying the car, but then pac never sent the new paperwork into ally so it turned into this huge nightmare...just no service after the sale and never owned up to the issue that it is their problem they messed up, I'm just so mad and buyers please beware, if they cat get the most critical information correct (the vin number) how can you trust a company like this? It just made the buying experience horrible and i just hope this doesn't happen to any other customers. I'm in the customer service business and when we screw up we own it and take care of the customer, ipac on the other hand never offered me anything to help me out or take care of me. I can't believe that with the economy how it is and customer service being so scarce now almost anywhere, they truly do not understand that word to mouth advertisement is by far the best and they will lose tons of business for making me a very unhappy customer. Not to mention the other 20 to 30 bad reviews on the net i will be giving them, and a complaint to the better business bureau.

1187,"May 01, 2011","When I went to the dealer on April 29th, I went in response to a call that I qualified for some type of special promotion. I also went prepared to be disappointed. Instead of being disappointed, I drove away in a brand new Dodge Avenger. I honestly did not think I would be able to get a car, but the salesman, John Coronado, and the finance manager whose name I do not recall, worked with my wife and I and we left with a car. Last year, I went to another dealer twice in the space of a few months, and all they told me is there was no way they could get me into a car. And that is honestly what I fully expected to hear this past Friday. The people at Ingram Park Auto Center turned what I expected to be a frustrating, even embarrassing experience into an enjoyable one. They were very friendly, very helpful, and determined that I left not only satisfied, but happy. This is the fourth car in a row I have purchased from IPAC. My wife purchased her car from IPAC before were were married, so we have a long history with them.

1189,"February 18, 2011","I went to this dealership from a used Infiniti that I saw online.  When I got there the vehicle I got there was available and just as described.  I was helped by a sales guy by the name of Charles H.  I don't remember his last name.  He wasn't with the internet, but I did run into the internet guy.  I was given an appraisal for my trade without them driving it or even looking closely at it.  With the little experience I had in purchasing a vehicle I was okay with this at the time.  I was given the Infiniti to drive for the day to think about it.  I was told from my parents to go look at a new Honda Accord before making a used car purchase.  I went to go find Gunn Honda and couldn't find it. ( I was new to San Antonio).  I ran into the Gunn Infiniti.  One of the salesman at Gunn Infiniti came out and I asked him where their Honda store was and he asked me why I would want to go there if I was in an Infiniti.  I told the sales guy my situation and he came out and looked at the car.  I told them what Ingram Park was giving me for the car and my trade.  He told me that they were asking way too much and told me to get my trade and bring it back and let them look at it.  I then went to Ingram Park to get my keys and they told me that my &amp;quot;salesman&amp;quot; went home for the day and took my keys with him so that no one would mess with my truck.  I told them that I needed my keys.  They &amp;quot;claimed&amp;quot; to call him and he didn't answer.  They said he lived 30 minutes from town and to just keep the car and come back the next day.  I bought it and went home and went back the next day.  After talking with the Gunn Infiniti sales guy he gave me advice on what kind of price I should get for the used Infiniti.  I went in the next day and my sales man was there.  I told him that I wanted my keys back because they were asking way too much for the Infiniti.  The sales guy showed me another Infiniti that they had just got in.  I looked at it and had negotiated a good deal according to the salesman at Gunn Infiniti.  That salesman was very polite and helped me get a good deal on my used Infiniti even though I wasn't buying from him and I was buying at IPAQ.  Well I was military and when I brought my &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; used car to base the gate guard told me that I didn't have an inspection sticker on my car and I had to bring it back to the dealership.  I noticed the wheels were shaking while braking.  I took it back to my salesman and told him that I was missing an inspection sticker and that my brakes were bad.  The sales guy told me that my brakes were fine and didn't understand why my brakes were bad.  So I sat in the Service department for 8 hours while they found out that my wheels were missing a lug nut on all wheels and my rotors were through my brakes.  They tried to get me to pay for it.  I told my salesman that I wanted my truck back if they were going to make me pay for it because I didn't even have it 24 hours.  After much debate they fixed my brakes and front rotors.  (Found out later that they only replaced the front brakes and didn't touch the back brakes).  I also found out that they had already sold my truck and thats why the fought me when I asked for my truck back.  I will NEVER go to this dealership again.  I recommend everyone steers clear of this dealership.  I took all the IPAQ advertisements off my car and went to Gunn Infiniti for service.  Even though I had bought my car somewhere else Gunn treated me like I bought it with them.  Check out the Gunn dealerships....that is where I am going to go for my next purchase.",2.0
