0,"May 27, 2015","I was interested in an Aston Martin advertised in Aston Martin of Dallas. I reached the dealer to purchase the car by phone and subsequently drove to Dallas to check out the car and finalize the deal. The dealer sales GM was nothing but a fake person to just talk and no show, He didn't responded to many phone calls and emails after we supposedly reached the deal and he was supposed to revise the sale order and send to us. We drove to Dallas from Houston and spent couple of hours discussing the deal, and he made a lot promises and bashed other dealers. I would not recommend this dealership and I am very happy that he back out from deal, otherwise the after sale services would have been disaster.  ",1.0
1,"January 03, 2015","Thanks to Josh Ingram we had an extremely pleasant car buying experience.  We began the process then needed to take a little time away from the project to celebrate a birthday out of town.  Josh was very patient with us and picked right up where we left off.  We appreciate that he has quickly and thoroughly answered all questions we've had about the car.  Thanks so much Josh, we really love our new Vantage!",5.0
2,"September 24, 2014","Both Josh Ingram and Chris Johnson were very helpful throughout the entire process.  My wife had a requirement that I needed to fit a child seat in the back of whatever I bought, so Chris spent a lot of time researching child seats that fit in the back of a DB9.  The service was top notch, and they made the buying process easily.  I've been disappointed with many other local dealers in recent years, so it was a nice change to get such a great experience buying a car from Chris and Josh.  I would definitely recommend to anyone else thinking about an Aston Martin.",4.8
3,"July 26, 2012","I purchased a 2006 Aston Martin from the original owner a few months ago. Make a long story short the original owner lied/misrepresented the condition and history of the car. I was interested to find out if the misrepresentation had seriously affected the cars value. I called Aston Martin Dallas to ask for an appraisal of the car and was directed to speak with Chris Johnson Sales Director. I explained to Chris that I would like to have my car appraised and would like to know what the fee would be. He was curious as to why I needed it appraised and I explained the situation. He said he would call me back. I waited one week for him to return my phone call and finally called him back but this time left a voice mail reminding him that I was still waiting for information on the appraisal. I waited another week with no word from him and decided to call him again. This time I was fortunate that he took my phone call. He made no apologies for not returning my call or calling me for the past two weeks and instead arrogantly questioned my motives while hinting that I intended on filing a frivolous lawsuit against the original owner. Again he told me he would look into the appraisal and call me back which to this day 2 months later never happened. The entire experience was insulting and displayed a lack of character on Mr. Johnson's part. My request for a paid appraisal is not out of line, but he simply had to say that it is not a service that his dealership offers instead of running me around for more than two weeks and then being condescending.",1.0
4,"January 27, 2009","Very good experience leading up to and buying new Aston. Informed, reasonably balanced re sales ""pitch"" and informed about their product. Good communications and did everything they could to make the experience positive. 
Facility, while not in a great Dallas location overall, is modern, clean, well laid out and upscale. Service shop appeared well managed, clean and professional. 
Dealership appears to have plenty of onsite and offsite inventory, to please most tastes. 
Very good overall experience. I highly recommend. ",4.8
