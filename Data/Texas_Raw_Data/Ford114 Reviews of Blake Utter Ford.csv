4,"May 05, 2020","I felt awkward arriving at the dealership during the Covid 19 outbreak. Even though they were allowed to reopen their doors, I was unsure of how the experience would go. Not to worry. My salesman Robert Powell was very prepared and made the effort to insure our safety all through our time at the dealership. He had the vehicle I was interested in ready and waiting at the front door. He was polite, knowledgeable, and didn’t use high pressure tactics. We had a very good day at the dealership, and went home with our dream truck!",5.0

6,"April 30, 2020","Sold truck out from under me.   One star is too many but I guess that is the minimum rating.   I reached agreement on price via email on a Friday.  Late Friday morning, I was on the phone with salesman with my card out of my wallet to leave a deposit.  By Friday afternoon my bank's loan officer was working with the dealership's business manager to process paperwork.  Several iterations of back and forth (delays on their sid)e over next couple of days.  On Wednesday I was coordinating for travel and pick up when I got an email from salesman that the truck had sold through their sister dealership.  Unsatisfactory that they would  sell the truck  to an ""in person ""warm body over some guy in AZ "" (Saless managers words) despite fact that we had reached a good faith agreement.  Incompetent at best and unscrupulous at worst. Shop elsewhere!",1.0

30,"September 09, 2019","We were searching for a used vehicle and we're looking as far as Oklahoma City to find one. We finally found what we were looking for up in Denison Texas and decided to take the drive. Mark our sales rep at the dealership was first-rate. There wasn't any pressure he walked us through everything and even the valuated are trade-in. Most people are afraid of sitting down with the finance manager, but our finance manager was super. He didn't try to sell us anything that we didn't need or change the terms, and and when we said no he was fine with that -moved on. The credit terms were perfect the terms of the payments were perfect and overall I really can't tell you how good this dealership truly was. It has to be the people for sure. In the end buying a car is pretty stressful but Mark and the Blake Utter Ford team (salesman, car Porter, mechanic, front receptionist, and finance manager) made it very very painless. My wife and I would definitely do the 95 mile drive again to get this kind of service.",5.0

32,"August 13, 2019","The salesman was great to work with, appeared honest and knowledgeable. I do wish the purchase could have been completed in one day rather than have us return over 70 miles the next day to complete the financing piece of the purchase.",4.8
33,"July 30, 2019","Everything was great. The communication with Mr Burns was prompt and easy, the vehicle was waiting when I arrived, and the price was fair. I appreciate everyone at Blake Utter going the extra mile to make the process better.

Also, on behalf of a local school district, I want Bob and Blake Utter to know we greatly appreciate their involvement and support. Taking time out of the day to present student / athlete awards is a special service to our communities. Thank you! ",5.0

42,"April 15, 2019","This is the second car I bought from Blake Utter Ford in the last year and a day. BECKY was the sales rep for first purchase which was a cash transaction. Everything went great so when I needed another car I asked for Becky. Only problem, this time CHAD was involved. He said we did not qualify for 0%. But if we would agree to an insurance policy for $10 extra per month, he could get us 0%interest. I said maybe we need to visit the credit union. He immediately lowered it to $5 per month and we agreed. When we reviewed the Buyers order after leaving we discovered he had added $499 and $565 for two additional insurance policies in addition to the extra $5 per month, and had not credited the dealership discount of $1393 discussed with Becky. The Buyers Order was provided in an envelope given to us at the conclusion of the meeting. It was not shown during the meeting. We returned to the dealership the next day. Their position was, ""you signed a contract."" If you go to this Dealership ask for Becky, she is a great sales rep. but pay cash or arrange you own financing. If you deal with CHAD bring your accountant  or attorney.
ADDENDUM TO MY REVIEW. 
I talked with AUSTIN, I believe he is the sales manager.  The problem has been resolved. There was actually an additional problem that was discovered by AUSTIN. That problem was also resolved. My advise is Don't let your guard down because the Dealership has a good reputation. If something doesn't sound right and you get double talk, go to the boss before you walk out.",3.0

98,"December 01, 2017","1 Star Rating- Truck purchased on 30th of October 2017-Current Milage:2000
0.5=Kansas City Plant did a great job building the truck.
0.5= Ginger the owners dog provided us with the BEST customer service. 
Honorable Mention: The Cool guy in the service department that told us they fix issues the truck has under factory warranty all the time that the Sales Manager told us we’d get KICKED out of any Ford dealership for asking about fixing it. 

Summary
•	Sales Manager (Chris) DENIED having the truck WASHED so we could receive a clean truck!
•	No one at the dealership offered us a SEAT while we waited! 
•	Internet sale where all we had to do was verify the truck had no issues, sign, and leave. Arrived at 10am and did not leave with truck until 5pm! 
•	Rear USB Ports were loose & rattled while driving the 7 hour ride back home Chris REFUSED to fix it. Made a comment that any dealership would BOOT US OUT for asking them to fix it under warranty.
•	Rear USB Ports are currently loose & make rattling noises while driving especially on bumpy city roads.
•	Chris tried to make us take our deposit money back because we asked him to look at damages on the truck! This happened within 5 MINUTES OF MEETING HIM! 
•	Chris REFUSED to fix a paint chip on the edge of driver’s door and a scratch below driver’s door handle! Stated he’d “GIVE” us the touch up paint and we can do it ourselves or have a professional detailer do it for us! 
•	The paint chip, scratches, & full body swirl marks have been estimated by local professional detail shops to cost around $2500 to properly repair!
•	No one told/showed us how to use the Integrated Tailgate Step, nor how the BLIS System fully works.
•	Currently the right side BLIS (cross traffic/blind spot alert) unit is showing an on and off fault immediately after starting the truck!
•	The BRAKES are currently jumping when breaking in parking lot situations which seem that once again there were issues with this truck that this dealership either knew about and did not tell us or LIED about actually having their service department thoroughly check the truck before selling!
•	Finance Manger did not tell us about daily interest starting BEFORE 1st payment, told us interest starting AFTER 1st payment but was busy trying his BEST to UPSELL unwanted warranties. 
•	Felt like Chris tried everything in his power NOT to sale us the truck!
•	Poor (Hellish) customer service was given to the point where we felt as if we shouldn’t/Wasn't allowed to  be in the dealership and the employees there made us feel the same way!

101,"September 27, 2017","I came into the dealership with little to no hope of getting a car, but Blake Utter, especially Mark Edwards, helped me through the process.  I could not have asked for a better car buying experience.  I would highly recommend Blake Utter",5.0
102,"September 14, 2017","First, I would like to thank everyone involved with the purchase of my 2017 F150. Now, I will tell anyone reading this that Blake Utter Ford should be the dealership that you go to first to buy a vehicle. I drove from Baytown TX just to purchase from Blake Utter. I was a flood victim and all the dealerships here either flooded and was lying about it or they up marked their inventory. So, when I spoke with Kip, from the first conversation to the day that I showed up to buy my truck, He never lied or there was never any hidden fees or "" Well, something came up"" type crap. ",5.0
103,"July 14, 2017","If your looking to purchase a new or used ford.... Go see Mark Edwards at Blake Utter Ford. He was so generous and helpful. I didn't feel any pressure. He even came to Tom Bean to deliver my car. He's a great salesman who goes above and beyond to help provide you with what you looking for. A big shout out to Steve Garner in the Service Dept. for getting my new car cleaned and ready to go. Would also like to thank Chris in finance for making it happen.

Thank you for making me a part of the Blake Utter Ford family,

105,"May 04, 2016","I found a older lincoln towncar that I was interested in on the Internet from this dealer, Blake Utter Ford in Denison, TX. The person I dealt with was Brian Kinkade, a Sales Consultant. From begining to end Brian was polite & professonial. He really went the extra yard on everything to try & put the deal together for me. In the end we did not make the deal, but it was not because Brian didn't try his best. I'm a old timer & have probably bought 20 cars during my lifetime. I know, I know, I'm old. So I have a pretty good feel about salesmen. Even thou we never met in person & only talked on the phone, I got a good feeling I was dealing with a honest person. From time to time in life, you run across someone that is a pleasure to deal with. Brian was one of those. Utter Ford should be proud they have a salesperson like him. I would recommend Utter Ford Dealership to anyone, and to ask for Brian Kinkade to serve them. Thanks again Brian!

106,"November 06, 2015","I called and spoke to Austin and was told one price over the phone So  My son and i went there to test drive a car. The Pre owned Manager AUSTIN  was absolutely Horrible and denied ever speaking to me over the phone  . He didn't seemed like he wanted to even deal with us like we weren't good enough. We have known Mr Utter for a very long time my son and have been doing business here for many years . But over the Years this Dealership has gone to xxxx .. My Recommedation to everyone is if you can Please avoid this and go to MCKINNEY or DALLAS TO purchase your Vehicles where your business will be appreciated . And WE CAN""T DO IT OR NOT CARE TO DO IT is not the attitude . ",1.0
107,"April 06, 2015","Brad Kerrigan made the experience of buying a new car fun.  He answered every question, answered questions that we hadn't even thought of.  Will definitely come back when I need another car or truck.  Helped my step daughter get a Kia Soul, he's gone out of his way to make sure she understood everything.  ",5.0
108,"April 06, 2015",I had been looking for a 4x4 truck for a while and was beginning to lose hope. Luckily I dropped by the Bob Utter dealership and ran into Brad Kerrigan. He was courteous and professional but more importantly he listened to my needs. He found just the right used truck that was right in my budget. He really went over and above to make sure I had a great experience!,5.0
109,"March 25, 2015","I recently purchased my 3rd car from Bob Utter Ford, and Malcolm Ross has been my Go-To salesman every single time. Each time I have worked with him, he has proven time and time again why I love coming back to Bob Utter for all of my auto purchases. He works so hard each and every time to get me into a beautiful new vehicle, even when my credit has not been at its best... he is honest, friendly, expedient, and reliable. As a buyer, it makes me feel safe knowing that he has my best interest at heart, and not just the ""bottom line."" Bob Utter Ford should be proud to have someone like Malcolm representing their company. Thank you Malcolm Ross, yet again, for making my car buying experience stress free and pleasant... I LOVE my new 2015 Ford Escape! ",5.0

111,"March 23, 2015",Don was a great help while we were at the dealership looking to replace our 2 leases that were ending in a month. We were able to test drive the cars and go through financing and service in an afternoon and drive home with the 2 new cars. When my husband low tire light came on a week later they serviced it for free! Love this dealer! Highly recommended!,5.0
112,"November 22, 2013","I liked my sales guy.  He was the reason I went back to the lot.  He found the truck I was looking for in McKinney so I went up to buy.  When I finally got to the finance guy, Chad, that's when things fell apart.  He wouldn't let the sales guy go get the truck so I could see it.  Wouldn't explain the fiancé terms clearly, told me my trade was ""no good"", and until my trade got figured out, wouldn't quote me even what the interest rate would be through Ford (I was already pre approved thru my credit union at 1.74%).  He acted like he was doing me a favor, so I walked out, and bought my brand new Ford FX4 the following weekend at another dealership with absolutely NO hassle or games, no humiliation or haggle.  All for a better price and MUCH better experience.  I feel for the sales guy, he's the one paying for Chad's behavior and attitude.",1.0
113,"January 24, 2013","Sales staff extremely friendly. I had no problems with this dealership until I had to deal with the service department. I will in the future take my car elsewhere for repairs. However, buying my car was a breeze. I'd buy from them again. ",4.4
