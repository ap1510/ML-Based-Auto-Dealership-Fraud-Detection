Each time the process becomes easier and easier with Newton proactively compiling all the necessary paperwork ahead of time so when we come to collect the car we just need to sign papers with finance.  Newton makes buying a car very enjoyable and treats us wonderfully.
P.S. our daughter also purchased a vehicle from Newton and it was a very easy purchase.",5.0

24,"July 18, 2019","Staff is seemingly nice enough. Bought a used 2007 Ford Expedition here. Test drive went fine, so we purchased the car. On the way home from the dealership, brakes/wheels were smoking when I got home (20 mins away). We called the dealership and were told ""Brakes get hot. You test drove it and bought it without warranty"" and basically we are on our own. That's fair I guess and technically they are right, but when I buy from a dealership I expected a more responsible and accountable approach than that. 
Bought the car 6/26/19. Had to bring it in for repairs 6/27/19. Had to bring it in again for a different repair 7/5/19. And again 7/15/19 for a total of $1,197 in repairs. I brought this to the attention of the salesperson (Newton Rose) when he told me my plates were ready. His response was ""Ok"". 
So advising people to maybe buy a used car elsewhere. I can;t speak for their new car sales. ",2.0
25,"June 27, 2019","I have an older car, a 2001 Prius that is still in great shape, thanks to Toyota of Killeen. Their service rep that I deal with, Todd Sateren, Service Drive manager, has been one of the greatest contacts that I have ever had.",5.0

27,"March 19, 2019",Thank you Toyota of Killeen!  Rocky was extremely attentive and responsive to my needs both on the phone and in person while I was looking for a vehicle.  He is the main reason I returned the next day to purchase my Venza.  I was mostly shuffled to the side at a different Killeen dealership even though I had an appointment and was prepared and knowledgeable about what I wanted.  I attributed their attitude to me being a women shopping by myself.  Rocky and the staff at Toyota of Killeen welcomed me with their friendliness and prompt attention and follow up.,5.0
28,"January 20, 2019",Great customer service Awesome sales person clean facilities love the product. Also was fed and met a state Senator.

29,"January 14, 2019","It took only one phone call to Mr. Todd in your service dept. to resolve 3 vehicle-related problems.  1) fluid  leaking from & puddling under the front of my Tacoma, 2)  was scheduled to drive the Tacoma to meet 3 others in Austin w/trailer in tow in 48 hours and 3) no transportation while the truck was being repaired. Although assisting many other customers simultaneously, Mr. Todd confirmed all needed repair parts were on-hand, initiated and relayed multiple progress updates thru-out from the repairing technician in whom he expressed the utmost confidence and also, personally ensured this customer had a ride home from and back to the dealership.  As a direct result of Mr. Todd's diligence and skillfulness, 1) the engine's water leak was repaired and now runs even smoother, 2) completed the trip to Austin w/o delaying and 3) was provided courtesy transportation during repairs.  Mr. Todd deserves commendation for his dedication to excellence.  He is what ""right"" looks like. Please extend to him every consideration for time-off and cash awards that clearly communicate he is appreciated. ",5.0
30,"November 14, 2018","Had the family‚Äôs 2 Toyotas serviced recently at Toyota of Killeen and had the pleasure of working with Mr. Todd.  Although he was obviously busy with many others, he had our 2 vehicles in-and-out in less than an hour.  

At the time of drop off, in addition to the periodic servicing, asked him to inspect closely one of the vehicles to identify possible problem areas and any preventive maintenance items that might need attention before taking it on an extended road trip planned in 2019.  When picking up the vehicles, Mr. Todd conscientiously delineated problem areas found during vehicle servicing that, although not urgent, would need addressing before the planned road trip at the current rate of wear.  Additionally, having worked with Mr. Todd before, he remembered what was important to this specifically customer and insured their accomplishment.  

Mr. Todd deserves commendation and every consideration for time-off and cash awards, to ensure he knows he is appreciated and as incentive for him to remain there at Toyota of Killeen for many more years to come.

31,"November 13, 2018","I was highly recommended to you by a friend, who had a great experience working with you several years ago when they purchased their first vehicle and they are still driving the same car ten years later.

 

I wanted to take the time to say thank you for the assistance you gave me as a sales representative in purchasing the Toyota RAV 4 LE. I am truly thankful and satisfied with the car I bought from your dealership. You assisted me very well, with constant contact regarding options for me to select, staying after closed business hours, picking me up from the car rental agency and several other things that made my car buying experience hassle free. I was able to get the right car for me and my profession

 

Again, I want to let you know that I greatly appreciate the effort that you took in giving me great customer service, which is highly appreciated. 

I will be referring you to anyone  looking to purchase to new or used vehicle ",5.0
32,"October 24, 2018",I hadn't planned on actually going through with a trade but I couldn't pass up the rebates and deals. Main reason for trading my 2016 Ram out for a 2018 Nav4 Hybrid was the fuel efficiency. Corey helped me decide to go out of my comfort zone of trucks to the Nav and so far so good. ,5.0
33,"October 11, 2018","Where to start.  I guess first off I worked with with Rocky, dont do it.  I was in an accident and my Camry was totalled so I was in the market for a new car.  I went in on Friday 6 Oct and I was on a bit of a timeline because the insurance would only pay for the rental until Tuesday 9 Oct.  I was looking for a specific car which they ""found"" for me at a different dealer.  I was told they would ship it in and could have it in on Monday.  Rocky couldnt be in on Monday for personal reasons so he requested I come in Tuesday.  I called Monday night to make sure everything was still on track and that the car was there, I was told yes and it would be.  So Tuesday morning I returned my rental and was given a ride to Toyota.  When i got there Rocky said he was just ""looking for the keys"".  After sitting around for 30 minutes he finally came back and said the car wasnt there, that the other dealership had sold it.  What's so frustrating about it is that obviously they knew, or should of known, the car wasn't there before the day i was supposed to pick it up and they didn't bother to call or look for a different one or anything until i got there.  Also frustrating, I had already dropped off my rental because i wastold the night before everything was good to go.absolutly. Absolutely terrible service.  So incredibly frustrating.  They did nothing to make amends, and strongly recommend going somewhere else if you are in the market.   Forgot to mention I even put a deposit down on the car on Friday and we had already figured out all the #s.  Guess the deposit meant nothing to the good people at Toyota of Killeen.  Go elsewhere",1.0

69,"August 06, 2018","My husband and I entered the car buying search already knowing which vehicle we wanted, but we were still on the fence on what trim level. Toyota of Killeen was the first dealership we visited and Sam was the sales consulted that greeted us at the door, he was welcoming and knowledgeable with all questions that we had. We made it clear on that day we were not ready to buy since we just started our search and he never pushed the sale on us. We test drove a vehicle with Sam, and asked questions about the different trim levels. His answers helped us get a clearer view on which one we would choose in the end.  After that day we did visit other dealerships but never felt that personal experience we got from Toyota of Killeen and Sam. We began to contact him over email to get price quotes and he directed us to Rocky Price, the internet sales rep, to help us on that platform. Rocky too did not push on getting a sale right away, and was very quick to respond to our enquiries and never hesitated to answer us. Rocky was polite and knowledgeable as well about our questions and helped to smooth our transition into actually buying a vehicle. In just a few short days we bought our vehicle from this Dealership at a great price! No buyers remorse from us! Do not believe the rumors told about ""never buying from a Dealership in a military town"". Those at Toyota of Killeen are a small knit group that feels like family and make it their mission to make sure your car buying experience is stress free and you walk away happy with a new car! We will be using their services in the future for any of our needs!",5.0

81,"July 23, 2018","Have been looking for a used Mazda 3 for my son's first car.  Had some difficulty in the Austin area and found a nice 2014 with 70K miles within our budget at Toyota of Killeen.  Got in touch with salesman Newton Rose at the dealership and we set a time for me to come up from Austin for a test drive.  I was a little early on arrival and Newton got to me as soon as he could, and made me comfortable for the 10 minute wait.  When the car was brought up front for inspection I was very disappointed to see a softball size dent in the front bumper.  I immediately asked if that could be repaired as it was a deal breaker if it wasn't.  Newton checked with his manager and repair was approved.  I drove the car and a couple of things came up.  The sun visor clip fell out in my hand.  Not a big deal and not a deal breaker.  The second was a missing switch on the center console.  Newton and I both acknowledged this, and was going to be checked on.  
 The dent was going to be a couple of days so I went home and waited for Newton to let us know when the car was ready.  I started to research this model to determine what the missing switch on the console was for, and was disappointed when I thought it was a sport / economy button that can change shift patterns for a more spirited driving experience.  I notified Newton of this by email in bold text so he wouldn't miss it.  I didn't hear anything about this concern, and it was never acknowledged by Newton.   Fortunately as I kept researching I discovered this model of Mazda 3 does not have this sport mode button because it is an option.  That was good, because that would have been a deal breaker.  Kind of like a car with a missing overdrive button, that obviously has a serious mechanical effect on a vehicle.  What it actually was in this model is a shift lock switch so that the push button start car can be placed into neutral without the engine running.  In case a tow was needed or an engine out situation where the car needs to be moved.  Not a huge deal in that case...but I would have liked to have had it fixed if possible.   After the dent in the bumper was repaired Toyota of Killeen delivered the car to my wife's office in Cedar Park!  Over a 45 mile trip one way!  Nice!   Unfortunately again, the car showed up with a missing wheel cover..  Again not a big deal, as they are pretty cheap.  The next Sunday, yes I said Sunday.. Newton arranged for his boss who lives in Austin to deliver 4 brand new wheel covers to my house and they look great.    Would have been 5 stars all day long if the switch thing was at least looked at.  Overall outstanding customer service! And I will recommend Newton and Toyota of Killeen to anyone who asks.

This resulted in finding the clutch did not need replacing as my son originally thought   Mr. Monte's initiative and expansive knowledge of automotive systems ultimately resulted in saving my son over $1200. It is service advisors like Mr. Monte that keep me coming back to Toyota of KIlleen's service department.

188,"January 13, 2018","Overall I thought I had a great experience and I genuinely trusted the cars sales person. I had initially been quoted a no hassle price of $35,550 for my lightly used dodge ram 2500 diesel with an incentive of $1000 since the truck is very popular in the area and the state of Texas in general. When it was time to appraise the truck and work out a final price they told me the truck was not very appealing in this area and the high end of the pricing was $33,000, they would be willing to give me that. I was able to get the price to $35,000 as the sales person asked me to be ""reasonable with what I wanted"" since I initially wanted $37,000. Not wanting to stay at this dealership for 4 hours I decided to settle with $35,000. The very next day I see the truck listed at $39,900. So much for my truck not being very popular in this area. Needless to say I am not please with the deception at this dealership. If you are going to act genuine and upfront then actually mean it. DISAPPOINTED ",1.0

336,"March 06, 2017","Let me just say I hate working with dealerships that run off commission. I always ask the sales representative whether or not they run off salary or commission. Chances are, they run off commission and you can usually tell because they are pushy, adamant, and usually very irritable if things don't go their way. I have had dealers tell me half truths and only realizing when we started signing paperwork. With Rocky, we were never pushed into a decision, we were never pushed to take things out of our budget, we were never guilted to take additives, and we were allowed to change our minds without feeling like a burden to the representative (which might I add, we usually see a decline in service here because they probably feel like they will not make a sale). He's always straight forward with our questions and we never discovered any half truths and although offered, he never pushed anything that was more money for the company and not wanted by us. In short, he always understood the word no and then moved on. Now enough about Rocky, let me move on to the dealership. It is such a friendly environment. Everyone including Rocky was so accommodating of my 1.5 year old. There were Reps around every corner that would stop and play with her for a minute or two. They gave her balloons, crayons, talked to her, played with the balloon with her and personally gave her snacks just for her. Now keep in mind, I don't have a rambunctious child (well not yet anyways) but it did allow me to see the dealership as a whole just having that warm feeling. I never got that ""not my customer, not my job"" feeling. It really was a wonderful experience.",5.0
337,"March 01, 2017","This was by far the easiest and lest-stressful car buying experience I've ever had.  Highly recommend having him get you the car you want.  He will work to make it right and do it with a great relaxed manner.  Thanks, Rocky!",4.8

339,"February 23, 2017","After an extensive search and dealing with other Toyota dealers, we chose to check out Toyota of Killeen. We began our search online where I came into contact with Rocky, and he was very helpful without being pushy. 
We made an appointment to see him and see if we could work out a deal. We wound up trading in two of our vehicles for a Toyota 4Runner TRD off road and we could not be happier with our decision. If it weren't for Rocky and Bill (the numbers guy) I am certain we would not have gotten a new SUV. They beat the competitor's sale price and trade-in value on the vehicles without making it seem like they were doing us a favor. Rocky was very efficient, knowledgeable, and extremely helpful throughout the entire process. 

We highly recommend Rocky and Toyota of Killeen. ",5.0
340,"February 23, 2017","I found the pre-owned car I needed online at Toyota of Killeen. I needed something reliable for my daughter to take to college. Blaine contacted me right away and kept me in the loop about its availability. They had all the service records and car fax printed out for me when I drove from Austin to look at the car. I didn't even look at it, I spoke with Blaine and bought it. Seamless process and as mentioned, Blaine pumped us full of excellent coffee while we waited for detailing. I walked out within an hour with a new car. He was personable, never came at me with upsales, gimmicks or ungenuine character. I would have walked away if so. I'd certainly return to ToK/Blaine as I only buy Toyotas anyways.",5.0
341,"February 21, 2017","Great experience. Straight talk from my sales representative ( Newton Rose). He answered all my questions, showed me several vehicles, got me comparable paperwork for me to review so I could make an informed decision. No hassle and great customer experience. Would highly recommend Mr. Rose. ",5.0
342,"February 20, 2017","We really enjoy coming by the Toyota of Killeen Dealership. The main reason is due to Rocky Price. My wife and I have purchased five vehicles from Toyota of Killeen. The reason why we keep coming is Rocky. From the first time we met him, his non-aggressive form of sales has always been very pleasing to me. We give him our demands, and he always comes through. He is an all around great guy with whom we enjoy dealing with. Thanks for everything Rocky. You are the man!!!

349,"February 22, 2016","After looking at several other dealers in the state and not finding any good deals or service, my brother-in-law suggested Toyota of Killeen.  He had just purchased his new 2016 Prius and recommended taking at look at a Toyota through this dealer.  Everything was done on the phone and online, it was one of the easiest purchases I've ever made.  I didn't spend more than an hour at the dealership when I went to pick it up and everyone was exceptionally helpful, especially my salesman, Newton Rose.

I've been really happy with the Corolla so far and I'm not ready to say I'm a convert, but I'll definitely be coming back to Killeen if I go with a Toyota again!",5.0
350,"January 09, 2016","Last three appointments for oil change took 4-6 hours.  100,000 mile service took 8 hours and they weren't finished then.  Two recalls recently and that took 2 days, yes I did write days!  Even when you bring your car in a 8 am, they don't start looking at it until late in the afternoon.  I live 40 miles away and that is more than an inconvenience.  Unacceptable service.",1.8

352,"October 24, 2011","I worked with Jim to purchase a new Prius.  My husband and I talked with him in the spring, and just recently were ready to make our purchase.  Jim was friendly, knowledgeable, and worked out some great financing through Toyota for us that cut our interest rate by 2/3 from what we were expecting through our bank.  The process was simple and easy, no pressure sales with Jim.  I really enjoyed this experience and will continue to return to Toyota of Killeen for as long as we remain in Texas!  ",5.0
353,"September 16, 2011","GM Mickey Rawls is a croock and a lier we are an auto transport company that picked up a car from the dealership and when my driver got there they gave him the wrong car and when we spoke to the sales person he told me that GM Mickey Rawls will call me and take care of the transport but instead they picked up the car and GM Mickey Rawls said that he doesnt want to pay because he got the car in his lot.
be very carefull dealing with this dealership .",1.0
354,"January 26, 2011","Recently, I called Toyota of Killeen to order a set of ""all weather floor mats"" for my sons 2009 Tacoma pickup truck.  I dealt with the GM Mickey Rawls and he took my information and gave it to his Parts Manager Jamie Oyler.  Jamie listened to my request, quoted me a price and when I ordered them, he shipped them immediatley.  Very easy and smooth transaction.  This was not a big sale for them however what was so different was the friendly atmosphere and the ""customer service"" I received.  I would recommend Toyota of Killen for all your Toyota needs, the owners Paula and Stan Lohse are a class-act family and the General Manager Mickey is a great guy!  Thanks Toyota of Killeen!
