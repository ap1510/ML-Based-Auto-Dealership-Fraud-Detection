On Wed, 12/27, I was near Waco en route to Fort Worth in my 2016 RRSport when my transmission light suddenly appeared. I Googled Land Rover and the closest dealership was yours. Tracy assured me over the phone that I could safely drive my car to Fort Worth as long as the light was not blinking.

Two hours later I arrived in Fort Worth and was within a few miles of your dealership when my navigation system failed, probably due to all the new construction on the highway.

I called your dealership and was routed to Joe who literally stayed on the phone w me while he guided me to your front door. Joe was so kind!

Once I got out of my car, Tracy graciously took control immediately. She sent my car to Service and less than 2 hours later, I was back in business.

Apparently, all I needed was a software update!

I cannot thank Tracy and Joe enough. What could have been an absolutely miserable experience turned into a most positive one!

And the entire time I was treated with such courtesy and respect!

Thank you, and Tracy and Joe, so much!
