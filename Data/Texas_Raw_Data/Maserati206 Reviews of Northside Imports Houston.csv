1,"April 30, 2020","We live in Atlanta and we’re looking for a specific car that they had online. We had a week to make a purchase before our daughters birthday surprise. The last two dealerships we worked with fell through due to them never following through with promises or flat out lying about the price. I called this dealership and reached Courtney! Wow, she was fantastic! She was personable, kind and went way out of the way for us since we were out of town. She immediately had all the information on the car. She even personally took a detailed video so we could get a better look at the car. She was professional and not pushy! I would highly recommend using her if you are in need of a new/used car! Can’t say enough nice things! Thanks so much Courtney!!!!:) ",5.0

The waiting area is comfortable with all amenities and my vehicle was ready to go right on time.  Receptionist was also friendly and helpful.  A top notch service experience at Northside Imports!",4.8

8,"February 19, 2020",Professional environment with no hassle or pressure.  Courtney introduced me to the 2020 Giulia and demonstrated a thorough knowledge of the impressive features of this premier vehicle.  Everyone from the greeter to top mgmt. made the entire process an absolute pleasure.,5.0
9,"February 19, 2020","Northside Imports is over an hour away from our home, but they are so great at taking care of us and our car, we are happy to drive the distance rather than seek service at our nearest FIAT dealer, an unfriendly and uncaring business that has finally lost our business.

We will continue to consider FIATs for future new car purchases because Northside Imports has made our experience owning the car, to date, exceptional.",5.0
10,"February 18, 2020",My wife and I had a great experience at Northside Imports. Our salesman Matthew went above and beyond for us and was able to get us the vehicle we wanted at the price we wanted. Couldn't be more pleased with our new vehicle and the service we received. We will definitely do business with Northside imports in the future. ,5.0
11,"February 17, 2020","DeLawrence, Ryan, and Mayra were all excellent to work with. Very professional and up front. We were able to make a deal happen without me ever having to step into the dealership until I was taking delivery of the car. DeLawrence and Ryan were willing to work with me via email and phone and did not press me to come in like some of the other dealerships I've worked with. Mayra in Finance was informative and swift in getting me out of the dealership in a timely manner.",5.0

13,"February 11, 2020","Hats off to a unified team of professionals who aim for perfection!  I have been most fortunate to be part of Northside Alfa Romeo’s community of proud customers for nearly three years.  Although I’ve had a few repairs in the past, the service team always comes through!  They take time with me, are extremely courteous, and don’t mind any question. 

The entire team, including sales and an awesome new  leader, Ryan Flores, will certainly be the driving force toward future business from me.  
This team makes me feel welcome each and every visit and that speaks volumes.  Thank you for being our “Home Town” kind of dealership!!",5.0

15,"January 30, 2020",I have had to get my whole top replaced on my convertible Fiat500. The dealership honored the warranty and I was elated. Since then I have brought my car in for oil changes and other routine scheduled maintenance. I appreciate the transparency the updates on what is going on the repairs .. the snacks and the patience shown to me. Thank you. I would certainly recommend this dealership based on the exceptional experiences I have had .. ,5.0

19,"December 12, 2019","We had a great experience with Kristofer Villalba; he was very thorough, made the process seamless, answered all of our questions and was quick to respond in the days leading up to our purchase.  Vehicle was as described.  Vince in Finance got us in and out within 45 minutes.  No complaints from me!  Ask for Kris!",5.0
20,"December 09, 2019","Great team of people, they were a pleasure to work with. They worked hard to meet my needs and called me when they felt the right opportunity was available. ",4.0
21,"December 06, 2019","It's hard to really like the car buying experience in general, but the sales manger, Brandon Roth, at Northside Import really made it excruciatingly worse than it should be.  

I'm glad I was able to recognize how sleazy this place was before giving them my business. After some email communication on a car I wanted, they basically tried to bate me to come in under the impression that they were willing to match another dealership's price ($14.5k) only to say that they can't in the end because the actual price of the car is $16.1k.

Listen y'all.... Listing price of the car was almost $14k. Even if I didn't care to negotiate the listing price, with taxes (6.25%), licence&registration ($61.50), title( $44), even if they tag on a big bogus ""document fees"" or any other ""dealership fees"" it should still come under $15,500. As all fees and taxes should come in at no more than 10% of the cost of the car. If you're paying for more than that in taxes and fees, then you're being cheated by the dealer.

Bottom line. STAY FAR AWAY.",1.0
22,"September 30, 2019","Bryan was our sales person He was excellent. 
Answered our questions, was not pushy and closed the deal for us. 
Returned for service and got the same attention. Bryan saw me waiting and came over to ask if there was anything he could do to help. 

Love my Giulia TI Sport Carbon! If you give me a good deal would love to upgrade to a Quadrifolgio...

23,"September 30, 2019",Awesome experience purchasing my new FIAT 500 from Northside Imports! Bryan did a great job finding the right car for me with the features I wanted. Both Bryan and Trinidad did an awesome job taking care of me at the dealership. And Ben made me a drive-out I deal I couldn't refuse.  Plus Trinidad delivered the car  to my driveway all the way in Kemah TX. Thank you!!! ,5.0

25,"September 04, 2019","Northside Imports is the top Alfa Romeo dealer I the US for the iconic 4C. Their selection of this limited edition mini supercar is second to none, and so too their knowledge about it.

They don’t just sell the 4C at Northside, several own their own!

After dealing with some other nearby and out of state Alfa dealers that knew less than me about this halo car, speaking to Matthew Cleveland, my sales rep, was like a breath of fresh air.

Worked out a deal over the phone and flew down to Houston on a Sunday night. Matthew picked me up at my hotel at 9AM on his way to work. 90 minutes later I was driving home in the car of my dreams. 

Everyone at dealership could not have been nicer or more friendly. Thanks Matt & Northside! ",4.8
26,"September 03, 2019","The sales guy, Bryan Gonzalez, was very kind and very helpful ... it is always good to deal with someone that can explain you the plans and the features of the car in your own language (Spanish in our case) ... Brandon and Mayra were also of good help and highly professionals ... so far, we love our Alfa Romeo ... still learning how to manage all the features ... ",5.0
27,"August 27, 2019","I would recommend Northside Imports Houston to anyone who don’t want to deal with pushy salesman.  Matthew Cleveland was courteous and professional.  He provided detailed information and all my options. He went above and beyond to make sure if I was able to get a trade-in on my current vehicle.  

Even Josh the finance guy provided detailed information about my interest rate and answer all of my questions before I signed.

They both were the reasons why I’m one happy customer. I’ve been a long time customer of Northside Lexus but now I’m a new fan of Northside Imports Houston. ",4.6
28,"July 08, 2019","I just picked up my 2014 Corvette Stingray and I could not be happier.  I work overseas, literally half-way around the world, and was only looking online with no real intent to buy until I returned to the States.  However, when I saw this beautiful Vette with low mileage I decided it couldn't hurt to make an inquiry.  Along came Cali Leal and the rest, as they say, is history.  Cali, and others who I spoke with, were incredibly helpful without the slightest pressure.  I wanted a video, the next hour I had a video in my inbox.  I had questions, she transferred me to the person who could answer my questions. In short, I wound up buying the car with my wife signing the papers (ain't Power of Attorney a wonderful thing?).  I flew in over the weekend and the car was waiting for me when I got there.  All I had to do was shake a few hands, give Cali a big hug, and drive off.  This couldn't have been easier.  I highly recommend this dealership and if you do call or go by, ask for Cali.  ",5.0
29,"April 23, 2019","I urge ANYONE shopping for a new or used car to stay far away from this place.  The General Manager, Ryan Flores has promised to return emails / phone calls and the promises go unanswered.  His staff is the same way.  The car I received would not start when it showed up, the tires were cracked and unsafe to drive on, the breaks were shot, and various other issues that made the car unsafe for the road.  All of this after I was told that it went through their vigorous inspection process.  Ha!  Seriously, they don't know what they are doing.  Look at all the one star reviews on Google and other sites and you will see similar stories.  I complained to the BBB, and guess what, Ryan and team didn't even respond to them.  There are thousands of dealerships out there.  Stay far away from this one!",1.0
30,"March 27, 2019","Purchased a used Porsche from these guys.  Was told it was in GREAT shape.  As an out of town buyer, I was cautious, but believed in their sales staff.  After receiving the car, it wouldn't start.  An inspection in town found over $4,000 in repairs needed to even make the car safe to drive.  Throughout the experience I was told that this was a Maserati dealership and they inspect all cars before the sell them.  The turn signals didn't work.   The radiator was chucked full of debris.  The tires and breaks were shot.  Stay far away from these guys. ",1.0
31,"March 23, 2019","Very disappointed at the number of authorized credit inquiries I received when I specifically went through capital one. I have 5 extra. I have called numerous times, left messages with the finance department that have never been returned, sent a number of emails and at least 5 letters by postal mail. I finally talked to one guy who said he would email a letter to me and never did. That was last week. When I called back I couldn't get an answer so I had to leave another message. I know my next car won't be with them and I will not suggest anyone to go. I even tweeted you guys because you do not respond, purposely. All it takes is a simple letter to recognize the error to fix the situation.",1.8
32,"October 23, 2018",Simply put we would never have bought that car if it hadn't been for Joels persistence and determination to sell it to us. He never gave up on the deal no matter how long it took. We also worked with ryan Hon and Vincent in finance who helped us with a great deal on the car and now my wife is happy with her new Stelvio. Hopefully we get the same service for many years to come at their dealership. ,4.7
33,"October 17, 2018",This dealership and it's sales people exceeded all expectations on everything.  They worked remotely with me due to scheduling issues on my end and even drove the vehicle 70 miles to deliver with paperwork ready to execute.,5.0
34,"October 14, 2018","This  dealership participates in deceptive practices. “ it’s a simple reset, we’ll take care of it, no problem” said salesman Matthew Cleveland.  Didn’t take care of it and wouldn’t return calls. Same goes for his manager Mike Ricks and the GM/ Director Ryan Hon. Although Ryan was full of the right words initially, he also did not return calls. Horrible service from sales and management. Don’t take them at their word you will be greatly disappointed. ",2.0

42,"June 16, 2018",Enjoyed the experience. Fair deals. Nice people. Neal Hogg was especially helpful. Ask for him if you go. We purchased a Fiat X500. They had the features and price range we were looking for to fit our requirements and budget. ,5.0

44,"May 25, 2018","Brought vehicle in to repair running light and flood light. I had previously taken the vehicle to another dealership for an inspection which it passed because all other lights worked properly, however I was told that it may be electrical so I called Northside to check the warranty and was told it would expire on May 30th and to bring it in. I told them the problem and what the other dealership said. I asked if electrical was covered and was told it was. I then received a call saying it was not electrical after they tested the bulbs and they worked but afterwards did a diagnostic which made no sense but wanted to charge me for it",1.0
45,"May 21, 2018",I was in the middle of negotiations to purchase a used Cayenne from Northside. I had several conversations and emails with the used car manager (Michael). He was extremely helpful until he sold the vehicle that we were in the middle of our negotiations. I had made an offer to which he responded. I made another offer. The next thing I heard was an email telling me that they had sold the vehicle to someone else. I was ready to drive from New Orleans to complete the deal. I felt that he should have at least given me the opportunity to match any deal as we had been negotiating for a couple of days. Not a good experience from my prospective. I do not plan to deal with Northside Imports Houston again. This experience confirms the lack of ethical business practices in the automobile business. ,2.8

61,"January 15, 2018","I typically do not leave reviews, but I believe that this place completely deserves it. I initially requested information about a car online and discussed the details with Jarred, who provided me detailed information about the specific car and answered all of my questions. However, at that time, due to personal reasons, I could not visit the dealership to see the car.
 
Later, I was contacted by Neal Hogg, who followed up on with me about my previous requests and offered his assistance. When I visited the dealership, Neal was incredibly helpful, polite and professional. He was not only knowledgeable about the car, answering all my questions, but he did his best to make sure I was a satisfied customer. The environment was very positive with no pressure whatsoever.
 
I would highly recommend this dealership and Neal Hogg to anyone who is looking for great customer experience, high quality service, and an excellent choice of vehicles with competitive prices.

74,"October 22, 2017","The too long didn't read: They wrecked my car, did a terrible job fixing it, made me wait hours at their dealership, got me a bad loaner car, couldn't figure out why I had a check engine light, told me it would be ready 5 times before it was actually ready, wouldn't answer my calls, wouldn't return my calls, and would tell me they would call me with updates and failed to follow through. And then they tried to act like they did a good job.

I went there to get warranty work done on my car (service engine light coming on). When I got there, I had to wait 3 hours to get a loaner car because they thought I wouldn't need one despite anticipating a multi-day wait. They got me a loaner (possibly the crappiest car I've ever driven).

 Next morning, they call and say they can't figure out why I had a service engine light, but that they would work on other things and would give me an update call by 4:30. No call came, so I called them and they told me a part I need would be in the next morning and they'd call me first thing the following morning. No call came, so I left a message at lunch. No call. I called again at 3 and they finally answered, saying again the car would be ready the following morning and they'd give me a call.

They actually call this time (though not until mid-day) and say the car would be ready by the end of the day. I get a call an hour later. They crashed my car. No joke. They crashed it. Still can't get me a better loaner. They ""fixed"" my car (they did a terrible job, there are still small marks they missed because they can't do anything right) and acted like they were doing me a favor fixing the damage they did.

The following Monday (so they've had my car for a full week at this point), they tell me they finally figured out why my car was having the service engine lights, tell me they'll call me the following morning, hopefully to tell me the next day it was ready. No call Tuesday. I call Wednesday and nobody answers or calls back. I call Thursday and they finally answer and tell me one service person had a family emergency (I don't know why none of the other workers could at least call over a multi-day period, but whatever) but my car should finally be ready the next day. So, after almost two weeks in the worst loaner they have, I finally get my car back, with a poor paint job, from the dealership. This was not only the worst dealership experience I have ever had, this was the worst consumer experience. And that includes ordering things off of Amazon from fake sellers.

If I had to give positives (and I only do this to TRY and be fair), there were two. First, they did work me in a little sooner than expected and second, they tried really hard to fix all the major mistakes they made (but that doesn't overcome the HUGE list of mistakes).",1.5

78,"September 24, 2017","My family lost all of our vehicles in Hurricane Harvey.  I found a well-priced vehicle at Northside Imports that met all of my needs (and some of my wants).  I inquired about it through Northside Imports’ website and was contacted by one of their salespeople.  We spoke on the phone, text, and he even sent me a video of the vehicle.  I set up an appointment for later that day, and drove across town to their dealership.  The salesman was super nice, we took a test drive, and agreed on a number pending a 3rd party inspection, which is a necessity post-Harvey.  The inspection only found a couple of issues, the worst being that the battery was bad and on its last legs.  I took the report back to Northside Imports to discuss it and see about getting the battery replaced since they should have caught that in their inspection.  This is where the whole experience took a major downturn.  
The salesman was helping someone else, so I talked to one of the managers, Parish Hadley.  Parish treated me like a piece of garbage, something less than human.  Here is the end of our conversation:
Me:  “Out of the couple of issues here, I’d like the dealership to replace the battery.  It should have been caught in your inspection.”
Parish Hadley:  “There’s nothing we can do for you.  The vehicle is already priced competitively.”
Me:  “You can’t replace a battery?”
Parish Hadley:  “Batteries go out all the time.  My wife’s went out last week.  Do you want the vehicle or not?”
Me:  “I need a vehicle.  But the vehicle needs to have a reliable battery.”
Parish Hadley:  “Well, if your battery dies in a week, call us and we’ll see what we can do.”
Me:  “This is how you treat victims of Harvey?”
Parish Hadley (snarkily as he walked away):  “We try to accommodate our customers.”
How was that accommodating?  I can’t capture in a review how horrible this conversation was, and how rude, arrogant, and downright mean Parish Hadley was during it.  What should have been a renewing moment for me in replacing a vehicle after losing one in Harvey was completely destroyed by this guy.  He is most of the reason for my low review of this place.  The rest of the reason being that if your Maserati dealership is running so tight that you can’t afford to replace a battery on a pre-owned vehicle, that should give you some indication on how they run their business, and what you can expect when you go there.  Get a 3rd party inspection!  They won’t do anything about the findings, but at least you’ll know, and can hopefully walk away.

86,"August 08, 2017","I had a deal to buy a used car from the dealer.  I wrote them a personal check which their check processor could not process.  Per the processor's suggestion, I got a conference call setup with my Bank, Ally Bank, and the processor.  My bank told the processor that I had well more available funds than was needed for the check.  The processor still could not process the check.  I told the dealership to have my salesman contact me.  My salesman contacted me shortly and stated that there was nothing to worry about, the check would clear in 24 hours, and that I could come pick the car up that night if I wanted to.  I couldn't make it back that night, and I told him I would come in the morning. This is all undisputed facts, documented in writing via e-mail exchanges.  They sold the car that night to someone else as I found out the next morning.

I complained to everyone and every state department I new of.  The Texas DMV even instigated an investigation based on the facts I produced.  I moved on and found a great car and deal at another dealer.

9 months later: I get an email from the dealer asking me to do business with them again via the BBB complaints public website.  After I responded telling them you must be crazy based on my last experience, they post a statement with false and slanderous statements about the incident.  This dealership has never fessed up to the fact that they screwed up, they always blame me and put stink on me.

Do yourself a favor and avoid this place at all possible costs!",1.4

88,"July 29, 2017","I took my Fiat in to have an issue with the gas tank repaired, among other things. It took almost two weeks to get the car back. Each time they called, they kept adding more things that were wrong. The original issue I asked them to repair, they didn't, but charged me for it. I picked up the car, went to the gas station and immediate discovered they never repaired the issue with the gas tank. Brought the car back, and was told it would be another $1200 to fix it. I told them no and to return my car. Then they dropped the price another $400. I told them no and had to threaten them with calling the police to get my car back. Had to contact Fiat who contacted the dealership to get the car back. Then Ryan called and made another offer to replace the tank for $450. If they didn't fix it in the first place, do you really think I'm going to fall for the bait and switch tactic and another two weeks without a car and have them fix it only to discover they haven't fixed it and it'll be more money? Seriously? The service department used to be really good when it was at AutoNation with Chrysler. Each time I've taken it in for service now it's the same story. Said they fixed it, then 'discover' something else that has to be fixed. IF they did in fact replace the part on the tank, why did they never test it to make sure it was fixed? What if that were my brake lines? Then they started telling me that I must drive on dusty roads or overfilled the tank and that's what caused the problem. Neither of those were the cause. I checked online and this is an issue with this make and model. Plenty of consumers have reported it and once replaced, it will often fail again, and the consumer is out more money. This dealership is the worst. And they never offered a loaner. I would never use them for service and after my experience with Ryan buying the car, would never buy another car from them again. 

THE DEALERSHIP SAYS THEY TRIED EVERYTHING. DID YOU REFUND ME THE MONEY YOU CHARGED ME FOR THE REPAIR THAT DID NOT FIX THE ISSUE THAT YOUR TECH NEVER CHECKED TO MAKE SURE IT WAS FIXED? NO. 

YOU JUST KEPT ASKING IF I WANTED TO SPEND MORE MONEY WITH A DEALERSHIP THAT CAN'T REPAIR OR CHECK THE ISSUE THE FIRST TIME.

I took the vehicle to the Alpine Motor Works for an inspection, great people about European cars.

Amy responded first to tell me Brandon would be getting in touch then, Brandon responded then Ryan emailed me to say let him know if I didn't get the info I needed from Brandon.

When I went in to buy, driving my 19.5 year old beater of a BMW, everyone was very friendly and helpful and very much not your stereotypical car sales persons.

156,"March 25, 2015","Back in June & July, I was helping someone else look at cars. We went to nearly 20 different dealers. At Northside, they were very enthusiastic about the car we were looking at, a 500L. They really knew the cars. Also there was none of the ""only talk to your salesperson, everyone else will ignore you"" biz - everyone was friendly. Ultimately we didn't buy the 500L because she liked a different brand's car better. 

However, I liked the experience so well that I went back a month later to buy a 500 Sport. I already knew which cars I wanted to look at, and exactly what I wanted. There was no pressure to look at anything else. When I decided to buy, they handled the process extremely quickly. I was in and out of the dealership in 3 hours. Not only that, but Ryan in finance got me much better financing than I'd been pre-approved for with an interest rate much better than expected.  I would certainly buy my next Fiat from Northside.

The salesman I had my appointment with was busy, my daughter and I were out on the car lot looking at available vehicles.  The Sales Manager approached us and I let him know we had an appointment, in fact, the sales manager had called me that morning to confirm my appointment.  He said the sales man was busy and asked which cars I was interested in.  I let him know that we were ""browsing"" at and pointed at the cars.  He said he would be back with the keys and show me the cars himself...... 10 minutes later we were still waiting.... So my daughter and I left................... Unfortunately for the this dealership I purchased my daughter a BMW from a dealership down the road, purchased it out right no financing.  I was not too impressed with North Side Fiat,  Not a good sign when the Sales Manager blows off potential customers.  Wouldn't waste my time with them.

169,"September 10, 2014","I recently decided to check out a new Fiat. After having a rental, I was intrigued to learn more about the brand. Having no recommendation or starting point, I turned to the internet. I was impressed with Northside's selection, so I submitted my interest. I was quickly contacted by Justin Black, who scheduled an appointment that was convenient for me. My experience was great from beginning to end! Justin consulted with me and was very driven to learn what I was interested in. He showed me several cars that met my criteria. I was also quickly greeted by the studio manager, Ed Paez. Justin is new with the Fiat brand, but still very knowledgeable. If he wasn't sure about something, Ed was right there to fill in the blanks. Even the finance guy, Ryan Hon, was awesome. He is polite, professional, and extremely knowledgeable. He worked with me to decide which warranty was best for my needs. This is exactly the way buying a car should be! No artillery of high pressure sales tactics. No effort made to sell me something I don't need. Who knew this was possible? These guys sold me a great car at a great price. Even better, they sold me on an exceptional dealership. Thanks Northside! I love my new Fiat! It makes me smile.

We never remembered their names or faces. From the moment we met Logan Beller - that all changed. He was attentive, polite, and very informative.  Our entire purchase went very smoothly, and I have a car that makes me smile every day!  It has now been over a year and a half since we made our purchase.

185,"March 05, 2014","My wife and I test drove a Fiat at a nearby location (I-10/Helfman) and were about to purchase a model which was not exactly what we wanted but what they had to offer in stock. The color and sun/moonroof were not options we were searching for at the time. The cost also was a bit off target. Needless to say we were happy to leave that location (after having to wait around for more than a few hours to finally speak to the 'Chrysler' financer who would not budge on a set financing percentage rate). After doing more research I found Northside Fiat through a simple online ad. Ryan Hon quickly answered my email inquiry at Northside and we began sending and responding to each others emails. Ed Paez also emailed me and through a few back and forths they helped me nail down a financing percentage we could agree on. The drive to Northside is 28+ miles for us and we didn't want to do another sitdown session with nothing to show for it. They understood the concern so I had a guaranteed rate in email form to bring with me. Once there I was kindly greeted by Ed and he introduced me to Logan Beller who showed me the vehicle I inquired about from their website. Logan was very informative and knew his Fiats as he answered all my questions in detail. I should point out Ryan was out that weekend for family reasons but I was able to meet him a few weeks later to put my new plates onto the Fiat - he was as helpful in answering more questions and I have no doubt the entire sales staff at Northside are all prepared to give you necessary info based on knowing these three gentlemen.
The signing went well and Billy Dieringer helped answer further inquiries about the financial end and even gave me great trivia about the print on the wall behind him. Overall, this auto purchase is a much better memorable experience for me and my wife. My toddler was well behaved also as they had a nice play area for them and anyone who's into video games. Thanks for being there, Northside Fiat! My family and friends will be notified...",4.8

I immediately told her that I was wanting some information about one of the Harleys that they had in the shop.  She was able to give me all the information that I needed to make the decision to purchase this bike.  As it was late on a Saturday evening they tried their very best to get me out of there on the bike, however the banks were closed so I would have to wait until Monday for the bike.  I realized at that time that I did not have a ride to get me there where I could take the bike with me without leaving one behind.  Well Theresa offered to come and pick me up and I tell you that I do not live close at all.  She and Billy made this all possible and I really appreciate her non-pushy approach.  That put me at ease very quickly.  All was good to go then once I got the bike out of the shop for some reason or another the battery was dead, that is when the pther gentleman came over and charged the battery and made sure that I had enough of  a charge so that I would not have to worry about it starting up later when I was off of work.

They know the product very well and obviously love the cars they sell. I have recommended several people to this studio and they have all been treated with the same great service and attitudes...even when staying until 9:30pm or 10:00pm to complete the deal. I have purchased several new cars over the years and can tell you that this was by far a better all around experience. The first time we walked in just to take a look at the new models we were treated as though we were staying the night in a high end hotel. We were approached more in a manner of the staff wanting to help us find what we were looking for instead of a high pressure hard sell. Very laid back environment where you do indeed feel like a guest and not just another potential check walking in the door. My wife hated the Fiat when we first bought mine, then she fell in love, so we picked out one for her, then I traded up to an Abarth, now we are going to purchase a 500L. Thats all in a year and its not only because we have fallen in love with the Fiat brand but also the friendly atmosphere created by Ed, Santiago, and Marilyn.

After telling her a few more models, she suggested that we go to their other lot where they had a few of the ones I mentioned.  That way, I could test drive a bunch all in one place rather than me driving around all day from dealership to dealership.  That was very cool of her and in addition to saving me time, gave me a great feel for what I liked and what I could do without on a number of different types of cars.
