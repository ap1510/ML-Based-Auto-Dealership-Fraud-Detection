0,"July 08, 2019","As a veteran on the 4th of July weekend I walked in with high hopes of getting a good deal based on the great reviews from google. I looked at a 2017 suburban and researched the kelly book value at around $30k if buying from a dealership and they were asking $34.5k. I drove it and everything seemed to be in really great condition. When we started to talk numbers they wouldn’t budge on their over priced value and only wanted to offer me 21k for a Vehicle worth 24k that they sold my girlfriend a year prior overpriced at 30k. They took advantage of her then and tried to do the same to me. The salesman Nick Jones didn’t even bother to ask and assumed we needed financing almost wasting a hit on our credit. When we told him we were paying for the vehicle with cash in full and he still wouldn’t budge on the price because he knew he could lie and cheat his way to sell the vehicle to someone else he could take advantage of. Horrible salesman. horrible practice. I wouldn’t recommend this dealership even to someone I hated. No one deserves to be taken advantage of like this dealership does to the great Texans of Paris, TX. Worst experience ever. 0/10 would not recommend.",1.0
1,"February 03, 2019",They provide the necessary services I need without little or no delays. They get my pick up in and complete the necessary required items I have asked them to perform ,4.0
2,"January 15, 2019",Although they charged me for the diagnostic fee and was unable to tell me the issue with my service lights being on and my acceleration issues (which they drove and the problem did not occur then) they still have A+ customer service. I feel certain if I must return again with the same issue that I won’t be charged another fee. They are quick to want to help and satisfy. ,3.8

7,"December 24, 2017","Very low pressure, they had a huge selection so I was able to find what I wanted. When I wanted to compare models and test drive them my salesman just handed me the keys and told me to take my time.  Very comfortable sales center as well. We also enjoy the tv commercials, especially during Christmas time as they spent the time to share the amazing love of Jesus!",5.0

13,"June 15, 2017","My extended warranty on a Chrysler minivan had come to an end and I decided to checkout Everett Toyota's service department by giving them the opportunity to do a simple oil change.  The service was outstanding...as they checked out several other basic items like the fluids, battery, tires, brakes, air filter, and looked for anything abnormal like the small oil leak they found...interesting  since I thought that had been taken care of at the Chrysler dealership under you guessed it the warranty.  I did do a post check and verified that the oil was properly filled to the correct level and was impressed that they noted on the report and verbally that the oil had been down on the dipstick.  They also filled the windshield fluid container and to top it all off offered to wash and vacuum the vehicle.   While I waited I enjoyed a coke and a great tasting donut and cookie in their customer waiting area with my son. During the wait I observed a service advisor making recommendations to an elderly lady who had a nail in her tire.  She didn't want to replace the tire even though the low presure light in the dash been on for a week and she was going to be driving the vehicle out of town!  The service advisor was genuinely concerned and suggested she take the vehicle next door and see if they could make a plug repair since Toyota's rules would not allow them.

The only glitch was where the cashier failed to give me my keys and I had to walk back and get them....received a genuine apology for my inconvenience...by the way he had been very nice to my six year old!!  Wow, because of all that I had to come here and give you this feedback to keep it up!!!  I also then had to go and rate the James Hodge dealership to take a page out of Everett Toyota's service department's book....the difference was huge in how I felt leaving the place...appreciated...even though it was just an oil change on a brand they didn't sell.  Thank you.",5.0

16,"February 13, 2015","This is the third Toyota I've purchased at Toyota of Paris, 2 new and 1 used. I live in Dallas and it's absolutely worth the drive out there. Everyone is personable and respectful. I've used other dealerships here in Dallas and you start to feel like just another sale. With Toyota of Paris, however, they actually listen to you and treat you like a real person. I highly recommend them to everyone. ",5.0
