0,"April 28, 2020",I took my car in to have my computer updated. The service advisor stated they had complete work up on my vehicle. I showed him the paperwork from my mechanic and asked him to give me a quote for the computer module. He calls me later that day and stated the problem was the wiring and it would cost $440 to fix. I agreed and the next day he calls and says that didn’t fix the problem and that I needed two modules (which is what I asked for in the first place. Frustrated I decided to just pick up my vehicle. The next day I noticed my front bumper was not reattached it was bearly hanging on. I returned to the dealership to have them fix it. As I was leaving I noticed that every time I turn my wheel left or right my horn blows. They not only didn’t fix what was asked but created another problem!!! I’ve reached out to GM but have yet to hear back. ,1.0

2,"March 09, 2020","I had a great buying experience at Mac Haik Ford Pasadena!!! Jose Navarez was the guy who worked really hard to earn my business with great customer service to facilitate our needs!!! I was going to buy a brand new Ford Truck at another dealership and Jose got right to work and went the extra mile to earn my business as well as drive the vehicle to me in Austin Texas. I bought the New Ford Truck at Mac Haik Ford because of Jose Navarez and his customer service!!!

3,"February 03, 2020","Our experience at Mac Haik Ford was easy and enjoyable.  We bought a preowned Ford Flex from Kenneth Pullin, and we have nothing but great things to say.  Coming from over 4 hours away, Kenny was extremely helpful and responsive with all of our questions and concerns. He went above and beyond helping us evaluate our Flex before we made the trip down to Houston. He was transparent, extremely pleasant to work with, and helped us get a great deal on the car we wanted – a true professional. 

We couldn’t be happier with our Flex !

They kept her car for 2 weeks and gave it backed rigged. They said they could not determine why it fell off so they did not cover it. They rigged it with clips instead of putting the proper bolts backed on, so now they bottom piece of her new Explorer is clipped together, because they were to cheap and lazy to fix it properly. And there attitude about it is they just don’t care. Do not go here...",1.0

6,"September 11, 2018",I will never recommend nor will purchase a vehicle from this dealership. Purchase a 2017 mustang and have had multiple issues. Vehicle has been in and out of the service department for the same issue. Asked to speak to the service manager and he advised me to go to another dealership due to my vehicle being in their service department for the same issue multiple times. vehicle has left me stranded and the service department advised since the issue didn’t occur while they had it the vehicle had no issue with it. Took my vehicle due to to having my check park aid light come on and they advised me to take my car home due to the high levels of service. I asked to speak to the general manager several times and he has been avoiding me. ,1.0
7,"July 27, 2018","I am in the market for Mustang, but when they found out that I was not using their finance department, they added $500.00 to the price of the car. I cancelled. Waited a month or so, called back, dealt with another salesman, Larry and the sales manager, David. They again added $500.00 to the sales price and said it was for transportation fee to get the vehicle there. If that is true, no where does it say about a transportation fee or have to transport the vehicle, but it should NOT be added to the sales price of the car where I pay taxes on it. It should be added as a fee, but not to the sales price! STAY CLEAR OF ALL MAC HAIK!!!",1.0
8,"April 04, 2018","Service will not honor warranties on parts that they feel as if it will be a burden for them.  They will keep putting you off for so long that you will have racked up more miles on your vehicle than when you originally came there for the issue.  Next, they will just simply tell you that Ford will not cover it just to stop.you from bugging them when actually forsaking will.cover the part.   Go somewhere else. ",1.7
9,"March 19, 2018",Just bought a used car from these guys less than 3 weeks ago. I have driven the car 800 miles. Yesterday the tranmisson went out on the highway while we were over an hour from home. Now the repair shop NTB says estimated repairs are between $2200-4500. Their is no doubt in my mind that they were aware of this problem. They are shady. They will do anything to sell you a car. I would not recommend anyone to this dealership. They have horrible ratings all over the internet because they have no integrity. Praise jesus for he is good and always provides. Even when scummy car dealerships do there customers wrong. Btw the the car was used but it only had 80000 miles on it. Not like I bought a 20 year old beater from these guys. Do your research and go to someone you can trust. ,1.0
10,"March 05, 2018","We have no gripe with the quality of the work done here - we absolutely respect that good work costs money and is done as quickly as possible. However, we are horrified at the negligence of the staff at this location. After having done business with this location several times, we get our vehicle back to discover that the $500 sound system we had installed in it was missing. The management at this location practically blew us off, saying it could have been broken into overnight when left unlocked - not sure why they'd leave it unlocked when it's in their care! I honestly believe someone who works for their service center likely stole the equipment and pawned it off, and management is covering for them. Don't trust these people with your vehicle, unless you want to get your car back to discover it's been stripped for parts!",1.6
11,"February 26, 2018","Beware of the finance department and shady transactions. My husband and I have been looking at new vehicles and we knew we wanted a Ford. We picked an STX 4WD model with a crew cab that seemed to be really well priced and after discussing it decided we would decide between 2 vehicles that were 2 wheel drive and 4 wheel drive. The salesman, Val, said that if we bought today he would have the bed lined with spray in protection and the windows tinted and we felt that was reasonable, but we still wanted numbers and monthly payment options before we decided to proceed. We talked numbers and we were planning on making a down payment of about 5k. We asked about Ford Motor Credit and he told us about incentives. Val couldn't come through with the promise of a bed liner or tinted windows, so he was able to take $500 of the total price of the one vehicle (the more expensive one) but not the 2 wheel drive. We filled out the credit application on the contingency that the numbers Val showed us would be what the finance department could show us before deciding to finance with Ford because we had already been pre-approved through our credit union for a low APR of 2.7% --we also asked for a breakdown of tax, title, license, and ALL OTHER fees associated with the purchase. We asked if the taxes to be paid were on the actual sale price or our purchase price and what other fees, besides finance charges, we should expect. We got nothing from Val except an answer that ""finance"" handles that. Finance was evasive. The difference in payments (depending on who we financed with) was $100-$150 MORE than the quote. Then we realized that they RAN OUR CREDIT and were handing us papers to sign for the sale of the 4 wheel drive truck before we ever got the numbers for payments and finance charges on them. The finance charges ranged between 2.69% and 8%. We asked for a copy of the credit report they pulled but the finance man refused to show us anything. We were trying to determine how the payments were so high. He was trying to make it seem as though we had just purchased that vehicle. Every time I reached for the break down paper work on the desk the finance person would pull it back, look at it, point to lines and say something and out it in a folder on his desk. I asked to see it 3 times. All 3 times he placed it in front of me and as I reached he grabbed it before I could get my hands on it and put it back into that folder on his desk. We told him those were not the numbers we discussed, and I wanted to see ALL the fees, and that we had NOT DECIDED which vehicle we actually wanted yet. I never got to see ANY PAPEROWRK. We told him about our discussion with Val and he said Val was a salesman and not part of the finance department. What is that supposed to mean? We did not buy that truck. The sale price with incentive and the $500 discount was $32,995. After financing for 5-6 years we would have paid $57,000+ for that vehicle. Protect yourselves people!! All of this was before we could even discuss Gap insurance and warranty info. PROTECT YOURSELVES. When we told the finance person we wanted more info he moved the folder to a table out of sight by his printer and become angry. We invested nearly 4 hours of our day with Mac Haik and he spent a total of 30 minutes running numbers. Be careful! There is something shady going on at Mac Haik Ford in Pasadena!!",1.2
12,"September 18, 2017",It's our job to help each other out as consumers so by doing my part I hope this review helps somebody. I had the worst experience ever with Mac Haik ford having a brand new truck with a paper tag still on it repaired by their body shop what a experience first of all they can't paint black so don't even try it take it to welsh collision in deer park or franks collision in baytown do not go here you've been warned. Second they won't stand behind the work THEIR employees do. Long story kept short I jus won a judgement in small claims court against Mac Haik ford for aweful repair job it's public record look it up before you decide to do any kind of bussiness with Mac Haik ford Pasadena. I will update this review soon if anybody would like info about this shop contact me I will be happy to help you if you do decide to go here ask for Darren the shop manager  he will be happy to take your money. Good luck ,1.0
13,"April 21, 2017",I went there one evening with a friend to look at F-150 trucks. I met Scott Walker. I realized he was quite an experienced sales man by his knowledge and how he handled my questions. The next day he sent me a video of an Awesome Black XLT Sport with hot red accents- Man it popped. I came in the next day and bought it just like that. If you are looking for any kind of truck you need to see Scott Walker ,5.0
14,"March 25, 2017","Moved here in July 2016, took Mustang to them because it was draining the battery. They told us it was the altenator, paid them $892.58 to replace.  A few months later, died again.  This time they told us to get a new battery, old one had a dead cell.  Did so.  Went on a trip and on return, car dead again.  This time had it towed to Mac Haik, they told us the Smart Junction Box was corroded, $914.00, told them that this was ridiculous, we just spent the money for the altenator, but they insisted this was the only problem they could find, but it was no guarantee.  I got them to lower the bill to $814.00.  When my husband picked up his car, the back window louver was torn off, and he asked, but no one knew what happened.  When he was driving home, he noticed the air bag light was on at the dash board, he called Stephen at Mac Haik, and he said it was on when they received the car, which was total BS.  The airbags are under recall.  Run, don't walk away, run from this dealership, they don't care about fixing the problem, just getting as much money from you as they can.",1.0

16,"November 17, 2016","Learned very costly lesson from not reading the current reviews about a dealership turned out I read the AC Collins reviews instead of mac haik reviews bad mistake!! READ THE REVIEWS PEOPLE it's the only way to know who you want to buy or work on your vehicle... I don't like giving a bad reviews but if anybody ever deserved it its MAC HAIK FORD PASADENA TX the body shop is hands down the most inexperienced in Harris county Macco does better job. After 4 trips back and fourt for paint repairs and redos they managed to really deprecate and destroy a brand new truck not to mention the customer service about keeping you informed forget about it it's not gonna happen they too busy to call and keep you informed. I'll post pictures from the beginning to recent time (when I get a little time) and let you make your decision before you choose a body shop. Advice is always free and my advice is take to a professional and save yourself multiple trips and more damage. Check back for pics soon... Good luck , Exhausted customer

17,"September 07, 2015",I don't normally write reviews unless I'm mad and I have a nasty comment. This time is very different. I bought my 32nd new vehicle today 2015 F150. Got there before noon was driving my new truck home at 2:30. Jerry Ben was by far the nicest calmest salesperson I have ever encountered. First time I didn't get mad and walk out. Then Oscar Villarreal in finance was just as pleasant. I like ford product and will definitely return fiir my next vehicle.  Negotiated price online and my truck was waiting at the front door when I arrived.  No games no bait and switch. I'm very impressed with ac Collins. ,5.0
18,"August 31, 2015","I had my truck towed in on Saturday I was told they would check it out on Monday or Tuesday. I called three times on Tuesday got no answers called five times on Wednesday before I got an answer out of Robert. He said it would be $3100 plus tax. When i got it back he said it $3100. They probably took some off because they broke some plastic under my hood, left one battery disconnected, spilled oil all over the motor, left two hose clamps loose, left greasy hand prints all over my truck and give you phony checklist of what they did. They don't call back, they didn't say anything when I picked up my truck, Robert never left his chair. What a service manager! I will never take a vehicle to these yahoos again.",1.0
19,"August 17, 2015",Good luck filing a complaint all they do is take your number and no one ever calls you back.    It has been exhausting dealing with this dealership and I wonder if Ford corporation bothers to follow up on the service they provide to the unsuspecting customer.  Consumer BEWARE!!!,1.2
20,"August 17, 2015","I have been quietly dealing with 3 months of sudden delays and newly discovered problems with my vehicle, but I have absolutely had enough. My car was supposed to be ready on the first week of June. I called, and they said they were waiting for carpets to come in and it would be ready on the 15th of June. I called that day and the said I needed a new module for my breaks and it would be ready in July. July came and my ""transmission was full of water."" My State Farm Agent in El Paso has had difficulties corresponding with the Houston agents, who in turn, have had a difficult time hearing from the individuals at this dealership. I am very cognizant of the fact that that the employees of AC Collins don't care about me or all the delays/inconveniences this has caused me. I would strongly encourage you to avoid this dealership at all costs.   ",1.0
21,"February 02, 2015","I have bought 9 new Ford trucks in the last 22 years, so I am a Ford man.
I bought my last truck a 2013 Ford F-150 Limited $50,000.00 truck from AC Collins Ford in Pasadena, TX. 
I also bought all the maintenance service plan which I thought wasn’t a bad deal for the price, until I started to use it I have taken it in for service @ AC Collins Ford 3 times since and it has always been an extensive wait time for typical service oil and filter change should be 30 minutes or so, Not here I have waited anywhere from 1-2 hours every time I have took it in to AC Collins. I have taken it to Gullo Ford in Conroe, TX 1 other time and the wait wasn’t near as long and great customer service.
So to get to the point AC Collins sends you service rating review every time you get your service done, I didn’t seek out to complain in a service request, they asked for it, so if you ask I assume you want the truth so you can correct or attempt to correct the problems, that is not the case @ AC Collins.
I completed the service rating reviews as requested, I stated that the normal oil and filter service takes too long 1 ½ hours on average and that if I would have known this I would not have purchased the maintenance service plan and that the lady and gentleman at the service desk were very nice and professional.
I get a phone call a couple of days later from a person that says he is the General Manager of AC Collins Ford and his name is Steve Peacock and he stated very rudely immediately that obviously they can’t please me at AC Collins Ford and I am not welcome back and need to take my business elsewhere, I was dumbfounded by that statement and asked him is this really how he treats his customers and not try to resolve the issue just treat them as if they don’t matter he then stated yes and slammed the phone down. I have never been treated and disrespected so bad by any business.
Steve Peacock with AC Collins Ford I would not return there for any reason and will also be telling all my friends and family to avoid this dealership and your bad business practices. 
I told my fiancé a few weeks ago (before this incident) to look at the new MKC Black Label (she has always drove Audi) she since ordered one from a different dealership which will be in in a few weeks. I told my fiancé about this and she wanted to cancel her Lincoln MKC order and I explained this is just AC Collins Ford it has nothing to do with Ford itself.

22,"December 23, 2013","I went into the AC Collins Ford dealership by my home because it is very near to my house.  I actually bought my truck from anther dealership and had a VERY pleasant experience there.  The Ford emblem came off the back of the tailgate after I went through a local carwash.  The reverse camera is housed under this emblem.  I'm thinking this is no big deal so instead of driving all the way to the dealership I bought the truck from, I went to AC Collins.  I showed the serviceman what happened (my truck is two weeks old today) and he said it wasn't covered because it was ""outside circumstances"" that caused it to break.  Never mind it is two weeks old OR that this piece should not be so shotty it came off after one car wash.  I realize it seems to be a cheap part but the truck itself wasn't, I bought the best warranty I could and the emblem hangs down and interferes with the view on the camera.  So after offering NO help, like maybe going to get a manager, looking up the parts, looking about the warranty I bought-the man actually told me, ""My service manager wouldn't even look at this"", I left.  I then called the dealership I bought the truck from and they said it is totally covered and I am taking it there tomorrow.  This is my second bad experience with AC COllins and I will never go there again.  They are not interested in customer service at all.  I am flabbergasted that the other Ford dealership told me the part is covered yet it wasn't at AC Collins.  How could two certified Ford dealerships be so different?  So sad they could care less about the people that walk through their doors.  I will never recommend that place to anyone else either.

24,"November 13, 2012","The car I bought brand new from AC Collins Ford has now been back to them over 5 times for various problems.  Most problems have been in their shop at least 3 times and still have not been fixed.  Every time I get my car back the warning lights or issues occur that day or within a week.  Plus I always seem to get it back having more problems than when it went in.  I have been completely stranded by my car and no one returned my calls to figure out what we need to do to get this fixed so I don't have issues with a brand new car.  They have lied saying they called me but couldn't get me, when I have had no missed calls or voice mails from them.  Fix Or Repair Daily has been my nightmare as well as Found On the Road Dead. I had a problem with my hatch trying to close on it's own while I was getting my things out of the back, nowhere near the keys or the button to close it.  I called Robert, service advisor, and he didn't return my call.  When I called because my hatch completely opened itself while I was working exposing all the things in my car Dave Evans, service manager proceeded to give me a lecture about not leaving things in my car.  Instead of saying they'd fix it he just lectures me and then proceeds to say ""Well I've never heard of that happening"".  I believe they invented door locks so that people could lock their cars.

26,"March 30, 2012",The salesman was friendly & helpful and the used car was serviced before I got it. Ray even came to my home and delivered me to the Pasadena dealer for work on the car and kept in touch with me after the sale to see how things were going. I am very satisfied with my experience with A C Collins Ford.,4.8
27,"February 14, 2012","I wanted to surprise my husband with a new truck for his birthday and I am still in shock that I was actually able to pull it off.  My salesman (very new to the AC Collins Ford family) in my opinion, had a tough job to do being that this was a surprise for my husband and I wasn't able to just come in for one visit with the trade in vehicle to get everything done.  After I explained to him (over the phone) what we had to trade and what my husband was looking for and that the deal would have to be done in pieces and completed in a short period of time, he never acted like he was nervous about pulling it off & to be honest, his confidence concerned me a little.  To my surprise, the deal went off without any problems, no hassle's, no stress - I kept waiting for the bump in the road, but it never came to pass.  The selling price for the new 2012 truck that we purchased was unbelievable, never in my life have I EVER had a dealership discount so much money off of the MSPR Sticker price on a vehicle that AC Collins did.  I told my salesman (Armando) what the payoff was on the trade (negative equity), no down payment and where my payments needed to be and not a penny more which must include GAP Insurance because we don't purchase vehicles without it...and this young man, determined young man delivered the smoothest transaction that I have ever experienced.  Not ONE phone call telling me there was a problem - of course he had help from the more seasoned team/family that he works with at AC Collins, from the sales manager's to the finance team that provided us with an amazingly sweet deal.  This dealership has been around as far as I can remember, from when I was a little girl and they had a small dealership off of Shaver in Pasadena to the beautiful dealership they now have off Beltway 8 in Pasadena...you don't stay in business for as many years as they have been doing business if you aren't doing everything right...no one is perfect but I can personally attest to the fact (from a used car deal with them back in 1998) that when something did go wrong, the did not hesitate to make it MORE THAN right!!!  They DO care, and they WANT YOUR business and it shows, no one else will ever get any of my business when it comes to a new or used vehicle purchase.  I could go on and on (I already have) but there's nothing like experiencing for yourself just how much they DO want your business and just how great of an experience you can have if you give them the opportunity to earn your business.  If you are seriously in the market for a new vehicle - give Armando De Los Santos a call at 281-604-FORD and be ready to be amazed, I am still amazed and forever grateful for my experience with Armando De Los Santos and the AC Collins team - my husband's 2012 Ford F-250 Super Duty Diesel 4X$ that he got for his birthday is EVERYTHING he wanted and MORE - I can't describe how happy he (we) are with it and I can't describe how GOOD IT FELT to be able to pull off a huge surprise for him for his birthday.  He is the most deserving man I know and it's something that we will NEVER forget!! 

If you are seriously looking for a used vehicle, call Armando, I am sure that he will get you in touch with one of their used car salesmen that will treat you just as well as we were treated. I STAND AMAZED...LIFE IS GOOD!",5.0

29,"June 17, 2011","I came in to AC Collins Ford ready to look (not buy) new vehicles.  I dealt with Rick Derragon and Max Collns and they were both AWESOME!  The only reason I drove from Conroe to Pasadena was because they were referred to me by a family member.  I was very glad I did!  I was treated as a very valued customer.  I have purchased many cars and never been treated quite like that.  They far exceeded my expectations as far as customer service goes.  I look forward to going back next year to purchase my spouse's car when we get hers.  Thank you so much, Max and Rick!  I refer all my family and friends to you!",5.0
30,"March 10, 2011","I had been looking at a used car for about a week online and decided to make an appointment to test drive. I spoke to Mark and set a day at the end of that week to come in. I told him over the phone I had my own financing and a trade, I told Mark that I did not live in Pasadena and I wanted to make sure if I like the car that it would not be a waste of my day and gas to get there. He assured me all would be well. I gave the man exact numbers! When I arrived, the first thing he did was forget that we had spoken three different times, and he lied!! He said the car had just come off the truck!! Not true at all. I had seen the car online two weeks prior. To make things better the car I was to purchase was filthy!! They had a week to at least wash it. One of the ac vents was in the floor!! I drove it around the block and decided to just go ahead and purchase. When I went back in Carolyn was to do the paper work. She was on the phone with another customer for at least 15 minutes. The entire time she talked about her physical therapy, her kids, how her husband is a stay at home dad. Oh and how she was doing me a favor by staying to ""help"" me out. She should have been gone hours ago per her doctor. Whatever! She acted shocked when I told her the numbers I had given Mark. I was clear on what I could do and could not do!! Carolyn said she had to ask ""him"" who ever that is, if the deal could be done. She was gone long enough to make me angry and ready to walk out. When she came back she didnt give me a counter offer just asked if I wanted to use one of their financing options. When I said no thank you and got up to walk out they all acted shocked. Mark was genuinely shocked that a guarenteed sale was walking out the door. He told me the car would not last the weekend. Well Mark, its a week and a half later and the car is still sitting on the lot. Shame on you guys! I should have had you fill up my tank! The three hours of driving back and forth for nothing makes me never want to go out of my area for a ""good deal"" again. They treated me as if their time was more important than mine. This is just part of how poorly I was treated at AC Collins Ford in Pasadena. ",2.0
31,"September 04, 2010","  I went to A.C Collins Ford with my fiancé looking to test drive and possibly buy a Ford Fiesta.  When we got there, we saw a gentleman standing outside smoking a cigarette ignoring us.  It took about ten minutes, when we had to approach him, for him to even acknowledge we were there.  We even had to ask to speak to a dealer.  I’m not sure what the business practice is at this particular dealership, but it is obviously not customer service.
  When I did finally talk to a car dealer and started negotiating prices, the dealer refused to listen to what I had to say and attempted to sell me a car I was not interested in.  He did not work with me whatsoever nor did he care to work with me.  
  I would not recommend going to this dealership if you are serious about purchasing another vehicle.  They have very poor customer service skills and are not willing to listen to you or care to listen to you.  If you are looking for a car salesman to negotiate with you, avoid this dealership at ALL costs.
