0,"June 17, 2020","This experience is with the SERVICE department only. I have had little issues before but this one was the worst. I will not return to this dealership again. I will pay a toll and drive further to avoid West Houston INFINITI's service department.

I setup a Saturday morning appointment to get the oil changed on my car and inspect a couple of issues. When I entered the dealership, Oscar Q. was my Service Advisor. I explained to him that the passenger front seat makes a rattling noise at speeds of 65MPH and above. I then told him about the 2nd issue. The brakes are becoming very hard to modulate. He told me that there will be $180 diagnosis fee which I accepted. He had an iPad-like device in his hand the whole time I was in his office and was entering data into as I was speaking. A few hours later, I received a text indicating that the car was ready. The text had a link to an online report. The report only addressed the brake issue but not the noise problem. I then called Oscar and he said that he forgot to include the noise issue because ""we switched to discussing the brake issue"". So I asked him when he can take a look at the noise issue and his response was: My technicians left for the day and will not be back until Tuesday. Then he told me that the door noise diagnosis will cost me another $180. I explained that this was not what we agreed on. That after telling him about the two issues, he quoted me $180 for diagnoses. It was NEVER mentioned that this is per issue. Had he told me that each would cost $180, I would have said, no thank you. His answer was: I can take the car for a test drive myself and tell you if I hear a noise but can't do anything else.

Any way, I went to pick up the car and when I got to the cashier's desk, I asked to speak to a manager. The lady behind the desk told me that the manager left and will not be back until Monday. That's when Service Advisor Josh J. asked if he can help. I explained to him what happened and he said: Clearly my associate made a mistake and I want to make things right for you. He even offered me a loaner for until the car is fixed. That made me VERY happy. Sounded like he got to the root of the problem and was going to fix it. We had a very pleasant conversation and he said he was going to print some paperwork and then get the issue addressed. He left the room for a few minutes and came back with a whole different story. He suddenly said: I'm sorry but I have to be fair to my technicians... I need to charge you $180 because I am going to send two technicians to listen to the noise. I have to be fair to them. 

Wow, what happened in the few minutes he left the office?

I waited until Monday and called the service dept to talk to a manager. They told me the manager was on another call and I could leave him my information to call me back. I did. It has been over a week now and nobody called. Well, enough is enough. This is not how you treat a long term customer or any customer for that matter.",1.0

8,"March 24, 2020","It was a pleasure working with Daniel Saucedo. He is patient and is as thorough as he can be. There were some post sale issues I had to hold management's feet to the fire on. You promise in order to get a deal done, you better be prepared to pay up. Management did, but didn't make it pleasant. Jack Pearson may be good for the dealership as sales manager. But the petulant look on his face and body language when he had to authorize work wasn't only noticed by me but others, as well. It is better to control your reactions and body language. Then go in to your office and throw a tantrum, out of sight.",4.0

11,"February 14, 2020","Going through the search, negotiation, finance and completion process of purchasing a new vehicle is not among something we like to do. However, after working with West Houston Infiniti on the purchase of our new vehicle, I felt compelled to offer this review.  If asked what one word describes the difference, I would have to say transparency.  From our first contact with Ryan R. in sales to working with Steven T. in finance, we believed there were no hidden agendas or information that might impact this purchase.  The friendliness, professionalism, product knowledge, and willingness to go the extra measure made the ordeal almost seamless and certainly trustworthy.  It still took an inordinate amount of time. It still required lots of patience, but major purchases should not be cookie cutter or abbreviated exercises.  
We have done business with a number of the other Houston dealerships, but we have found one we trust and will recommend to others.  Thank you, folks, for an unexpectedly satisfying experience.

13,"October 23, 2019","Bought a 2019 QX30 which  had about 12,000 miles-like new.Rollback or dealer demo-don't really know. Got good price and good trade in on my non-Infiniti early lease return.
Just went back to dealer from Galveston Island-about a three and a half hour round trip to West Houston for some dent repairs and a new emergency key that were promised at purchase, but had to be ordered from Infiniti.
Needed a frame for front plate which was not in car at purchase. They happily provided and installed it.
Dent repair guy actually found several dents and beautifully repaired them, all covered by dealership.
Bottom line? They did as promised, didn't try to nickel or dime me.Treated with respect, Salesman Austin even offered to drive me to Whataburger since it was lunchtime.
Overall a very positive experience ,making a less than perfect car into a very positive car buying experience.
My wife loves the car and I even got to drive it again today!",5.0
14,"August 03, 2018","This is for the inept service department.  Based off their inability to repair my car they said I needed to have some body work performed to fix my problem.  $1900 later it is still having the same problem.  Also, Ray in their parts department is garbage and should be fired for the way he is allowed to talk to customers.  The fact he is still employed there is a direct reflection on the management at West Houston.  I bought my car there, which was a great experience, Ray and the lack of service I have received from the service department made it my last.",2.0

Now we have been presented with the title that has infinity as the title holder along with a ""letter"" saying it was an error and we are the title holder.

19,"April 24, 2018",Michael Pal was very helpful in finding the exact car I wanted. I really appreciated his insight and non-pushy sales technique. I'm very happy with my purchase and will definitely refer my family/friends to Mike. My only negative is that my certified car was still dirty when I drove off the lot. The detailing service is seriously lacking. The detailing garage should be better lit because they obviously missed a bunch of dirt on the console. ,5.0

41,"March 23, 2018","I contacted West Houston Infiniti online and received a call from Ryan R. very soon after. I had been shopping around and had a price in mind already, and after 15 minutes of working with Ryan we hit my target and things were moving. I drover over to the dealer from Austin and and left with my car 24 hours later.

Ryan understood my situation of being in Austin, and didn't try to pressure me to come in before reaching an agreement on a vehicle. This was by far one of the most painless leases I've done. By the time I'm reaching out to dealers for pricing I know what I want and just want to nail down a price and sign paperwork. Where most dealers were very inflexible and difficult to get to the point of agreement, Ryan did not waste my time and was helpful through the entire process.

I'm extremely happy with both my new car and my experience at West Houston Infiniti and would definitely recommend them.",5.0
42,"March 22, 2018","BAD CSR ever!!! BUYER AWARE
I purchased their warranty for dents, rims, windshield and key for $2000. I came there for a repair and they denied to fix the windshield however they fix my rims. Came back and they hired a third party to fix my rims instead of their certified services. Also, my house is 1 hour away from the dealer, i dropped off the car at 2pm, they gave me a phone call at 5.30pm tell me to be there before 7pm or they will charge my credit card for the loaner car. As you all know 6pm is a really bad time for driving from galveston to katy  Showed up at 6.45pm and non of the csr served me. They kept pushing me around and told me they had no idea about my car. The rims looked so bad like they dont even touch my car. 
Also when we first purchased the car it was late so they told us to come back and they will pump gas in full for me. I came back 2 times and they didnt do it at all. ",1.0
43,"March 21, 2018",Overall it was a great buying experience except for the used car department not giving me what I felt was a fair value for my trade-in. My salesman was able to get the to raise the offer $500 but it was still way low for what the car was worth.,5.0

45,"March 16, 2018","I was not going for any other reason but to get an idea of how much my vehicle of choice would cost and to drive one to see if I was even comfortable.  I was planning on purchasing a new vehicle in the summer or fall of this year.  I was truly surprised at the price and how willing the team was to convince me to leave owning a new vehicle by negotiating what I wanted based off of the needs expressed.  Needless to say, hours later I left with the vehicle of my dreams and it has more than exceeded my expectations along with the team I worked with.  ",5.0

Brought the car back today to have the tow package installed, was given a loaner car, and the work was performed and the car was ready as promised by Bennie Bynum.

I contacted the dealer through the web and after several texts and phone calls telling them what I could do and selecting the car I wanted, Daniel Saucedo was excellent, took his time explaining to me the features of the car. It only took a few minutes with Daniel and his manager Chris Reed to reach a deal that worked for both of us. Be sure to do your homework before you go into any dealer; it actually makes it easier on both sides if you know the incentives and invoice cost on the car. Edmunds and TrueCar are great for this. Once we made the deal, we came  back a few hours latter to sign the papers and Robert Stoltz in finance made the process simple. 

I like the fact West Houston Infiniti is locally owned. Their ratings on the various dealer ratings sites were so positive I almost didn't believe them, as few car dealers have great ratings and that's the nature of the beast. 

Finally, this is my second Infiniti; I previously owned a 2010 G37 and it was a great car. But Infiniti has upped their game with the QX30; it's the same basic car as the Mercedes GLA 250, but with Infiniti styling and handling. I think it looks great and drives even better. Go for the Bose surround sound, you'll be glad you did. While the backseat and storage are not that great, it's the perfect car for me, as I am a consultant and will be driving to client meetings the majority of the time, with some supplies, but nothing huge. 90% of the time it'll be just me or my bride in the car, so again, it's the ideal entry level Infiniti for up and comers, as well as empty nesters like we are at my house.

Learned from the service tech that my error code was for a catalytic converter issue that is a ""known problem"".  Read up on the internet that many owners have had mixed reviews about this low standard of design from Infiniti.  Service rep told me Infiniti's warranty covers it, but my ""third party"" warranty they pushed on me in the finance department was hardly ever sold and didn't cover this repair at all.  I was shown a  pamphlet for the warranty and not the laminated sheet that has items not covered.  Had I seen that, my husband who is a hobby advanced level mechanic would have rejected it right off.  I don't know why I wasn't shown that particular layout, but I feel very disgusted with their finance department and with Infiniti for even putting that 3rd party warranty out there.  Don't buy the third party extended warranty.  The finance man told me it covered everything except normal wear and tear parts like tires and batteries and brakes.  That was a generalization and a lie.  I'm really disgusted.  I researched the code issue and found that if maintained properly (archoil 6400-g fuel additive every so often), a catalytic converter will maintain proper operating function.  I bought  a bottle on the internet for $18, added it per instructions and ran almost a quarter tank of gas and the error code disappeared.  Infiniti was ready to replace my catalytic converter off the bat for $2300.00.  Just like that.

The car doesn't even have a single ding on it anywhere. And headlights do not need to be waxed. I took the car to 3 body shops all of whom told me that waxing had nothing to do with the paint or the headlights being in such poor condition.

440,"May 13, 2014","I originally had scheduled maintenance performed on my vehicle (April 25th). I informed Gary Wilson that the passenger side window had a leak and made a howling noise. I was informed that it would be looked at and addressed accordingly.

I picked up my vehicle on Saturday; however, the issue wasn’t truly resolved. I returned the vehicle on Wednesday to get the window fixed (again). The next day, I drive an hour (dealing with nightmarish traffic) to pick up my car, only to have to drive home another hour in my loaner vehicle instead.

Come to find out, a technician didn’t calibrate the window correctly, and the entire window shattered upon the closing of the door. I didn’t have to waste two hours of my life had I been told of this over the phone. 

That’s not even the worst part. Since my car was at the service center/dealership for 11 days, there was ample time for the thief to steal my Xbox 360 and Kinect without being detected by surveillance. My wife works extremely hard as an elementary teacher in order to provide me that Christmas gift, and now some dishonest person is enjoying my mishap.

I understand completely that I’m held liable for personal belongings left in my vehicle when I signed the waiver. I invested all this time and money to have services rendered at West Houston Infiniti. I could have avoided this entire ordeal had I choose not to get the window replaced. I put my faith in them, and this is how I’m repaid.

They could easily remedy this situation by replacing my personal belongings, but apparently they’d prefer not to spend a few hundred dollars and lose my business over the next 4 years. They’re in the business of providing customer service, but I’m now a very unsatisfied customer. Southwest Infiniti never looked so good. ",1.8

I also get the good expert advise and being very patient and detailed in explaining the schedule services to what need to be performed on my Infiniti M37S by saving money from my pocket and not to forgot I have also been offered for drink or coffee :-)

On a lighter note I am little not convinced with the operator/receptionist as they suppose to give me a call back which I never received and as a result I have to call back in which result in some time loss

Having said that, this was my first service and experience with Infiniti West Houston and over all  I am highly satisfied and if they maintain and keep the same level of services I'm sure its very hard for anyone to go to any other place for service.

Dwayne DiMaria greeted me at the door and was very knowledge, kind and never PUSHY! I never felt pressured. I came to see the inventory of the 2013 QX56, he made me feel at home and let me test drive the vehicle.  He explained in detail the differences between the packages that the QX offered.  He worked closely with Hart Oshman, the GM, to find exactly the vehicle I wanted.  The whole process was simple, no hassle, no fuss!! It was painless.

Their customer service is far beyond professional and their knowledge is extremely spoken with great experience.

I had a list of preferences that we reviewed as basis for selecting a JX35.  Using my list, we reviewed the dealership inventory, inventory of dealers in close proximity, and special ordering the vehicle.  I compromised with a vehicle in the dealer inventory that had more equipment than I had wanted ,but the sales manager discounted the price reasonably.  The allowance for my G35S trade was also equitable.

When I took delivery of the car, Dwayne took a great deal of time helping with the registrations required to initiate several of the services included by Infiniti.  He also walked me through all the numerous screens and status software on board, including how to access each feature.  He is the most knowledgable sales representative that I have worked with.

When he contacted me regarding receipt of the car tags I set up a time with him to have the tags installed.  He was again friendly, helpful and expedited getting the tags and state registration tag installed.

We have been shopping around and were almost sold on a Toyota Sequoia.  We liked the vehicle, but found our salesperson uneducated on his product.  We were specific about the specs that we wanted, he told us they ""could get it""...but, actually, they could not. Thank goodness West Houston Infiniti is just down the street! 

As we were rushed to make an appointment after we signed the paperwork, I asked if I could return the next day to ask Dwayne to show me through all the bells and whistles!  Dwayne met me at the door, and proceeded to show me everything, in detail.  He programmed my garage door openers, taught me how to sync my iphone, and showed me how to use the nav.

We formerly owned a fully loaded Tahoe, and thought it was great.  (in fact, I loved it...until I met the QX56)  This vehicle really delivers on comfort, style and performance. My husband says the only thing he does'nt love about Infiniti is that they don't make a truck!   ",5.0
523,"October 27, 2011","I had dealt with West Houston Infiniti on the purchase of a 2010 QX56.  They were very fast, fair, and professional then.  This car buying experience was no different.  I asked Terry Epps, our salesperson from our first purchase there, if he could find us a 2012 QX56 with a few specific options.  He and Ricky Tejada found exactly what we wanted, and told me that it would be a about 3 weeks before they could get it.  About 10 days later, they called me to set up an appointment to swap cars because they were able to get it in early.  The trade in procedure, all of the paperwork, and the new car were all great.  The whole transaction took less that 2 hours from the first step in the door to the new car orientation and drive off.  

The entire staff at West Houston Infinity, especially Terry and Ricky, did a great job and they earned our business.  The facilities are immaculate, the waiting area is very comfortable, and the service department is fast and courteous.

We knew we had only an hour and a half to catch the flight, but no time to drive back to West Houston, get wallet (with I.D. and $1,800 cash in it) and make the last flight.

In a panic, I called the dealership. The nice receptionist named Molania transferred me to the service department. They stated the car was already being serviced, would check the car for the wallet while I was on hold.

Thank God the wallet was still there in the door side pocket. The dealership immediately sent one of the porters to IAH and met us at gate ""C"". Nothing was touched or missing from his wallet.

537,"September 22, 2011","Rating is 10 out of 10. 

From the top, Bubba Gentry the owner of The First Infinity Dealership in the United States - West Houston Infinity, down throughout the organization, everyone is extraordinarily interested in helping customers. Bubba was especially helpful in listening to each issue we had, and advising us on a strategy to solve each problem. His advice was outstanding - for example he suggested I switch cars with my wife (have her drive my AMG to keep mileage down) and for me to drive her 2008 EX and wait about 6-9 months to reduce the hit on selling the AMG which we owned.

We have had several challenges. Let me tell you about them. 

First we needed to replace an expensive car(2009 Mercedes C-63 AMG which I had bought a year earlier to replace my Porsche Turbo which I now could no longer drive because of my back) with a new 2011 EX-35 for my wife as she had been stuck with the AMG to keep the miles down - she drives 9 miles a day, I do 90. Oh, and of course dealing with the negative equity. They did a great job waiting until the right time and then purchasing from us the AMG and leasing to us a new 2011 for my wife in what I consider a more than fair deal. 

Next we just this week turned in a leased 2008 EX-35 10 months early to avoid over mileage.It was my wife's car, originally leased at 10,000 miles/year, which I was now driving. This week I ended up with a great 2011 EX-35 with everything I wanted including Lumbar Support and just gave West Houston Infinity the keys to our faithful 2008 EX-35. We received credit for being a good customer and did not even have to replace the tires on the 41,000 mile 2008 EX.  

Terry Epps our salesman was a very good listener and kept producing just the right car complete with explanations as to features and suggestions. He produced in 2008 a white 2008 EX for my wife when we moved here, another white 2011 EX for my wife (remember she was driving my AMG to cut down on the mileage) and now a Black 2011 EX for me. The exchanges he managed so they seemed effortless.

Ricky Tejada New Car Sales Manager was most helpful each time coming up with a deal that fit our circumstances, explaining the deal and its elements, answering the many question I had and getting us to close; Finance were always very careful to explain each document and listen to any questions or possible objections and smooth them all out to result in a very successful deal - each time. 

Service for all of our periodic services since we move to the West side 3 years ago has been excellent with scheduled service times, loaners if needed and clear explanations of what needed to be done. Typically they were warranty items that were free.",5.0

541,"September 02, 2011","I had a very good experience buying a G25. Dealt directly with Steve Titley and a minimum portion with Ricky Tejeda. Steve was great. Made sure that I felt comfortable and that I understood everything. I analyzed the guy since the beginning, and he didn't sell himself or the brand short. First question he asked me when we went for a test drive was: : &quot;tell me more about what you look for in a car and the needs you have?&quot; making those things the central part of the conversation more than the car itself was important for me. Hey, we all know Infiniti are great cars. It's like test driving a BMW to see if it rides well. You know it will, so this is more about you and your needs. So, he's a good seller...you got points for that Steve...haha! He wasn't pushy to try and sell me any car, but the car that I needed in the price range I was comfortable. I felt like the I was marrying the car at some point and I was getting to know the family. He made sure to explain all (from the leasing terms, to all gadgets in the car) and introduced me to everyone in the dealership, the manager, the finance guy, the recepcionist, the service guy, all the family...haha. He wants you to feel comfortable with what you're buying. I met Ricky Tejeda too, the Manager, and what I liked about these guys is that they're upfront and honest, which goes well with me. They make sure to back up the brand they have in front of them. It gave me the impression that they really respect you as a customer, the brand and their job. In the end, they understand that you might be back for another car in a couple of years, so it's clear to them that customer satisfaction is key and pays off at some point. Ricky told me: &quot;the real deal begins when you drive away with your Infiniti because we need to make sure we serve you as well as we've done it just to get you buy the car.&quot; This far, they've been excellent. If they continue like this, I might be back in a couple of year for another Infiniti. Let's see. Grat job you guys. Continue like that. I have to say they're professional. Expectable from Infiniti? Most definitely, but I went to Audi Momentum and they didn't treat me like that, for a car that was cheaper than the G25. You see Audi? I bought a more expensive car at Infiniti! Both cars are excellent, but at this stage of the game, the name is not car quality, it is called customer service and satisfaction. They gave me a discount for being a graduated MBA and also taxes free in a promotion they had. So MBA's, go to to West Houston Infiniti!",5.0

547,"August 05, 2011","I was looking for a third row vehicle to accomodate a growing family, and had never purchased an Infinity.  We visited a number of dealerships to compare different makes and models, and settled on Inifinity and the QX56 equally dues to the cost/benefits of this vehicle over makes and models, but also becuase we were most comfortable with the selling experience with Nick.  We also placed a lot of value on what we expected to be an easy longer term relationship with the dealership.  The service package and the 4 yr personal concierge service were huge advtages in my mind.  During my car selection process, I left 2 dealerships simply becuase I did not like (or have the time for) high pressure tactics.

549,"August 04, 2011","My experience with West Houston Infiniti was excellent.  I had done quite a bit of research on the Infiniti EX before I made my first visit to the dealer.  I knew what options I wanted, what price I was willing to pay (www.edmunds.com) and that West Houston had the exact car I wanted.  I called the dealer as I was on my way and asked for an internet sales person.  I spoke with Steven Sistrunk.  I told him that I would be there soon and what I was looking for.  When I arrived about 20 minutes later, he met me at the reception desk and apologized that another buyer had come in unannounced.  Being in sales, I totally understood and told him I would look around the showroom.  A few minutes later, Hart Oshman, approached me, asked for me by name and said that Steven told him I was coming in and he would be glad to help me.  Hart showed me the exact car I wanted to purchase and allowed me to test drive their demo model.  As it turns out, Hart Oshman is the general manager.  I was very impressed with this as many general managers are hardly ever seen in a dealership, let alone actually taking a customer out on a test drive while his salesperson is busy with another customer.  Once returning from the test drive, Hart asked if I had time to review some numbers.  However, I must point out that there was never a “hard sell” feeling coming from Hart.  About this time Steven was free to help me.  Hart and Steven brought over the numbers and I was extremely pleased that I didn’t have to get involved in the “mental warfare” of purchasing a car.  I knew exactly what I was willing to pay and their price was right on point.  I got a great deal and had a very pleasant experience doing so.  How many times have you heard someone say that?  We agreed to the deal on Friday, and I picked the car up on Monday.  Larry Bagley, in the finance department, was also great to work with.  He was very conscientious of my time and did his best to get me out as quickly as possible.  Steven did a very thorough job of explaining everything in the car and I was on my way.  He even put his cell phone number in the car phonebook in case I ever have any issues.  

One other thing I would like to point out is that West Houston Infiniti is family owned and not part of a massive conglomerate like many car dealerships these days.  I actually met the owner at one point as he was downstairs talking to everyone.  I was thrilled that I didn’t have to argue against a $500 “dealer services” fee that many of the larger dealers charge.  Why should I have to pay $500 for you to take care of me when I bring my car in for service?  That is the biggest “screwing” in the auto industry and, again, I was thrilled that West Houston didn’t even try to collect such a bogus fee.  I would highly recommend this dealer to anyone looking for a new Infiniti.  You won’t be the least bit disappointed.

In fact, it was no work at all on my part and it took only a few minutes to finalize the deal including the trade in value which was more than satisfactory.

At no time did I feel pressured to make a purchase right away, he seemed to have my best interests in mind which was quite refreshing and made we want to buy from him that much more.  My wife is also about to purchase a car so we did a lot of test driving for her car and he was extremely patient with her and my kids as well.  

I have owned other luxury brands before (Porsche and Lincoln) and the experience I have had with Infiniti so far surpasses by a wide margin the buying experiences that I had with those two brands.

We did not have to wait to be helped, and were never given any indication that we should have made an appointment, which we experienced at other dealerships. He was very knowledgeable about the vehicle and its billion features.  He asked what features were important to us, made a recommendation, and stuck to it - no pressure to upgrade to features we don't need.

575,"June 01, 2011","Dwayne was our main point of contact as the sales representative.  I visited the dealership a couple of months ago.  We were in the throws of trying to decide what to buy and had really opened up our thinking.  My wife's car is a Lexus RX and we originally thought we would just get another RX.  We decided to look more broadly.  I had never been to the Infiniti dealership, but stopped one Friday and Dwayne DiMaria offered to help.  Dwayne's friendly demeanor and helpful attitude was what drew me back.  I brought my wife back and Dwayne lined her up to drive several different models that interested us.  After looking at several different manufacturers and dealerships, the combination of the positive reviews of Infiniti's vehicles and the friendly and helpful service from Dwayne at West Houston Infiniti brought us back. We finally settled on the Infinit M37.  There happened to be an M37 on the lot that had just arrived, and Hart Oshman agreed to hold the vehicle with a deposit until I could get my wife by the next day to look at the vehicle and we could drive it.  The purchase paperwork, although time consuming, was made as efficient as possible by Beau.  Beau was very efficient and knowledgeable.  The overall shopping, deciding, and buying experience was very positive.  I would recommend the dealership.",5.0

Most of the negotiating, of which there was little as they gave me a fair trade value, was handled my Mr. Tejada.  The handling of the vehicle set up and orientation was done my Mr. DiMaria. Both did great jobs and I will not hesitate to recommend them to anyone I know.  I did the deal on a Saturday and Mr. DiMaria said for my wife (the car is for her) to call him anytime and he would do the orientation and set up all the electronics (seats, bluetooth, etc.) for her also.

Response was very quick and with precise answers to my questions, not with a hard-sales approach.  The price finalization process was painless and quick and straightforward, and my trade-in request was met.  But when it came time for delivery the best was yet to come.

582,"May 02, 2011","I've purchased many luxury vehicles in my life and none offer the excitement and satisfaction I've received from Infiniti.  The added bonus for me has been my encounter with West Houston Infiniti's standards and its staff.

I had moved away for several years to the Austin market and when searching for my then second Infiniti, and I made the choice to travel to Houston for a weekend to complete my search with my driving force being service and value.  My tried and true method of shopping was to complete my search at West Houston Infiniti and it once again proved to be the right choice.  I then purchased my 2002 QX4 (from Andre) with the intent, as was the case for many years, to replace the vehicle within two years.  These were different times for my family and I, so the visit to the Service Department was never a concern.  The sales staff is always professional and truly make my purchases very enjoyable, as they should be.  There is never any high pressure tactics used and I've always been treated with respect.  More importantly, the staff exhibits a high level of integrity, which is worth thousands of dollars in my opinion.

Although, we've continued to replace my wife's vehicle repeatedly, due to financial reasons and the enjoyment I get from driving my vehicle, I have now reached the 9th year of ownership of this said QX4 as well as 185,000 miles. I attribute that lengthy ownership to the service and parts department at West Houston Infiniti.  Although we're merely acquaintances in my relationship with the service and parts department, I consider them my friends.

As you may imagine, the care that an individual shows to a vehicle that gets replaced every other year is less than acceptable and so after keeping the vehicle as long as I have these things begin to show up, so hence the multiple visits to the service and parts dept.  The parts dept manager, Ray, not only remembers me, but takes the time from his busy schedule to take care of my questions with the patience of a physician and has a genuine conversation with me during the process.  Although I've had several different Service Advisors during the years, like Charlie, Mr. Martinez, and Joe, I've even received a ride home by another service advisor, Justin even after sharing that I had another arrangement already scheduled.

One important note on the reference of ""home""; I live in the Houston market area, yes, but about 35 miles from this particular dealer.  As would be common Houston knowledge, I pass other Infiniti dealerships to reach West Houston Infiniti because of the attributes mentioned above.  I have tried closer dealers, but I have not been fortunate in duplicating the service consistently as is done here.

In addition, Ken Sullivan the master technician most familiar with my vehicle, has taken extra care to ensure that I'm feeling peace of mind with each and every visit. His knowledge of Infiniti vehicles is amazing!  He can literally looks at my vehicle and in seconds determine what is wrong. He even reaches out to me personally to share his evaluation of my vehicle with me; nowhere has that ever been done before!

Add to all of this the fact that the most invisible people in this process (and definitely not less important) to most service department consumers are the porter and the Service Director.  Yet, I know the porter I most often work with by name, Juan, and he knows my vehicle and also interacts with me, the customer, where in most places they just walk away from your vehicle and you're left with the enigma of whether your car is ready to be taken or not.  And the Service Director?  The person most customers at other dealers never meet, Terry,  has made several contacts with me personally over the phone.  In fact, on one occasion, he personally drove my vehicle to ensure that all was well when I returned to pick it up.

This kind of service is truly unique to West Houston Infiniti and all I can say is ""Thank you for being so AWESOME!""  As you know, you have my loyalty!

599,"January 27, 2011","I went to West Houston Infiniti because they seemed to have the largest selection of used cars.  Unfortunately the salesman gave me a bad experience.   Then when we went to test drive vehicles, the sales person wanted to sit in the front seat and have my wife sit in the back!!  Since my wife of course is going to help me with such a big decision I nixed that one and he was genuinely put off.  He insisted on showing me stuff while I was driving which wasnt great, but I admit it was interesting.  He tried to discourage me from test driving a sport model because he did not feel I would like it (even though that was important to me to know and feel the difference, he acted put off).  Then when I found a car that I might be interested I asked him what their lowest price was, that I wanted to do more shopping but I wanted to know.  He gave me a typical runaround, that he was not just going to lower the price, but if I was serious he would work with me on the price (in other words I might lower the price but who knows how much,and it will take you hours to find out how much and by that time you will wish you were at the beach).  You would think that I wanted a secret from the CIA and FBI, just to tell me their best price.  I finally got out of him a price (advertised price), which he conceded he could give me, I began to wonder what kind of store is it that they will not tell you their price? If I was not serious why would I ask him a question like that in the first place???  I left feeling like I liked the car, but that the price should be better and they were more interested in squeezing the last dollar of profit than actually moving a car off their lot (3 weeks later car is still there!). I found a better value on a vehicle with less miles a few miles down the road and came back to buy touch up paint and later floor mats.  

Rather than telling me congratulations or conceding that it was a better deal in most every way (except for the certification thing - hardly worth the $3-5000 relative price differential, he began to suggest that the car had been in an accident, asking me if they had x-rayed the paint.  The car had been certified by another dealer, and frankly I do not know or care how their 137 point inspection compares to Infinitis 156 point inspection.  I had satisfied myself that they inspected it for frame damage, flood damage and the rest would be worth the 3-5000 that I was saving.  Here I was patronizing their dealer for parts (twice) - the parts people are really nice, and this man ( I do not want to cause him personal embarrasment or pain by using his name) was each time trying to put my new car down.  Perhaps he can read this and find some improvement, and sell more cars.   This individual is a good dresser, but I believe, he kind of gives used car dealers a bad name.  I have bought a used Infiniti from another dealer, and I can tell you some used car dealers are great, so I am not comparing him to an ideal, but rather his peers.  He could have made a sale that day, but I felt like not going back to that dealer because of his attitude.  If you have ever been to a high end store for anything and gotten the idea from the person there that they are used to serving a better quality of person than you ( in the way they treat you are put off by most requests, and do not talk straight with you about what is going on), than you know exactly my experience with this sales person.",2.3

601,"January 03, 2011","My first experience with Westside Infiniti was by eamail.  Mr. Dwayne DiMaria responded to my email and invited me in to visit the dealership.  I was hesitant as I walked through the doors. Previous experience had me cautious and apprehensive that I would be meeting someone who would treat me as just another customer.  However, as soon as I entered the doors the receptionist was very professional.  She greetinged me and asked if I would like a drink.  I informed her that I was there to meet with Mr. DiMaria.  She was very calm and professional as she called him on the phone. The atmosphere in the dealership was relaxing and very intimate.  I found  Mr. DiMaria to be very personable, warm and truly interested in ensuring that I was comfortable.  He was no nonsense and did not engage me in unproductive conversations.  I was treated with dignity, courtesy and respect from the moment we met.  We went on a test drive of the EX-35.  I found the experience to be very rewarding and knew that I was a valued customer from the moment I entered the doors.  During the process I had the opportunity to meet the manager, Mr. Tejada and several other members of the Westside Infiniti team.  Each person I interacted with treated me as if I was the only person in the dealership.  Their attention to the customer was outstanding and the warm and inviting environment was the best experience I have ever had while purchasing a car.  I would highly recommend anyone planning to purchase an Infiniti to start at this dealership.  You will not regret the time and attention the group admonishes on each customer.
