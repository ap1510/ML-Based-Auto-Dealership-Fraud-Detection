0,"August 19, 2013","Amazing family oriented dealership!    From the initial call, to my visit, purchase and follow up, Central Yamaha went above and beyond to work with me and make sure I was completely satisfied on my purchase of 2 Yamaha Cruiser Waverunners!   Jason and his staff have top notch customer service and competitive pricing.    Our salesman, Jim, was so easy to work with, answered our questions and went above and beyond on the entire experience.  I will be recommending Central Yamaha to all of our friends!",5.0
1,"May 07, 2012","I have visited this dealership many times over the years. Jim, in sales, has been very helpful in finding the bikes I needed. In fact, I bought my first Yamaha raider in 2008, through Jim's help. I sold it in 2010 on consignment through this dealership, because I needed some cash. In 2011, I bought a used 2009 raider S. The bike recently had a lifter problem, which would have set me back ~$900. I worked with Sean in service, who did an excellent job with the repair. In addition, he also spoke to Yamaha customer service because I had called the company and wanted them to cover the repairs for me. In the end, the Yamaha company covered the repair because the lifter problem is a known issue with 2009 raiders. Thanks to Jim and Sean, I have enjoyed trouble free riding over years.",5.0
2,"October 15, 2011","Bought a Roadstar back in 06.  Had it in for service at Central Yamaha a couple of times in the first year.  Always extremely pricy and always a long time in the shop.  Started taking it to another place.  Last week, I had it inspected and I needed a new rear tire.  Same day I received an email from Central Yamaha indicating free installation if I bought the tire there.  Called parts and they told me the tire would be $149 and they knew nothing of the email I was sent.  Called service, they told me the deal was for 50% off and the tire would be $169 and asked if I could print the email and bring it in they would honor the email. I took my bike and the email in and they put the tire on the bike with free installation.  The bill $204.00.  They charged me $191.00 for the tire.  Not only that but told me I had to have the steering bearing repacked.  Service manager said it would be about 2 1/2 hours and if I brought it back the next day (Saturday) it was first come first serve.   Also told me it was dangerous to be riding the bike.   Took my bike back in Saturday morning.  Called Saturday afternoon and they had not looked at it yet.  Called back on Monday and still no luck.  Service guy told me they would call me when they could get to it.  They called Thursday afternoon to tell me it was ready.  The service manager explained that when they quoted me the 2 1/2 hours ($91/hour), that was the ""standard"" price for a Roadstar. My bike, which was in the shop when they quoted me the price, had a windshield and road lamps which they had not accounted for.  These had to be removed and it took over 4 hours.  Price $400. Picked up bike and it was filthy with greasy handprints.  Hard to start and stalled 3 times on the way home. So, I originally went in for a 1 hour rear tire replacement that should have cost $149.  Ended paying over $600.  3 different prices for tires, 2 different prices for service work and 5 days longer then expected and bike runs like crap.  The funny thing was while I was waiting for the tire to be replaced; I had been working with a sales guy on an FZ1 and was ready to buy it as a second bike.  Now, would not spend another dime in that dealership and probably wonâ€™t buy another Yamaha",1.2
3,"October 14, 2010","STAY AWAY!!!!!!I took my road star in to have it raked and rear end lowered. I was told it would ride better with these modifications. I got the bike back, the front end wobbled,very dangerous to ride. I took it back again, they said they fixed it, it wobbled even more and handle bars shook. Every mechanic and forum I talked to  gave me the same answers of what was wrong with the bike, the mechanics said "" I agree"", but said "" I needed other parts to fix it"". They also scratched my 500.00 brand new headlight and then denied it. According to all my research, this shop and its mechanics have ""no idea"" what they are doing. After all was said and done and taking my bike there ""THREE"" times, I lost 1400.00 dollars and got a scratched headlight!! On top of all that, I was talked down too, argued with, and this was the worst I have ever been treated by a dealership! I would rate this dealership with an overall of ""one"".",1.4
4,"March 24, 2010","Had to have my carburetor cleaned out on my dirt bike. Dropped the bike off and it took them 2 weeks just to look at it and tell me what needed doing, the same as I told them when I droppped it off. Then when I eventually got my bike back and parked it at home in my garage the very next day I noticed a puddle of oil on the floor, my forks were leaking. Never a drop of oil leaked out of the bike then as soon as I have it wored on here my fork seal has gone. When I called about it they just told me it was probably ready to blow and tieing it down in my truck popped it...Coincidence??",2.4
5,"September 20, 2009","This is the worst possible place you can bring your Motorcycle to be repaired. Most common answer when checking on my bike was ""We'll call you tomorrow"" That lasted 3 weeks before I took my motorcycle back from them. When they returned my bike to me, it was in pieces. They refused to put it back together, and they charged me $87.. Their prices on parts and repair are the highest of all dealerships around. Not to mention they treat you like an idoiot.
When researching their website, you find parts prices, which are lower than the actual price in the store. So driving there to pick up your part will cost you more than if you order it and wait 3 days. How does that make any sense at all?
As far as a complaint to management, GOOD LUCK. Apparantly noone is in charge over there except for the owner, who is NEVER there. Basically the inmates are running the prison over there, and they all HATE customers.
I will sincerely NEVER be a customer of that store again and I reccommend the same for anyone that is considering using this dealership",1.2
