0,"May 20, 2020","Absolute terrible place to purchase/lease car. The salesman Matthew Pluta and sales manager Terry demonstrated extremely unprofessional behavior with multiple lies, excuses and refusal to honor a lease deal discussed in detail at the dealership (3 hours!) just the day prior! Next time just be honest and tell your customer you changed minds on the deal rather than coming up with nonsense see through excuses. 

Apart from my experience, I witnessed quite a pushy salesman trying to prevent a disinterested elderly couple from leaving. Couple had to lose their temper a bit before he backed off! 

Can just imagine what other craziness goes there. Strongly advise checking the multiple other Volvo dealerships in the area before considering this one and if you just have to, definitely avoid Matthew and Terry! ",1.0
1,"November 28, 2019","My schedule was pretty busy when I was looking for a new car and because of that I didn't want to go around to all the dealers so I decided to talk to all of them via email. All the other dealers gave me a feeling that didn't want to do a deal via email, most of them wanted me to come in, which I understand but my schedule was just too tight. Adolfo H. at Grubbs was the only one who seemed like he wanted to make a deal work, he was very responsive, made sure we landed on an agreed upon price, and once said and done he even delivered my new car to my home. I've never gotten treatment as spectacular as what Adolfo and the Grubbs team provided, above and beyond anything I could ask for. I don't imagine I'll be needing a new car anytime soon, but when that time does come these guys are the first ones I'll be reaching out to. ",5.0
