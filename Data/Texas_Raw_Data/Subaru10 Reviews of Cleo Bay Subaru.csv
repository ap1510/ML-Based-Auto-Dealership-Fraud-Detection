Mimi told me yes when I’ve heard no so many times. Thank you Mimi for going above and beyond me for me !!Thank you so much Cleo Bay Subaru!!!

2,"May 09, 2018","We were deciding between two cars and decided to go to lunch to think over our options.  We made our decision and immediately returned to the dealership.  We were told be our salesman that the price that was physically on the car was wrong, and they screwed up.  He went to talk to the sales manager to see if something could be done to correct their screw up.  The sales manager (Jon Locklin) introduced himself and asked if we wanted the car.  I said “yes, but at what price?”  He showed us the window sticker with a freshly printed add-on slip (not the same one that was physically on the car) that was more than $6000 more.  xxxxxxx didn’t apologize for THEIR screwup, or even offer negotiations.  He just flat out lied and insulted us.  STAY AWAY, SHOP ELSEWHERE!!!!!  ",1.0

The process was smooth, easy and pretty fast..  The service so far has been amazing.  The folks in the service department are even nicer!!!

5,"June 17, 2017","I sold Cleo Bay Subaru my 2016 Nissan Maxima with clear title and was told my check would be here in 7 to 10 days.  It's now 12 days and the sales manager - Jon - said it would be Monday before he can determine anything about my check.  My car was on their lot for sale two days after they purchased it from me, which means they had to have title transferred by then or they couldn't sell the car.  

Watch these guys.  I will make certain to let everyone know about my experience.

6,"June 13, 2017","Rarely does a dealer get positive marks for refund processing.   But Kristen who processes warranty cancellations was really most helpful.   She communicated through the process often and did
her best while busy and multitasking to get the refunds processed as quickly as possible.  I had a great experience when buying, and thru service, but 
was most impressed with Kristens professional 
Handling of my warranty cancellation and refund.
Really top level employees all over at Cleo Bay Subaru.",5.0

A+++ to Jason-service advisor, and the crew Cleo Bay Subaru!!!  I don't normally write reviews for dealership service departments unless I get exceptional service.  I am not an employee of Cleo Bay.  I am a new customer, active army, who just PCS'd here from New York. It's our 3rd PCS move and each time it has been a priority to find good mechanics to keep our vehicles (investments) in good working order.  After our 1,800 mile drive we had a minor issue with the Honda Pilot. I heard good things from one of my soldiers about Cleo Bay, so I went to their Honda dealership. The service advisor/mechanics there fixed the problem and discovered a potentially serious issue with suspension caused by all the salt from the roads in upstate N.Y.  The preventive maintenance was cheaper than a steering arm failure on the highway.  We were instantly won over to Cleo Bay.  They referred us to Cleo Bay Subaru for our Subaru Impreza.  About 1month later I hit a deep pothole in the road at about 40 mph.  A couple weeks after that I noticed the car pulling to either right and left.  Certain that I had damaged alignment or suspension I brought it into Cleo Bay Subaru.  I was prepared for the worst possible scenario and repair cost, alignment, parts replacement labor, etc.  There, I was met by Jason, service advisor who in-processed our vehicle for inspection.  He recommended services that had just come due at 30k mi., however, since this is a leased vehicle we passed on the services that would only benefit us if we were not going to return the car in 8 mos.  I brought it in early Saturday without an appt so wasn't sure how long it would take. They gave me a ride to the Killeen Mall where I relaxed until they had more info for me.  When Jason called me, to my surprise, they found that the problem was not as bad nor as expensive as was feared.   They found 2 things.  Hitting the pothole had knocked the weight off my right wheel, so it only needed rebalancing.  There was low air pressure due to a small staple that had pierced the right edge of the same tire.  Since the puncture was too close to the edge of the tire it could not be repaired; it had to be replaced. They did have that same tire in stock and pricing was well within our budget.  Whenever Cleo Bay does work on a vehicle they also do a safety check on it.  Their mechanic identified a dirty air filter that needed replacing.  A picture was sent to me via text so that I could see the filter's condition.  I authorized the air filter replacement, which has improved both fuel economy and power.  Jason's and the crew's attention to detail at Cleo Bay Subaru made the search for our new mechanics ""too easy.""  They earned instant customer loyalty, and when we have to re-lease our next vehicle we will just drive to Cleo Bay to pick one up.  You can't put a price on vehicle ""piece-of-mind,"" and at Cleo Bay you won't pay an arm and a leg for it.  I highly recommend Cleo Bay to anyone.  They will work on any brand of vehicle too.  A word of warning, however, if you are already have a favorite mechanic your loyalty will change after going to Cleo Bay.  Your old mechanic will be looking for new customer.",5.0
