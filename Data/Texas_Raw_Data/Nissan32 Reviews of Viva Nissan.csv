0,"August 21, 2019","Kindly do not go to this dealership eventhough if you have warranty cover work. They will come up with stories that does not make sense. I took my 2017 Maxima for front sensor replacement due to malfunction and recevie message on my dash board. Service Manager Mark and Advisor Jessie told me that if warranty does cover than I have to pay $125 for diagnostic, plus part and labor if decide to that route. I did not leave my car and went to different nissan dealership in town very next day. Gues what they replaced the sensor wiht in 2 hours without hassling me about warranty. My car was under warranty for 36k and 3 yrs and had only 26000 miles when I took it. I will not recommend this dealship for anything. ",1.0
1,"August 15, 2019",Purchased brand new car.  100% serviced at same dealership year after year.  Failed state inspection for window tint that was on new car when purchased.  Dealer unwilling to own this issue.  Blame state for changing rules.   No ownership.  2 Vehicles purchased (Titan and Altima SR).  Lost my business. ,1.0
2,"July 03, 2019","Made a credit card payment at Viva Nissan that was never sent to Nissan Finance, of $375.
On May 11th I made a credit card payment for the tax title and license of $1381 and of $375, a total of $1756. The $375 was to bring the purchase total to $16,600 since they were showing a balance due of $16,975 which was not reflecting a payment I had already made online with Nissan Finance to already bring the balance to $16,600. Alexis Soto the finance employee handling the purchase order said not to worry the payment made at the dealership would be sent to Nissan Finance and they will realize I made a double payment and refund me. As I spoke to Nissan Finance on 5/31/2019 for the last time they said they cannot refund me money they did not receive from the dealership. They only received the check from Bank of America sent of $16,600 which they received on May 20th after Viva Nissan received it on the 15th of May.When I spoke to Viva Nissan for the last time on 05/31/2019, Alexis Soto told me regardless if an error was made they will not be able to send me a refund. He said that is just not the way things work at the dealership. Alexis said no one told him to send the $375 to Nissan Finance as part of the payoff amount so he is not going to send it to them either. Alexis Soto said that I gave a down payment at the dealership, but as I mentioned to him that was noted incorrectly because the amount I paid was to pay for the tax, title, and license that cannot be handled through Nissan Finance and they asked me to go into a dealership so they could work on the tax title and license for me to get the lease buy out completed.
The BBB has contact Viva Nissan twice and both times there has been no response. Very disappointing of organization to do this.

On Cars.com Review, Viva Nissan asks for a call to be made to the manager but the manager has been unable to reach me. Going on a week for them to call me back, but if they cannot contact the BBB they will not contact me. If the manager wanted me to call back he would leave his name or direct line instead of having me try to guess who I need to speak with.

4,"August 10, 2018","horrible customer service from the sales manager ALEX SOTO i have never been treated this way he treated us like garbage. ! will never in my life go back and i will make sure all my family and friends know the way he talked to me so they will beware of going there ! sales person JORGE MENDOZA was very nice but sales manager he was a whole different case. !

i went in today with my mom looking for deals we made it clear when we got there we wanted to see options since my mom didn't have any down payment or a good credit we didn't want anything too luxurious or expensive since interest would add on a good amount to the price because her credit was not good they wouldn't give us any prices until they showed us the card had my mom drive it and have all our information taken down well i ended up lending her 500 so process would go on smoother with a little down payment no they couldn't make it work they were trying different things they told us the price and the deal i was making calculations and price was just too much with the interest for car we were getting we understood it was her credit the problem we just kindly told them that we couldn't well sales manager started getting ugly with us telling us that we weren't trying to buy a blender we told him we understand that of course we do i'm just saying i cant right now thank you very much and he told us that why did we make them work so hard then if we weren't going to buy ? ah isn't that there job? isn't that what they're their for? i mean idk but i was very offended and very mad by his reaction to us not being financially able to go through with transaction i mean we weren't trying to make them work too much is not our fault they didn't want to be straight up on prices when we got there and them taking 2+ hours to do their work that is not our fault ! very disappointing i will be calling customer service because this came from a manager i mean what example is he putting to his employees there supposed to give good customer service and today i felt hounded like i had to get it even though  i didn't want to .",1.0
5,"May 09, 2018","I took in my 2015 Sentra for a scheduled service and Benito was the Service Advisor who attended me  he was awesome!  He  was very delightful to talk to and took my car in right away for service,  it was in and out quickly.  While I was waiting for my car to be serviced I shopped around and met a wonderful Sales person by the name of Jorge Mendoza.  Mr. Mendoza was so friendly and professional that I ended up buying a NEW 2018 ALTIMA!. I am delighted with Viva Nissan they are all wonderful people. I would recommend this dealership to anyone who is looking for a car. The manager of Viva Nissan Mr. Johnny Pattinson was very approachable and really nice. This car dealership is awesome! LOVE IT!!!",5.0
6,"March 20, 2018","I believe the car buying experience starts with the sales staff. Upon arrival to the dealership we were greeted very kindly, listened to and provided expert knowledge about the car that was of interest to us. The sales reps were very precise and direct in their knowledge and ability to understand our needs. We did not get pressured or promised anything but reassured we had come to the right place. Jonathan Addison, Marcos Mendoza, Mario Carbajal, and Shawn Diana should be recognized in front of their peers as among the best Nissan has to offer. ",5.0

15,"December 21, 2017",Mario Teran was great in helping with our purchase.  Our entire experience was top notch from the wonderful facility to Mario showing us vehicles to the sales manager Jonathon Addison helping us along every step of the way.   They are not sales people but men of honor who happen to be selling cars.  I appreciate that.  This is first time buying Nissan but won't be our last.  ,5.0

22,"November 22, 2017","The auto buying process at this store was superb! We were greeted by the courtious staff when we entered. We were provided with an awesome quote for the vehicle the very first time. No games with ""Let me ask the sales manager"", ""Let me ask the owner"", ""Let me ask,,,,,,"". After the quote was provided, there was no pressure to accept and purchase the vehicle. We went home. There was no follow-up phone call, text e-mail, nothing. If you have visited other dealers, you get the idea. We returned after a few days and asked to test-drive the proposed vehicle, we did and purchased the proposed vehicle. The entire process was fantastic! Other dealers had tried playing phycological games and tried to use manipulative tactics to push us into purchasing various vehicles, there were no such games from the sales associates at Viva Nissan. If you are looking for a new vehicle, try this dealer first. Thank you Frank (sales), Omar (sales) and Johnny (GM)!",5.0
23,"November 10, 2017","Our sales person Richard worked hard to get us the car we wanted. He was friendly, curtious and knowledgeable about the process.  We had a few obsticles and he worked to make it happen. ",4.8
24,"October 06, 2017","From the start our salesman, Andres Quintero was friendly and attentive. They were closed on the Saturday we stopped by due to a big sale on Sunday, but he still helped us and answered questions about the vehicles we were interested in. We could not come in on Sunday but made it in later in the week. Andres and John, the sales manager, worked out a great price on the 2017 Nissan Rogue Sport SL. There was no need for back and forth haggling like I’ve had at other dealerships. If you’re looking for a new Nissan I highly recommend you give Viva and Andres the opportunity to help you find your perfect car. ",5.0
