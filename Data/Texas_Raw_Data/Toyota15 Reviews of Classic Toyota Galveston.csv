0,"October 21, 2019","I live in Houston and bought a certified pre-owned Prius in Classic Toyota Galveston. A week and 100 miles later wipers are not working, the odometer panel is fogged with a condensate under the glass. A Toyota dealer near me estimated about $900 in repairs that were supposed to be performed prior to certification and sale. I am hesitant to go back to Galveston to deal with these people. Will repair wipers on my expenses and address the odometer later.    ",1.0

2,"January 19, 2019","I chose Classic Toyota because its close to me. Upon arrival to dealership I met with Christopher Santiago and Mina Baher. I explained which truck I was interested in. Picked it out and went inside to do the deal. Both Chris and Mina were outstanding in the buying process. Then I met with Terry Newell to complete the process of the financing. These 3 men were outstanding in the whole process of this deal. I am very pleased. If I ever want or hear of anyone who wants a Toyota, I will certainly direct them to Classic Toyota.  ",5.0

4,"June 29, 2018",Was able to work with me on a deal for a brand new car. I was shown great customer service that exhibited a fantastic and friendly environment by all employees. A specific employee personally took care of all questions/needs through phone/email and showed an equally great attitude when meeting in person. A dealership that all island residents should take advantage of.,5.0

7,"November 10, 2017","Classic Toyota is an amazing dealership with a fantastic customer service team! Just wonderful personnel!!! 

Sabrina Walker went above & beyond to get me the best possible price on my new Tacoma! Dave Becker answered all my questions!! I am one of those crazy customers: I question everything, but the staff here never flinched! They stayed calm, cool & collected while helping me understand the process of buying a new car. Brian Barnes is also awesome, Debbie in finance was very nice as well. I had a great  experience purchasing my new car, again I can be one of those difficult customers (maybe...lol), but it did not stop Classic Toyota from doing there very best with Class!!! If your looking for a new car, give Sabrina a call!!!",5.0
8,"November 11, 2016","My wife had been lookint at and driving Highlanders. We live in Baytown and had been visiting Community Toyota. They treated us well each visit, but did not have the car we were looking for. I got online and an ad for Galveston Classic Toyota came up and I clicked on the site. A short while later Tito Marshall called me and we had a pleasant visit about the Highlanders. We made an appointment a week later and met Tito. We looked at new Highlander Limiteds, but saw a preowned 2015 up by the show room. Long story short, we bought the preowned Highlander and are very pleased with our decision. The folks at Galveston took really good care of us every step of the way. It was Tito who made us feel very comfortable and we felt like we had known him a long time. There was never any pressure and everyone we came in contact with was very cordial and thanked us for out business. We have been very satisfied with our vehicle and our buying experience at Galevston Classic Toyota and Mr. Tito Marshall.",5.0
9,"August 19, 2013","I was looking for a new car and found a version of the car I wanted on the internet and decided to visit Classic Galveston but had another deal lined up that I was 99% sure I was going to go with but wanted to see if this dealership would deal. I had bought a car from them when they were still Sand Dollar and had a positive experience then.

I go there knowing which car I was after and found it and looked at it. Andre Epps approached me and we started talking and they had marked the car down to a great price and that's why I decided initially to go there. Andre wasn't aware of the internet price and quoted me the full price but I quickly set him straight and started negotiating to the point where he had to get the sales manager (Brian Barnes) involved.

When I started talking to Brian, that's when it got serious.  We negotiated a decent trade in value for a car I was trading and then he gave me his best price after I told him about the other car I was considering and we discussed it at length.  There was no hard sell here at all, all he did was give me the facts on his car and the 2012 previous year new car I was considering at the other dealership (Star Toyota). I kept pushing and pushing to get him to deal but he couldn't go lower and said no several times so I knew I had pushed him to his limits and I had his best deal.

At this point I wasn't quite sure I wanted to go with his car and so I left (and they let me leave without chasing after me).  I went to Star Toyota and got their best price (only it wasn't) and was $500 away from buying that car but they wouldn't give me the exact pricing I wanted and didn't deal like they should ( until they found out I had committed to Classic Toyota later).  I decided to go with the Classic Toyota 2013 model but ended up paying $1700 more (wife made the decision on a couple of factors).

I'm happy with the way the whole Classic team treated my wife and I, from Andre to Brian to the low pressure finance guy who didn't try and up sell a bunch of crap I didn't want.

So on my inevitable next Toyota purchase I will start with Classic Toyota in Galveston and probably not deal with Star Toyota due to the games they play and inability to give you their best price right from the start. Star Toyota was my 'hometown' dealer (have bought two new cars from them, one recently for my daughter about a month ago) but now believe Classic will be my 'hometown' dealer. I firmly believe that Classic has to try harder due to their lower customer traffic due to being in Galveston so when they get customers in the lot who are serious about buying they try harder and treat them right. Star Toyota can take you or leave you as there is always another customer coming in.",5.0

13,"July 18, 2012","Sabrina Stokely and Don Conley were very accomodating.  I have purchased many cars and I have never received customer service like I did with the two of them.  They are great and I will recommend everyone I know that will be buying a car to come to them.
All  of the staff came to greet me and to make sure that I was truly satisfied.  I give Classic an A+.

I am enjoying my car.",5.0
14,"July 14, 2012","Our recent purchase of a new 2012 Camry SE was the most enjoyable auto buying experience I have ever had.  Ms. Stokley was very straighforward on e-mail (Carwoo) and bid to exactly what we were initially looking for.  Many of the other respondants were obviously trying to sell us what they had on their lot. Everyone we talked to at Classic was very focused on customer satisfaction and providing exactly what we wanted. Everyone was very professional and honestly friendly. After a test drive, we changed our mind and decided to buy the SE.  Ms. Stokley put together a good bid again based on the exact options we wanted. They had to get the car from across the city of Houston from another dealership but had it in and ready to go in 2 days. Ms. Stokley's manager (Lesa) was a key part of success in the process in negotiating with other Houston area dealers to get the exact vehicle we wanted. This is in stark contrast to my earlier buying experiences where the manager usually was part of a bait-and-switch or good-cop/bad-cop routine. 
The entire experience was very positive. This is the first time my wife was willing to accompany me during this process. All our previous car purchases were so unpleasant and came across as hard sells, harrassment, lies, bait-and-switch, etc. that she had long since sworn off any participation. She has recommended this dealer to several of her friends describing how positive and enjoyable the total process was for all involved.  My follow-up activities with the dealership and Ms. Stokley have remained very positive, totally focused on customer satisfaction and most importantly - honest and sincere.  Ms. Stokley, her manager and this dealership have set a new standard for us for any future auto purchases. Our thanks to them for changing the auto dealer image.",5.0
