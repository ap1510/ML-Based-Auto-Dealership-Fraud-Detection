06-10-2020
What started out as simple windshield replacement, on a Subaru that I purchased from this dealer one month ago, turned into a week long process of trial and error. I dropped my car off on Wednesday, June 10th and picked it up that afternoon. I gave them the benefit of doubt when I picked up the car. When I got home, I noticed a number of problems. The wipers were 4-6” out of place, which caused the wipers to go off the side of the vehicle when turned on. There was a glob of glue/epoxy smeared across the paint of my vehicle. And, there was a ½” gap between the bottom of the windshield and cowl. This gap is normally sealed to prevent liquids and dust from entering into the engine bay under normal conditions. Without a seal, liquids could run down the windshield and cause corrosion in the engine bay if left alone. So, I immediately brought the car back once I realized these problems and the service representative agreed with me that this was unacceptable. We scheduled to have it fixed the next day. 

06-11-2020
The dealer sent a team to my house and drove my car to their shop and called me when they had fixed the issue. Once I got there, I inspected the gap and it was still there, just slightly smaller – now maybe 3/8” instead of ½”. I pointed it out and then was told the windshield is too short (OEM part) and this was the best they could do. I was disappointed in that response. I took my car down to the Subaru body shop and asked them if this is a normal thing when replacing windshields on my particular car. He had his glass professional inspect it and was told the cowl was broken in the process of removing the old windshield. The body shop then gave me a part number for a part that would fix it. Went back to VW McKinney to inform them of the inspection, and they agreed to fix the mistake. The part was ordered that day.

06-15-2020
 Once the new part was received, I brought my car to them again. They removed the cowl from my car and then realized the part was wrong. VW issued me a loaner car at this point, since they did not want to pay the mechanic to put my car back together. I respectfully accepted the loaner.

06-17-2020
VW found out the adhesive was not installed properly and reinstalled the windshield. They also went ahead and installed the new cowl. When I picked up the car, there was still a gap. After the third attempt for this dealer to fix a simple problem, I took my car home and fixed the problem myself in a few hours. I disassembled the cowl and added a bead of RTV sealant to the cowl seal. Once the cowl was installed, I applied painters’ tape to hold everything in place and added some weights on top until the sealant cured for 24 hours. After the cure time I removed the tape and weights. The cowl looks brand new and has a proper seal.

I can not say that I recommend this dealer for service. The service representatives are very nice people, and their shop was very nice, but after this experience I will not be taking my car back for any kind of service.

1,"March 02, 2020","Update 3/3/2020 I took my VW to another dealership this morning. They diagnosed the problem. High pressure fuel pump. They will have it ready for me to pick up by 1:00 PM. I asked about the list of things the McKinney VW said. The brakes will need to be replace some time in the next year, the recommend a brake flush. The coolant is clear and normal (McKinney stated it was like milk). The rear sway bar bushings are in good condition, no replacement required (another thing we were told it needed). Keep in mind that the items that were called out by McKinney was performed by their Shop foreman :SAMUEL MURFIN!!!! Needless to say, I have reached out to VW USA. I will update when I hear back from them. 


Extremely displeased. Brought my car in for a stalling/poor idle problem. Told no fault in the system. Asked if they duplicated the concern, no answer. But wanted to up sell brakes, brake fluid flush, coolant flush, tire rotation, alignment....
  They say the reason for the stalling and poor idle is that my car requires an oil change. I approve it. They tell me that but a ton of miles on the car to verify the fix. Great. I drive it home. It idles bad still and stalls almost at every light. Their Lead Master Certified technician SAMUEL MURFIN insists that it was fixed. Well, nope, still have the same problem. Will not be back!",1.0
2,"December 15, 2019","I purchased a vehicle.  There was damage that was missed during the final walkaround (that was done after dark).  I brought the vehicle back in within 2 days and was told the policy was that if a vehicle was sold damaged, they were not responsible unless the damage was pointed out before I left the lot.  It was confirmed with a manager that no matter what the damage was, since I left the lot with it they would not be responsible even if it was there before I purchased the car.

Edit:  After about 2 weeks of fighting with them, they agreed to at least bend it back into shape.  I don't really care about the aesthetic blemish and after bending it back it does look like new from any distance.  I would have preferred that they had made it new or that I had not bought a damaged vehicle in the first place.  Lesson learned: inspect the vehicle you buy VERY closely and consider taking your own pictures before you leave the lot.  I'll be raising the review to reflect the fact that at least something was done after 2 weeks of leaving negative reviews and complaining to every manager in the building.  

Shane House was finally able to help me out.",2.8
3,"November 21, 2019","Even when the service center is slammed, the Mckinney Volkswagen team goes above and beyond to make sure that I am well taken care of and quickly. When the work went longer than expected, I was given a loaner vehicle immediately to make the drive back down to Dallas. The next day, they drove all the way down to Dallas to swap vehicles with me. Above and beyond service. Thanks JR!",5.0
4,"November 08, 2019","I just recently moved to Mckinney in April, I've visited Mckinney VW Service center twice within that time frame.

BOTH times I received my vehicle worse than given. The first time my vehicle was not giving me any alignment issues, it was not pulling to the left or right, but they recommended an alignment and I agreed since it's normal service and I figured I needed it. When I picked up my vehicle not even 5 minutes into me driving back home I found my vehicle pulling drastically to the right!! I texted them and let me know, I will they responded quickly and fixed it as soon as possible by picking up my vehicle from my job.

The second time was last Friday.  I specifically took my car in to get a health inspection and oil change since the road trip I was taking was an 8-hour drive!! I specified this and they returned my vehicle with 30 PSI when its suppose to be 38PSI. My TPMS light went off within 5 mins of me driving. Needless to say, they can simply avoid issues like this by implementing QUALITY CHECKS. They wouldn't have so many unhappy customers. I won't be returning at all. I will drive to a different city to service my vehicle. ",1.0
5,"August 12, 2019","Poor experience my wife and I traded in an Audi A3 for a 2018 Tiguan.  I was promised a new tire that had a sidewall indentation and to be reimbursed for a door damage the A3 door when i receive the final audi invoice. 

The audi invoice came in and over 5 trips to the dealership in almost a year, Trae Gibson sales manager and my sales person Christopher Riddle, have never come thru with their promises, only excuses.

I would not recommend this dealership",1.0
6,"April 27, 2019","This dealership helped us out with negotiating our car payments down to about 40-30 dollars below what it was originally, they we’re very helpful with explaining how to use all the features and advantages of one car over another and helped us save a considerable amount on our payments.",5.0

9,"February 02, 2019","I went in to look at a 2019 jetta they advertised for $15,381.  They had the exact car on the lot and tried to tell me that the price was without additional features such as the nitrogen in the tires and the key replacement, tint, and other crap.  It is no wonder that car salesman rate just slightly above below politicians and pond scum on the trust scale every year.  I then went to another dealer of VW's on 121 in Frisco (Hendrick) and they played no games and dealt with me professionally!  I am shocked at how anyone with a fourth grade education would fall for the stupid tricks and offensive attitude that was on display at the McKinney VW store.  This same family owns other dealerships and their reputation in the Ford business is the same and goes back years and years with dealer add ons, bait and switch, and other games.  If this is the way that it is on the lot then you know you haven't seen anything yet.  Just wait til they get you in the finance office and they try to tie you up like a pretzel with their fees and ridiculous games that bump the rates, or extend the length of the note.  ",1.0
10,"February 01, 2019","After driving 4 hours to this store with the intention of purchasing a specific used vehicle from their inventory, my girlfriend and I were dumbfounded at the unprofessional way the final negotiations were handled.
The store reduced the internet advertised price on the vehicle days before our visit, and though the sales desk presented a worksheet with the advertised amount listed at the top there were additional 'Pro Pack' fees designed to 'recoup some money' (the Sales Consultant's words).  Additionally, not knowing how to handle a transaction with an out-of-state customer with different numbers on different offers indicated the store employees were not trained in that area.
The final straw was when another store employee came in and informed us that, even though we had arrived and test drove the vehicle first, 'someone else in the store has already pulled the trigger' and negotiations ended.
Needless to say we left without purchasing anything.
We would not recommend this store to anyone looking to purchase a vehicle.

12,"October 30, 2018","I will give 0 zero stars but the system doesn't have. The service manager is unprofessional, rude and do not have any people skills and Respect for the customers.
I have the video where he is coursing and yelling at one of this dealership customer's. It's the most Unprofessional and discussing way to treat somebody.

14,"October 04, 2018","I was very pleased that I was able to take my Beetle into the dealer within an hour after I called for an appointment. They graciously gave me a loaner car as I had to work the next day in the afternoon. but it didn’t take all day! They had it ready the next morning at 11 am. (I had taken it in at 4 PM the previous day.) My service person was courteous, clear with his explanations, and very considerate of my time. Thank you, Chris!!",5.0

17,"September 04, 2018","I’m visiting my family from South Carolina. My Passat hit the 30,000 mile mark. Time for an oil change. 
I called on Friday morning. And Brandon squeezed me in. Made my appointment for 1:00. 
I got there a little earlier. They took care of me right away. I used my car care plan coupon. For free oil change and tire rotation.  I wasn’t treated any different from a cash paying customer. 
Then I was notified by a video ( which was awesome) that I needed a wheel alignment. 
To be honest, I felt my car pulling a little to the side in my drive here from SC.  
So I accepted the service. Wasn’t to expensive. 
The only thing was that I waited a little over two hours. But I wasn’t complaining. Because I know it was being done professionally. 
Thank you Mckinney VW and Brandon!!!!! ",5.0
18,"September 01, 2018","The work was done without problems, it took 2 hours. It was a busy day so the time was expected. My only complaint is that the website is poor. I could not successfully schedule my appointment online. I went through the online chat and tried to schedule through that, whoever was on the chat said someone from service would call me back with a specific time, no one ever called.",4.0
19,"August 30, 2018",Josh in the service department was great. He kept me informed and up to date. Also was great letting me know the exact details of everything done,5.0
20,"August 22, 2018","Their sales process feels like a scam, smells like a scam and on top of that, they treat you like you are plain stupid, like they are doing you a favor!

We were ready to buy a new car. First, they dont tell you the exact numbers, we had to ask many times to be told what the exact interest rate was. Then, we run the numbers on a Volkswagen finance calculator and the rate they were applying was some 40% higher than the one we were being informed. That happened twice. I guess their finance people are really bad at their job or.... they think their customers are dumb.

Second, we were asking for specifics on the ""protection package"" that was part of the deal and they were doing all they could to not show us in clear terms what was covered. We were being coerced to sign the check for the down payment without seeing those details although we asked for those repeatedly from three different people. 

Third, and the last straw, the working paper with all the details on the deal showed the car had some 200 miles on it and when the final papers came, it had some 500. And we were sarcastically asked why we didnt check that by ourselves when we test drove the car! That's when we left.

This was by far the the worst experience I ever had with buying a car, I will not come back and will take my business to a serious respectfull dealer elsewhere.",1.0
21,"August 04, 2018",Excellent service. Friendly helpful folks.  Very thorough. And professional. Great dealership. Outstanding service Dept.  Josh went out of his way to be helpful and explain everything to me about my car. Suggested I needed an alignment but was never pushy. Totally was my decision to agree to do it then. Glad I did!

45,"February 01, 2018","I value politeness and attentiveness from anyone selling a large ticket item such as a car, house, grand piano, etc. McKinney Volkswagen are definitely courteous and attentive to my needs and desires concerning a car. They listened to my early lease termination story and helped me to decide whether to turn it in or keep another year. No pressure just to sell a new car. They just gave me options. I ended up getting the new car but in no way did I feel as if I was being herded in that direction. 
I recommend buying a new VW there if that's the car you want. ",4.6

54,"December 18, 2017","The service staff is always really good, but it is obvious that this is not a dealership you go to if you have a used care and just need to fix the basics. The only down side is that the repairs do not seem to always be corrected as I have had to return a couple of time to get the repairs right. Example. I just brought in for brake lights to be repaired and they still do not work. Now I'm going to have to take off work again to bring the car back for them to look at it and fix it again. When you're charged the amount of money that they charge for repairs and labor,  you would expect that the repairs are done right the first time. ",2.8

57,"November 29, 2017","My rating for this company would have to be poor when dealing with used vehicles. This may not be the case with buying new, but do not buy used. I communicated with a sales rep 2 weeks before I purchased my vehicle. I explained I was 6 hours away, and would have to get a babysitter so I could take my wife up there with me to drive the car back( I had a job an hour away so I would just drive to work and she would drive back home) the only questions I asked: is the car in good condition, and has it been wrecked. The pictures looked great and I was told everything was good except the seat extension inside. We communicated multiple times up to the day I left after work, drove ?till 1:00am? got a hotel room then woke up and left out early to be there early enough for me to still be able to work when I got back to paris, TX. When I showed up everything was great till we walked out to see the car. There where scratches on both driver side doors, the front quarter, back quarter and runs in the paint on the bumper(runs in the bumper meaning most likely it was replaced, but there was no information about that). I’m not a real picky person but these where extensive. When I mentioned them the rep said it’s a used car. It’s going to have some scratches. So I took him out there to look at it, and he immediately agreed something should have been said about it before I drove 6 hours and rented a room. After that I told them I need 500 off in order to get it looking descent(my father inlaw owns a body shop. He quoted me 1200$ I just planned on fixing the 2 doors and maybe the front quarter) but they said their guy could do it for 200$ so that’s all they would take off. So I asked if they would do it and I would pay the original amount… then excuse after excuse. One guy kept telling me they do all their work on the inside of the vehicle, and that he personaly would prefer a company that fixes the mechanical issues over someone that just covers it up… needless to say the check engine light came on before my wife made it home. So In summary they told me: I should have asked specifically about scratches…. I just asked if it was in good condition assuming they where professionals. And I was told I should have had someone come look at it for me… you know, cause I guess I could have asked my buddy in Houston to drive up there lol. Probably would have only been a 8 hour round trip for him. No matter what effort you put into making it there under false pretenses of the vehicles condition, don’t expect much compensation. We agreed on 23500$ 2 weeks prior then when I told him I would have to either drive my wife back home lose a day of work then drive back(12 hours of driving) he told me he could go down 200$ so after almost pleading with them for 2 hours we ended up at 23200$ so expectation: nice car for 23500. What I got scratched up car that will cost 1200$ to fix and a check engine light warning 3 hours out … but hey that 200 payed for gas.

I was told by Joe that we can get the total discount at $8,250, bringing the car to 23,885. When I drove 1.5 hr from Downtown Dallas to the dealership, I was given a completely different price, upper $25k almost $26k. Joe told me that in order to get the full $8,250 discount, I have to purchase $1,800 (3 oil changes) extra stuff that he did not mention about in his emails. He mentioned that the online website said that this $1,800 package was stated (we checked, it does not).  I also let the dealer ran my credit because I thought we already agreed on the purchase price and we are just looking at closing the deal. This is the nastiest thing I have ever seen a car dealer does. We agreed on a price, and then ran my credit and increased the price.

I passed that vehicle down to my child and purchased a new one for myself.

72,"May 14, 2017","Had my '06 Passat towed in with  'Steering Column Lock!'  and 'Immobilizer Active!' messages. It has one of the electronic push in keys. Car would start but then immediately die. 

Initial diagnosis was replace the electronic steering wheel lock module for around $800. Agreed to that service charge. The car has been very reliable for years and that was reasonable to get another 150,000 or so miles out of her. 
Update from their 'Service' department. It needed a new Comfort module, since the new steering wheel lock module was not compatible with the old Comfort module. THAT doesn't make sense and whatever that comfort module is. Why would VW (or ANYONE) build parts that are not compatible with their existing parts. Another $800+. 

Had enough and decided to purchase a CPO from them. When I asked to get all my items out of the '06 Passat, they drove it round to let me gather everything. xxx?... it drives

I do LOVE Autobahn VW dealership in Ft Worth and brought the '06 Passat there for EVERY service even though I live here in McKinney. 

There is another issue with the Sales department (new CPO purchase) here in McKinney, but I will post that in another.

78,"December 12, 2015","A few weeks ago I went to the dealership to look at a used passat I had been looking at online.  I showed up close to closing due to my crazy work scheduled, but a friendly sales associate named Aaron Kingsley offered to assist.  We test drove the car and discussed its features.  He did not seem disinterested or rushed due the the time.  Ultimately I decided it was not the right car for me.  Aaron offered of course to assist in finding the right one when I was ready.  I explained to him that this was not a primary vehicle and I was not really sure if I would be purchasing at all.  
I spoke with him again about a week later, he asked if there was anything he can help with (as expected a normal sales followup call)... I explained that my work schedule is insane and unpredictable and I really didn't know when I could come back.  I didn't receive any pushy phone calls in the meantime as I normally do after visiting dealerships.  
A few weeks later I returned with my wife to look at some other vehicles...After test driving just about everything on the lot.  I was still no closer to making a decision yet Aaron and the Sales manager Greg Wells were still accommodating.  I never heard any of the typical car dealer xxxxxxxx like ""what can I do to get you in a car tonight"".  I never felt pressured to ""run credit or numbers on the spot"" like you will often experience at dealerships.  
Again we returned and on this visit after discussing vehicles Greg offered different financing and lease options, again still not having actually run credit.  Ultimately this tells me that they are less concerned about the making the sale than earning a customer.  
I originally started this mission looking at 1 used vehicle..My wife and I decided to get 2 new ones instead.  I came home with my 2016 Jetta sport this evening and my wife will be picking up her 2016 golf S this coming week.  The entire experience was exceptional from start to finish.  Kudos to James Cassels in the finance department for the same no pressure experience.  
I am very easily turned off by the ""typical car dealer experience"" and this was most defiantly not typical.  Aaron Kingsley is a huge asset to the company.  Good job everyone.  
I only hope the same experience continues in the service dept in the years to come.

Well if that's the case then I was cheated when I bought the car brand new from your guys because It has done this since I bought the car from your dealership 5 years ago. They told me then that it was due to the ""Auto Hold"". I find it hard to believe that I need a whole new transmission! The car has been mostly been serviced by Randall Reed's service department.

121,"November 20, 2013","After much research and being a fan of diesel power, I brought my girlfriend, Kristina Dixon, to this dealership last year and again in May when she chose to purchase a Passat TDI.  We were extremely satisfied with every aspect of the vehicle and dealership.  This past Saturday I brought Kristina in for her first service and decided to look at pre-owned stock in search of a second vehicle for myself.  I had been considering either a jetta or golf, tdi, manual, stripped down, nothing fancy - just a second vehicle to conserve fuel.  After strolling the lot for a bit and admiring one or two tdi's, Bobby Owens approached and introduced himself.  With absolutely no pressure we took one car after another out for a test drive until I settled on a new 2014 Golf TDI.  He made everything effortless, zero stress, zero pressure, zero hassle -  the same experience as we had before when getting Kristina's.  Once we had everything settled with Bobby, he past us to Susan Johnson who made the transaction official.  Susan is an obvious staple of this location and made the paper work fun; a real pleasure to work with just like last time.  We pretty well had the whole deal done by the time Kristina's car was out of the service department.  Our family now owns two VW TDIs and will be customer for life and continue to send friends and family to this dealership so long as the dealer makes no drastic changes in policy or personnel.

Mr. Snow makes the car buying experience for his customers an event they look forward to and not dread.  Mr. Snow is not only a great ambassador for Randall Reed Volkswagen, but for the entire auto industry as well.  Also, you will also not find a group of more accomodating and friendly people than at Randall Reed Volkswagen in McKinney.

136,"June 20, 2013","As a 42 yr old professional who works with a large Fortune 100 corporation in a sales based division, I understand the sales business.  I can honestly say that of all the car buying experiences I have had in my 42 years all over the state of Texas and South Carolina, this was by far the absolute best and most comfortable buying experience I have had.  I attribute this to the comfort part of my statement.  Right from the very beginning, from the very first contact Mr. Owens made with me, the communication was in such a manner to make me, the customer, not feel as if the dealership was desperate for a sale and only interested in the sale, but was such that it made me feel as if they were interested in me as a customer now and from here on.  In this day and time with an immense lack of trust in big businesses, especially sales based businesses, that factor, the comfort factor is immensely important to capture not only the sale, but the customer.  Further, in this day and age of web based communication, word of mouth can spread more rapidly than at any other time in history.  Because of that, a single bad experience by one customer, whether true or not, could cost an organization hundreds of thousands of dollars in sales.  Comfort is by far the main reason I continued to speak with and ultimately purchase my vehicle from Mr. Owens and Randall Reed.  The attention to detail from introducing me to the service manager to showing me everything I needed to know about the new car and down to going on a search for a very nice key chain were all part of a great buying experience.  However, any dealership can do that.  What Mr. Owens and the staff at Randall Reed did was ensure me and communicate in such a manner that I didn't feel as if they were there to just take my money, sell me a car, and forget about me once I drove out.  Great job.",5.0
137,"June 09, 2013",They were all very friendly and let us look around as long as we wanted with no pressure. When we were ready we could drive all the cars we wanted. Financing was easy and painless. Great all around experience. I have already recommended the dealership and my salesman.,5.0

142,"May 17, 2013","   If it hadn't been for Willy Castillo I wouldn't have bought a new car today.  He's trustworthy and knowledgeable in every detail. He encouraged  me to come back any time had any questions which is comforting.
   If it hadn't been for Willy, I wouldn't have even taken a test drive.  After all, my10 year old Passat was working just fine. But that new car in the show room sure was pretty...midnight blue..my favorite car color.  What could a test drive of that CC hurt?  It was FINE.  And then I wondered ""How different is this from the car I know and love...the Passat?  So Willy found a midnight blue Passat on the lot WITHOUT a sun roof (one of my deal breakers), I drove it and ""that was all she wrote.""  
   Susan Johnson in the finance dept made every thing so EASY!  No red tape here.
   There's one more thing, and to me, it's the most important thing....NO HAGGLING.  They offered me a fair price for my car, no conspiring behind my back between management and the sales department, which is degrading to the customer.  I was dealt with fairly and wasn't being ""played.""  They paid the sales tax, too.  
   If your experience with Willy and Reed Vw is a good as mine, you're going to be a very happy customer.

The sales person let me look, explained my options and guided me through alternatives.  When I kept coming back to my first choice, although above my initial price, we were able to work on numerous options that put me in my car, with terms I could work with.

Everyone I came into contact with while at the dealership were helpful and interested in making my experience what it was,  GREAT.

After more conversation, Dave told us to wait a minute while he went to get something he wanted us to look at - ""just look at it"". he said.  He came back with a car which was not the exact car we were thinking of, but met each of our important criteria items.  We both looked at it and said to each other, ""This is what we want.""

Took it to service last Saturday 3/2/13 because of a check engine light, they took care swiftly of it and everything was covered under warranty. The guys at the service department were great and very accommodating, answering all my questions with great attitude.
While I waited on my car, met with Bobby, my sales guy (he sold me the Tiguan) and upon chatting about different options (I was considering a second car) he offered me to take a used Routan home for the wife to see and test drive.

My wife and I had been researching vehicles for some time and we finally made a decision on the automobile we wanted. We researched dealers on this web site and stopped into McKinney Volkswagen to see if they were as good as their rating indicated. From the moment we walked in dealership and met with Chris Schafer, my wife and I felt that this was the right place. Chris went above and beyond to make everything happen the right way, at the right price and we never once felt uncomfortable. The dealership did not have the color we wanted, but Chris and his team found exact request and got it to their dealership that afternoon. We purchased the vehicle from Chris and we actually felt good for once buying a vehicle. I would highly recommend to anyone if they are in the market for a new Volkswagen, give Chris Schafer a call.

Willie was so knowledgeable, helpful, and fun to work with.  I have NEVER been excited about dealing with anyone at a car dealership, as I have had one too many bad experiences.  Willie completely changed my attitude.  Buying a car doesn't have to feel like your going into 'battle'.

My next car will be the CC!!

In June 2012, my wife purchased a 2012 Volkswagen Eos and we could not have been happier with the sales experience at McKinney Volkswagen and/or the Eos convertible, which we consider an engineering marvel.  In September 2012, I became ready to purchase a new vehicle.  The only brand I considered was Volkswagen and the only dealership I considered was McKinney Volkswagen.  After doing my research and needing a family friendly sedan, I chose the 2012 Volkswagen Passat.  I work overseas and reached out to Mr. Dave Snow, our previous sales person, via email to assist me with this purchase.  After a few email exchanges, Mr. Snow located the perfect 2012 Volkswagen Passat for me and we quickly agreed on the terms of the sale.  Knowing I would not be able to take immediate delivery of the vehicle, Mr. Snow took the initiative to segregate the vehicle for me from the dealership's inventory and hold it for me until I arrived back in the United States.  That sign of trust by Mr. Snow just confirmed what I already knew about McKinney Volkswagen that customer satisfaction is their highest priority.  It was a great feeling to finally arrive at McKinney Volkswagen a few days later and see my vehicle sitting outside the front door ready for delivery.  Mr. Snow, being efficient as usual, made sure majority of the legwork was accomplished by email and had the business office poised for my arrival to complete the sale.  It was a totally seamless process from start to finish!  My 2012 Volkswagen Passat has certainly exceeded all of my expectations and I have never enjoyed a new vehicle as much as I have this one.  It is really difficult to find the right words to truly articulate what a great buying experience this was for me.  Mr. Snow is the consummate sales professional and is an excellent ambassador for Volkswagen in general and more specifically McKinney Volkswagen.  The highest compliment I can give to McKinney Volkswagen, beginning with Mr. Snow, is everyone to a person at this dealership genuinely appears to like their job(s) and it shows.  Further, true customer satisfaction is not just a slogan or some cheap car dealership gimmick but is truly ingrained in the business culture of McKinney Volkswagen.",5.0
277,"October 05, 2012","I visited this dealership location 3 times in the last month.  First salesman was friendly but new, and was no longer there when I visited the second time.  No one followed up.  The second time I visited to test drive the internet sales director was not informative but allowed me to test drive a vehicle.  He also did not follow-up.  The 3rd time I met with Tommy.  Friendly but not very informative. He also did not follow up.  Not one of these gentlemen took me serious.  Even when I said I was ready to buy (cash deal).  Perhaps because I did not have my husband there?  Well your location missed the boat.  I went to the Richardson VW dealer and met with a real salesman.  I am now the owner of a 2013 VW GLI Autobahn.  He listened.  He was not pushy.  He educated me on all the information... made it quite painless.  So VW McKinney---perhaps you need to take all people seriously.",2.3
278,"October 04, 2012","Josh met us at the door and was very cordial.  He listened to us and then responded by showing us what we indicated we were insterested in.  We indicated that we would prefer a vehicle which would provide greater fuel economy and was smaller, and he showed us the Jetta.  We drove it, liked the way it handled, and the fuel economy should be what we want, it's a TDI, 6-speed manual.  He didn't push us, but offered us choices, so thou he sold us the vehicle, we felt we were in control of buying it.  He was very accomodating, friendly, and caring to us, his customers.
Susan went through the financing process with us, and she was very pleasant, friendly, and knowledgeable.
I would definitely suggest to my friends that they visit McKinney VW if they are in the market for a car.",5.0

We appreciate that.  My husband has been a VW fan for a long time having had a Scirocco back in the early days which unfortunately was a lemon for us but that did not deter us from buying another Volkswagen.  Now we have two.  (Jetta Sportwagen and recently purchased Touareg) We look forward to continued great service for our Touareg as well.

Thanks Brandon Hill for all you do.

I wasn't planning on buying when I went into McKinney Volkswagen to see Dave, but after visiting with Dave for awhile, I was able to get a great price on a 2012 Jetta TDI with the premium package.  In fact, the final price, after adding TT&L on the Jetta, was only $200 more than the best price the other dealer was offering me--for the base model (i.e., no premium package with sunroof).

We visited from our home in Oklahoma late on Saturday evening just planning to dine with friends and  test drive a TDI Passat. A few short hours later, we drove off with a new car. We traded in our much loved 22 mph for a 43 mpg.  There was never any pressure.  Dave is a car guy and could talk shop with my husband who is a mechanic.  When we signed the paperwork, we were offered the extra packages but never pressured.  They even agreed to up the offer on our trade-in, but the TDI passat sold itself.  We paid the full sticker price, but we are very happy with our car.  We have already gotten 750 miles on our 1st tank of gas!
The entire staff was friendly, informative, laid back, and the waiting area was comfortable.  We even had another couple with us, and the 4 of us made the test drive!  It was simply an enjoyable evening.

We were just passing by your dealership and I missed the turning to go on to US75, so we thought might as well test drive a Golf. We were initially looking at a 2011 GOLF GTI on display at your dealership but were really interested in a 4 door Golf, that’s when we met Perry. We had not considered buying a VW GOLF as they are relatively pricy and then the added servicing costs.

After test driving the 2011 GOLF GTI, Perry convinced us to test drive a new GOLF and explained the 0% deals that you were doing with 3 Year 36,000 mile warrant including cost of all servicing for that period. He spent his precious time explaining and showing us different models of GOLF in your dealership. We test drove at least two cars and he went through the spec of each one with us, he is very knowledgeable and easy to work with compared to other Car salesman I have had to deal with in the past. I was very close to buying a MAZDA 3 and was on my way there when I missed the turning to go on to US75. I was being pestered by their salesman even when I was talking with Perry. He made sure that I didn’t leave your dealership without the car keys. The negotiations for the right price on the car with him was painless and he made sure we were comfortable on the deal.

333,"August 07, 2012","It all started with oil service on both my 2009 Jetta TDI's.  The service person did not bother to tell me that a 40k service was due, glow plug change, DSG service, fuel filter change, cabin air filter change, brake fluid flush, engine air filter change, oil change, and a bunch of useless standard checks.  

I got my cars back with the engine oil over filled.  Most people don't even check their engine oil level let alone know what over filling the engine with oil will do.  It will kill your engine slowly over time if not sooner by choking it with oil and possibly blowing all or some of your engine seals.  McKinney VW master tech's response was that they add and extra .5-1 quart of oil because the diesel engine burns oil...this is not documented on any VW literature.  Basically they are selling you another 1 quart of oil for $10.00 - $15.00.  

I had the opportunity to also talk with one of McKinney's Master Mechanics - Kevin, who volunteered to show me exactly how an oil change was done.  I found that he did not torque the drain plug properly and hold him so, at which he got angry and asked me what the proper torque was!!!  Also he did not seem to know the difference between 4.2 LITERS and 5 QUARTS.  He then tried to dump all 4.5 quarts of oil all at the same time into the engine (he admitted that he poured .5 quarts in the oil filter).  The proper procedure is to add 1 quart at a time and check the engine oil level with the dip stick.  The master mechanic did'nt seem to care especially after I caught him and told him the proper procedures and torque values.

BOTTOM LINE MY ENGINE OIL WAS OVER FILLED BY ABOUT 1 QUART.  ALL YOU NEED IS 4 QUARTS OF OIL or 4 LITERS ANYMORE AND YOU WILL OVER FILL YOUR ENGINE AND CAUSE ENGINE DAMAGE!!!

The McKinney service and customer service personnel are very good.  After talking with Steve Mulholland I went against my better judgement and agreed to do a DSG Service, Brake Flush, and Fuel Filter Change for $600 for one vehicle!!! WOW!!!

I normally drive very conservatively and recently had to do some hard emergency braking and found that my brakes were very spongy/mushy and made me think that they did not perform the brake flush properly either!!!  Imagine that if the mechanics can't properly do or follow the procedures of a simple engine oil change, imagine them doing a brake flush or DSG service!!!

CAUTION CHECK YOUR ENGINE OIL LEVEL AT THE DEALERSHIP!!!  DEMAND a REFUND FOR THE EXTRA QUART OF ENGINE OIL IF THEY CHARGE YOU FOR 5 QUARTS!!!

I will be also discussing my experience with VW of America's customer service about my experience and quality of the vehicle service.",2.6

I was very impressed with Brenda's prompt response and continued response to all of our questions and/or concerns.  She was not only professional and knowledgeable, but very personable and friendly.
We had ordered a spoiler for the VW which was not there when I picked up the car, but, again, Brenda followed up and got me in there very soon to have it added.  She had arranged for a loaner car and had everything ready and in order when I came to drop off the car.

342,"August 03, 2012","Mr. Snow was the best car sales/specialist that I have ever encountered. In an industry fraught with behind the scenes deals and underhanded techniques, Dave Snow was a breath of cool fresh air with his honesty, genuine concern, and attentive help with our needs. He went beyond the extra mile to help us obtain a car and get the best financing rate that we could get. I would highly recommend this man, wherever he works, as the best in his field. At least in my opinion he is. The whole experience of purchasing a car is rather daunting and the expectation of high pressure sales pitches something not to be desired. But Dave Snow is different...a man who truly explores what one needs and helps in any way he can to effect one's  desires. For me, this was the best car purchase experience I have had and will return to McKinney Volkswagen just to deal with Dave Snow. Thank you, Dave!    ",5.0

344,"August 01, 2012","I traveled from the Tyler area to purchase my daughter a Jetta she had found on the website. The overall experience with Mr. Snow and Ms. Johnson was a welcome change from other dealerships I had dealt with in the past. Both Mr. Snow and Ms. Johnson worked hard to make our buying experience a good one and went well above the call of duty to accomplish that task. Mr. Snow's knowledge of his product was excellent and he took the time to be sure my daughter knew and understood all facets of the car before we made the purchase. We liked the car from the get go, but by the end of the test drive and Mr. Snow's explanations of all the workings of it, we LOVED IT. Despite the fact that the hour was getting late, past their normal closing time, Mr. Snow and Ms. Johnson both remained after hours to complete the sale so my daughter could take her new car home with her that night. Ms. Johnson made the closing enjoyable which considering the nature of that task is quite a lot to say. I would highly recommend anyone considering the purchase of a vehicle to visit McKinney Volkswagen and while your there, if your lucky enough to get Mr. Snow as your sales representative, ask him about his classic car restoration projects. I'm sure between the overall experience of buying from a dealership that exudes class in every respect of the word, you'll also enjoy the visions he has for his classic restorations. ",5.0

Everyone there seemed very genuine and wanted to ensure that I found the right car for me, even if it wasn't a Volkswagen. The first day I walked into McKinney VW I met with Willy and told him that I was shopping around for a vehicle and still planning to look at some other options. After doing a few test drives, he told me all the information about some promotions that were going on, but wasn't too pushy like most of the other car dealerships about trying to get my sale that day. The thing I appreciated the most is that Willy, as well as the rest of the staff there, was persistant about staying in touch after I left, but like i said it didn't come off as too pushy. Perhaps partly to do with the fact that VW cars almost sell themselves, coupled with the professionalism of the staff, I decided to go back the next day and Willy talked me though all the financing options and I drove out with a new Jetta that day!

I have taken my VW to Broadwalk VW both in Richardson and McKinney for service within the last 6 months and twice been quoted a hugh amount of service that was not needed.  The latest was last week when I took my car to McKinney to ask them to check my car because it had a check engine light on and couldn't pass inspection.  They quoted me $650 to replace the canister and EVAP pump and also threw in the need for new wipers at $49 which was strange since I had replace them less than a month earlier.    In total I was quoted $2,000 worth of ""required"" work on my car.   I paid the $120 diagnostic charge and picked up my car.

I went home and looked up information on the EVAP pump and canister. Bottom line, I fixed my EVAP problem by replacing a hose between the canister and pump.  Total $14 including two new hose clamps and about 20 minutes labor.

406,"June 14, 2012","My journey with McKinney Volkwagen began on the morning of 06/12/2012 with their online chat service as I was in the market for a CC, but was still on the fence as I hadn't found ""the one"" that I was looking for.  I chatted with the rep. for about 20 mins. and she stated that a Sales Manager would contact me via phone shortly.  Within an hour from our chat, I was contacted by Perry, but missed his call.  I called him back and we scheduled to meet at 1pm.

I arrived a little before 1p and Perry greeted me on the showroom floor - already a great start!  We walked to his office and he had a model already ready for me to test drive.  We drove it, but I didn't ""connect"" with the car...if you catch my drift.  After the drive, I told Perry the exact color I was looking for and he managed to find me one.  Once we went to it and I sat in it, I knew then...this is ""the one"" :)

Overall, Perry's attentive customer service, personable & professional disposition definitely aided in easing my anxiety of ""being a girl"" going into a dealership without that male partner to ensure that I wouldn't be dooped or taken advantage of.

Now, Susan Johnson on the other hand - was the ""icing on the cake!""  I went into her office to handle ""the money"" and the behind-the-scenes matters.  During our conversation, Susan continued to ease my anxiety as well as LOWERED my interest to a great rate - I am forever grateful for her genuiness and candor related to the necessity of purchasing coverage that would protect my purchase.

Perry, Susan and McKinney Volkswagen - thank you for making my car purchasing experience an easy transaction.  Your honest, professional, no-hassle approach is definitely one that is appreciated and should be admired by those that you all encounter.  I will 100% ensure that upon those that I know in the market looking for great customer service, honest deals and attentive interactions - McKinney Volkswagen is the best choice!",5.0

417,"June 04, 2012","All my experience was via phone. I wanted to inquire how much it would cost if I got a Golf delivered to where I live and Willy either had a difficult time understanding what I was asking or he didn't care. He asked me to fill out a credit report online BEFORE I got a price quote and that doesn't sit with me very well. I don't want my credit pulled as it could potentially impact one's score PLUS I didn't want to start the buying process before I got more information. I also informed him I was going to pay cash, in full, so I especially did not see why he wanted credit info. All I wanted was a simple price quote to my destination but when I explained this, he became frustrated and rudely told me to call him back when I'm serious about purchasing this car - obviously I am if I'm inquiring about shipping. I'm extremely off put by his rudeness and I hope this isn't a reflection of the service at McKinney. I've never been treated so rudely by a car salesman. 

UPDATE: JC, a sales manager, called me back with apologies. He was helpful with information I requested and explained there may have been a problem with the language barrier. Either way, I'm glad he cleared up the misunderstanding and he sounded very genuine. He assured me Willy is very amiable in person and I take his word for it. ",4.0

423,"May 29, 2012","Alex (Alejandro Franco) was a phenomenal salesperson. He was very quick to respond to all inquiries via e-mail or phone while not being pushy. He was upfront, honest, and showed personal interest in my care. He went out of his way to find a vehicle with my exact specifications (2012 Jetta TDI with M/T and Premium Package, Black interior, Black exterior) and we worked out a very fair price with minimum hassle. I have never seen a car negotiation work so quickly while still walking away feeling that I got a good deal. I would definitely recommend Alex and McKinney Volkswagen to friends and family.

For comparison (and to justify that high ratings from me have value), I had an absolutely atrocious experience at Lewisville Volkswagen (where I first test-drove the car). On my first visit, I was given an MSRP that was about $2,000 higher than the online VW pricing tool claimed it should be with no explanation in the price differential (the salesperson tried to claim it was the destination fee which I had already taken into consideration and knew to be $750--not $2,000). Then, I was told that these cars were in such high demand that they earned an additional $2,000 markup on top of the MSRP. So even though I wanted to pay with CASH, the ""best"" deal they could offer was the already-high MSRP with low financing rate (when I wanted to hand over a check). Prior to my second visit, I was told they had a car that I could test drive for a second time on lot (since manual transmission cars are generally harder to find), and after driving 45 minutes to the dealership, I was told that the car was not actually there. While I had already invested tens of hours into determining that this car was the best fit for me, the experience at Lewisville McKinney Volkswagen was bad enough that I started questioning if Volkswagen was the right fit for me.

So I would like to express a sincere thank you to Alex for restoring my faith in Volkswagen and turning my negative car-buying experience into a good one. I look forward to working with him and the McKinney Volkswagen team in the future.",5.0

I still was leary about wasting his time and mine as I was certain no one could help me out of the situation without allot of money down or extremely high monthly payments.  Finally after the 91 degree heat hit and no A/C, I called Dave and told him about my trade in and financial concerns.  Within 24 hours he had found me a 12 VW Golf, paid off my trade in, and kept my payments at a monthly amount that I could handle.  I have finally found a salesman that I trust and enjoy talking to, as well. I will never work with another dealership again as long is Dave is selling cars!!!

The first review was immediately following the purchase of my 2008 Jetta (which occurred in early February 2012) and reflected the positive experience that my wife and I had. Post-purchase, however, is a completely different story. More than 3 months and 3 temporary tags later, I still don't have my license plates. I have called upwards of 40-50 times trying to get some color on the situation but get the same run-around each time. Never once in the 3+ months has McKinney Volkswagen reached out to fill me in on the status of my situation; instead it’s me probing them multiple times each day receiving excuses rather than resolutions and countless false promises to “find out what’s going on and give me a call back”. The bottom line is that once their sale was made, they lost incentive to remain courteous or helpful. It’s disappointing that such a pleasant purchase has been erased by the disastrous experience since. ",1.3

436,"May 13, 2012","We did not plan on buying our new car at the time we visited McKinney VW on Saturday, 5/12/12. 
Willy Castillo was so knowledgeable, professional and genuine that we did purchase our beautiful new 2013 CC from him. The CC was our optimum choice but like everyone we are trying to watch our budget and drove a Jetta and Passat as well. Willy explained the advantages of the CC so well that it just simply made sense for us and our needs to get our dream car. Willy helped identify some of the features we need for best driving, such as the xenon headlights, safety features and not to mention the great ride!

Another selling point is that Willy stayed with us and negotiated for us with sales management, we weren't turned over to someone else to do the financial part like most dealerships. This helped build credibility and allowed us to see Willy work for us where it's critically important-financing. He again proved his knowledge and ability to speak on our behalf. We did meet with Finance but only after the price was set, we also weren't pushed to buy all of the options like at other dealerships. 

McKinney VW is part of the Boardwalk group which will allow us to get our service done at the Richardson location as we live closer to Richardson than McKinney. Another great selling point for us that Willy pointed out.

Lastly, Willy is a kind, fun man, and don't we all like to buy from people we like? Basically, go see Willy Castillo for your new car!

440,"May 11, 2012","I called 4 times asking for my regular service man, Gene May, who is fantastic, and I was told by the call center that he was ""with a customer"", only to find out after driving an hour to the dealership that gene wasn't even working that day. I went ahead and checked in for my appointment and dealt with Gabriel. I told him my AC wasn't blowing cold and that I thought the AC compressor might be out. I waited THREE hours and paid a hundred dollar deductible only to be told they replaced an expansion valve. My ticket stated that my AC was blowing at a temp of 45 degrees. It wasn't even blowing 75 degrees!!! I said this was not going to work and they took it back into the shop. Gabriel in service, had me to clean my belongings out of the car and drag all my nursing supplies (for my home health patients) out of the trunk and drag a laundry tote full of things to the customer waiting area while I had to wait on my husband to drive an hour to come pick me up. Gabriel told me they didn't have a loan car for me and that I would have to wait. He didn't even offer to help me carry my belongings from the shop to the customer waiting area!! I had been at the dealership from 3pm to 8:30pm. When it was time for Gabriel to go home at 7pm, he left me sitting there thinking the place was going to close on me and I thought if have to stand outside the dealership by the highway or something until my husband got from Bonham to McKinney. LUCKILY, the salesman I purchased my car from, Jeff French, saw me and asked what was going on. He very quickly go me a vehicle to use and the sales mgr was there and very apologetic. Gene May called me the next day and had me taken care of. Gene is the reason I keep coming back to McKinney VW, and if I had just been told the truth by the call center about gene being out that day, I would've just waited until I could see him, and I'm positive all of this could've been avoided. What kind of dealership allows a customer to sit 5 1/2 hrs waiting and then the service man leaves you there so he can go home??? I have FIVE children I wanted and needed to get home to also. I hadn't eaten all day because my patients come first! Where is his work ethic for goodness sake??

Service like this is virtually impossible to find in any industry these days.  I will happily continue to take my car to this dealership for service.

Troy was very professional and attentive to what I was looking for. On my first visit, I had a few different vehicles I was looking at, and he assisted working me through the facts and figures of each. Even though this visit did not end in a purchase I returned a few weeks later with specific intentions to seek out Troy to assist me once more.

He promptly called me back to verify and I rushed to the dealership. I was greeted promplty and we were test driving the exact car in no time. The numbers process was a snap. No back and forth and haggling. Straight to the point and we all agreed quickly. 
Next, I went to finance with Susan and she was GREAT, as well. Nice and quick! No hassle and a lot of fun to deal with. Best financing experience ever.
Delivery was perfect. Dave took the time to go over the details and also helped me removing personal items from my trade in. He went above and beyond!

471,"April 10, 2012","We brought my daughter's car in for her brakes.  It is the car she will be taking to college this fall so we asked that the service team inspect the vehicle from that perspective.  She will be driving it a long way in the West Texas sun, so it needs to be completely up to snuff.  They did a complete review of the car, checked the brakes, alignment, tires, and all critical environments and some not so critical.  After viewing the inspection sheet, I realized they did a great job in reviewing the running nature of this car.  It was not cheap fixing everything than needed to be fixed, but afterward, we feel as if there is nothing that requires any work. Gabriel worked well with us.  He provide information in a timely manner and even gave us a slight price break because of all the work we had done in the dealer ship.

It was a job well done, and I do feel comfortable that everything was looked at, checked or fixed.

If Willy were to change dealerships I would definitely find him to purchase another car.  However if he is still at McKinney VW, I am sorry I will not be buying a vehicle from him.  We had to wait over 3 hours to complete our purchase.  We were paying cash so we only needed to write a check.  There was no need to check how to finance the vehicle no haggling over percentages for payments.  We needed to write a check and walk away.  Should NEVER have taken 3+ hours.

Back in Dec 2011 I had a check engine light come on. And took it in of usually Gene took care of it. But then about two weeks ago the engine light came back on. I called and spoke with Gabriel and he told me to go head and bring it in and they would take a look.

About an hour and half after I dropped it off Gene called to tell me that it was related to the original issue that was taken care back in Dec 2011. He did not hesitate to tell me that it was a mistake on their side and that they missed something the first time around. Before I could ask how much it would be to fix it ... he quickly let me know that since they missed it the first time around that they would take care of it for free. WOW !!

Gene was great throughout the process keeping me informed about what was going on and when I could expect my car to be ready. It is really rare that you get up to date progress on what is happening during the process I for one appreciate it. The service at McKinney Boardwalk is superior to most in town.  Keep up the good work!

520,"February 27, 2012","I have been to McKinney VW many times for service on my Touareg.  Gene May always gives me great service.  He is friendly, has a professional demeanor, and always gives me as much info as I need to best understand the work that is being done on my car and why it is needed.  The fact the dealer has a courtesy shuttle and also washes your car after any services is a plus and adds to the overall great experience of dealing with them.  I would recommend this dealer to family and friends and if I purchase another VW in the future, McKinney VW is first on the list.

I can't remember the finance ladies name but after working with Bobby she was the cherry on top. I absolutely love how friendly and helpfull everyone there was. My friend who came with me was also so impressed that since she couldn't buy a car she bought a volts wagon hat. I am beyond pleased and I love, love, love my new car. ",4.8

Even though I came to a Volkswagen dealership to specifically buy a Chevrolet, Willy still treated me like a member of the Volkswagen Family! He did not attempt to waste his time (and mine) by showing me something I was not interested in. We went straight to a test drive then on to the business of the paperwork. This was the fastest and smoothest car buying experience of my life! I would also like to thank Susan in finance for her expertise.  As long as there is a car at Mckinney Volkswagen I want, I will be buying here for a very long time. Thanks for changing how I see spending the day at a car dealership!

523,"February 27, 2012","This is the 2nd car I have purchased from Boardwalk VW. Since my 1st visit and purchase, I have been dealing exclusively with Willy. When ever I come in to the dealership, I always ask to see Willy, even when it is just to say 'Hi' he is always friendly and helpful. In my opion Willy is just a great salesman, easy to work with when buying a new car and very knowledgeable about the VW products and car industry in general. He listens to what you want and asks appropriate questions to verify he gets you the right car. 

Willy is always very friendly, knowledgeable and helpful when ever I have visited the dealership. I would not buy my VW from anyone but Willy. I have bought 2 VW and 3 Porsches now from Boardwalk Dealerships and I only deal with Willy at VW and Mark at Porsche.

Alex had the Jetta I was looking for parked right infront to test drive, without question we were on the road with my dream car! Alex was so helpful and what I loved about the whole experience was that he wasn't your typical pushy sales guy. Alex made my first car purchasing experience so amazing, he was so knowdeable and was determined to find me a good deal on my dream car, in which he offered me a fantastic deal that I couldn't refuse. After the paperwork processing, I was introduced to Doug Lucas, who walked me through all the details of my new car, Doug was so knowledgeable about every aspect of the vehicle.

The service department in particular do excellent work and when you make an appointment the time spent waiting for the car to be serviced is reasonable. My only complaints are that without an appointment you could get stuck waiting several hours, which happened to me one Saturday morning, and some of the prices for services are a bit high, which is expected with any dealership. Also, when I made a recent appointment for an oil change it stated specifically online that it would cost $59.99 for full synthetic oil change (which is reasonable) but when I got the bill after the service was complete it was asking for $80.00+. I simply told the employee what the website said and without any question or hesitation they corrected the price.

My complaints are with VW in general, not VW McKinney. Every time I pay for a repair, I get a recall notification/warranty extension in the mail 3-6 months later.

610,"December 02, 2011","Dear VW McKinney

My 2008 Passat Wagon was having issues with a check engine light and would rev erratically at idle, and also needed an update regarding a steering coloumb lock recall.

I called to book my car in for service the day before Thankgiving. I was very pleased that my car was able to be booked in over the holiday. The service team worked on my car through Thanksgiving and had my car back to me by Friday. 

I also had a regular service performed on the car. 

When I went to pick up my car, I was very pleased to find out the issues with the check engine light were due to a previous recall and would be covered under a factory extended warranty, and was corrected to me at no charge.

VW could have easily kept their mouth shut and charged me for these repairs and I would have been none the wiser.  I'm very pleased theres still honesty at VW and my car was supported.

My greeting at the dealership upon my arrival was warm and relaxed. I talked with Gabrial Richardson regarding my issues. I am a VW enthusiast with an engineering degree and know my car VERY well. I was pleased to say Gabrial Richardson was very knowledgeable and was good to talk to about my car.

This is my 7th VW and I'm still pleased with the quality of the product and the excellent service I recieved at McKinney VW.

My 8th VW will hopefully be a 2012 Golf R, once they arrive early next year providing I can get my hands on one... I would love to have McKinney reserve one for me if possible.

Thanks again for an excellent product and service...

From the moment I walked into the building I felt like like I was at my second home.  Very warm, friendly and personable.  Gene set me down to let me know what was going on with my car step by step so that there would be no surprises.  
Having to be there for a while, June noticed I needed lunch but did'nt have a way; so Amanda was kind enough to go get lunch for me.
Jose provided exceptional customer care and great conversation making the stay pleasant.  
Willy did everything from trying to sell me a car to telling fun clean jokes to keep me smiling.  Whenever I get back in the market to purchase another VW, he will be the first person I look up.

616,"November 18, 2011","My rating is based on the following:

My first contact with your firm was via online regarding a used vehicle.  I had never contacted a dealer online before, but was not impressed.  No one replied to my request for a call from sales as well as the fact that I applied for credit approval and never heard anything back.  I knew my credit was very good and it wouldn't be a problem getting a loan, but I wanted to confirm vw credit iterest rates so I could compare.  I had stopped by late one evening to view the used car I as considering and also viewed a new one that interested me. (both were out in the lot).  No one waited on me, which was good because It was after dark and I didn't really want to be approached by a sales person at that point. --Fact finding only-- The next day or 2 I made up my mind that I was going to buy and wanted to do so before the vehicle I was interested in was sold. 

I called the dealership to see why no one was responding to my online request and Jeff French took my call.  Everything after that went great.  He followed up, got answers to all of my questions on price, financing etc.  When I arrived at our appointment he was patient as I vasilated between the used car and the new one.  Had me drive both, explained both in a very knowlegable way and allowed me to decide which was best for me.  Thats what sold me.  At 56 years and having purchased my share of new vehicles I just need the facts - - I'll make the choice.  Jeff understood that and did a great job.

In the past I have purchased from VW Richardson twice(good experience) - The vw dealer in Irving (Horrible experience) and I started this car hunt at VW Lewisville a month ago (not bad, but not good either)

Thanks again Jeff French for making this purchase quick, easy and enjoyable.

I've owned several different makes of automobiles from Ferrari to VW and everything in between. Having dealt with numerous Service Advisors, Gene May is by far the most attentive and thorough that I've ever experienced working with. 

Gene continuously is in tune with the Client, whether it is from a loaner vehicle being required or attempting to duplicate issues that Technicians can't find. I've had several issues with the 2 VW's I currently own,prior to working with Gene I was simply told ""this is the way it's suppose to be"" knowing otherwise I explained to Gene the issues and he listened on numerous occasions and offered to take the vehicle to duplicate the issues himself as to have the ability to explain to the Technicians his findings.

All too often people like Gene are overlooked, simply because Clients don't have or take the time to share their experiences with such individuals. Currently I'm the Owner of my 7th VW and will not consider having either of them serviced anywhere other where Gene is affiliated with!

655,"September 15, 2011","If you are concerned about being treated well, receiving a fair & honest deal, here is my advice ... buy where the people who work in the auto industry buy.  If a dealers vendors buy from them, that's a darn good indication the dealer is indeed reputable and will be around after you buy the car!  When we went shopping for a new family van, our neighbor who works in the auto business told us who to stay away from.  Of course we didn't listen at first.  Then we came to this store, which she DID recommend and drove out in a Routan AND A JETTA.  Our salesman was Ty and he puts to rest the car salesman stereotype.  You won't find Ty running back & forth asking permission for this or that, gone is the paper you need to sign with an amount written down, or the hidden fees adding $100 on to your payment.

The manager, Darren, is always around introducing himself, making sure existing & potential customers are happy.  No arm twisting or second guessing from Darrin; he truly wants to make sure your buying experience at this store exceeds expectations.  Got a question ... he will answer it on the spot.  Everything is transparent, no secrets at this store.

Financing is always the most brutal part of any car buying experience.  Joe Verhey makes the process smooth and more importantly simple.  The best part ... NO surprises.  Ty & Joe clearly worked together which ensured a perfectly painless process.

Doug completed our delivery by demonstrating each option our vehicles had and then added our phones to the bluetooth system!  I challenge anyone from VW corporate to ask Doug a question (on any of their models) to trip him up ... it just won't happen.

657,"September 12, 2011","My experience with Dave Snow and Boardwalk Volkswagon of McKinney was phenomenal! In all, I have purchased 6 new vehicle's in my life and this was by far the quickest and most pleasant experience ever! Dave was amazing! Dave was very accommodating and willing to listen to what I was looking for in a vehicle. He was very understanding and not pushy at all. He was extremely professional and knowledgeable about his product. I appreciated that he was not trying to sell me something that I did not want or could not afford. I can tell that Dave truly cares about his customer's and not simply trying to sell a product.

With the help of Dave Snow, I had the honor to purchase and drive the dealerships first 2012 Tiguan out of the showroom floor!! I have diven my 2012 Tiguan for 1 month and truly love my vehicle! I am very happy and feel I made a very wise purchase. I would highly recommend this vehicle and this dealership to anyone. I will certainly return to Volkswagon McKinney in two years to purchase my daughter's first vehicle and I sure hope that Dave will help me again.

658,"September 09, 2011",I had been to several dealerships already and was just going down the line as there are several in a row. I happen to spot a car that fit my profile that I was looking for but it was a little higher than I was wanting to pay. It was a nice car. Willie came out to talk to me and let me take for a test drive. The car ran great and was in great shape as well. It was a CPO and  looked new even though it wasn't Now understand that I arrived at McKinney Volkswagen at 6:00 PM on Labor Day. We talked and went to run the numbers and we were able to agree on a price that I could live with. We did the paperwork and I drove it home that night. Did I mention that I was home by 8:15 PM? Mike and Willie were both very helpful and were willing to work with me on the price and financing. I drove away with a nice little 2007 Rabbit 2.5 and what was basically a pretty pleasant experience considering most people rate going to the car dealership below going to the dentist. I found the staff knowledgeable and friendly. I had to go back to get a key fob for the car. There was some issue with the programming with it so I was unable to pick it up right away but they put me in a loaner car and took care of it for me. I would definitely go back and I would definitely recommend McKinney Volkswagen to other people.,5.0
659,"September 09, 2011","UPDATE AT BOTTOM...
DO NOT GO THERE FOR SERVICE!  I recently took my 2011 Jetta TDI for the 20k mile included service.  They listed the wrong spec of oil on the invoice (505.00, not 507.00), and did not change the fuel filter!  This is crucial on diesel engines.  I called the service manager, brought it back &amp; got a loaner.  The purpose of having a Sat appt in the first place was so I wouldn't have to take off work for service.  Bringing it back &amp; picking it up on the Tues after the holiday was not in my original plans.  Then the next day I hear some scraping from underneath driving down normal city streets.  Come to find out, the tech didn't put the plastic belly pan on properly &amp; it was scraping as it was hanging so low.  Also, when I opened up the hood to check things out, the work done was very sloppy.  Oil splatters, fuel filter housing not cleaned.  The tech also checked the box stating the air filter was dirty but didn't bother to even clean it out a minimal amount.  I took a vacuum to it after cleaning out a few bugs that they could've easily cleaned out.  This service was included in the purchase price, so I'm sure I paid for it somewhere along the line.  The price listed was $349!!!  It wasn't worth $9.  So, not only did they mess it up once, they managed to mess it up twice.  

Brandon Hill, the service advisor, did fine.  He was helpful &amp; tried to make it right.  Steve Mulholland, the service manager, tried to make it right as well.  The person responsible for the mistakes were the mechanics working on my Jetta.  They are the ones who sign their names &amp; are ultimately responsible for making sure their work is done properly.  The first service tech was #3063.  Not sure who the second one was, they printed an amended version of the original invoice for the second screw up.  

UPDATE (9/21/11): I was contacted by Douglas Lucas, the Customer Relations Manager.  We went over what was & was not done & he made it right.  He can't go back in time but he was able to leave me satisfied at the end of our conversation.  I appreciate his assistance.  ",2.3

666,"September 01, 2011","I worked with Joe Luna through my process to look for a new vehicle. Joe was an amazing sales person. He was upfront, honest and friendly from the second I walked onto the lot. I started by just checking out what VW had to offer and was very unfamiliar with the cars. Joe took the time to walk me around a few of the models and explain all the features and details of the different vehicles. He worked on explaining the benefits of each and rough pricing of each car. I was able to take that home and consider VW further. In the beginning of my search I didn't have the ""it car"" I wanted or had a brand of vehicle I must have. Joe was a key piece of what led me to VW. He really seemed to have my interest and budget in hand. He worked on showing me different package options to the vehicles. As I was torn about what model I wanted he allowed me to test drive multiple vehicles and never seemed in a rush to get to the next customer. The first day he knew we were not in the position to buy on the spot as I still was doing research, yet he still worked with me as long as I needed and never acted like I was wasting time. He has a great way with people. I had initially driven a Jetta TDI, but realized if I was to continue down the path of getting a VW I would want a gas car and Joe was really great at setting me up for an appointment so I could test drive that model of vehicle so I could make sure the drive was the same for me and I liked it. He made sure I was comfortable with my decision. As this was my first car purchase on my own he understood how big of a decision this was for me. Joe really impacted my ultimate decision to get a VW Jetta. 

Once I decided on the Jetta we began the ""negotiating"" process with Joe. Many factors were weighing in as I had my budget limit. Initially Joe was unable to match a price I was able/willing to make the purchase for. Though, he never gave up on the fight to help me drive away with an all new Jetta. After much work Joe was able to come back with an offer that worked on both ends. Without all of Joe's hard work and dedication to me as his customer I would not be out driving a Jetta from McKinney VW. He never just pushed me aside because I wasn't ready at the beginning and had a price set in my mind. He worked through the challenges and fought for the sale. He keeps his customers as the priority in the deal. 

Joe was beyond a great sales person to work with. My experience in car shopping would have been quite a different experience without him working with me. I cannot thank him enough for all his effort and work in helping me get my new car. I am so thrilled with my first big car purchase! Everyday I go around in my Jetta I am reassured with my purchase choice and the help of Joe. 

Everyone at McKinney VW was so helpful and great to work with. The people and attitude of the dealership was the deciding factor on my decision. Without them, and specifically Joe, I would not have been happy. 

THANK YOU for all the hard work! I LOVE my car!",5.0

677,"August 19, 2011","Mr. Willy Castillo – Mr. Castillo did an excellent job. He welcomed us at the front door and provided good information related to various options and colors for the Jetta model along with a test drive and warranty information. He also helped negotiate a final price with the sales manager. He worked painstakingly in order to get our car ready around closing time by changing license plates and authorizing to take our car before signing the final documents with the business office and scheduling an appointment with Doug. He also had to arrange a minor repair of the gas cover with the service department and also arranged a ride for me to go home in his own car. He knows what it means to take care of a customer. While the service department personnel and customer pick up and drop off personal  told him that their job is to take care of  service department instead of taking care of sales customers, Mr. Castillo helped me.
Ms. Susan Johnson- She was well prepared with her documents and covered all aspects by providing an excellent explanation. She sold us on the extended warranty without using any sales gimmicks or scare tactics. We enjoyed our conversation with her and found her very easy to work with. 
I have the following suggestions for the Dealership Owner/President:
1. Salespeople need to be supported by all other dealership departments because they are the ones that bring in the revenue.
2. Everyone should respect and listen to the sales person as long as they are working to take care of a customer.
3. Be flexible in solving problems related to customer service.
4. Customers want to close a transaction as fast as possible and don’t want to wait more than two hours to finish a deal.
5. Anyone who does not take care of the customer should not be a part of your organization, especially in this current economy with over 9% unemployment and major financial difficulties for car dealers everywhere.

My husband John and I were looking to purchase/lease a new car this year and went to Boardwalk VW here in McKinney.   One of our family members told us to look at the VW’s out this year. We had never had a VW ever in our lives.    

We knew we wanted more a more comfortable and safe car that delivered more miles to the gallon but we were not sure which car was best for us. 

Once we were in the New Car Showroom we were assisted my Christopher Pearsall.   He made us feel really comfortable in looking around the showroom.
We looked at the VW Golf first and Chris let us test drive one off the lot.   
I was impressed by the comfort and ride of the Golf and it’s claim for better gas mileage.   

Since this would be my car I was still unsure about whether or not I wanted a hatch-back or not so we took the VW Jetta SE out for a test drive.   My husband and I were both impressed with it’s features, comfortable drive, and zip that it had that we were now sure it was the car for us.   Chris explained features about the car before we took the car for a spin and by the time we brought it back to the showroom we had a better understanding about how the VW line has evolved.   We were impressed with the 2.5 L  -5 Cylinder engine and the quality of the entire car.   Even though the car sold itself we were lucky to have a bright salesman to assist us in choosing the right car. 
 
Chris was very attentive to our questions and concerns about Leasing a car. 
He made trading in our 2007 Honda CRV worthwhile and brought us down to a most affordable lease payment which fit our lifestyle perfectly. 

Chris was a perfect gentleman throughout this deal that evolved and then linked us up with the other people involved within the Boardwalk team who really worked smoothly in informing us how the warranty, repairs, and general maintenance was handled through our lease process. 

Our thanks and appreciation go out to Christopher Pearsall, New Car Sales, & Doug Lucas, Customer Relations Manager.

Willy met us in the parking lot and was very helpful with the test drive, etc.  My wife and I have been pretty torn on whether we wanted another SUV or something smaller which is why we were trying out the sportwagens.  We were hoping for a relaxing test drive and no pressure sales tactics, and that is exactly what Willy and McKinney VW provided.    It was not your typical car shopping experience for sure; it was relaxing and easy.  My wife and I left for lunch and discussed our options.  One hour later we were working on the sales paperwork.  Total time on the lot was only 4 hours start to finish and we got a great deal.  It was an excellent shopping experience because Willy and the staff balanced the right amount of dealer involvement with the right amount of 'space' for us to think seriously about what we needed as a family.",5.0

When you get ready to buy car you need to arm yourself with a second coat of patience because you know that they will push you, they will try to sell you anything, they will treat you like you have no education and like your money is free. Well, I am so happy with Willie and the rest of the VW staff at McKinney that I am re-directing my company to only buy cars at their location (For personal and business use). I had a great experience; I got what I needed and what I want it. Great job!!!",5.0
707,"July 20, 2011","We were driving around specifically for a VW Jetta and ran across this dealership. When we walked in the door, we were greeted by the salesperson and asked about their used Jettas. He asked basic questions and what our budget was going to be. Because the timing was so late I just wanted a quick run-down of pricing options of what they had available. Now, looking back on it, when he had asked me what type of payments I was looking for I had responded with somewhere around $250 in 48 months (I actually meant around 60 months). I had tried explaining that there could also be down payments but he wouldn't expand on that as I can only assume he thinks that I do not have the money for it. He was quick and to the point. To top the ""experience"" off, when we were leaving, we had overheard him talking to his colleagues about the situation and it felt very belittling. I understand that in today's tough times, and with people looking for reliability and value, a car dealership would sympathize. I understand that not all salesmen are the same but I can criticize on the ones I had the ""pleasure"" of experiencing.",1.3

710,"July 14, 2011","I purchased my 2011 Jetta SEL at the very beginning of June 2011.  The car came with factory navigation.  
I began to browse online to see if my brand new car did, indeed, have the latest version of the Navteq navigation maps installed.  To my surprise, the new version had come out just 2 weeks after purchasing my vehicle.  
I understood that VW had no policy of updating navigation maps once the vehicle was sold.  However, I felt that with the maps update being so expensive ($199+tax&shipping) and the car being so very new, that I was going to be extremely unhappy if I was going to have to shell out another $200+.  
I contacted VWs customer service, who put me in touch with Steve Mulholland, the Service Manager at Volkswagen of McKinney.  Going into my conversation with Steve, I truly expected to have a fight on my hands about the maps update.  
The reality of the situation was the complete opposite.  Steve completely understood my frustration, never uttered anything resembling a negative comment, and did everything in his power to right the situation, which he accomplished.  
I continue to tell friends and family coming from higher-end vehicles, ""If you decide to purchase a Volkswagen from McKinney Volkswagen, the service after the purchase you receive will be as good, if not better, than anything you might be familiar with from BMW or Mercedes Benz.

He came back in a bit with a deal that I found acceptable.  

The whole process in buying my new CC was very simple.  From taliking to the sales manager, to Yvette in Finance, to Brad at the end of the deal and dealing with the service department, I was very impressed with how everything went.  Before the deal was even complete, Willy bought my lunch.  I have never dealt with a salesperson such as Willy.

He was very helpful and he found out quickly what was causing all the problems with my headlights.  Brandon also let me know how much everything would cost upfront before the repairs were done, which I truly appreciated!  I have been to dealerships where they do the repairs without asking and this is why I will only go to VW McKinney for my service needs!  Brandon said that the repairs would be in the next day, but I was unable to be there due to my scheduling.  He told me to come back in a few days, call him when I am on my way and he would get my car in which he did!  It was nice to know that they would work around my schedule to make sure that everything would be done correctly.  I highly recommed their service department to all of my family and friends, it was a great experience and the price for my repairs was great!

While waiting in their very clean and nice customer area when Brandon was finding out what was wrong with my car, I decided to look around at the new cars.  That is when I met Willie Castillo, who happens to be one of the nicest guys that I have ever meet.  He did not pressure me when I was looking the cars, but he did tell me that if I ever wanted to test drive one in the future to let him know and he would be glad to help!  After a while, I decided that I wanted to check out the 2012 CC and I went to Willie for his help.  He was very educated on this car and I should know because I have been doing research on it for a few weeks.  After the test drive, I asked him for an estimate on the CC with my trade in and it was very helpful to have the information to show my husband.

A few days later, I went back to have the parts put into my VW Beetle and this time I asked Willie about the new Jetta.  The CC is wonderful and I would love to have it, but I needed something that seated 5 with my growing child.  He was wonderful again and after talking to Bob Elkin, General Sales Manager - I took the Jetta home to show my husband.  He loved it, but not in the color I was driving.  Needless to say, the next day I was back and they just happened to have it in the color I and my husband wanted!  Again, Willie and Bob let me take it home for the day.  The 2011 Jetta is a wonderful car, very roomy, great on gas and it has all the features that we are looking for!  Blue tooth, navagation, keyless entry, huge trunk and so much more!  

While we are still trying to decide on when to trade in the awesome VW Beetle, we are so grateful for all the hard work that Willie Castillo has done for us!  He did not and has not pressured us into getting this car asap!  He told me on the first day that he wanted me to feel comfortable and know when the time is right to get the car.  Bob Elkins was the same, he told me that they were here to help me and not put any pressure on me. I truly appreciated that!  My grandfather and several cousins were in the car business, I was brought up knowing what to expect from some dealerships and how to handle the pressure.  I did not have to worry about that at all with VW McKinney!  

This really is a wonderful dealership that cares about their customers, they have an amazing service department and sales staff!  When we get our new car in the next month we will only go to VW McKinney and we will ask for one of the kindest and best salesman at their dealership - Willie Castillo!

I spoke to Christopher on the sales staff. He was very friendly and helpful. I was willing to get another Jetta and keep a very low car payment, as always, but I really wanted the beautiful, hard top convertible VW EOS. 

Christopher let me drive both cars, the EOS and the newest Jetta, and he spent several hours with me that first day. I was quite impressed. I hadn't had any problems with Boardwalk VW in Richardson, but nobody had paid the attention to me there like they did here in McKinney!  

Over the next week, my husband and I visited McKinney VW, Christopher, and all the staff several more times. Everybody was very friendly and helpful, going out of their way to answer all our questions.

Finally, we decided to go for the EOS! Mainly because the staff worked with us and what we could afford to put down, and got us a price per month that worked for us. We were very happy. 

But then, I decided the convertible had to be a red one, which put everybody back to work again, to find a red EOS.

Within a couple days, my red EOS convertible had arrived! I had them tint the windows and then we were signing papers and I was driving my new car off the lot! That last visit to the dealership felt almost like a small party, all the staff coming by to congratulate us and remark on the car.

I recommend McKinney VW highly. Be honest with the staff about what you want, and what you can afford, up front, and they will work to get you exactly what you need. I will definitely go back when this lease is up!",5.0
759,"May 08, 2011","We had a excellent buying experience with the people at McKinney Volkswagen.  They treated us very well.  I generally dread buying cars, but I made up my mind that I would buy the first car I found that fit my requirements at a good price rather than driving all over the north Dallas area trying to find the best deal and maybe save a few hundred dollars.  I brought my son-in-law because he was in car sales for a while and knows some things about the business.  When he assured me that I was getting a great deal, it was all I needed to go ahead with it.

762,"May 04, 2011","I would like to share my experience with McKinney Volkswagen sales team.

I arrived to the dealer on my way back to Laredo, TX from the Toyota dealer which is next door from McKinney Volkswagen. And just because my wife insisted to stop since she saw the car I was looking for: a 2008 AUDI A4 on the exact combination she loved White with camel interiors.

I was tired and upset after the time wasted at Toyota (not entirely their fault because they did not have the specific car I wanted).

I was received by Kevin Teller who was smart enough to handle my mood. He offered to take the 2004 Touareg I was driving and conducted all the sale at the point of closure. Because I am a 'hard cookie' he included Willy Castillo a great individual who continue addressing all my petitions.

My goal was to buy one car only; but at the end I was driving back with my wife on two shiny, flawless and full-tank vehicles to Laredo, TX: the 2008 AUDI A4 and a 2007 VW Touareg! All the transactions were painless and custom-made to accommodate my personal preferences and finance conditions. These guys are really working as a pro team to make things happen!

And all are being leaded by Vincent Ferrara who is the General Manager. He made all the difference and take this whole experience to another level. I felt I was buying the ultimate machines. He took care of me at all times; I was feeling like a spoiled boy who all demands needs to be addressed. Basically that's what he did.

Vincent, I will not forget who hand me my first ever electric guitar!

Without hesitation I will back again to buy my next cars with McKinney Volkswagen! you guys are pure rock and roll!!!

Respectfully,

RM

In one email and one phone call I made the deal on my new Jetta TDI Sportwagon. Jetta TDI Wagons are going for over MSRP. (At 52 mpg on the highway,and with no batteries, who wouldn't want to buy this car). I simply asked Dave for the best price he could give me and he sold me the car under MSRP. Dave did not have to call me back or go talk with any one, he just made the deal. The day I picked up my car, Dave went over the details of the car as well as maintances and gave me a full tank of disel. McKinney VW is a place with great customer service and they care about their customer. They even made my next maintance appointment for me. Dave and Doug have been checking in with me to make sure everything is working well. I would drive 6 hours again to purchase another VW from McKinney VW.

While the other was very aggressive trying to close the deal until we got stuck on the price. 
Dave Snow approached us while we were looking at the cars on the lot. I told him what I was looking for. He didn't try to give me the annoying typical sales pitch. He was geniune while working with us that we actually had a great time.

788,"March 21, 2011","It is my pleasure to write this letter of recommendation on behalf of Dave Snow and Jon Donahue.  I am extremely happy with my decision on leasing a 2011 CC.  I am most impressed by the level of professionalism, courtesy, LISTENING SKILLS and EXTREME patience.  

I originally purchased a VW Jetta GLI from Metro VW in Sept. 2009 and had a great experience with them.  I had a lease, allowing me only 12,000 miles.  As of January 2011 I had 28,000 miles!  I decided to go to McKinney Dealership because I had moved to Frisco and it was a closer location for me. 

When I first walked into the dealership back in January, I had a HORRIBLE experience with the previous Sales Consultant there.  Without going into too much detail, the Sales Consultant clearly needed some sales training on how to listen to their customers instead of jumping into a sale that had NOTHING to do with what I was looking for. My goal was to get a lower monthly payment or get into a new car with more miles putting little to nothing down as I was trading in a car. The Sales consultant at the time, said &quot;Great news! We can get you a CC for $535 a month, but you'll have to put $10,000 down! Or you can get that brown Passat for around the same montly payment your paying now&quot; After asking him what that payment would be, his response was &quot;close to $500 a month.&quot; I thought this was a joke!! After sitting there for 3 1/2 hours, he couldnt tell me what my payment would be.

Me being a Sales Manager for a Luxury Home Builder and in sales (and him knowing that after the first 10 seconds after meeting him), I thought I would have been one of his easiest clients.  I told him EXACTLY what I was hoping to accomplish and didnt want to play the sales game, and just wanted to see if it was possible for me to trade in my lease for a new lease because of my overage on miles, or buy my car.  Long story short, I walked out of there after 3 1/2 hours extremely frusterated and upset and 3 steps behind where I originally was.

Dave Snow had gotten a hold of my file back in January and his follow up skills were impecible!! He put in a great amount of effort into bringing me back into McKinney Volkswagon.  I had explained my situation in great detail over the phone and the reasoning for me not wanting to come back to your dealership based on the level of service I had first received.  I was so taken back on my first visit, that I never thought I would EVER lease again, step foot in McKinney VW or ever buy a Volkswagon for that matter.  Dave was extremely patient with me and my crazy busy work schedule.  Dave even went the extra mile for me and would email me updates on how I can make my situation work and get out of my lease quicker.  After months of him following up with me, I felt comfortable going back in and giving it another try.  Dave built trust by remembering my situation and took the time to really understand what I was looking to accomplish.  Within 15 minutes of being there, he was able to tell me that it was possible and I was able to get what I wanted in a car!  He not only showed me the features of this car, but the BENEFITS of how it will make my work more convenient being on the road so much.  

 Jon took the time to greet me and thank me for coming in and giving it another shot.  When we got down to the financial end of it, Jon was able to make the deal happen without any hesitation with a smile on his face. Jon would pop in every so often to make sure I was ok and things were going smoothly. I saw the enthusiasm that Dave Snow and Jon Donahue had for their job and it is that enthusiasm that makes them such a tremendous team and so successful at what they do.

In summary, Dave and Jon put in a great amount of time and I really appreciate their efforts and assistance.  I can honestly say, that I will reccommend this team to friends and family. 

Thanks again!!

791,"March 19, 2011","Dear Vince,

I am writing to you in regard to Dave Snow, the salesman who worked with us on our recent Jetta purchase in December, 2010.

Although this message is belated, on behalf of my wife, Maria, and myself, I wanted to tell you how pleased we were with Dave’s patience and professionalism throughout the sales process.  As you may recall, we are the customers that were purchasing a base model 2011 Jetta for my wife, back on December 10, 2010.  However, on the evening we were to take delivery, we discovered that the base model did not include cruise control – an essential feature for my wife.  Rather than trying to convince us that cruise control was not essential – for the sake of making the sale – Dave quickly acknowledged that not only was he unaware of the absence of cruise control on the base Jetta, but Dave also quickly nullified the sale, acknowledging the mistake and validating my wife’s opinion about that particular vehicle for her purposes.

In other words, Dave – perhaps without knowing it – made the sale that evening in both our minds.  We awkwardly parted company that evening.  However, Dave continued searching Volkswagon’s inventory for another vehicle that might better meet our needs.  While we certainly had the option to shop elsewhere at that point, both my wife and I were so impressed with his ability to put himself in our shoes that, for us, there was only one car salesman.  

We ultimately purchased a Certified Pre-Owned 2008 VW Jetta (with cruise control, of course) with Dave’s help.  It’s a great car with which my wife is very pleased – and where my wife is concerned, that’s saying something !

Which brings me to the ultimate reason for this letter – the fact that throughout the sales process, Dave listened to my wife’s concerns, her likes and dislikes, and was extremely thorough and patient in showing her all the features, taking her on multiple test drives, etc.  It was actually quite remarkable, and I want to impress upon you what a valuable person Dave is to your dealership.  In a time when the economy has us all worried about our businesses, you have a role model of how a salesman should conduct him or herself.  Nothing is more valuable to any sales organization than the capacity and patience to listen and share a prospective customer’s point of view.  

Our daughter will be graduating college within the next 18 months and I will bring her here, without reservation, to work with Dave when she is looking for a new car.  Treat this man well.  Your future depends upon it.


Kind regards,

Carl Reinelt

It was apparent from the onset that I was going to try and buy a car from Joe. 
Joe kept me up to date on what cars might be available. He called said he might have the car. Well as it turned out it was the right car the right price and perfect for what we envisioned for our son (Jackson) first car. 
We had a little issue with a static fault trip. Steve Mulholland is the Service Manager for Boardwalk VW. Took ownership and made the car right. He said he would, Steve kept his word.

Within an hour, we had agreed on the price and I flew to Dallas that afternoon to close the deal.  I didn't arrive until well after the dealership had closed but both Chris and the finance manager stayed late to facilitate the transaction.  The dealership was very clean and well-designed.  Chris was one of the most pleasant salespeople I've dealt with and I would definitely seek him out for future vehicle purchases.  This is my first VW and I am totally impressed with the quality and workmanship of the brand.  ",5.0
808,"March 02, 2011","Good communication, good price, and Dave Snow was very knowledgeable and informative. I didn't feel like he was a typical ""used"" car salesmen. I received a call within a few hours of my email about the car. I do feel like a free service visit with any new or used car would be an added benefit to the customer. My used vw golf popped up a check engine light the day after I bought it so it would of been nice to have that free service visit. Also some sort of 7 day warranty just to make sure there wasnt something terribly wrong with the car. Normally I hate being sold an extended warranty but I was never even offered an extended warranty. Overall I received good service.",4.8
809,"March 02, 2011","My experience here was awesome!  I normally do not fill out surveys, but when I have a great service experience I feel like it is important to highlight the people that made my experience so wonderful.  Not only was Gene very professional and great to work with, so were all of his coworkers.  I really did enjoy my experience at VW McKinney and look forward to going back again!!!

810,"March 02, 2011","I brought my 2009 Jetta TDi in for its 30K mile check-up and Gene was so courteous when I brought my car in earlier than the scheduled appointment and had my car ready to go earlier than he had committed to have it ready.  He called me promptly so I was able to pick up my car and move on with my busy day.  He was very friendly and the service was FREE (one of my favorite benefits of buying a new car.)

A really nice dealership with whom to work. ",5.0
811,"March 02, 2011","I'm happy VW openned in Mckinney; much better than driving to Richardson. I usually hate dealing with recalls but McKinney Staff is excellent. Gene's professionalism and kindness was amazing; not what i'm use too in assisting with my vehicle. The facilities was clean, staff nice and professional, and they even called to let me know when my vehicle was ready (i'm not use too that.) I was even informed of why a service light kept coming on and what repair was needed unlike another repair facilities who told me it was nothing but the gas cap; which was wrong. What shocked me even more was that upon returning to pickup the car they even washed my car and tires. Amazing. My husband and me will definitely return when needed.",5.0
812,"March 02, 2011",Kevin responded to my internet inquiry within 10 minutes.  I thought 'WOW' this person is really on the ball.  I found the link from our Company website and thought I would just inquire to see what type of response and offerings I could get on a new Jetta.  Working with Kevin through emails was more efficient that I ever thought it would turn out.  His offer met my expectations and we closed the deal within 24 hours.  No hassles to manuever through.  Overall experience was Great!  ,4.8
813,"February 25, 2011",Our visit to this dealership was wonderful. We were just stopping by for a test drive and ended up buying a new 2011 Tiguan. I would say that is exceptional service. Willy was fantastic as he gave us room to make our decision without feeling pressured. I feel that I am a lifelong VW driver. Thank you to Willy and the rest of the McKinney VW team. You will certainly be recommended.,5.0
814,"February 25, 2011","I went in  with an engine light on.  I had no appointment, however they got me right in.  They gave me a ride to my daughter's home in Mckinney and fixed my problem the same day.  There were two active recalls on my vehicle and they took care of those at the same time.  I am very pleased with this dealership and would recommend them to my friends and family.",5.0
815,"February 23, 2011","Had a nagging engine light problem with my wife's EOS. Pete and the service department worked on the recurring problem twice and finally have fixed it for good.
Always have received prompt, courteous, treatment with every service experience at McKinney VW Boardwalk. Michael, the service driver, is also very courteous and certainly makes you feel welcome.
Highly recommend this dealership from a service standpoint, have had no experience with buying a car here but will certainly consider them when we are ready for another VW.
So many companies could learn about customer service from you guys!! ",5.0
816,"February 22, 2011","I met Joe Luna, first through the live chat on your website.  He was very friendly and professional, listening to my needs.  He was very honest from the beginning, letting me know he will search for the car I wanted.  A few days later he emailed me that he had a Jetta for me that met my needs.  I went in to see Joe and instantly, he made me feel very comfortable.  Again, I found his listening skills to be excellent.  He answered all my questions and allowed me to come to the conclusion that this car was the right one for me.  I will highly recommend Joe to anyone interested in buying a VW.",4.8
817,"February 15, 2011","I have been to 2 other dealerships in 2 other cities with my ""transmission issues"". They both told me that nothing was wrong and they checked the tranmisission. When I talked to other mechanics they would tell me it sounds like a transmission issue. Gene and his team never once tried to get rid of me or try to take advantage of me. As a female more often than not this happens. I would recommend this dealership to anyone!!  ",5.0
818,"January 31, 2011","I purchased a certified used Passat from this dealership last spring and have since utilized their service department for routine maintenance, warranty repair, and recall services.  Brandon Hill in the Service Department has assisted me with each of these visits and I can't say enough about his exceptional level of service.  I have always been taken care of whether I scheduled service in advance via phone or internet and even when I have dropped by without an appointment; this service department accomodates my schedule and my vehicle has been ready when promised.  Not only do they perform the services requested in a timely manner, but they do so without nickel and diming me for these services.  Not many dealerships honor military members with discounts, but this one does.  It is good to know that this dealership accurately reflects the values of the community it is a part of.  My only regret is that I did not find this delearship sooner.  From sales, to finance, to services the personel in each department that I have dealth with have gone above and beyond all previous experiences I have had at other delearships.  Obviously, I highly recommend McKinney Volkswagen!",5.0
819,"January 24, 2011","I have gone to many dealers in my 23 years in the Dallas area.From the minute I went in got a great trade for my car , great financing, ready for pickup when promised.
They get me in and out as easy as possible and make me know they understand how important my time is every time. Calling me by name every time and concern for my day and how it is going , just gives you that great feeling that going back for any service with the car will be a breeze. 
Sincerely

820,"January 24, 2011","I was so pleased that I immediately posted all this dealer's information on facebook.  I have told everyone about this great dealership.  These guys did not play games - they were honest, worked hard to ensure I was happy, and had great offerings.  If you are looking for a vehicle contact Boardwalk Volkswagen of McKinney - www.boardwalkag.com or 1-800-373-6796 - you will be glad you did.  I had been to dozens of dealerships prior to these guys...WOW WHAT A GREAT DEALERSHIP!!!!!  :-)",4.6
821,"January 12, 2011","I purchased a low milage mini van. A few months ago.  It is a VW Routan.  Every time I have brought it in for basic service they have gone out of their way to treat me as if I just bought the most expensive new car they have.  They always return my vehical to me cleaner than when I brought it to them.  I just recently had a front wheel bearing go bad.  They took care of the problem no questions asked.  It was all covered under the factory warranty still.  They made sure that I had a way to work and even offered to pick me up or give me a ride if they did not have a loner car for me to use.  The people I worked with are all very courtious and I would highly recommend you look at working with this company.


Thanks,

822,"December 20, 2010","     My husband and I were ready to trade in my Lexus and I was very interested in learning more about the VW CC.  The sales staff at VW McKinney were knowledgeable and professional.  Deciding to purchase the car was an easy choice, and Kevin and Sam helped make our buying experience easy, too.  In fact, everyone we have met at the dealership has been friendly and a pleasure to work with.  
     Once we picked up the car, Doug spent ample time with me, to explain in detail each function of the vehicle's components .  He even scheduled my first maintenance appointment, and has followed up with me through email since our first visit. 
     The level of service we were provided upon first walking through the doors of the dealership continued each time we went back.  We will definitely recommend McKinney Volkswagon to our friends and family.",5.0
823,"December 14, 2010","We were totally satisfied with your dealership and the professionalism of your staff. We are new to the Dallas area and we feel fortunate to have found such a nice dealership to bring our car for service. From the employee that quickly greeted us at the Service Deparment and who called us about the repairs, to the friendliness of the Cashier who promptly waited on us and had our car immediately delivered to us with no wait at all.  And, what a wonderful surprise to discover they had washed our car and cleaned the inside.  We thought we had just bought a new car.  Never in all my years of owning a vehicle had I ever had such fine service from a dealership. My wife and I thank you for the pleasant experience.
