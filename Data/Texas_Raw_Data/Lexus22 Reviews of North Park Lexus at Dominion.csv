0,"October 26, 2019",Rusty Vaughn was my sales person and he was awesome! He was very patient with me when I couldn‚Äôt decide on colors for the car. I actually had a little hiccup and changed my mind after the vehicle was purchased and Rusty and Zac Hale went above and beyond to make sure I was happy and got what I wanted. Everyone at the dealership is very friendly and the services offered are like no other I‚Äôve experienced at a dealership. Definitely recommend! ,5.0

2,"November 18, 2018","Went in to look at leasing a NX300 at the Dominion location. The original salesperson we dealt was great, but when I went in with my wife, he had left the dealership. The next sales person was simply not interested to talk to us about different features available and was very quiet during our entire time. Even the pricing given to us was excruciatingly high. We left with a bad taste and decided to go to the San Pedro location. Incidentally we found a contact as a reference but were told that this location really did not want to deal with INDIANS. This attitude really sucks...such that it made us contact a dealership outside the San Antonio area to lease our next Lexus.  ",1.8

I got a car üòä.  The transaction educated me but I acquired two new trustworthy friends!!!  I will ALWAYS return. ",5.0
5,"May 26, 2018","‚ÄúThis dealership is outstanding.  Their main goal is to take care of the customer and make sure the experience is unparalleled.  M. James Garza is an outstanding professional and person.  Took care of everything making for a great buying experience.  Ms. Kirby on financing made wonders.  Even found me a lower rate than my bank.  I was literary out of there in less than one hour. An by the way, James took the car to my workplace to show it to me and drove it home after I purchased it.  Look him out.  He will take care of you‚Äù.",5.0

7,"August 05, 2017",Have purchased 5 Lexus vehicles in 15 years. Vehicle delivered to Lexus Dominion at 7:00 AM. Could not receive response from service advisor until 4:00 PM. Be prepared to wait on them.,1.0
8,"July 06, 2017","I bought 3 cars from a gentleman named Rusty when he was at north park Toyota. To my surprise, when I was shopping for a vehicle for my elderly mother, I found out rusty had moved over to north park Lexus. I bought an RX from him without ever setting foot into the dealership (I'm from Louisiana). Rusty's negotiated price was $2k less than all negotiated prices in Louisiana so I had the car shipped to me. Thanks Rusty! ",5.0

10,"May 26, 2017","James Garza was extremely helpful, personable and knowledgeable during my buying experience! I highly recommend asking for him I you're interested in purchasing a vehicle at North Park Dominion. ",5.0
11,"May 19, 2017","This dealership is by far the best facility I have visited. Very friendly staff, great atmosphere and great prices on vehicles. Would like to give a special thank you to my salesman Fernando Maldonado for sending me great information and answering any questions I had. I found exactly what I was looking for and I'll be sure to buy my next vehicle from North Park Lexus Dominion.",5.0
12,"May 12, 2017","I do have some concerns that will prevent me from doing business with them and recommending them to friends and family.  Salesman was going to have a red Lexus transferred from the San Pedro location to dominion and said it was ""secured"" for my wife to look at the next day as she wanted to buy that one.  Got a text at 8 pm the night before saying ""sorry, it was sold."" I'm sure dealership's position is that car is fair game with no deposit.  I got that. But, I think it also speaks volumes to customer service and integrity.  Dealer had another car we were interested in. Vehicle was listed as non-smoking. There was an obvious cigarette burn in the headliner and the car smelled like smoke. It's funny how companies that cater to more affluent consumers confuse free Starbucks and snacks as excellent customer service.  Regardless, we ended up buying our car at Austin of Lexus and had a really good experience.

13,"January 10, 2017",Salesman James and Used car Sales Manager Tre met my every need and beyond. They really did have my back and made sure I was 100% satisfied when I left those doors. Highly recommend!!!      -Isaac R,5.0
14,"December 07, 2016","I purchased a brand new Lexus and discovered it did not fit my needs within a couple of days.     My salesperson Alex Navarrete had the patience of a saint dealing with me!  He spent several hours driving multiple cars until we found the perfect one for me- which was a new GS 350.  I love it!!!  The entire team from Justin, the new car sales manager and Oscar Elizondo in finance was the best experience I have ever had purchasing a car.  I was able to visit with the General Manager, Jesus Rodriguez and he was very helpful in resolving my situation!  I have owned several Mercedes Benz that I purchased in Boerne.  I don't know how that store can survive when you have the staff, service and amazing facility that Lexus at Dominion have to offer!!!",5.0
15,"December 02, 2016","I recently took my 2015 GS for 20K mile scheduled service. Setting the appointment was easy, and the scheduler was able to work with my scheduling needs. The service promptly began within minutes of my arrival. John Barecky (Certified Service Consultant of record) displayed his usual level of exemplary customer care and concern, kept me informed of the service progress, and returned my car to me washed perfectly. NP Lexus of Dominion is a class act, and is the product of their exceptional, professional team members. John is predictably on his game each and every time I bring my vehicle in for service. Thank You!

16,"October 14, 2016","I just traded in my Mercedes for a Lexus 300h. 

Sales manager, Todd Vagi, worked hard to earn my business and my trust. He went out of his way to make sure that I was completely satisfied. In the auto sales industry professionalism, ethics and trust are not easy to earn. Mr. Vagi is a wonderful example of these qualities.  

And thank you also to Cory Holland who attended to all of the little details that matter.

17,"August 19, 2016","We recently purchased a Lexus RX 350 from North Park Lexus of Dominion.  Our original plan was to go thru our bank‚Äôs car buying service, but at North Park Lexus of Dominion we found the exact RX 350 that we wanted (colors, features, options, etc.)  We had expected that the prices would be much higher than competitors.  WRONG!  We were able to get a better price than the car buying service offered -- and, from a dealer much closer to home.

Our salesman, Frank Pace, was very professional and accomodating.  No pressure, etc., which made the car buying experience extra special.   Frank ensured that our requirements,  desires and needs were met to our satisfaction and then some. An extra nice touch was the gift of a basket of ‚Äúgoodies‚Äù --  a touch of class!  Frank was excellent at following-up to ensure our experience was positive in all respects.

The facility at North Park Lexus of Dominion is absolutely ‚ÄúFirst Class!‚Äù  Viewing the photos of the facility on the web page does not do justice to seeing the facility in person.  Not many superlatives (e.g. ‚Äúrustic luxury‚Äù) can accurately capture the appearance and ambiance that one experiences while there.  All of the employees we‚Äôve encountered on several visits were professional, friendly and helpful.

If you are like we were -- ready to move up to automotive state-of-the art design, technology and luxury -- we highly recommend that you visit North Park Lexus of Dominion -- and ask for ‚ÄúFrank‚Äù. You will not be disappointed.

20,"June 25, 2015","I just purchased  a new Lexus from this dealer. Without any reservations, the purchase experience was both professional and exceptional. See Rusty Vaughn or Kent Patterson for assistance in selection and working a favorable deal for you. 
Customer care begins on your arrival, and awaits you on your return. 
Lexus builds a great vehicle, the staff at North Park Lexus @ Dominion is what sets this dealer many miles ahead of any other dealer in the Southwest.
I will be back for my next vehicle replacement in the coming months.

21,"January 24, 2015","Our entire experience was exceptional from beginning to end. Our sales specialist, Jamie Brennan, welcomed us at the beautiful NP Lexus at Dominion dealership. She helped locate the exact vehicle we were looking for, made the purchase process painless, and delivered our new GX460 expeditiously. We couldn't be happier with our experience, and would highly recommend Jamie Brennan to anyone in the market for a new vehicle. We will continue to be long-time Lexus customers thanks to the superior service they provide! ",5.0
