I did not get anxious as I usually do buying an automobile because everything went very swiftly and stressfree.  I totally love my RAM 1500!! It is so comfortable and absolutely beautiful.  
This is the second time I deal with Burns and both times were awesome.  I really recommend this dealership and the people working there.",5.0

9,"September 30, 2016","I have purchased several vehicles from Burns Motors and have been extremely impressed with their sales and finance department. They do not play games or waste your time like many other local dealerships.  In my opinion, Burns Motors is simply the best dealership I have dealt with. Braden Contreras was my salesman and is a great person to deal with. He is very honest and patient. If your looking for a vehicle don't waste your time at other dealerships,  please check out Burns Motors. You wont be disappointed!!",5.0
10,"December 01, 2015","Mr. Benito Reyes and Mr. Gary Solomon were wonderful people to work with when I bought my new van in 2015.  The price was right with great incentives.  I would recommend these two people and the rest of the staff at Burns Motors.  This is my second experience with Burns Motors.  I bought a new van from them in 2003 and was very pleased with the price and service I received then.  I would like to add that Burns Motors supports KVMV.org, the Valley's Christian Radio Station and I hear their name mentioned every day on the station.  Thank you.  Kathy",5.0
