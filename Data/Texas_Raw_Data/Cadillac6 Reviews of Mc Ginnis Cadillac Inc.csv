5,"January 08, 2007","Let me tell you a little about my experience with McGinnis Cadillac.

During an online search for a pre-owned vehicle, I came across what I thought to be a pretty good bargain from McGinnis Cadillac.  I called the number listed, and spoke to a sales person.  He gave me some information about the car, and I went to look at it during my lunch break.

The first time I got there, the car was blocked in by about 5 other cars, so a test drive was out of the question.  I had to come back a second time to test drive it.  After driving the car, and deciding I liked it, we negotiated a price a day or two later, and I informed the sales person I intended to have the vehicle inspected, and, should the vehicle pass inspection, I intended to purchase it.  I SPECIFICALLY asked him what the protocol would be for taking the car off the market, asking him if a deposit was required, and telling him I would have no problem leaving one.  HIS WORDS: ""Consider it held.""  I informed the sales person that if he needed a deposit, or needed to get a hold of me for any reason, to not hesitate to call me.  I worked about 2 miles away, and could easily drop by.

I contacted an inspection company on a Thursday (1 day after we agreed on a deal).  They inspected the car the following day (Friday).  

Saturday gets here.  At this time, the report had been completed, but the results had not been made available by the inspection company.  I receive a phone call from the sales person Saturday evening, informing me that someone is looking at the vehicle.  I tell him I don't yet have the report, and ask him if he needs anything from me to ensure the car will be held.  I tell him that I will contact him the second the report is in my hands.  He tells me he'll let everyone know, and not to worry.

It's now Monday.  The report is posted at around 8AM my time, and I call the dealership at around 10AM (I believe the earliest they open).  There was nothing on the report that would have stopped me from buying the car.  I had a question about a minor line item on the report, but that was basically it.  The sales person tells me he will go retrieve the car.

I get a call from the sales person 30 minutes later, informing me that they sold the vehicle Saturday evening.  He is apologetic, and keeps saying he ""doesn't know what happened"".  When I press him as to what happened, he doesn't know what to say.  I proceed to remind him that they promised to hold the car, and I had offered on multiple occasions to leave a deposit.  All I get is ""I know, I'm sorry"".  Furious, I ask to have the inspection fee refunded ($99).  He says he will ask his supervisor.  I get another call 30 minutes later, informing me they are unwilling to refund my inspection fee.

I leave a message to the owner of the dealership.  He calls me back, sounding very concerned.  He says he will investigate this ""right now"" and get back to me today.  This was around 2PM this afternoon, and the dealership has long since closed.  I'd be real surprised if I ever heard back from him.

<b>I hope that after reading the above, you will see why I give McGinnis Cadillac a rating of 1.  I would give them a rating of ZERO, but that is not a choice on this website. NOT ONE THING about my experience with this classless organization has been positive.  I will contact the Better Business Bureau and other outlets, so consumers can know about what happens at McGinnis Cadillac ahead of time, and not experience anger and frustration similar to what I have experienced.</b>",1.0
