7,"June 08, 2020","Came in to look for a new/used car when my previous car hit 130,000 miles. Saw some cars on the dealership website that looked promising but when I came in there were several cars not listed on the website with good deals.

While I had not initially planned to purchase a vehicle that day due to concerns over a high interest rate on the loan offered through the dealership's connections (I had already gotten quotes from outside sources) the sales team worked with me and heard my concerns. After some back and forth, the manager was able to offer me a better interest rate than what I had gotten from previous quotes.

I walked out that night with the keys in hand and very pleased with the overall experience.",5.0

10,"May 30, 2020","Bought the Honda Insight for my daughter.  The purchase was smooth and easy!! Walked in and out in less than 1 1/2 hours.  Options were offered but we were not pressured.  We had already test drove many cars and experienced many sales persons who did not know much about their product.  Kaylon Jackson was awesome!  Unlike any other,  he knew everything about the Honda product.  Took his time and explained everything about the car to my daughter.  Asked her how she wanted her settings done and the car was ready to go when we left.  The key to excellent sales is making a personal relationship with the client and Kaylon did just that.  Left my daughter with personal advise that she will carry with her forever!!  I would definitely buy from him again.",5.0

After a lot of research and visiting other dealerships, I requested a quote through Hondaoftomball.com and Tatiana emailed me quickly with the details, including the out-the-door price for the car I was interested in without any outrageous fees. I scheduled a test drive for later that day. Tatiana was knowledgeable, friendly, and very easy to talk to. We settled on a price and a fair value for my trade-in. I then met with Manny Gil, the finance manager. He was also lovely to work with. The final price was exactly what I discussed with Tatiana. There was no pressure to add on any unnecessary options or fees. You hear about things fees for things like window etching, nitrogen in the tires, etc. None of those were even mentioned. The document fee was reasonable. After we signed the contract, Tatiana helped me set up the safety features to my liking. This was the easiest car-buying experience I've ever had and I cannot recommend Honda of Tomball highly enough! Totally worth the drive from Katy! ",5.0

Rhonda Walling, our sales person, was standing behind a desk and greeted us as we walked in the door. She asked if she could help us. When we told her we wanted to look at a CRV, she took us to a desk to find out exactly what we wanted in a vehicle. She found a CRV that met all of our must haves.

39,"April 02, 2020","When shopping for a new Civic EX to buy, Nick was the most transparent, responsive, and offered the lowest price for exactly what I was looking for compared to 4 other highly-rated local Honda dealers in the Houston area.

I hate dealing with car dealerships when it comes to negotiating pricing on any kind of situation (leasing, lease sale, purchase, loan, etc), so I prefer to email all of them for what I want, then proceed with the best and most-transparent one or two offers.

Nick was great all the way through the process: he was the first to respond, the only one with totally transparent pricing for exactly what I wanted, and the actual process of purchasing the new car at the dealership was one of the best experiences I've had at a dealership.

I would highly recommend Honda of Tomball, and Nick Durham specifically, if you're on the fence between them and another dealer.",5.0

94,"November 17, 2019","Just a heads up that this review is going to sound more like an acceptance speech at a Hollywood award ceremony than it will a typical review. The obvious reason you’ll see for this is the amount of people I have to sincerely thank and the explanations for that appreciation. The other is because I honestly feel like I all around gained some things through my car purchase here at Honda of Tomball. Things that I am proud of and things that will help me go forward with huge success for many years to come. The best part is that I have zero regret so far and don’t have a single inclination I will acquire any in the future. Zero! That’s a rare thing to feel this soon after a purchase of any type anywhere, especially one this significant. I don’t feel bad about the terms, the price, the car, The coverages, the need for a new vehicle or lack of one, the dealership chosen...and the time spent between multiple dealerships or the fact that usually I feel like I should have visited more. There is almost always some type of buyers remorse associated with most major purchases in some way, shape, or form. Anyhow, my mind is perfectly at ease due to the events and people I’ve been exposed to over the last 96 hours. It all started with a phone call to compare a price that I was getting for the same vehicle at a different dealership. My sales advisor Stephen Bonnain answered the call and got to work right away. He stayed focused to the exact request I had and assured me that once I made it in to his dealership he’d have everything arranged to my specifications. When I arrived everything was in good order but my initial communication with him was a bit confusing when it came to some specifics, therefore a few things with the vehicle weren’t exactly the same way as they were on the vehicle I had been looking at earlier. This was not Stevens fault and he handled it without producing any frustration on my part(probably why it’s best to just get into the dealership in person and let them do what they do best first). Now enters the management team...Josh Wilms and Josh Foust both spent a few minutes with me following up with what was initially discussed on the phone and quickly got the paperwork sorted out and produced. They honored every word they had spoken and helped me feel great about moving right along with the process after only being there for a few minutes. I can tell you that the deal would not have been done if they hadn’t made that part so hassle free. A few minutes of waiting started but Zach, my finance manager, walked up and introduced himself while letting me know he was getting everything ready for me to move to his office. Meanwhile, anyone and everyone that passed by always took a moment to check on me and offer up a few moments of fun conversation even if they didn’t have anything directly to to with my deal. Once I got into Zach’s office it was all adaptive cruise control for the rest of the process. His explanations made it easy for me to agree to and choose all of the best financing options for my vehicle. What was great about my time spent with him was that he actually helped me and consulted. I never felt like I was being sold anything...just gaining peace of mind, control, and stability. We had quite a few good laughs as well. While I was with Zach my sales associate Steven was of course getting the car gassed up, washed, and prepped for receiving. When it came time to actually get the keys another sales associate named Cody Schulin joined us for the walk through on my Accord. He was extremely knowledgeable about the systems and settings for the vehicle but there was one question that none of us could come up with the answer for at that time. He threw out the old “I’ll do some research on that and let you know” line...I’ve heard it a thousand times but this time, I woke up to an email from him on Monday with the exact literature and directions for the issue. The guy remembered what most would consider a small trivial detail all through the rest of the weekend and delivered with awesomeness the first chance he had back in the office. That was the beginning of the rest of all the “little details” that make this dealership and their services Top Notch and stand out amongst the rest! Wednesday was the next time I came into the dealership to get some of the remaining accessories added to the vehicle. The first service advisor that I had set me up was Bob. He got me checked right in...this was my first experience driving a car right up to the service center expecting work to be done that day without ever scheduling an appointment(I’ll tell you about that here in a minute). I went in and said hey to the guys on the floor then left until it was time to come back to pick my car up. There was a tiny hiccup at that point in the sense that not all of the work was able to be completed that night and I wasn’t expecting to have to come back again to get it finished...I say that not to blast anyone but because I was a little upset until I saw how great everything had turned out at this point. Pedro, nailed it with all of the additions and modifications that were done to the car. Between that and how kindly Jozeph, the service advisor on duty was treating me at that time, I forgot all about work still needing to be done...in fact I was excited to bring the car back in especially knowing that there wouldn’t need to be an appointment scheduled for some time way later in the week...just bring it back in tomorrow whenever! They’d get it done. Matt, the one running the service department at that time was still very sympathetic and apologized for any inconvenience that may have been caused. We all took a few moments to talk and decompress before i headed out, after all this was at 10:30 at night. Yes, 10:30 at night because their service department doesn’t close until 11PM on weekdays!!! They both explained that if I ever needed anything at 10o’clock at night...just bring it it and if they can get the work started or finished...they will. No appointment necessary! So I’ve said that a few times and by now I’m guessing you’re picking up on it...I’ll hammer that home here in a minute though. The next day, I brought my car back in and was met in the service lanes by a super nice lady and Mr. Fink(I didn’t know that he was the guy that had the big glass office with all of the certifications and awards on the wall). But they received my car just the same way as before and listened to and addressed any other issues I had. This time I stayed while they were doing the work and took advantage of the waiting areas and the amenities they provided. In fact I started writing this review while I was sitting in their top of the line massage chair. This wasn’t no vibrating $5 airport leg rubber...this thing hit every spot that an hour with a therapist would. Shoot that time in the chair and my Starbucks coffee that was brewed right there in the waiting area was worth the trip back alone. Had me contemplating taking a cross country trip and knocking out the mileage to my first oil change so I could come back the next week. When I had loosened up all I could and finished my coffee and the list of people I’d need to include in this review, I walked back out to the floor and chatted with another manager I had met the day before. His name is Steven Elsbury. He was supper helpful both days with filling in for anyone who was involved with the original sale but had either of the days I was there off. Just another example of a great member of the team always wanting to take time to make me feel special even if it didn’t have something to do with the next sale they were trying to work on. When the work was done on my car, I was introduced to a service member named Phil. I gotta tell you one last thing...this guy is smart and knows his business better than any I’ve ever met. He explained the issue I had mentioned in passing when I first handed the car over that day...I honestly didn’t expect an answer or an explanation because most places wouldn’t have even passed something small like that along looking for any remedy or thought it would be of any importance. Well it was important for me at least...it really solidified the whole process that I had just finished going through and it put me at ease knowing that at anytime going forward, 7 days a week, pretty much anytime of the day for the next 7 years...My new car and I will be in good hands. This service is available for any type of car at any time always with No Appointment Necessary Monday thru Friday till 11PM and Saturday and Sunday 7AM-7PM! In closing, my time at Honda of Tomball was a vastly different car buying experience than ANY other I’ve ever had. It’s because of their impeccable ability to focus on every detail no matter how small or insignificant it may seem, their amazing product and 1 of a kind service that they are able to offer, and most of all...the Team Members there that care about, are good at, and love their job. I promise if you go in and spend some time getting to know them, they will help you with whatever you may Truly need. They did it with me and I was just a voice on the other side of the phone at first...",5.0

96,"November 14, 2019","We purchased a 2019 Honda Civic Touring at Honda of Tomball in November of 2019. I have purchased many vehicles throughout my life and this was the best auto transaction that I have ever experienced. We have owned six Honda’s including recently purchasing a 2018 CRV at John Eagle Honda last December just before Honda of Tomball opened (for tax purposes we could not wait). John Eagle Honda’s cars have built in profit with ridiculous dealer added options such as “nitrogen filled tires” and a “theft tracking device” totaling $2000 of dealer added items + a $995 destination charge. I sure wish Honda of Tomball would have been open last December as they PLAY NONE OF THESE GAMES AND CHARGE NONE OF THESE FEE’S. They added $150 to the car. Thats it. They didn’t even charge for the window tint or wheel locks. We negotiated a fantastic price VIA TEXT MESSAGE - 0 Hassle. We then negotiated a fantastic interest rate. I had a very professional team assigned to me consisting of Dustin Riley - Sales, Joshua Foust - Sales Mgr, Steve Stromatt - Finance and Zach Barra - Finance Mgr. I have been purchasing vehicles for 35 years and Honda of Tomball is the best that I have ever dealt with. I will buy all of our future Honda’s from them.",5.0

John Vo was my salesperson, and he was totally helpful and  did an excellent job coordinating the details and organization to make sure I had a smooth experience.  Ultimately when I showed up at the dealership all I had to do was sign docs, make the payment and drive away in my Ridgeline.  Thumbs up to John and team!",5.0

106,"September 17, 2019","One of the greatest ideas they came up with, besides the Starbucks coffee machine, is that they remain open until 11 pm during the week.  I have never encountered a dealership do this.  Gone will be the days when for reasons of importance you can’t make it to the shop until later in the morning and you’ll be told we can’t accept your car because we close at 7 pm.

What I did not appreciate is that I was sent an appraisal on my car with pictures of all my bumps and scratches.  It was sent to my email and the next day I received a text message on my cellular phone following up with the appraisal.  What was strange was that the person’s title was discrepant and I was not sure they were directly associated with the dealership.  Abstracting my information from service records to contact me seemed a bit invasive..  An adjustment of this procedure is warranted.",5.0

I brought it in today and he said bc we wrote the review he would NOT EVEN LOOK AT MY CAR!  TERRIBLE!!

A few days ago, we went to the dealership to update from My mini van to a CR-V. Tommy Win greeted us as we looked at the car lot and helped us narrow our options down and find the perfect car! He did an outstanding job helping and making our experience at the dealership the best it could be. ",5.0
112,"August 26, 2019","I worked with Zeke and Dandi to look at different features of the Honda Accord, Pilot and Ridgeline They were very helpful and knowledgeable about the different vehicles and their options. Lenny made the pricing appealing for my final selection with no hassle. I could not have been more pleased with what I selected. The service they extended was nice and sweet not pushy which was refreshing, and they helped me think about my family’s needs. They offered personal insight which was valuable before my final decision. They were very patient with me when I asked the same question more than once and Dandi went the extra mile explaining and setting up the technology features. And she has followed up with me offering continued help. Thank you all for being so personable. I don’t buy very often and I could not be happier with my new Honda Pilot!",5.0

When a car comes in from an accident/insurance claim they are suppose to fill out an MPI showing what’s wrong with the car.

Attention to detail is demonstrated. They have truly been partners in our ownership experience. That’s how genuine trust is developed. This has happened across the board from these employees: Gary, Chad, Mike, Lenny, Walter, Neil and a couple of others whose names I cannot recall at the moment. When you have an investment in a vehicle you want a dealer to enhance that investment-not diminish it. Honda of Tomball accomplishes this to the highest degree. ",5.0
