7,"April 25, 2019","Went to dealership recommended by step daughter.  Was greeted by Todd and asked how he could help.  I told him what I had in mind.  We went to the car lot where there were many to choose  from.  I narrowed it down to two  different models that I drove to check out. Decided on a White traverse suv. 
When back to Todd’s office and the paperwork began. The gentleman who finished up the paperwork was fast and efficient.  Today picked up my new shiny Traverse.  Todd explained all the features and set up my Bluetooth.  At no time did I feel I was being talked down to.  He was happy to help a baby boomer with the “bells and Whistles “
of this generation.   Thank you Todd for your patience.  I will be recommending you to any one who is wanting to purchase a vehicle!",4.7

46,"November 06, 2018","I had the pleasure of buying my second Tahoe from Tegler.  The deciding factor for me to return to this dealership was the employees and the excellent service.  On one of my service trips for my Cadillac I had the pleasure of working with Mr. Tegler himself.  He was genuinely friendly, down to earth, knowledgeable and extremely helpful.  Instead of telling me about something a might need he informed me of what I should do regarding an issue with my Cadillac.  This advice saved me money and it worked.  I’m all for honesty and integrity especially in today’s world when it’s getting harder to find these qualities in a person and company.  Also the sales person, Todd Bourque has the same qualities that Mr. Tegler has and that made my buying decision easier.",5.0

I finally decided to purchase a new Silverado and was challenged deciding what options and how much value. Kevin helped me through this delimma professionally and courteously without any hard sell or drama. I had to convince myself where to be logical and where to splurge. Tegeler made it easy without pressure and commercially competitive. In the end a great deal and I feel we both left money on the table so a good negotiation with smiles on both sides.

86,"December 13, 2017","I was in need of a vehicle after being involved in an accident, totaling my truck. I am young, and had never purchased a vehicle before. After a few weeks of searching used vehicles, missing out on great deals, and not really finding what I was looking for, I stumbled onto Tegelers website. As usual I reached out to the dealer about a used vehicle I was interested, and was promptly reached out to by a Tegeler employee, Kevin. Not only did we quickly set up a time for me to come out and see the vehicle, he also did something no other dealer had done yet, he asked me what it was I was looking for. Not having planned on getting another vehicle for a while I realized I hadn't put much time into figuring out what it was I actually wanted, all I knew was I needed a truck. The next day I visited the dealership and Kevin spent time with me showing me my options. He even brought up what I feared the most... buying a NEW vehicle. To make a long story short, I am currently driving around in a new 2018 Silverado, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase from Tegeler. When Kevin was able to help me figure out exactly what I needed he explained my purchasing options, and he was able to find me exactly what I was looking for. As a first time buyer he made perfect sense of the benefits of buying new versus buying used.  He even went above and beyond to get me in my new vehicle as soon as possible, taking time on his day off, driving all around Texas to make sure I didn't have to wait on my new purchase. I have a whole new outlook on car buying thanks to him.",5.0
