1,"April 17, 2020","I recently purchased a vehicle from Texan GMC . I traded in my truck to and agreed to price. I was ""TOLD"" the sale price of the new vehicle was 68,999 (Denali Ultimate 2500 Duramax) OTD. Shook hands and took the deal. Well i get my first statement in and low and behold it was 68,999 plus ttl and Added another 2900 on top of the agreed to price. I bought all my documentation showing this. the sales manager Lonnie Gibson(Crooked Car Salesman) lied through his teeth and will not honor it. So here I am telling my story so that this Scam / Terrible Business practice doesn't happen to anyone else!",1.0

He was able to get it the next day and we finalized everything that same day.  Thank you!!  Ofelia Garza,5.0

The manager said again if we want the rims it would be another $4000. Or they could take them off and put the factory wheels back on it.  Like him saying it made everything OK.  NO!  The website picture and price should be accurate....not having to read fine print or disclosures.  We are not buying anything from you.  We will never buy from this dealership!

39,"October 24, 2017","My Name is Bob L. and to be frank, I'm not too pleased with how this  dealership handled the issue regarding the purchase of a car I got from your lot. I thought for once I'd try doing business locally in my area by not driving all over Houston, last time I'll be doing that.
Last week my wife and I dropped in to the Texan GMC Buick dealer off of Hwy 59 (18225 Eastex Freeway Humble TX 77338) and found a used vehicle my wife would like to have, so anyways we test drove it and decided it was the car for her. After a short period of price haggling we  agreed on a price, I signed the required documents, waited twenty minutes for them to prep the car and was told the car is ready. As my wife and I were exiting the show room onto the lot the sales person (Paul Hernandez) advised me that there is only one key fob, I turned to him and said ‚Äúwhen will I get the other one‚Äù? He responded they are aware of the missing second key and will ask the previous owner as to where it‚Äôs at and will get back to me in a few days. I returned the same day to drop off 3 keys for the vehicle I just sold to them and a check for the vehicle I just purchased, I also reiterated to the finance manager (Joe Gomez) that ‚Äúnot having the second key is not acceptable and I would not have purchased the car if I was disclosed this information earlier‚Äù, I was running late for work and as I was exiting his office Mr. Gomez said ‚Äúnot to expect the second key‚Äù, yet an hour before he was the person passing me documents to sign and reiterating that ‚Äúhis job is to make sure to do what is necessary to make the customer happy and resolve any issues‚Äù.  I told him I hope you find it and left. 
Couple days had passed and I got a call from Paul saying that the second key cannot be located and that I needed to come and talk to the manager as to what they can do, and besides I needed to bring the car in because they forgot to get a safety inspection done. Two days passed, I'm at the Texan GMC Buick dealer with the car for a safety inspection, as I was waiting I went into and spoke to Lonnie Gibson (Sales Manager) to see what they can do. He told me ""it‚Äôs a used car"", ""we didn‚Äôt promise a second key"", ""and there is nothing they can do"" AND had the balls to ask me if I ever purchased a used car from a lot before? I said yes, actually the vehicle I just turned in was from a Toyota dealer and at the time of pick up had only the valet key, I spoke to the manager and they provided 2 keys and 2 remotes (well done Don McGill Toyota!).

This time I purchased a 2013 Mercedes from a Buick dealer, paid cash, and was treated like this? This is nothing short of an insult, aside from utilizing shady sales practices, not being up front and nothing short of being liars for their own greed and bonuses. In this case buyer beware if you were to do business with them. ",1.6

Called to make sure that the appointment was still made and spoke to Ashley who said that she also had a 1pm. The 1pm worked better with my schedule so I booked that time. I went to the service location, went to the service department where only one older man was sitting spitting chew into a cup, ignored me when I walked up, then I said ""I have a 1pm appointment to have my thermostat replaced"", he then begrudgingly typed my name into the computer and said ""nope, there is no appointment here, can you leave it with me till Tuesday or Wednesday?""

78,"July 26, 2016","My vehicle was taken in for oil change and service due to my check engine light, my vehicle was not driving any differently but my light was on. The technician could not figure out what was wrong with my vehicle. He called my husband to ask him if he knew what was going on with it because the computer was throwing almost 2 dozen false codes. My husband told them he did not know which is why we took it to them in the first place. They finally decided it was my fuse box and replaced it. When I picked up my vehicle, I had to turn right back around and take it back. There was a very loud popping noise and my radio was shorting out. We received a call a few days later letting us know our vehicle was once again ready. Upon pick up I was informed that the technician who replaced the fuse box was in to much of a rush and did not put the box back in the proper way so it shorted out and a new one was ordered and put in properly. I did not make it home from the dealership before my vehicle's check engine light was back on and my vehicle was no longer driving properly. I took it back to the dealership once again to be asked if I just wanted an application for a new car. In a frustrating situation, that was not a welcome comment. I just wanted my car fixed properly. I was called the next day and informed that my catalytic converter was the problem and would not be covered under my warranty so it would cost me close to $1000 to replace. When I questioned the technician as to why this issue would not have been noticed before and why all of the sudden my vehicle was driving improperly when I was having no issue with it prior to service, he informed me that the computer does not throw false codes and if that is what it says then that was what was wrong. This was very confusing since the week prior at the beginning of service we were called regarding the dozen plus false codes that the computer was showing. I suggested checking my O2 sensors since that is an issue related to the catalytic converter which would cause similar issues. The technician would not even check into the possibility. He told me if the code said catalytic converter then that is what it is. I decided to pick up my vehicle and take it for a second opinion. I am very dissatisfied with the service I was provided.

79,"July 25, 2016",Purchased a fully loaded slt less than a year ago.  They we're great.  Bought used and had a clean carfax.  Find out later it had been in a wreck.  Then it wouldnt pass inspection.  Took it in.  After a week and a half they call me that it's ready and inspected. I get there and they give me a failed inspection paper.  And there's a dent in my bumper.  The service guy said he was sorry.  I asked how can we fix it and he said he will have to give me a new bumper. I emailed him to set up a time to get the new bumper and now he says his guys didn't do it. And they said it wouldn't pass because of the tv installed in the truck.  The tv came in the truck when I bought it.  So they gave me back my truck still not passing inspection.  With a dent in the back bumper they won't fix.  And the tv that came in the truck disconnected.  And all they tried to do to help was up sale me to another truck and when I said it wasn't fair they just said they can't lose money on a deal. I own a local business and I'm going to tell everyone I know and every customer I have in the humble area what they do and how they treat a customer that spends $40k. Soon as you leave buying your truck here that's the end of your support.  I bought the truck because it was loaded with a tv for my son and they we're close to my house and it only had 7900 miles. Now I have a truck with a wreck in the carfax history affecting resale value.  A dent in the back bumper.  A tv that doesn't work. All I wanted them to do was fix it and the bumper and the tv and gm certify like they said it was when I bought it. And I overheard them say that the day I bought it was the day it was traded in.  They never had a chance to certify it for the extra warranty like they said it was.,1.4

83,"May 26, 2016","I bought a certified used truck last summer and felt that I got a fair deal.  I took it back in for the ""certified"" oil changes (by appointment) and didn't think much about it.  Then I decided to trade in the truck (9 months later) and get a different used truck from their lot.  I called the sales manager I dealt with last summer and told him what I wanted to do...bring the current truck in for service and look at the used truck and discuss options with him.  He set up an appointment with me for the next day to have my truck serviced and take a look at the other vehicle.  I arrived on time to service department (4 star rating for that department) only to find the sales manager gave me the incorrect appointment time.  Service department accommodated me so I went over to meet w sales to see the other truck.  He wasn't there!  I text him and he said he was running errands for boss and he wouldn't be back for a while.  He sent someone else over to help me (poor new guy).  after waiting around for about an hour, I finally asked WHERE IS THE OTHER VEHICLE I came to see.  He said it isn't here.  It was loaned out for a loaner vehicle and won't be back until after 5 and I should come back.  Ummmm, no thank you.  To make matters worse and seal the deal as the worst car dealership experience ever, they tried to offer me HALF of what I paid for the truck less than a year ago!!!  I rolled over only $2000 onto the new note but was assured it was such a great deal that it wouldn't matter in a year.  I thought they either screwed me upon purchase or upon trying to trade it in....now I KNOW it was both.  I went to the Chevrolet store a mile away and bought not one, but TWO brand spanking new Chevrolet trucks.  I completed a survey with details but never heard a word back.
PS.  I never heard from the sales manager who missed the appointment either.",1.8

85,"March 28, 2016","I had already been to 5 other Dealerships in the Conroe, Texas area, i was very frustrated with what I would consider sales people Not listening to me and trying to give me what I did not want, from trying to sell me a truck out of my price range to offering a Bare Bones truck.

I then did what I should have done in the first place, stopped and asked the Lord to help me find a Truck.

I then went on Line and started Looking up Local GMC truck dealers in Texas and found TEXAN in Humble, I went to there WEB sight and found 4 trucks with what I wanted on the truck and in the Price range I wanted to spend, 

I called the dealership and Spoke to a man named Johnny Smith, I told him I only had a couple of Hours he said No Problem, when I arrived I was greeted with very professional folks who introduced me to Johnny, we looked at the 4 trucks I picked one of them and Said this is the deal I want to do, with the agreement of the GSM, I signed the paperwork and Off I went.",5.0

When they realized I wasn't purchasing another car they became rude.  William tried intimidating me to keeping the car stating the balance would go on credit report. Car note was late and I went back to pick up vechile it had some scratches. William says it my issue not the dealership. When I called Diana to make a complaint she also replied it was me issue not the dealership.. And refuse to acknowledge why they didn't follow procedure and turn car in to lease holder.,1.0

I wanted to move it to the back while I shopped for a set of new tires.  When I picked it up, the tire was in the same spot.  The second & third times I marked my tires before dropping off.  Again no tire rotation.  Every time I ask if they were rotated, they told me yes.  Am I the only one this happens to or am I the only one who notices it.  

I would not recommend this service department or dealership.  
I also was sold a service maintenance agreement that I found out from the Chevy dealer that GMC includes it with the purchase.  
I will never buy another vehicle from this dealership again.

91,"January 12, 2016","We bought our Enclave 5 years ago and had a decent car buying experience.  Sales rep was very attentive, responsive, and eager to find what we wanted.  Financing options were good with fair interest rate.  That's about where the good experience ends.

Service department is customer service is poor.  They have poor communication and feedback on what's going on with your car (though this varies based on who the service rep is - I have had only a couple people in the past 5 years that were good).  The wait just to have your car looked at can take a few days and they only cover rentals if it takes more than one day for the repair (including waiting on parts), BUT NOT counting the waiting time for them to look at your vehicle.  The actual service done on the car has always been good  and pretty thorough but very over priced.

Vehicle quality is poor.  It has been in at least once every year for the 5 years we have owned it for various recalls and repairs not related to recalls.  We had the engine clips break and exhaust weld crack within 50k miles; thank goodness for warranties.  But our warranty is out now and our enclave is back in yet again, now for a leaking water pump at 86k miles.  There was a recall for GM vehicles for leaking water pumps, but apparently it doesn't apply to the 2011 enclave, even though the Traverse and Acadia are listed for the same years.  Searching repair estimates had the NATIONAL average for parts at $31 to $74 and labor at $220-$278 and the Texan service department charged $340.12 for parts and $444 for labor.  Autozone sells the water pump for $90.  ",1.8

Before he even started getting out his lease specials that I had began to inquire about, he stopped to get to know me and what kinds of things I like in a vehicle. Lo and behold, I ended up getting a GREAT no hassle deal with him and my trade in. He even patiently waited for my husband to arrive to see the vehicle and seal the deal! ",5.0

96,"July 10, 2015","I have a 2014 GMC Sierra purchased at Texan GMC in Humble, TX.  I am writing you to explain what has been going on for the last six weeks and to see what can be done about a loyal GM customer being treated like a piece of garbage.  I turned my vehicle in around June 25th for an oil change as well as two mechanical issues.  One was a sound from the steering and another was from tires rubbing the wheel wells from a lift that was done during the purchase.  My truck was in in service for a week and a half.  When returned the steering sound was still there and the service advisor, John Bishop, stated he wasn‚Äôt aware that the sound was part of the initial problems stated.  It was in the original paperwork.  As far as the rubbing. They turned it over to a company called Texas Auto Trim.  There fix for the rubbing - They beat the inner wheel wells with a hammer until the rubbing stopped.  Hammer marks and paint chips on the paint in the wheel well.  When I saw the repair job that was done I immediately turned it back in to repair what they had done, also to fix the steering issue that hadn‚Äôt been addressed.  They had the truck for 3 weeks!  When returned this time, the rack and pinion was repaired but the alignment was off.  The steering wheel had to be turned to the 10 o‚Äôclock position in order to go straight.  And the remedy for the hammer beating‚Ä¶. It looked like a 3 year old daubed some touch up paint on the area.  Needless to say it went back to the dealer.  This time the customer relations guy, Lionel, said he would have a body shop fix the issue.  I asked why they continue to use Texas Auto Trim for these issues.  I was told that he thinks the manager at the dealership is getting kickbacks from them.  
                This time the body shop did a mediocre job on the hammer damage and the alignment was fixed.  However, after all that they had done, this is where it really got bad.  After being without my truck for nearly six weeks, upon return there was a flaw in the paint on the hood of the truck.  It looked like something had splattered on it and whatever it was has eaten into the clear coat of the paint, possibly further.  The dealership of course is denying any wrong doing.  This spot was MOST definitely not there upon initially turning it in.  It either happened at the dealer or at their subcontract horrible company. They are playing he said, she said.  I turned my vehicle into Texan GMC, therefore that‚Äôs who I hold responsible.  They say I need to turn in a claim to Permaplate, which I have done and waiting to hear if my claim is approved. But in my opinion, they did this damage and they need to fix it!

99,"August 30, 2014","Worse Dealership EVER!!!!

After spending two weeks working with a Salesman and Sales Manager, I thought we had a deal.  My husband and I drove from Cleveland to go sign papers and pick up our New Buick Encore, and what we walked into was HORRIBLE...

Everything from the past two weeks seemed to have gone out the window.  They paired us with a different Salesman and started the entire car buying process over.  

After I had enough, they didn't want to give me back papers I had taken to them, nor the keys to my trade.  I told them they were all liars and game players and I was leaving.

The situation was so bad that I am going to write a letter directly to GMC.  GMC deserves to know how horribly they treat people.

I purchased my 2014 Buick Encore from Wiesner in Conroe and I could NOT be happy with the deal and how EASY Wiesner made it.  No games, excellent value on my trade, Car Pro Dealer incentives and other discounts, PLUS 0% financing.  It doesn't get better that that!!!

Not until I was there 5 hrs was I approached and offered any service. The person actually asked me 'not to blast them on my survey' and offered to fill my tank and give a detail package. I accepted the gas but will never go there again. I appreciate the offer but to me customer service is honesty not trying to kiss up to someone you have lied to for 4 hours. Very disappointing and frustrating. They tried to make it up to me but I hope next time to the next person that shows up with a small child they try being honest and not repeat the debacle that I encountered.

102,"June 14, 2013","If you want a dealership that totally neglects you after the sale purchase your car from Texan GMC Buick. We have had problems from them from day 1. 1st, after my husband signed all the paperwork for the sale he was informed that there was only 1 key to the vehicle (2011 Buick Regal). The keys to that vehicle cost $700. They were not willing to give him a 2nd key until he threatened to cancel the sale. They told him he'd have the key in 2 weeks. After 4 weeks I called the salesman to check on the key and the license plates. I left 4 messages, no one called me back. I finally got him on the 5th try. He said he would look into and call me back. I waited 2 days, no call. I called again. He said ""Oh, no one got in touch with you? Let me check into that and I'll call you back. 2 days later no call. My husband called the sales manager. The sales manager (James Pierce) did return the call, said that the key was at the dealership and that we hadn't received the plates because there was an additional inspection that needed to be done because the car was from out of the state. This should have been done prior to the purchase. They wanted me to bring the car back for the inspection and for the trouble they would fill my gas tank. Also I would be able to pick up the key at that time. This dealership is 40 miles away. I drove out there on a Saturday. When I get there the service department doesn't know anything about the ""free gas"" also they have lost the key. I am furious. The service manager says he'll order another key and that he would next day air the key and the plates to me the following Wednesday. He did fill my tank. I wait until Thursday, no key no plates. I call the service manager and he says he has the key and that he was just waiting on the plates. I asked that he send the key before they lose it again. He did. We have the key now but no plates. We bought the car back in March. Today is June 14th. No one from the dealership will return my call. I got so frustrated 2 days ago I called the General Manager. I looked him up on the internet and the funny thing is he answered the phone. He first told me to call the controller. I think he could hear the frustration in my voice so he offered to call the sales manager and said he didn't know why the man hadn't returned my calls. Later that evening someone called my husband and left a message saying that the plates would be next day aired. Guess what? NO PLATES THE NEXT DAY!!! OMG!!! Run do not walk from this dealership! I love the car but wish we'd bought from David Taylor. They really understand how to treat a customer. I've used their service department twice now and will NEVER go back to TEXAN GMC BUICK.",1.4

The staff was friendly and helpful, but when it came to price they were giving me the same price I could have received without a trade that was advertised in the paper by another dealership. I did not accept the deal and left. They called me three times to come in at the end of the year sale for a good deal on my truck. I returned to the dealer with an ad from another dealer and asked them to meet the price. They showed me a demo at that price and when I tried to negotiate for the vehicle, they wanted $2000 more for the demo with the exact same equipment. It was very confusing to us. I guess they only wanted to sell if they get over on you, like taking your trade for nothing. ",2.2

After pushing a vehicle on me that I had no desire for with all the great offers and warranties he was offering I couldn't pass it up, so I got the vehicle. I was told the vehicle was a non-smokers but the following weekend I was back at the dealership to get it detailed out because all you could smell was smoke. I later called to talk with Toby to verify my warranty to get my oil changed at ANY GM dealership as I was trying it wasn't working when I called again Toby had been fired so I talked to Dane who did the financing who also told me I had the warranty and told me to give the dealership my info, still nothing. When I called again I was told Dane was no longer with the company also and come to find out after trying to get the details of what I did have I was told I had none of the things I was promised! So now I have a vehicle that I don't really care for with no warranties. Instead of taking care of any problems I have they just give me the run around!
