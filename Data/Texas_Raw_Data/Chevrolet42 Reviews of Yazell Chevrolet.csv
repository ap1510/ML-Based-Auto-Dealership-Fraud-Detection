There no ""haggling"" over the price as Kurt had already calculated what his bottom line was.  He made me a very fair deal.  I will recommend this dealership to my friends.",5.0

15,"July 17, 2013","I would like to take a moment to praise Yazell Chevrolet in general as well as Jay Yazell and Misty Martin and Ron Yazell in particular. Yesterday, 15 July, 2013, I visited Yazell Chevrolet about a problem with my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado. As usual, Ron was on top of my request and attending to my needs. During the process, I visited with Jay Yazell (I will only buy my vehicles through Yazell Chevrolet because of its top-notch employees and their high level of honesty and integrity), and on a fluke, I asked Jay to work up a sale for me (just as an exercise at that juncture).

He did so and took me out to see the one vehicle that he had on his lot which matched my interests, allowing me to drive the vehicle. Mind you, that this was done simply in the interest of camaraderie since at that point he had no idea that I was doing anything but wasting his time. When I returned from the drive, we visited, and during that visit I asked Jay some very pointed questions about whether it was time for me to trade my old 2006 in on a new silverado. Some of the answers were those that I did not want to hear, but Jay laid it on the line, giving me the necessary data that I needed to evaluate my prospective decision. He did not try to Hard-sell me, he did not misrepresent any information, and he did not try to be vague or ambiguous in his responses-- all of these I hugely appreciated.

When I finally decided to trade, he introduced me to Misty Martin and allowed her to handle the paperwork, and did she ever do so; I have never seen such coordinated and courteous efforts in many, many years. She was efficient, organized, helpful, and courteous. She went above and beyond her call of duty in assisting a customer.

All in all, this aura of professionalism and compassionate interaction is characteristic of the entire staff at Yazell Chevrolet; it does not matter whether they ""know"" you or not-- a stranger gets the same level of professionalism and courtesy as an old friend. Moreover, you can take whatever you are told by anyone at this business to the bank-- it will be absolutely true and unadulterated.

I sincerely appreciate everyone at Yazell Chevrolet, and they embody a work ethic that has otherwise long since departed the business world in general.",5.0

36,"January 06, 2012","This is the first time for me to buy from this dealership. I contacted Yazell because of salesmen Lanny Milton, who I have bought a car from previously when he worked at another dealership. The reason I gave the dealership high marks because I found them friendly and not high pressure. Since I live an hour from the dealership I was very thankful of the employees having everything in place to complete the deal when I arrived. Misty, F&amp;I person, was very nice. Even when the internet went down, she explained the problem and went to try find a solution to get it fixed. She also explained very well all the necessary paperwork that I had to be done to complete the purchase.  ",5.0
37,"December 05, 2011","I give this Dealership 5 stars due to the fact that I was never pressured to buy! I looked till I found what I wanted and then the staff was there to make the sell a pleasant experience for me. Mr. Yazell took the time to explain and demonstrate the features on my new car and Misty was an angel with the paper work! They truly treat their clients as if they had known them forever with no pressure what so ever. As far as I am concerned,they are the only dealership that I will deal with from now on! I thought all Dealerships were all alike, but Yazell Chevrolet has changed my mind. I believe Yazell has the surrounding dealerships beat hands down as far as friendliness,thoughtfulness and professionalism. Thank you Mr.Yazell and Mrs. Martin.

They are freindly when you first walk into to the door, and remember you when you come back for service work. There is no other dealer around that will work for as hard as Yazell. I have made this promise to them. As long as you are in business, you will see me back each time I am ready to buy a car. Keep up the ""GREAT JOB"". I LOVE MY NEW CHEVY AVALANCHE!",5.0
