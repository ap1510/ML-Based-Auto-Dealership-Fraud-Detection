4,"March 10, 2018","Took my 99 VW rialto to automax VW because I wanted to make sure this got done even though I would spend more money to get it fixed. instrument cluster not working, You tube videos show what is most likely wrong and how to fix. They would not fix it just replace the whole unit but they no longer make them. Heater not working. lots of foam coming out of vents. You tube videos show that the foam is from the blender doors which is a rectangular piece of metal with a lot of quarter sized holes like Swiss cheese. this is covered with a foam to make the doors solid and over time the foam comes off leaving the door with holes. several quick fixes are to cover with muffler tape etc. also videos show that over time the heater core gets clogged and needs to be flushed out unclogging it. I explained all this to the service writer. nearly 700 dollars later I find that they will not attempt to re[air the instrument cluster as I described and will only replace the whole unit which I can't because they don't make them anymore. they said my serpentine belt needed to be replaced but just had it replaced like 7 months ago and have not put more than a 100 to 150 miles on the vehicle since. They then said the coolant hose is leaking and needs to be replaced which is why I have no heat. I reminded them about what I pointed out before and they said it was the hose. Although I was not low on coolant before I took it to them and have never noticed a leak, I let them change it and it did not fix the heat problem. they suggested changing the heater core. the paperwork they gave me said the blend doors foam had come off and suggest replacing the blower unit that has the blend doors and that the heater core was partially clogged and recommended replacing the whole unit. Not once would they attempt to remedy the issues without just replacing the whole unit. They make less money if they had done what I asked and they would also be known as a repair facility that bends over backwards for the customer to get their vehicle back on the road whether it be conventionally or unconventionally and what hurts the costumers pocketbook the least. All that money spent knowing what was wrong and how to fix it and my vehicle is still not repaired. I will go to the place I have always gone from now on for all my repair needs since in the past they always did what they could to get me back on the road even if it was a temp fix with the understanding of no warranty. I gave 1 star because I could not give any less in this review. I WILL NEVER USE THIS PLACE AGAIN. TOTAL RIP OFF.",1.6
5,"March 08, 2018","Sales department overall is excellent, there was no pressure from anyone to buy the vehicle. The salesman who worked with me was very knowlegable, there was nothing he doesn't know about vehicles we're looking at. We are extremely happy with the vehicle we brought, follow up call to insure we're still happy and if we have any questions with functionality. ",5.0

7,"January 26, 2018","How can you go from great to worst. By not been faithful to their returning customers. Returning customers are the ones that have the most value to you specially for those that shop locally. If you tell a customer that you are going to call them back, you better call them back. USAA should really back out from doing business with AUTOMAX, specially when most of your customers are either active military, retire or veterans. If you read this review, please shop outside where you will get better services and a much better deal. ",1.0
8,"January 12, 2018","Thank you to Mr Michael Rodriguez (Internet Director, Automax Killeen TX) for following up with me and your efforts to resolve the issues from my previous (negative) visit. Mr Rodriguez was very patient in taking the time to listen to my concerns, he made me feel like a person not just another name on a file folder! So I returned to the dealership on Friday, Jan 12th around 1pm to give it another chance. I was greeted by salesman Dennis who was very gracious and welcoming. Dennis went the extra mile to take care of the small details related to my new deal - he had a positive spirit and made me feel comfortable which helped to calm the mini melt down I experienced at the start of our visit lol. Mr Charles Kenneaster, very professional, extremely nice man, made the final signing process a no pressure, comfortable experience!! Thank you all for taking care of me and restoring my faith in the car buying process. I am happy I returned and I am very happy with my new truck!!",5.0
9,"November 25, 2017","Sales is a job about building relationships.  We could have gone anywhere to buy a car, but our sales representative Daniel is the reason we stayed to sign the papers.  His dedication and determination to make the sales experience as trouble-free as possible will have us coming back.",5.0

11,"April 21, 2017","I purchased a brand new car, the car was supposed to come with some accessories. The managers claimed they would called me back to fix the issue, they  never did!!!!! They even hunged up on me once. The General manager still hasn't called me back. At this point I wished I would never purchased from Automax... Round Rock location is way better!!!!  I wished I would of gone there.",1.0

17,"December 10, 2016","My wife and I went to automax to look for a new car. Well in the end we left driving 2 new cars and here is the good part, the experience was fantastic. The person i talked to was Ms. Stephanie. She was very professional, very kind and made sure everything is done the way it should be done, by the book. She went above and beyond making sure everything is good. And i will say this for VW Automax of Killeen. They do not forget their customers even after they sold a car. They will keep in touch with you making sure everything is good even half a year after purchase. 

So AUTOMAX VW of Kileen, keep up the good work ! ",5.0

21,"December 10, 2016","Me and my husband bought two cars from a salesperson at Volkswagen. We both were able to leave that same day with our vehicles. I bought a 2014 Ford Fiesta with a co- signer, my mom Ilka Perreira.  She didn't rush me and she was very patient and everything went very smooth considering my co signer was not physically present.",5.0
22,"December 10, 2016","WOW!! Not a place that would have come to mind when you think of a car dealership! No wonder why they get business! I literally had the most amazing experience for buying a car, AT THIS STORE. I found out about all the amazing deals they had for any car that matched your preference, the sales personnel were Super knowledgeable about their cars, and service recommendations. And even the finance department was helpful. The things I liked the most about this store was that they educated me on the cars , the sales process was fast and streamlined, but still at my own pace; I never felt rushed or pressured, one bit. And the finance department had everything out in the open, by showed me everything and explained everything. I never once had to feel like there were shady things going on behind the curtain. This is a very ""new school"" dealership. You can tell it's completely crafted around the customer 360 degrees. The service center is very knowledgeable and friendly which is how I originally found the place. I'm in the Army so I had just moved to Killeen Texas (Fort Hood) and I needed a service center for my VW Jetta. They helped me make sure I had everything I needed without spending extra money. And then a salesman by the name of  Daniel Phinney came to educate me on the new Tiguan I wanted to get. This salesman Daniel and the finance manager Lambert are the sole reasons why I had such an exclusive experience at getting a car! My old car was appraised honorably as my trade, and my test drive on the new Tiguan was smooth and informative. I never felt like I had to haggle, I saw both my buying and leasing options which were fully in my control. I got hooked up with a great deal on a maintenance plan as well and knew about everything I was signing. No buyers remorse here. They provided food while I waited for my car to be ready for delivery. And I'm giving this review 5 stars because I know it's not just my experience! I have 2 friends who also went there and told me they had an amazing experience buying cars as well. They both bought used cars so I know the quality customer service worked both ways! I ended up getting two cars total from this place since I've been here! Im telling you, there's a lot of people in this town, a lot of dealerships too, I'm sure there's other good places out there but this is by far THE BEST. Don't settle, if you end up shopping somewhere else, then you played yourself. Hard! I will most definitely come back to get another car from these people, new or used! Automax Volkswagen is the spot. ",5.0
23,"December 10, 2016",Derek Chase worked tenaciously to get me the vehicle I wanted and continues to contact me to see about my satisfaction 10 months later. He is very knowledgeable about the vehicle and as he has learned about more some features he as shared them with me. ,4.8
24,"December 10, 2016","I was very pleased with my salesman, Derek.  He was very patient with me and enthusiastic about the product he represented which goes a long way in sales.

25,"December 10, 2016","My experience with Stephanie Terry was outstanding! She has such a beautiful spirit! She is an awesome person! I originally came in only for an oil change, and left with another vehicle. I told her what I wanted and she didn't stop until I was satisfied. This was the best experience I have ever had at a dealership. Her customer service was impeccable! Thanks for everything! I found my new love, 2016 Chrysler Town & Country!",5.0
26,"December 08, 2016","Josh (my salesperson) and George (the manager) worked with me every step of the way to get me a car that I've been interested in for the last 15 years.

27,"November 23, 2016",I saw the Jetta and wanted right outside so I took a picture of the VIN number. I came inside and ask for credit application filedl my credit application out with the sales manager Lambert Hodges and Tony did the paperwork while Derek deliver the car and showed me all the options. Special thanks to Bobby Bollinger for getting me approved. It was very painless. Mr. Garfield in service is already sold me on VW service. Thank you AutoMax for a free lunch and a great deal,5.0

30,"August 26, 2016","Daniel was extremely professional and knowledgeable showing me everything my new Passat has to offer.  This is my first time leading a vehicle and was unsure if that was the best choice for me. The entire finance team as well as the saless managers took their time and really made me feel comfortable moving forward with my purchase.  Booby, Sean, and Gi made sure that I understood and was updated throughout the entire buying process and ultimately this dealership has earned my business not only today but for my future car buying needs as well.  Thank you AutoMax!",5.0
31,"July 10, 2016","Daniel and Bobby awesome friendly, patient, kind helpful and caring....Smiles all around. Gave us a great deal and 9 hrs of their time.

32,"May 25, 2016",I bought my 2012 VW Beetle in February of that year. Automax made it easy to have the oil changed. people are friendly and they don't try to sell you on things you don't need. Tim ward is the best at what he does weather it is doing the financing or helping you decide what VW is right for you.,5.0
33,"April 01, 2016",Just purchased a vehicle with the help of Marcus Hudson. At no time during the process did I feel pressured. He was very knowledgable and willing to take time to answer all my questions and demo all the features of the vehicle.  I would confidently recommend him if you are in the market for a new or pre-owned  vehicle. The rest of the Automax staff was equally professional. I have not experienced such a consistent quality across a staff in my 40+ years of purchasing vehicles. Thank you everyone. ,5.0
34,"July 13, 2015","The guys at VW were great! I worked Eric, in sales, and he did an amazing job giving me all the info I needed. I also worked with Oliver and Lambert and those guys worked with me for four days to make sure I got the deal that was right for me. And two of those days they worked till midnight. Lambert worked with just about every bank known to man to make sure I got the best rates and Oliver made sure I got the car I wanted and hooked me up with a vehicle to drive until my new car arrived.  I highly recommend this dealership and these guys. I also want to thank James another salesman who helped me the first day I was there just browsing the lot. ",5.0
35,"July 10, 2015","Constant issues on a 2015 Passat! 
Always an excuse as to what's going on with empty promises on getting it repaired and fixed
Car had 11 miles on it when radio stopped working, check engine light comes on, and fuel gauge doesn't ever work right.
Premium Passat too 
TDI SEL PREMIUM 
Constant excuses as to why it can't be fixed...
I have to pay my payments... I don't have the option of giving constant excuses!!! ",3.0
