0,"June 20, 2020",My girlfriend and I had been looking for the perfect Jeep for us for a long time. We stopped into Sams Bastrop just to look at the options. We met the nicest salesman by the name of Kyle Butler. He made are Buying experience awesome. He went out of his way to make sure we where able to get what we wanted. Everyone there was extremely nice. I highly suggest if you were purchasing a vehicle go to Sam’s Bastrop.,5.0
1,"June 10, 2020","I worked with Chip by email for a couple of weeks before purchasing my new vehicle. He showed me that he cared and wanted to help me make the right decision. I was definitely THAT customer with my many questions, concerns, and indecisiveness, but Chip was patient with me. I drove away in a brand new Jeep Cherokee Latitude Plus which I never expected was possible! Thank you, Chip! We will be lifelong customers. ",5.0
2,"June 08, 2020","I live in Bastrop and have taken my Ram 3500 truck here several time with the service being just tolerable.  This last time I was quoted $468.00 out the door for battery issue and oil change. Walked into the service area, two guys behind the counters with one of them talking to a mechanic and neither one of them seeming to care that I was in the room.  When the conversation was over with the mechanic, the service writer put his head down and continued to write, still ignoring me.  I said that I was here to PU by Ram truck, still no response, until finally the other service writer asked my name.  Went to pay and the total came to $606.00!!!  Wow, what happened to the $468.00 ""out the door""?  Service writer came to the pay window and reviewed the paperwork and said that the difference was the oil change for about $100.00 and tax.  OK, so; what happened to the $468.00 ""out the door"" when you called to tell me how much everything was going to cost?  He didn't care to help or provide any kind of customer service at all.  Simply amazing what a terribly run service department this is.  The service writers are on the front lines, liaison's between shop and customer, these guys don't give a crap about customer service.  When the quote $468 and charge $606, there should, at the very least, be an apology.  So now they have an extra $130.00 of mine, but have lost all future business with myself, my wife and my son's cars.  We will drive to Austin before returning to this dealership.  They certainly don't understand the value of good customer service.  BTW, took my truck in on Wednesday, did hear from them at all until I called them on Saturday, at that point it was going to be Monday before they could get to it.  The battery was draining overnight, so they did a drain test on all my electrical systems only to discover that the problem was a bad battery.  Anybody in their right mind would have tested the battery first!!!  OMG!  So the $606 got me a new battery and oil change.  They deserve zero stars.",1.0

My salesman, Joshua Perez, was extremely helpful.  The whole buying experience was a joy! This is the 6th vehicle our family have bought from this dealership. The finance officer, Reid Hoyle, could not have been more helpful.  After all the paperwork was completed, Josh patiently explained and set up all the “whistles and bells” on my Uconnect system.

Salesman Chris Herod listened to what I wanted/didn't want and had the PERFECT truck waiting for me to test drive when I arrived. I ended up purchasing that truck - and I love it. Although I was emotional (I get attached to vehicles) everyone treated me with patience and respect. 

Jamie wasn't even my Salesperson and he took the time to help me with my Trailer Brakes. 

I had a tonneau bed cover installed and Justin in Service took time to show me how it worked, and even put my license plates on.  They sent me texts (optional) to keep me updated on the installation progress. I'm not even from the area, but would shop here again. ",5.0

38,"October 15, 2019",Raymond Banks greeted us and help to explain the ins and outs of each of the different models of Jeeps that were asked about. He willingly showed us used Jeeps and did not push us into buying a new one. Raymond was a low pressure salesman who is very knowledgeable. We stopped by just to look as it was the first dealer we had gone to after looking online. The deal we got satisfied us without all the dealership pressure that we have gotten other places in the past. Even the finance man was low pressure.  Our Jeep Wrangler was ready for us before we left the dealership.  We were pleased at how friendly all the salesmen were and if ever we need another vehicle we will return to this one. ,5.0

83,"January 14, 2019",Kyle had my truck up front and waiting for me to test drive when I got there. I took my old truck home that afternoon so they could detail it and fill it up with gas. Great experience. The last vehicle purchase in Austin took 4 hours at the dealership. I would recommend Sames and buy there again.,5.0
84,"December 13, 2018","I had a great buying experience with JR on Monday 12/10/18. It was low pressure, he was knowledgeable and polite. The financing process went smoothly and quickly. My only complaint (which was reflected on the survey Sames sent after I bought the Jeep) was that 1. It took way too long to get detailed and 2. I had to follow the salesperson to the store to have gas put in the car after I bought it. The wasn’t a negative reflection at all on the salesperson.
However, 2 days after the sale, I got a text from JR asking if I like the vehicle and if everything’s ok. I told him it was great and then he sent the following: 
“Also can I ask a favor? I know the vehicle took a while to get cleaned up before you left and it is reflected on the survey. If we send another one to you, do you mind giving me all tens to help hit a bonus level. I will fill up your tank for you if you want to stop by as a thank you ”

Now I know he has to earn a paycheck too, But, that text made me feel completely devalued as a customer. Like I was just a number. He didn’t even say how they would corrected the issue I had with other customers in the future!

I still recommend Sames - because they are a great dealer- but I don’t recommend JR! ",4.2

We were there for maybe 5 minutes without being swarmed by sales staff like what happens in big town dealerships. After 5 or so minutes a nice polite young man appeared up on the porch, he introduced himself and said if we had any questions or wanted to look at something in particular he would be there to assist. We said we were looking for a RAM 1500 4X4, Ronnie was one of the politest and most professional people I have ever dealt with. Completing our purchase took several days because we kept looking at different vehicles with different options even having him do a dealer search. At no time was there ever any high pressure sales pitch nor anything to make you think you needed to act quickly. Ronnie was just very professional and helpful. I met several other folks while there and everyone was very nice and laid back, this is the kind of place you want to come back to. We decided on the vehicle and made the purchase. Everything exceeded our expectations.

Matt Wasem made it affordable and Larry Chabert was quick, efficient and painless with the paperwork.
It was a very good experience for buying a new truck.

Thank you all at Sames for making this a good experience!

I know that if I ever have a question in 6 months or a year that Ron will continue to be a help even though the purchase is complete.

Matt Wasem was friendly and straight forward, didn't give any bs and gave me the most money for my trade. He also made sure I received every discount and rebate I qualified for, ending up with a lower payment and getting an upgrade from a Sport to an Altitude!

I was also interested in adding a hitch to my little renegade, and after visiting about my needs and what the towing capacities are for the Jeep Renegades, they helped me research the options and settle on a hitch install that is perfect for my needs. 

Larry Chabert in finance was amazing. He took on the banks to get the best possible interest for me along with explaining all of the different service and extended warranty contracts that are available and always kept the conversation going with a great sense of humor.

I plan on holding on to this vehicle for a bit, but I know that I would work with Ron and his team again in a split second. And since I am familiar with the service department I'm happy to continue using them to help with all of my maintenance.",5.0

JR Alvarez was my salesperson and he was accommodating and did not pressure me but rather provided me options and really went out of his way to make sure I was purchasing the right vehicle for my needs. The whole process was seamless and I was in and out of the dealership within an hour or so which was unlike the long, painful, dragged out experience I had in Austin.

I have been to other dealerships in Bastrop County and have felt like I was being held hostage, pushed into a deal that wasn't right for me, and knowing that the dealer was working me for every last cent they could get out of me.
My salesman (Clive) at Sames Dodge changed that experience for me. He was more concerned about what was right for me and getting me into the best fit. Hands down, he changed my car buying experience. I think the other Bastrop County dealerships could learn a lot from Clive. With that being said, I give Sames Dodge an A++, and I plan on taking all my future business there.

The only area that I could see that needed a little work is the detail department. Their sense of urgency needs a little work. As a digestion, maybe the dealership could offer some sort of bonus based on the volume of cars detailed efficiently. Just a suggestion. It appears that the detail department creates a bottleneck when the rest of the dealership is trying to provide stellar customer service.",4.8

168,"December 04, 2017","Ok let me start by saying I'm 39 and this was my 1st brand new car purchase. And it was the best car buying experience by far. I needed a big truck to haul my 24ft food trailer. My 06 Lexus GX470 just wasn't strong enough I had been pricing trucks and values and found out Diamler Chrysler Freightliner and Mercedes all had hands in designing and building this heavy duty truck. Me being a Freightshaker driver over the road for 13 years sealed the deal my Detroit 60 and my Cummins N10 were by far the best low maintenance trucks I've ever owned. So I wanted a Ram 3500 I went to Semes Bastrop online and designed my truck with every option available from the ground up and they went and built out their 1st ever sold 2018 Dodge Ram 3500 Southfork Longhorn Larime Mega Cab 4x4 Dually this truck is beautiful and nicer than I ever expected the no expected the base is $60K mines with options was $76K and that salesman Christian Jaurez communicated with me online and over the ph for 4 days and they had my truck built out and delivered to my front door 200mi away here in Humble,Tx. Let me sign over my Lexus signed my loan papers and even followed me to the bank to get my cashier's check. With all the year end sales and incentives they sold me that xxxx near $80k truck for $63k and with my trade and down I owe $50k after finance fees. I took a chance on getting away from the big city dealers here in Houston and surrounding. And found the no haggle no bull experience I dreamed about. Semes Bastrop Chrysler Dodge and Jeep are the real deal! Down home Texans and really know how to treat their customers. I'm still at awe how easy and fair they are this is why they are the oldest Dodge dealership in Texas and almost 5 star reviews through their history. I'm proud to own a Semes Truck go buy now before all the deals have ended. But even then I'm sure they gonna beat any city slickers by atleast $8k my local here in Humble wanted $55k for an used 2015 give them a try Chris Jaurez is the man. He and his sales manger will make the deal they are that good. I have never laid eyes on anyone but the delivery driver but that didn't change their compassion or demeanor. They were professional and worked really hard to ensure I was satisfied and got everything i wanted period. They made me feel like royalty and xxxx it's a sweet truck I'll never see another one like it how awesome is that?",5.0

I did not appreciate being talked to in a demeaning way. No one that wants good service should be talked to in that manner, Especially if they want your business. He was very close to ruining it for the salesman J.R. (Genaro) which provided outstanding five- star service. Larry's tactic however was very unprofessional. I did not appreciate when I was being pressured into having to settle to what he was telling me. In his rude tone He said ""If we couldn't give him an answer he would walk us to the door"" because we were not happy with his offer. If it wasn't for the sales manager stepping in, My husband and I would've taken our business elsewhere. I was interested in going back and buying another vehicle from the lot but unfortunately after putting up with Larry, I will not go back.

He wound up chasing a few keys to open cars and assisted us in taking 2 for a test drive.  THERE WAS NEVER ANY SENSE OF PRESSURE!!!  We were in charge.  Upon leaving we were not barraged with a bunch of sales calls or anything like that at all.   We wound up going back to look some more a couple of weeks later and found one we really liked.  Went home that night and did some research on value of our trade in and what a reasonable discount might be on the vehicle we liked..  Got prepared to go in and negotiate!!!!  Upon confirming we were interested, Sergio introduced us to Matt whom spent a minute or two looking at numbers and literally just wrote out what they could do.  It was very close to what I had pre-determined would be a ""good deal"".  So there was no negotiation.  We were done and the rest of the transaction was just as good.

236,"January 18, 2017","I spent approximately 2.5 weeks looking for a new truck at the right price. Dealt with upwards of 10 dealerships. Got most of the way through the process with four and had three of those play your typical car salesman games. One had me drive four hours to their location just to pretend a phone conversation never occured. 

Sames Bastrop was the exception, we couldn't come to an agreement at first and I'd given up but a little while later I got a call back from Sergio and he gave me the impression he was really pushing to get me as close as possible to the out the door price I needed.  They treated me right after I drove the three hours to their lot and as a result I left a proud owner of a new 2016 Ram 1500 Lonestar.  Overall it was a very refreshing experience with this dealership and I'd recommend it to family and friends.

Thanks again Sergio (Sales) and Matt (Finance or Management?) ",4.8

Now I'm a proud owner of a new Ram 1500 Lone star Crew Cab.  Great job Charles! A big thank you to you and Luis in financing. Great lob guys. ",4.8

It was the whole crew.
They took the time to talk to me and get me where I needed to be # wise and they didn't just push a car on me that I didn't want. They helped me pick a car that worked he's for ME.  We even had some laughs along the way.

245,"December 02, 2016","We did a lot of research on which heavy duty pickup truck would be right for us.  For the test driving phase of our research, we went to Sames Bastrop Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram.  After driving the Ram 2500, we knew that was the truck we wanted.  Throughout the process, we worked with Johnny Perez who was absolutely fantastic in his attentiveness, understanding of what we were looking for, and support throughout the entire buying process and after-the-sale follow-up.  Johnny is one of the two sales representatives I have worked with in my 40 years of car buying who stand out as best of the best!",5.0

247,"November 23, 2016",We were thinking about trading in our 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee but were dreading to drive to Austin. We passed by Sames Bastrop and decided to stop in and I am so glad we did . We were looking at the 2017 Grand Jeep Cherokee and immediately J.R. Alvarez came over . J.R. was very professional and had extensive knowledge of the 2017 Jeep Grand Cherokee. I The banks were closed so they let me take my Jeep home .The next day Lois Versalles found us an even better deal than we expected and the 2017 Jeep was ours. So if you want to purchase a new vehicle Go To Sames in Bastrop and ask for J.R. Alvarez .,5.0
248,"November 17, 2016",I purchased a 2016 Jeep Cherokee 75th edition. Great gas mileage and the technology and convenience package is better than the BMW I traded in.

His prompt call back, laid back approach and inventory made it an easy decision. We arrived late, they stayed. After the banking systems locked up they allowed us to take the vehicle and return the next day to complete the deal. Mark and luis both worked hard and gained new customers. We will be back in the future. This was by far the best service/ sales experience and worth the drive.",5.0

253,"October 24, 2016","I was very happy with Johnny as soon as I visited Sames. Great customer service, polite and very helpful. I got the car without any issues and easy purchase. But, it's about the little things right? Within four days of driving away in the car the tire pressure alarm went off (three of four were low) and one of the keys doesn't work. Little things, yes. But still I would have expected those things to be checked before handing the car over.

254,"October 23, 2016","I was originally going elsewhere when I decided to give SAMES a try.  My initial contact was with Kevin on the internet and phone.  Just from his demeanor and assistance, I decided to make the drive to Bastrop.  There, I met Johnny...and was sold.  He was warm, HONEST, knowing and kind.  He and I had the deal closed by the days end.  I will refer all of my family and friends from this point on (and that includes my five children; two of which are 23 and looking at trade-ins now).  I LOVE my jeep and am so thankful to Kevin, Johnny and Louis (unsure of spelling, but he was the paperwork MAN in charge). Johnny get ready for some sales soon....thanks so much.

I found one I liked, populated the trade in information and within 5 minutes I received a call from Wade Leatherwood. I told Wade my trade in was sitting on the lot and  what I was wanting from their inventory. He took it from there calling me back with a very good trade in value within minutes. When I arrived at the dealership I was greeted with friendly smiles and a big Texas welcome. When I got to the dealership I had decided to trade in another vehicle as well and when I told Wade he handled it like a pro not to mention I received a very good trade in value on it as well. My whole experience was outstanding from sales to finance to delivery it was the smoothest vehicle transaction I had ever experienced. I have been back to the dealership several times since my purchase and have found out that you are just as important to them after you sign on the dotted line as you are before you sign on the dotted line, they make you feel like family. I am a customer for life. Wherever I am when it comes time to buy again I will be making a trip to Sames Bastrop CDJR. Kudos to the Bastrop CDJR team. ",5.0
