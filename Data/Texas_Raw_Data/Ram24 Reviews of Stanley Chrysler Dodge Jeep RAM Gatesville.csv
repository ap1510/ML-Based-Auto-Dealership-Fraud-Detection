0,"May 05, 2020",  My wife and I were very pleased with Matt Maxwell (Sales Manager) and his team when we ordered our 2020 Durango. All options were thoroughly explained to us throughout the whole process. Likewise the finance manager (Ray Green) at Stanley Gatesville really impressed us by taking the time to explain in detail all the paperwork. We definitely recommend Stanley Dodge Ram Jeep in Gatesville if you're looking for a quality vehicle at a great price.,5.0
1,"April 08, 2020",Rick Johnson and Ray Green was absolutely amazing. Plus the management team went to another dealership and picked up the truck after hours just to appease me. I told them it was no worry but customer service was A plus. ,5.0

4,"February 24, 2020","I have nothing but praise to sing regarding my experience with these fine professionals.  My initial contact was made by Bubba, who called me on a Sunday because he just happened to be in the office.  He was very pleasant and honest.  I was upfront about my credit and told him what I was looking for.  He called the next morning to initiate the whole process with no pressure.  I would also like to acknowledge Larry, a General Sales Manager.  Larry went above and beyond to get me a good loan option, even with my shaky credit.  He explained all the terms in simple, no pressure language.  

I was also given the option to have the car delivered at no additional cost.  I handled all transaction through phone calls, text messages, emails and a debit card.  

I cannot recommend these folks enough!  ",5.0
5,"December 27, 2019",I went in to the dealership to purchase a new truck and was greeted by Dewayne he was very polite and found me exactly what I was looking for so I would recommend this dealership to anyone looking for new and used vehicle best buying experience ever ,5.0
6,"September 16, 2019","My vehicle broke down at the gas station on a saturday morning, Tim the service manager for the Dodge store happened to be at the same gas station, he looked at my vehicle and gave me a ride to there store, with me needing a new vehicle I was nervous, Tim got me with Matt (Big Country) and from there he made everything so simple and easy, he showed me a few vehicles and worked with me to insure they would do everything they can to get me in a new car. I fell in love with a 2017 Chrysler 300S!!! Matt was patient and worked with me explaining everything and made me feel so at home, everyone at the dealership was nice and greeted me like i was family, I am now the new owner of a beautiful Chrysler 300 and could not be happier. I highly recommend MATT and Stanley Dodge to anyone looking for a new or used vehicle! Tim in service was beyond helpful and even set up a driver to tow my broke down car back to my house! This has been by far the best experience i have ever had buying a vehicle!!! Please do not pass this store up , when i say they go above and beyond Matt even called and helped me get insurance for my new ride! If i could give 10 stars i would! Make Sure to ask for Matt!",5.0
7,"March 13, 2019","We purchased our 2006 Dodge pickup from Stanley in Sept. 2018, we were told since it was a used vehicle they always change the oil and detail all vehicles. I took the same pickup in today to get the oil changed again and found out that Stanley does not have the filter to fit the Ams Oil bypass filter that was on the vehicle when it was purchased. I asked the service department how they changed it before if they dont even have this filter in the entire town. They informed me they have never changed the oil there. So now I have to worry how long has it really been since a oil change? I guess even though they told us they changed the oil they really did not",1.4
8,"September 11, 2017","On September 12, 2017, I purchased a used Jeep Wrangler Hard Rock edition from Ashley Erwin and Sales Manager Courtney Hobgood.  Both were excellent to deal with and made buying a pleasant experience.  Whether you are three hours away like myself or 3 days away, it is worth the effort to deal with them.  The say what they mean and mean what they say.  What more can you ever ask for?  Trust me on this.  Buy your next vehicle from them.  You won't be disappointed.  ",5.0
9,"May 23, 2016","I went today to get an oil change presented my coupon they sent me in the mail stating it would only cost me 29.95 plus tax before I even walked into the building, waited two hours and was surprised with a 70 dollar bill. They said my car needed a synthetic oil and the coupon didn't cover it. They never once came to me before the service was done to tell me it would be more and to ask me if I still wanted it done. If I had known I would have said no I didn't and gone elsewhere. I used that same coupon last time I got an oil change and they honored it, I had no reason to think it wouldn't be this time. They have lost a loyal customer forever I will never buy or have my car serviced by them again and will make sure I tell everyone in Gatesville that I run into about what happened to me I would hate for them to get charged more the double what they thought they were going to pay I should have been refunded that extra amount.",1.0
10,"May 19, 2016","WE LIVE IN THE CREADR CREEK AREA ABOUT 140 MILES FROM GATESVILLE. WE FOUND THE CAR WE WERE LOOKING FOR HERE AT STANLEY AND WAS ABLE TO DO SOME OF THE PAPERWORK VIA EMAIL AND SPOKE NUMEROUS TIMES ON THE PHONE WHICH HELPED ONCE WE ARRIVED. PRESTON WAS GREAT VERY KNOWLEGEABLE WITH ALL THE FEATURES OF THE 2014 CHARGER SXT. HE SPEND THE TIME NEEDED TO MAKE SURE WE WERE CONFORTABLE WITH ALL THE FEATURES.. HE AND GREG WORKED WITH ME TO MAKE SURE THAT I WAS SATISTFIED. 
GREG WAS ABLE TO WORK IT SO WE WERE ABLE TO GET A 3YR 36K MILKE BUMPER TO BUMPER WARRANTY AND STILL STAYED IN BUDGET.
THANKS TO PRESTON AND GREG FOR A JOB WELL DONE!

11,"May 12, 2016",Preston was a great salesman. He was helpful and made buying a car simple. He was very personable and easy to deal with. I would definitely recommend him if you're in the market for a new car! ,5.0
12,"April 08, 2016",This is my 4th automobile from Stanley and they always do a good job. The people are always so kind and take care of me and my wife needs. They always have a great selection of vehicles on the lot.,5.0
13,"April 08, 2016","So I've purchased a lot of vehicles in my days. This was absolutely the most effortless purchase ever. I searched for a while and then found this truck at Stanley Dodge. Called and spoke to Preston so he could answer a few questions. He did that and what he needed to clarify, he did and called me back within minutes. Preston was never pushy at all. I'm used to people asking for everything but your social just for a inquiry about a vehicle.....so nice! The next morning decided to make an offer. Within a couple hours, deal was done and we were talking about when the truck would be delivered. They came the same day! What's so exceptional about this, is that I live in Austin! The time and hassle that saved me is so so appreciated. Preston and the other driver were in no rush. Anything I needed to know and what other conveniences I had as options he fully explained. Preston went went above and beyond! Even my one phone call with the finance manager over the extended warranty was easy and pleasant. I would recommend these guys any day!!! Thank you again Preston and Stanley Dodge! ",5.0
14,"April 08, 2016",My salesman was great. He show me a lot of trucks and made sure that I had the truck that I wanted. He was very knowledgeable about the brand. ,5.0
15,"April 01, 2016","One day, my husband and I were driving back home with our kids and two big dogs. It was after a few of driving with my feet up on the dash (because I had zero room in the floorboard) when I looked over at my husband of 9 years and said, ""honey, I think it's time we look into a bigger vehicle. And by vehicle, I mean.... a minivan."" Without a beat, he agreed. We had always been anti-minivan so this was a huge step for us. 

If we were going to buy one of these things, it had to have everything we wanted. Our list was small; leather seats and a dvd player (because, hello, we have kids) and black (because hello, we still wanted to be semi cool). We are from the Fort Hood area and we knew to get the best deal, we had to leave that bubble and we started looking all over the rest of Central Texas and within a 3 hour radius and the one thing we didn't find was a vehicle with what we required, or salespeople actually willing to help us find it. 

After a week, I stumbled across a van with our requirements. All of them. I sent in a request through the website and decided to sit back and wait. I was in no rush, at this point, because I wasn't expecting much. Within an hour I had an actual email from Preston and not some automated canned response message. We spent pretty much the rest of that day emailing back and forth with quick responses (something we didn't find anywhere else), talking about the vehicle, my strict budget with the payment and set up a test drive for that weekend. He told me that the van would be parked right in front and ready to go as soon as we got there.

We got up that cold, rainy January morning and drove to Gatesville and sure enough, there it was, ready to go. My husband took it on a quick test drive, came back, and we started the paperwork. While we waited, Preston was very informative about what all of the gadgets and buttons did and how they work. 

The finance part was easy peasy as well. It was quick and went over everything. They worked to come up with a way for us to have the vehicle in the price range we were looking for even with having an upside down trade in. I've actually been turned away from dealerships for having an upside down trade in so this was pretty much the cherry on top of the day.

Once it was all done, we left. I'd like to say that this is where the review ends, but it's not. The dealership still exceeds my expectations. When I bring it in for service, the service guys are friendly and I've never had to wait more than half an hour for my oil change. But the kicker, I lost my ID down in the console and actually sent a message to Preston freaking out, asking if he had any idea if he knew how I could get this ID. He told me to just bring the vehicle in and he would let the service guys know I was on my way. 

Seriously, if you are looking at buying a new car, go to these guys. It's no pressure, no hassle. ",5.0
16,"March 31, 2016","I have purchased my last 3 vehicles from Jamie Velasquez and I wouldn't go anywhere else!  He was on point with all of my needs and helped me find exactly what I was looking for.  My most recent purchase was by far the most pleasing dealership experience ever, no pushy salesmen and easier than I could have ever imagined!! Thanks Jamie V!!",5.0
17,"March 30, 2016","Stanley in Gatesville has an amazing staff who have been in the business and know what they are doing. They work with you, and make sure you get what you need, and work with you. I would have to say it is the best dealership in Central Texas. ",5.0
18,"March 21, 2016",Right from when we called customer service and spoke with Jamie Vel we knew we were going to be satisfied. My wife and I had been to a couple of dealerships and none of them just didn't seem truthful and sincere. Jamie carefully went with the pricing and negotiation and eventually we got a great deal. We will always refer any of our friends to Stanley Motors. Dayo and Lolade,5.0
19,"March 19, 2016","I can't say ""thank you"" enough for all that  Jamie Velasquez has done in my vehicle buying process. The Stanley dealership is like family!",5.0
20,"March 18, 2016","I have bought many cars in my lifetime and I have NEVER received this level of care from a salesmen and a dealership. They weren't pushy with the sale and even allowed me to take the car over the weekend to decide. It's always been difficult to buy a car and only get 30min with it before you commit to 7 years with it.

I live in Austin but I will ALWAYS drive to Gatesville to see Jamie!",5.0

22,"October 20, 2015","I was in a bind, and Preston was willing to work with me, searching the area for used car for me.  He found one and was very flexible in meeting me, working around my schedule, and stayed with in the budget we discussed.

AWESOME ... Thank you Preston for all you did for me!  I really like my car!",5.0
23,"April 30, 2013",I just love this dealership I have bought 2 trucks from them and Preston has helpedme both times and has gotten me a great deal and exactly what I wanted both times I would definitely go back there.,5.0
