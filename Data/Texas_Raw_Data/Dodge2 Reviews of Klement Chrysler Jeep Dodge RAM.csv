0,"November 25, 2019","Took my truck in for a recall.  While there I tried to get the PIN number for my truck from the service dept.  The man there said he would need registration, ID etc. to be able to get that for me.  When I supplied the asked for information, he then said he couldn't get it for me I would have to call Chrysler customer care.  Upon leaving the dealership, I did call Chrysler customer care.  Who told me that the parts people should give that to me and I should return there.  I told him that wasnt an option at this time.  So he was nice enough to call another dealership and get it all arranged so I go into the parts counter ask for the right person and he will give me the number.   How hard would it have been for the original dealership to perform some customer service and call Chrysler for me.  ZERO customer service provided by the Parts dept. here.  Repair guys were awesome.  Unfortunately dont know that I will ever return to this dealership.  Also conveniently the general manager was out of town.",1.8
1,"November 16, 2016",I always bring my car to Klement for service and most of the time I can find a coupon or special on their website or the Mopar site. Always pay attention and let me know what my options are.  Good job.,5.0
