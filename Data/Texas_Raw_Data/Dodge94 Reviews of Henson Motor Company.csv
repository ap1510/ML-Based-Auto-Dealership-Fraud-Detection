",5.0
57,"February 22, 2019","Service is good and employees were helpful and caring for the most part. One employee behind the parts counter however didn't even get up out of his chair to walk over to the counter to talk to me about parts... I had to yell my questions out to him while he leaned back in his chair...
I think the price for service on a vehicle purchased there is too high. $300 for an oil change and fuel filter change... come on!
You should find less expensive parts and pass the savings onto the consumer. Other brands of diesels with larger capacity are far less expensive to maintain.
