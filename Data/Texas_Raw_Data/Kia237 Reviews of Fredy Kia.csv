2,"February 16, 2020",We came here to purchase a truck that would meet our needs. We only had 1000.00 for downpayment which wasn't enough to satisfy the lender. Sue and others worked very hard to make this deal happen for us and they did it. I received several calls and texts from them during the process so that we were always informed of what was happening. I appreciate the customer service and the great truck that we were able to purchase.,4.8

6,"February 04, 2020","Horrible Service!
The service writer and manager lie in what seems like an effort to avoid warranty work when KIA’s are sold in large part based on the warranty. They also don’t meet promised schedules, don’t keep the customer promptly informed about status and they constantly try to up sell unnecessary high mark up services. 
They don’t seem to want My current or future service or sales business. ",1.0
7,"February 02, 2020",Where do u begin I do an online application and received a call the next day from Alisson Hernandez she says “ I received your loan application and you were approved just bring $500 two pay stubs and a form of id. I drove from humble to 45 south I get there and it’s the most unprofessional place I walk in and they said oh we are sorry the lady who told you that it’s $500 is a lie she works for “BDC” and that’s a catch to get you in the door we still have to get all your info and then run your credit again because we need it on paper.  I called before I drove there and asked was the vehicle there I requested which was a 2019 GMC Terrain they told me yes so I came. Once I get there this when more foolishness starts he brings me keys for a 2017 GMC Terrain at this point I’m telling my wife let’s leave but we really needed a car so we allowed them to run the credit then I was asked to put $2500 down I’m like nope I’m good they are scam artist at its finest the short Hispanic finance guy comes and sits down and ask me did I have that amount I said no y’all said $500 he then ask me what happened to my credit it used to be good at that point I felt disrespected and didn’t want to make a scene I decided to leave with my family. We went to Ron Carter purchased a car no money down and I’m happy that my business was taken elsewhere. I wish I could give a negative 5 stars ,1.0

Fredy Kia was an unexpected find in Houston, Mr. Patrick  ""a genuine old school soul"" greeted me the moment I stepped out of my old mini-van. The atmosphere inside the store was warm, friendly and productive. Felt like I stumbled into the right place at the right time. Patrick got me good deal on a brand new Kia Rio. Good vibes from Fredy Kia !",4.4

13,"September 24, 2019","Went in to look at a vehicle that we called about that morning at 9. At the dealer at 7pm and the car is still in the ""bull pin"". Finally we go over the the lot where it is at and I will be surprised if I don't get Malaria from all of the mosquitos that swarm us. Went back to the dealership and waited for about 45 minutes for them to figure out where the porter was and how to get the keys to unlock the gate. All this time there is no less than five or more employees just standing around and not doing anything. So after test driving and deciding to buy the vehicle with cash no financing involved. They add in almost $1000 of extras, etching, windshield protection for 1 year and the ""elite package"" to protect the paint. This is a 2013 model used car to begin with. So total price with TT&L and some other bogus fees that they could not break down it was $10,456. Starting price was $8500. So a increase of 2K with add on items that we stated that we did not want the best they would offer was $10,000. So the ""manager goes on and on about how they make money by financing, and we have told him two times already we will pay cash. Needless to say no deal.

Bait and Switch at its best. 
Incompetent salespeople who cannot even explain all the items that are being paid for, just generic answers.

14,"September 11, 2019",Had a great experience.  Went in to buy one car and ended up buying two!!  Eli was our salesman and he was awesome.  Dealt with Mike and Mike in financing and in general.  Would recommend them to my friends.  It was a long process but they were very patient with all of my questions.,5.0
15,"September 09, 2019",After a disappointing experience at another Kia dealer we decided to try out Fredy Kia.  I am so glad we did.  Eli was an outstanding salesman letting us test drive anything we needed and explaining the differences I finally decided on a Kia Optima for me and a Kia Sorento for my fiancé.  Did the paperwork for my car and got me squared away and then began the process for her vehicle.  They had to secure it at a different dealer so we had to go back on Labor day to pick it up.  Both Mike's in financing were awesome and had an overall great experience!  I would recommend giving them a try!,5.0

17,"August 10, 2019","I attended my appointment in time and after a few minutes they informed me that they did not have the part offering me a car wash for the inconvenience and that they would call me when they had it, so I suggest you call another dealer to see if they had the part in stock when they answer that they are not my secretary, then I had no choice but to speak with the general manager and have the part brought from another dealer as I had suggested ,the service is a real disaster",1.0
18,"August 01, 2019","Bait and switch is the name of their game. Salesman, Roberto Cazares, assured me the final drive out price would be $1,000 lower than their competitors as per their company's guarantee. All I had to do is bring proof. I provided the paperwork and they approved the guarantee. We were excited about the new vehicle. We picked out the color, specs, etc. We discovered they added unwanted extras into the final price. The price ended up being higher than their competitors. We declined citing the price guarantee. They refused to close the sale until we agreed. It was 8pm and we were exhausted. This is their tactic - promise the moon and slip in unwanted charges in hopes you will fold. They play Christian music in their lobby. Wolf in sheep's clothing. Don't fall for their dirty tricks.

There are federal and state laws against Bait and Switch. Suggest you contact regulators such as the Federal Trade Commission, Harris County Office of Attorney General, Texas Atty General, Texas Comptroller or Texas Dept of Motor Vehicles if you fall prey. Keep all of your documents, receipts, emails, etc. The regulators want to hear from you.",1.0

21,"June 13, 2019","On Wednesday, June 12, 2019, I went to Freddy Kia located at 11711 Gulf Fwy, Houston TX 77034 to buy a preowned vehicle and was completely appalled and shocked at the dismissive behavior of the sales manager. He reneged on our deal to buy a preowned vehicle because I didn't feel comfortable signing finance papers without inspecting or test driving the vehicle. Here are some additional details to my ordeal:

1. They tried to give me a price higher than the internet price
2. The vehicle wasn't currently available because the dealership owners wife was driving it and didn't feel like bringing it back to the lot
3. After 3 hours of doing all of the preliminary paper work, I finally settle on a deal and get a fair price with the condition I like the vehicle when I inspect it and test drive it. 
4. I was ready to buy, contacted my in insurance company and stared that process, but when we went to finance I told the sales manager that I didn't feel comfortable doing the paperwork to finance a vehicle I hadn't seen nor driven. The sales manager then commences to tell me the law and that the sale isn't final until I drive off the lot and that the vehicle would be available the next day. I tell him I'm still not comfortable with signing finance papers can we do it tomorrow when the vehicle is available. He sarcastically and dismissively tells me, thank you and have a nice day. 

The sales associates were nice, transparent, and very helpful, but the sales manager's behavior was unacceptable.",2.0
22,"May 23, 2019",They will con you and sale you a vehicle that is totally different when described. Gave me xxxxxxxx warranties from Gil in the finance department. No buyers guide as well. Turbo and Justin G have been promising me parts for almost a month now that I never have seen. Dont even try and reach sales manager Justin G cause all he does is not speak or return phone calls. These people are con artist and full of xxxx. Never buy a vehicle from these thieves. Worst car buying experience I have ever encountered! Trash!,1.0

24,"May 08, 2019","My daughter and I were in South Houston and drove by Freddy KIA dealership, she wanted to look at a Soul and instantly fell in love. I was doomed but we started the buying process far from home. During process I asked if I should go to a KIA dealer closer to home to get the ""free oil changes"" for a year program and the sales manager assured me this would be honored by all dealerships in Houston. My daughter called today to find out how to get a dealership near us in Tomball to honor it and they said we must have miss understood what was said and they were the only ones to honor it. 
Bottom line they lied to close a deal.... beware. ",1.8
25,"April 30, 2019","While I love my new truck, I am warning everyone about the sales practice at this place.  The whole process took about 6 hours to complete.  They lied directly to my face about my credit score and after I got home and really looked over the paperwork, I found other disturbing stuff they did.  They stole my rebates, which I was told they don't do rebates, even after I showed them the rebate on the kia website.  They fudged numbers, basically marked the MSRP up by 2500, then took the 2500 in rebates to make it look like they sold the truck at MSRP, Which they didn't.  They also removed the MSRP sticker so customers can't see the MSRP, which is illegal luckily i had printed it out already from their website to show my lawyer.  So basically, do not go here.  Funny thing is, while they made a little extra off my sale, no big deal to me personally, I have already in the last 2 days swayed 4 friends I know in the market for a new car to not go here and look at other Kia dealerships.  So they made one, good for them, but lost at least 4 possible sales and more to come.",1.6
26,"April 30, 2019","Great customer service!  Competitive pricing.  Easy to work with staff.  Friendly, informative staff.  Great financing.  If you know what you want and are ready to buy.....they get you in and out quickly.  Ask about advertised discounts; you don’t get them all.",4.4

29,"April 21, 2019","I bought 2016 Chevy Silverado from them. The first time I came in they conveniently 'couldn't find the keys' to the truck parked behind it and therefore I couldn't test drive it. They also would not remove a VIN number etching (which HPD will do for free and they were going to charge $400 for) and several other items like it from the price. That added on around $2000 for nothing of value. 

We came back because it still looked like a really good deal. The second time they told us they would take that out and didn't, but we bought it anyway. It took six hours to get through the process, most of that time spent with us twiddling our thumbs waiting on someone. On the way home a check engine light for low oil came on. My wife and I decided that we would take it back to have it serviced that weekend since we were going out of town in a different vehicle that afternoon. 

When we came back, the truck had a flat tire and another that was dangerously low. I couldn't air that tire up because the stem on the tire was stripped, leading me to believe that they had been airing it up every few days to make it look right. The air conditioning also quit working properly on the way. So we drove in on a flat tire and were ushered into a corner office of the dealership where no one could see us and waited for the guy who sold us the truck for an hour before I got fed up and talked to a manager. He said they would fix it. 

Fast forward four days when I called and was told that the truck would be ready Saturday at noon. It was going to be late because they conveniently forgot the part about the low oil and air conditioning problem. We went back in that Monday to pick the truck up and had to wait an hour to be told that the engine was bad and that they couldn't in good conscience sell us the truck. They only caught this after it had sat on their lot for a month, they had worked on it for a week, and my wife and I waited to pick it up for an hour on the day we were told. We left the dealership. I called them thirty minutes later to tell them I needed to get my stuff out of the truck and get a check for the car we traded in. I had forgotten because I was so frustrated with the whole mess. They said they would take care of it. 

I called two days later and told them I was coming to get both. When I got there I had to wait yet again for an hour only to be told that they would not give me a check for the car or take the car to my apartment nor did they have my stuff from the truck even though they had known for two days. I had driven myself there so I was going to have to come back for a sixth time to get the car (each trip was an hour and a half in total). I have absolutely no faith that the car and my things will be there when I come back but I have no other options.

In conclusion, I bought a $20,000 truck from them only to have lots of problems (that I'm pretty sure they knew about) appear within a few days. We won't get the truck because the engine is bad and 'they didn't know'. They have been exceedingly unhelpful the entire time and have disrespected our time by making us wait at least an hour any time we needed to speak with them. In my opinion, that dealership is full of thieving liars and you'd be much better off buying somewhere else.

30,"April 07, 2019","I wanted a 2013 Scion IQ advertised on FredyKia.com at $6.998. On the telephone, two different salesmen told me that I would have to pay $9,998 IF I PAID CASH as they made money by car finance thru Capital ONE.  A third salesman said he would sell me the car at $6,998 if I drove to Houston and bought it in person. I agreed and told him he just sold me the car at $6,998 plus TTL. He agreed.
But after driving 200+ miles to Houston, the price was NOW $7,651 + 388 for ""special etching"" (I did not order), take it or leave it, as some mystery lady wanted it badly. Thet didn't even wash it or fix the hazy headlights (a $40 retail repair) or repair the bull eye hole in the windshield (a $25 retail) repair in the windshield.

31,"March 19, 2019","I bought a use Ford Explorer from Kia. Nile was the salesperson who helped me. He was great he did everything he could to help me also informed me on alot. The bad side was Nile told me they were going to gas my car up and it would be detailed. Well when i got to the car it wasn't detailed, my gas was on half tank, my radio didnt work, and the wind shield wiper fluid was low. I didnt say anything because i had to leave to go to work. I took it back two days later I spoke with Nile about my radio and the detail for the car. He told me they wouldn't detail it because it was already detailed. I have to take it to Ford so they can fix it because it was under warranty. Bottom line make sure everything that needs to be fixed with the car done before leaving. Lessoned learned!!

49,"April 19, 2018","I went to this dealership because I followed my salesman there.  He had just gotten a new job.  After going there several times to test drive several cars and service an older Kia I purchased some years back from another dealer I decided I wanted to do business with them.  My sales guy being employed there was a plus.  Now I know it was not a plus.  He is no longer employed there and I am an unsatisfied customer.  

1.  I had a great credit score when I went to purchase my vehicle.  For some reason they shopped around unnecessarily to so many banks that it dropped my score by some 60 points.  Pissed me off.  Then the pay off of my vehicle took 3 months. Yes!! No clear reason why that was since I had been approved for the loan a while back.  That caused an additional drop in my already dinged credit. 

2.  I was promised a cargo cover, as a benefit of my purchase.  Ask me if I ever received it? Ha!! Not a chance, they lied! They all lied. The sales manager, his manager and right on down to the receptionist who refused to give me the GM's email address or connect me.  She lied and said he had no email nor did she know his cell number. 

I certainly won't be doing any additional business with them.  Lying is so unnecessary, unprofessional and uncalled for.

65,"July 20, 2017","Multiple salesmen said free oil changes come with purchasing a new car. They specifically said that you do not have to have every service done at the dealership, that the oil changes will still be free. We went in for one of our oil changes and the service department said we had to get a $200 transmission service (fluid change) in order to get the free oil change. They had booklets and documents that clearly state EVERY service has to be done at the dealership in order to qualify for the free oil changes. The service department was just as frustrated as we were because they deal with this constantly.

When we went to talk to the sales department, they denied everything. The sales managers used the excuse of having a high turnover rate for salesmen and that they were uninformed. The sales managers contradicted everything the service department said, but had nothing to back it up, no documents or paperwork. They also used the excuse that at the end of 2016 they redid all of their service packages, but everything they said still contradicted the service department. I was trying to come up with a solution where everyone would be happy, but the sales managers were extremely rude, unhelpful, made excuses, and blamed everyone else.

 I truly do feel sorry for the service department. They are very organized and helpful, but can not provide the type of free services that the salesmen are using to help sell vehicles. I would not recommend anybody using this dealer.",1.0

96,"December 11, 2016","Bought a 2016 Kia Soul in April 2016. Car had 15 miles when we drove off the lot. Fredy Kia offers free oil changes & $20 tire rotations with purchase of a new vehicle, so of course, I'm taking advantage of the Perks of my new car! After the first oil change (approx. 6,000 miles) on my way home from the dealership, I notice my car smoking and sounding like a Diesel engine. Long story short, the service man never put back in the oil plug, so my car had been draining oil the entire drive back home. Luckily warranty covered, & I got a ""brand new engine"". Second oil change goes smoothly, only to notice a knocking noise in the engine about a week later. Take it back to the dealership. Supposedly it was a pulley on my air compressor making the noise, and it was replaced. Now, 3 days later, the A/C is not blowing cold (never had an issue with it until now). I wouldn't recommend buying a vehicle from Fredy Kia, unless you would like to spend the lifetime of the warranty, in & out of the shop! ",1.6

He was awesome and I was able to walk out with my 2015 kia rio the same day. It has been almost two years since I had my car and I was thinking about a trade in. I got a call from Edgar about a buy back and made an appointment. The day before the appointment Edgar asked me to reschedule because of the weather which I did. So the day of the reschedule Edgar confirmed my appt with me. He also confirmed again the day of. Thirty minutes before my appt, in route to kia, someone else called me and asked if I could reschedule AGAIN because they were short staffed. (Which I told them no because I'm coming all the way from across town). Then they tell me well we are going to have get someone else to work with you meaning I couldn't have the guy that set my appt because they were short staffed. That's not my issue. Already bad customer service and I didn't even make it to Kia yet. When I arrived to kia Jonathan approached my car,  not professional at all, I didn't even know he was a car salesman. We sat in his office all he had me do was sign a paper, tried to MAKE my dad sign as a co-signer, and did not give enough information. He told me he did not have a answer for me because the banks was closed but it was ""looking good for me"". He stated he would call me the next morning with the next step. I waited all morning for a call back. I had to call back three times to speak with him just for him to say sorry it was not approved.

173,"April 02, 2015","My car began making a rattle and clunking sound on my home and then died. I was able to make it home and had Kia Roadside assistance tow my car to the nearest Kia Dealership (Gay in Dickinson)

Gay informed me the reason I was having the problem is because the last oil change (done my Freddy's service department) they put 2 quarts too much oil and the oil was being sucked into the engine!
They thought the car was fixed and it wasn't now not only is it making the horrible sound it also has the oil and engine light on.

I called Freddy Kia and spoke to Jay, considering Gay told me they were the source of my problem I was having with my car in the first place. Jay said he would look at my car if I brought it to him but could do nothing further for me on another vehicle. This baffles me considering from what Gay Pontiac has told me the reason I’m having the car issues is because a service man at Freddy Kia put too much oil in my car when they did the oil change last. I explained that to Jay and it made no difference.

Jay with the service department is not trying to do anything to help correct the mistake that was made in the service department. His words to me were “since I cannot supplicate the problem I cannot help you” and “I cannot agree or dis-agree the mistake was made here since I cannot duplicate it”. After I explained to him that my oil light and engine light are on and the sound that was coming from my car. He told me if I wanted to drop it off I could. Why would I drive my car with the engine and oil light on from Texas City to Houston? That’s at least an hour drive. Furthermore why would a service department recommend I do that with the car being in that condition? 1 that is not safe and 2 that is doing more harm and stress to the engine.

I am completely appalled by the treatment and lack of consideration for their customers.

215,"December 10, 2012","Friendly and fair people, that was my first car in US, and I think negotiation toke a little more time than I expect, but I found out that is just the way it is here. Other wise everything went well, the sales guy answer all my questions and was very solicit.
The only issue I found was the difference between what they have on their website and in stock at the store, I guess is just to get us there, but as I said, on I get there everything went well.",3.8

217,"December 01, 2012","Being a woman, it is important to find a good Dealership.. The people at Fredy Kia are outstanding, made me feel at ease.  Looking forward to doing business with Fredy Kia again. GREAT JOB, and I love my new car.",5.0
218,"November 25, 2012","I went to Fredy Kia kind of scarred because of all the bad reviews I had saw. but after speaking with Miko over the phone he mad me really feel comfortable about at least stopping in to see what they could do for me. My credit isn't the best but Miko assured me that they are #1 for a reason, they have a great special finance team to help get people with not so good credit into a car. They didn't pressure me to and let me think about my decision while they stepped away. I see why this dealership is #1. Dealing with Miko was the best car purchase experience I have ever had and I hope he stays in the business a while because I will be purchasing all of my future cars from him. New or Used. This guy really knows how to take care of his customers and make them feel good about purchasing a vehicle. Thank you so much Miko! Anyone that is in the market for a vehicle, if you stop in to Fredy Kia, MIKO BERNSTINE is the guy you need to ask for if you want a pleasant experience. 

His manager, Mike Reymar wasn't the best, but having Miko there made him easier to bare. Mike Reymar just didn't seem to have much of a personality and was kind of stern. 

Overall though, this was the best, car purchase experience I've ever had. Thanks again MIKO! I will be sending all my friends and family your way! ",5.0
219,"November 23, 2012","i've purchase my very first KIA (a Sorento). My salesperson Miko Bernstine was absolutely wonderful.  He really wanted me to be comfortable and satisfied with my purchase.  Honesty is very important to me.  I will definitely send referrals to Fredy and I think I'm KIA for life now!  His managers were also very, very helpful in making me a fair deal that I can feel good about!  WTG KIA!!!",4.8
220,"November 21, 2012","I purchased my first new car from Fredy Kia and my experience was a great experience.  Mr. Miko Bernstine, was a gracious, polite, professional employee.  He answered all my questions and didn't lie.  He informed me what I would need before I came to the office and I am so grateful that he did.  I saved my time and his time. He and I went for a test drive and I was excited about this being my first purchase.  Unfortantely, I wasn't able to get my first choice of SUV's but he made sure I was I drove off in something!  And, that say's alot about an employee that take there job seriously.  Thank you again, Miko you rock!!!",4.8
221,"November 21, 2012","I highly recommend Miko Bernstine at Fredy KIA and Fredy KIA dealership. Miko kept in contact with me when my car took a few extra days to get here. He treated me with respect and was very helpful! Buying a car can be stressful but, Miko answered every question I asked and did not rush me. He handled himself with integrity which made me feel more comfortable. I stuck to what I wanted and he and his manager found a car. I love my car! I am very happy with my purchase. I highly recommend Miko Bernstine at Fredy KIA! 

One thing that I did not like at Fredy KIA was the group of sales people gathered at the front of the dealership. I felt uncomfortable when I drove in because the group reminded me of vultures gathered together. It's unsettling.",4.8

223,"October 31, 2012",After many days of car shopping we finally ended up at Fredy Kia and were amazed at how well we were taken car of and how far they were willing to meet and beat other dealers prices. If you are in the market for a used car go to Fredy Kia they have a very large inventory and great prices.,5.0

226,"October 30, 2012",Using the Internet is the way to go. I sent an email request to Fredy Kia to get luck and ge a response from a man named Mike Hamlin. He was right on point with his quote. They did not have the Kia Soul on the lot but they got one from somewhere else at no extra charge. Great experience! ,5.0

229,"October 02, 2012","Todd, absolutely the worst person sales manager in the business.  I was shopping for a new car and Todd wanted a comittment before I ever saw a car.  I wanted to see the car and take time to make a decision.  This was my first dealer and I wanted to shop and compare but I was mostly interested in a Kia.  He asked me could we make a deal that night, when I said no he became angry &quot; I am not going to waste my time, I am only doing my job and I have ten kids to feed.&quot;  This is not the place to buy a car from.  Todd should be fired, or demoted to parking lot cleaner.",1.0
230,"July 30, 2012",This was the absolute worst experiance i have had at a dealership. You have a very fast talking sales manager named Al somthing that really thinks he is smooth but he is just pathetic. He completely talked me out of ever buying a KIA from any dealership. ,1.0
231,"June 13, 2012","After recovering from a horrible experience from another Kia dealer in Baytown, I thought I would give the buying experience another try and stop by Fredy Kia.  That decision lead to the purchase of my new Optima EX and one day later I couldn't be happier.
I initially met with EJ who showed me the inventory on the lot and located the model I was looking for; except for the Tech Package which I was not interested in.  He turned me over to his Sales Manager Al who worked with me to get an outstanding price on the car all while clearly explaining the facets of the pricing and demonstrating an outstanding attitude with honest discussion.  I closed out my visit with Cedric from finance who had me through the signature process in a timely manner.
I had all but given up on the opportunity to purchase a new car for my wife, but Fredy Kia turned that thought around and refreshed my belief that car dealerships can demonstrate customer service.",5.0
232,"May 07, 2012","This place is a train wreck!!!!, The sales team has no idea what they are selling or how to treat someone who is ready to buy a car. I am kinda happy they treated me like crap because I went down the road and purchased a new sonata the same day. 

STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE. 

P.S it's dirty and stinks inside and run down ",1.0
233,"April 12, 2012","I had already done my homework and decided on a Kia Soul, after driving a friends.I got a great deal on my old trade-in, even though it was barely running. Salesman Mike Houston was fair and honest with me and easy to deal with...he really knows a lot about the cars he sells. I haven't tried the parts or service department yet, so I may submit another review in the future. But for now I am super happy with my Kia Soul!",5.0

236,"November 01, 2011","Ryan's under table tactic of lying about trade in values simply a waste of one's time and energy. He may claimed he has the best price in town but only by manipulating the numbers to make his numbers look good.

New 2012 optima he tried to sell has prior damages that he refused to acknowledge about it.

Dealership is dusty and infested with mosquitoes.
