This gentleman, who did such an impeccable demonstration of the vehicle earned my personal respect and trust was build due to such a great service and truthful answers. We paid cash for the vehicle and they were very upfront about the price and rebates of this 2015 Outlander. 

We are very happy with our vehicle and service provided by this young man. To all of you who are considering purchasing a vehicle (Whether new or pre-owned) Contact this gentleman first before you go anywhere else and be given the ""Run around"", he will prioritize your individual interests and will be a professional through out the whole process. 

Thanks again Mr. Pacheco.

1,"December 06, 2014",After looking for days to get my hubby his birthday gift traveling from dealership to dealership I decided to stop by and give it one last try.  My hubby and I were welcome with a huge smile by the best salesman here in Houston. We were straight to the point and now we are walking out of the door with my hubby truck  (bday gift).  Marcos really works for his customers and willing to go above and beyond.  So with that being said everyone STOP BY and give him a CHANCE OR look him up on the internet. Thanks once again Marcos from Jordans.,5.0
2,"December 04, 2014","When I was 18 I was young and dumb and got my car repoed and my credit ruined... But I had gotten recommended to a sales person by the name of Marcos pacheco from my cousin. I visited the dealership and spoke to Marcos, as soon as I go there Marcos with excellent with customer service and friendly, he helped me out, made sure I saw and got what I wanted, did some wonders and got me approved! I named this tittle 2nd chance because of him, he gave me that 2ns chance to redeem myself and raise my credit score.... Thank you Marcos pacheco and gillman Mitsubishi.",5.0
3,"May 14, 2014",Let me start by saying over all great. I would defiantly recommend this dealership to others. They find several cars in your budget then they find the perfect car for you and your family. So if your look for a good car this is the place to go!!!,5.0
4,"April 30, 2014",Of course like a Salesman they are very friendly. However I came in to refinance and left feeling like I had been scammed.I was pressured to basically pay the same rate even though my interest has dropped seven percent.when it was all said and done I was re sold my own car for about $3000 higher than its current valueand about $1000 less then what I initially bought it for.yes my interest to went down but they dumped my principal so now when I want to get another car and possibly trade this one in I'm going to be upside down and owe more than the car is worth. I'm sure all dealerships do this to the naive but I personally fill this way about this dealership since I was dealing with them. their job is to make you feel like you're getting a deal when in all actuality there is no such thing.,2.8
5,"April 13, 2014",The service was great and the employees were very helpful.  I walked out with the best deal for me and was glad that I went and left with the car that I wanted. ,5.0
6,"April 07, 2014",I am a first time buyer who recently purchased a vehicle from Gillman Mitsubishi North.  I was pleasantly surprised by how helpful the staff was and by their ability to negotiate a good price for a vehicle. I would highly recommend these guys.,5.0

8,"February 11, 2014","I purchase a new 2013 Mitsubishi Lancer on December 21, 2013. My overall experience was great! MD Hassan was so patient and kind to me during my overwhelming process. I thought that I would leave without making a purchase, but Hassan worked with me and my mother until he found the perfect vehicle for me! I greatly appreciate the time and effort that he made to make my overall experience a positive one. I would recommend Gillman to my family and friends, and I would definitely ask them to request Hassan as their salesman!",5.0
9,"January 24, 2014","My salesman was new and knew nothing about the Mitsubishi brand.  The managers were not helpful.  The 'sale tag' was grammatically incorrect, saying 3600 off AFTER all rebates and incentives - only a manager told me ""too bad"", the 1500 rebate was included in that 3600.  Theft-proof etching is supposed to be an option.  I was told that it was $1495 and every vehicle on the lot had it, it was not optional.  I ended up purchasing from a different dealership.",1.8
10,"January 16, 2014","I've visited multiple dealerships in the area recently looking for a top notch used car for my daughter.  Most of the dealerships are the same type of sales person who will say and do anything to get you in one of their cars, even if it's what you wanted.  This place is different!

I didn't feel any pressure to chose a vehicle I was not completely satisfied with including price.  Also, there wasn't the typical waiting for hours to complete the financing.  Process was quick and smooth.

I highly recommend this dealership to any looking for a true no haggle process.",4.8
11,"January 01, 2014","I called Cesar about a used hyundai I saw online.he told me yes it was available and asked if I wanted to see it that day.I told him I live over 2 hours away and would be there the following day for sure. the next day we drove over two hours to houston to purchase this car. I never spoke with Cesar once I got there, but the guy there told me he sold the car the day before!!! It would have been nice to get a call letting me know before I spent New Year's Day and 60 dollars in gas driving 2 hours to buy a car that was sold!! Then the guy just walked away to deal with other customers and told us we could look around. we left!!! Horrible customer service!! We had money to buy the car and were serious buyers who were totally ignored!! Will never use them!!!",1.2

13,"November 30, 2013","I came to the dealership knowing exactly what I wanted and the service was speedy and friendly. I had called in 2-3 weeks before to check out the pricing to compare to other dealerships, and Gillman Mitsubishi North had the best deal. As I was trying to decide which dealership to choose, MD called me to tell me when the price dropped for the vehicle. There were so many specs for the 2013 Hyundai Veloster Turbo and the price was a steal. The sales people here are super friendly and don't try to huddle towards you like vultures. :]",4.8
14,"November 26, 2013","I found Gillman Mitsubishi North while looking for a vehicle on line.  When I went to the dealership to test drive the vehicle that I was originally looking for had been sold, but MD Zahid Hassan was able to find one similar and was very knowledgeable about the car.  The staff worked very hard to get the car financed and I am very pleased with the car. ",4.2
15,"November 24, 2013",Service Advisor Donnie H. took care of me!  I am a single Mom and I needed my car serviced and returned to me ASAP!  The job was supposed to take 2 days but Donnie made sure I got it back the same day.  Thankful I went to Gillman Mitsubishi!  Thankful for Donnie!,5.0
16,"November 14, 2013","It was a great vehicle I purchased, But I would of given it a better rating if the price was negoatiated. I brought my 2013 Chevy Malibu at tag price, it didnt go down none. MD Hasan worked with me and had lots of patience with me. I know I can be difficult and intimidating at times as well. I loved the package the dealership offers (warranty, roadside, lost keys, dents and hits) even though its an additonal cost, I think it was well worth it.
Also the finance director was supurb and was GREAT, we had a pleasent experience with him and he made us feel as if we were friends and had known each other for years! 

Thanks Again!

17,"November 14, 2013",MD Hassan was very informative and helpful in finding me the right car. He answered all of my questions and got the deal done as quickly as possible. He was also very respectful and friendly. Thank you Hassan!,5.0
18,"October 29, 2013","Donnie is always AWESOME!!! Over the years I have purchase  9 vehicles from Mitsubishi the last 2 are 2013's and I must say Donnie is the reason. He is always nice, friendly and knowledgeable about your concerns he will go out of his way to help you. Donnie went out of his way for my son's car to check on a part, he found out it was still under warranty which saved him money (being a new dad) . GOOD customer service is very hard to find these days if at all. Thank you Donnie!! for all you do, as long as Mitsubishi has you they will have me as a customer........;*).

19,"October 18, 2013","I have to say, I would recommend this dealership based solely off of the friendliness of the MD and Eric.  Both were very helpful, weren't too pushy and understood I had a budget to work with.  They listened to what I wanted  and what I liked and what I wanted and directed me right to the cars they thought I would like.  I test drove a few cars and after I found the one I loved the most, they sat down and worked with me so I could drive out with the car I wanted.  I would recommend everyone go by Gilliam Mitsubishi in Spring, the people are great and so are the prices!",5.0

22,"October 06, 2013",Hassan was very friendly and talkative. He made sure he got to know the names of everyone in my family. He helped out the second he saw my family and I arrive. He explained everything he could about the car. We test drove the car and he was explaining how the car worked throughout the whole process. We went very late and he was not lazy at all about getting us to buy a car. My family and I believe he was the best car seller we have met. We did end up buying the car. And we wish Hassan very good luck in his career. ,5.0
23,"October 04, 2013","My wife needed a smaller car (Honda Pilot was her previous car). I already purchased Mitsubishi car in this dealership before and I was very pleased with everything, literally, everything and that is why I decided to stop by again, one Thursday evening, just to talk and get some quotes.
I knew sales guy by name from before, but he wasn't there that day, so I said ""thank you"" to young M. D. Hassan sales guy who was ""on duty"", very polite, and I told him that i will stop by tomorrow.
He appreciated my loyalty to dealership and sales guy I knew from before and just suggested to give me information on what currently were the best deals and to give me some quotes, so when I come back tomorrow, I will have clearer picture on ""everything"". I agreed and...90 minutes later, I had everything finished!!! And I enjoyed those 90 minutes. No down-payment, very low interest rate (I have good credit score). Car was ready for me to drive it home (Outlander Sport 2013).
Since I already came with car that i owned (Gallant 2012), they offered to drive it to my home tomorrow so my wife doesn't need to take a cab. That was really not necessary but it felt really good as professional gesture.
This is our 4th Mitsubishi over last 15 years (Mirage, Lancer, Gallant, Outlander Sport) and the second one in this dealership. 
When I stop buy in this dealership (information, service maintenance or any other reason), i really feel that I am at least a little more than regular customer. I know that they treat everyone with utmost respect, that is why everyone feels a little special.
Thank to everyone in this dealership.

27,"September 18, 2013",I vist service center late to see if could schedule a oil change. Donald Hicks was very helpful on assistancing me with the schedule. Instead of schedule my oil change he went ahead a did the oil change while i was there. He also explain to me it was time for my car mileage service. He explain to me several options for services. He offer me coupon for my service which made me make up my mind to go ahead and do the mileage services. He was very nice and took the time out to go in details on why the service is required. ,4.6
28,"August 13, 2013","I have bought my last two Acura's from Gillman and had no problem however this time I liked a used car on their Mitsubishi lot. It took them 3 days to finally let me know I need to put more money down so I agreed. I took the next day off work and called them in the morning to finalize the deal, I never received a call back for hours so with half the day gone I went up there and was informed they sold the car I was interested in over night. I had wrecked my previous car and had limited days to be in another car. I was very upset and just started crying I wasted 4 total days at this dealership. I was told my car was sold and kinda got an ""Oh well, these things happen"". I've been loyal to Gillman for years however in a time sensitive situation I received the worst treatment. I will not go back. I took my business to John Eagle Acura off Park Ten which was closer to my house anyways and received a great deal on another used car I liked and was promised they wouldn't sell it right out from under me over night, but I ended up leaving in my new car that same day! Thanks, John Eagle you have a new loyal customer for life!!",2.4
29,"May 10, 2013","Hassan was awesome! Helpful, friendly, he made our experience really great. This was the third dealership we had visited. Having had bad experiences at the previous two we were prepared for rude, pushy salesmen. Hassan was patient, polite, and worked with us to get us a good deal on a Ford Expedition. We will definitely recommend Gillman to our friends when they are looking for a new vehicle. Thanks for the great experience.

31,"February 05, 2013","I had a great experience buying from them. Marcos was very helpful and made it very easy to get in touch with them. Since i dont live locally, I had to go about everything via phone or email, but it all went by flawlessly. All in all Gillman Mitsubishi of North Houston was very easy to work with and i definitely recommend them.",4.8
32,"December 16, 2012","I have been to many different dealerships in my 40+ years but Gillman Mitsubishi was a whole different experience in it's own. With a sales staff whose goal is not only to get you into a vehicle, but to get you into the vehicle you want as easily and quyickly as possible. We sat down with our sales rep, explained to him what we were looking for and what I needed my payments to be. He then took us out onto the lot showed us what vehicles fit my needs as I had explained and made it happen. They acually listened and also genuinely cared about me and my family. I now understand what it means to be a real Gillman Guy.
  My special thanks to Harvey and Andre both for making us feel so at ease throughout the whole entire process.
  Guarentee I will be a Gillman customer for a very long, long time.

Throughout the process, we did not have to endure long waiting times. While my spouse drives a hard deal, we ended up very pleased with the trade in value of our old car as well as the price on the new car.  Financing was also a very smooth, quick and pleasant experience.",5.0

41,"April 23, 2012","My car was hit by another driver on 3/29.  Since then I have been looking for a new (used) car.

I have been to so many dealerships, and talked to so many salesmen (and managers). I spent between 45 minutes to an hour at each dealership trying to buy the right car. I even spent an hour at one dealership, only to have the general manager allow another salesman to buy the car instead of me - after I had called to confirm the car was still available and went directly to the lot.

I still haven't received the claim check from the at fault driver's insurance company, but was preapproved for a Capital One auto loan, so I was ready to buy as soon as possible.

My roommate bought a car from Gillman Mitsubishi last year and kept asking me why I didn't just go to that lot. I decided to look at their Gillman's website and found my perfect car.  I have always wanted a Dodge Charger, but knew it was out of my price range.  Due to my credit score, I knew getting financed would be difficult so I tried to stay withing the requirements of the Capital One loan. Unfortunatley, the Charger was over my loan amount.

I decided to call Gillman's pre-owned car department anyway and was blessed to have Rick Guzman answer my call.  I explained my situation and let him now which car I wanted.  He quickly and confidently assured me we could work something out.  Since the dealership is on the other side of Houston, I didn't want to waste my time.  I did not.

I set up an appointment to see Rick first thing the following morning and it was anything but a waste of time.  He not only was able to work with my credit situation, he was also able to get me financed through one of their lenders so I could purchase the car I truly wanted (and at a comparable interest rate).  They even held onto the car for me while I arranged for a friend to help me drive one of the cars home for me. I returned within 30 minutes and I swear the already clean car looked as if they had gone over it again, even though it was already sold. 

As long as I live in Houston - or even near Houston - Gillman Mitsubishi and Rick will always be my dealership and salesman.  Actually, he was less of a salesman and more like a friend looking out for another friend.  And, just for the record, Rick was not the only person I dealt with at Gillman. Every person I came across, even just in passing, was helpful and friendly.  Employees I didn't even know would ask if I was the person buying the black Dodge Charger and how lucky I was to get it. It felt like there was a sense of pride they hold, knowing the integrity and quality of where they choose to work.

I will strongly recommend Gillman Mitsubishi to anyone looking for a car, new or used. And if you come across Rick, tell him Brian says thanks again for the amazing experience he provided me while I made my first major purchase of my life.  That's one milestone that I can keep close to my heart and remember fondly, until I can one day tell my grandchildren about my first car (that wasn't a cash car).",5.0

58,"February 02, 2012","The salesman was great.. Worked with me on the telephone and quoted a great price after clearing it with his Manager.  Called back and confirmed the quoted price as total drive out, Cash, that day only....

After driving over 100 miles in a rain storm to get to the dealership, met Rick Guzman and checked out the vehicle.  Both were great.  Went to Ricks office and he wrote the deal up and took my cash.  He then left the office to go to his Manager, who had already agreed to the deal before I drove down there.

After 10 or 15 minutes Rick returned and said his Manager said they couldn't do the deal as agreed upon and needed another 420.00 or so.  I told him that was not acceptable as the price had already been agreed upon and the dealership already had my cash.  I then suggested that he go get his Manager and have him come and speak to me.

The Manager arrived, did not introduce himself, and proceeded to be very rude and demanding additional money for the car.  I explained that the deal had been agreed to, with his approval, before I ever came to the dealership and that I would not pay more.  To either honor the deal or refund my money.

The Manager left the office and after about 15 minutes, returned and in a very rude manner said he would honor the deal, but that he would be going back and listening to the telephone conversation intimating that I was lieing which is a big insult.  I told him that if it was indeed possible then he really should listen to the telephone call.

My opinion is that the Manager felt that he could squeeze me for additional money and tried his best not to honor the price already agreed upon and to use very poor business tactics to pressure me.

This Manager owes me an apology...

As I said Rick is terrific and his Manager was rude and unbusiness like..

61,"January 16, 2012","First I would like to recommend that anyone reading this deal with Hassan Esfaoui! This is the second vehicle I have purchased from this dealership and I can't say enough about the customer service and overall atmosphere of this dealership. Not only was everyone my wife and I dealt with extremely friendly, but they were also very professional. From requesting a contact online to signing the paperwork to buy the vehicle everything was pleasant. We set an appointment to test drive a vehicle and they had it ready and waiting when we arrived about 10 minutes early for our appointment. Our sales agent Hassan was very friendly, respectful, professional and knowledgeable. He also accommodated us when I asked to see another vehicle I had found online. The second vehicle (that I had not told him about before the appointment) had a flat tire but Hassan was still able to show it to us and we made an appointment to test drive it the next day. He was again on time and very prepared! I went to see the vehicle on my lunch break, and due to Hassan's punctuality and being prepared, I test drove the car and got back to work with plenty of time. I also liked that during the entire buying process Hassan was always available and actually walked us through everything. It made my wife and I feel like we were his only and most important customers even though I am sure he had other customers on the lot that he was tending to. I feel we got a great value for the vehicle we purchased and will absolutely be return customers for our next vehicle. I would not hesitate to recommend this dealership and Hassan to all of my friends and family! ",5.0

I hope everyone will still be the same after sale services.

65,"January 08, 2012","My son spoke with Charles on the telephone before we visited Gillman and he was so friendly and answered all our questions without being pushy that we went to the dealership within the hour.  

When we arrived, we were greeteed by Andrew and he was wonderful.  Never pushy, answered our questions and listened to what I wanted.  Bill and John also we very professional, courteous, friendly, listened to what I wanted and handled our transaction with the least amount of delay.  

Like most people, I hate the dealership process but I must commend the Gillman team - they made the process as pain free as possible. I must admit that I would have never gone to Gillman but for my son's interest in the Lancer he had seen on their website and a finance offer from Capital One Bank but because of the excellent service - I would go back the next time I'm in the market for a car.  Thanks Gillman!!",4.6
66,"January 02, 2012","I connected to the dealership by seeing the particular vehicle we were interested in ""on-line"".  Having a specific vehicle and price up front took out some of the unpleasant ""haggling"" that one may associate with buying a car.  So my experience was very positive:  the salesperson communicated with me on-line and with a phone call in advance; when I arrived, he immediately gave us the key to the car and let us test drive it.  It was a very busy day so he wasn't able to join us on the test drive which was fine since we were very familiar with the make/model of the car we were interested in.  It also gave my daughter and I time to discuss our thoughts/questions which Mohammad answered when we returned. I appreciated that there was no attempt to sell us up to something bigger/better since we were buying a used car which was not a Mitsubishi. We were pleasantly surprised that the mileage reported on-line was about 6,200 more than the actual mileage on car.  I'd say it's important to get your information on the web site as accurate as possible although in this case the deal was even better than we were expecting so we were thrilled.  The price was great...I'm sure helped by end-of-year mark-downs.  I appreciated that we had the opportunity to purchase an extended warranty (which we may or may not do.

They contacted me, and within a short time offered up a financing, trade-in, and warranty deal that I couldn't refuse. The salesperson was extremely personable and did not make me feel pressured at any time. Now I'm in a brand-new vehicle that is larger than my previous compact SUV, gets better gas mileage, and has a smaller payment along with a 100,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty! It is saving me money in every way and giving me peace of mind as a single mother that I don't have to worry about breaking down or having expensive repairs. Even the design of the sales building feels open, transparent, and friendly.

I was told i have to purchase that on my own... which the key is $25.00....just small things like that make me wonder about the decision i made, or either salesman cater more to female buyers.... but I just Thank you guys for assistance with the vehicle... 

I hope right person read this and contact me about a key, if you cant do a oil change...

I would recommend him to anyone looking to buy a Mitsubishi in Houston and would purchase from him again. 

The only reason why I rated their customer service as OK is because there have been a couple of times when I had some issues with their Service Department. Ran into an issue where they didn't know what were the exact components of the Evolution X MR suspension and tried to tell me that I had made aftermarket changes. Another time I made a call asking information about SST Transmission Fluid and they didn't know what it was.

After that, we were given the opportunity to drive the one that we purchased but were told that the price was going to be comparable with the 1st one which was not.  Another thing we didn't like is that we were pressured to get the extended warranty and the gap cover.  Overall, Ryan Nowroozi was an excellent salesman, very professional and caring.

221,"October 09, 2010","My fiance and I went to Gillman to look for a particular car we saw online.  Upon arrival on the lot we were greeted by Jason Jaksha (Salesman).  Jason was quick with a handshake and ready to help us find our vehicle.  Just minutes into our time with Jason we learned that the Ford Focus we had come to see and test drive was being driven off the lot by its new owners.  We were disapointed but decided to look on the lot for what else might be available.  Jason was very friendly and offered keys to any vehicle we would like to look at and/or test drive.  After sending him back and forth several times for keys we decided to test drive a Suzuki Vitara as it was the one vehicle that caught our eye visually.  Jason was quick to hand over the keys and help us with a test drive.
When we returned we continued to look for other vehicles but our thoughts were with the Suzuki we had test drove.  We decided it best to see what sort of deal could be made for that particular vehicle as it was in our price range.  Jason took us inside, found us chairs (as his had been commandeered by other salesmen), and began looking up info about the Suzuki.
Jason admitted to us early on that he was new to the used car sales department...a point which was a relief to us as we were new to the used car sales as well.
Long story short...Jason was awesome!  He admitted he was new and was not pushy or  condecending as some used car salesman are.  His attitude was awesome!  We were wishy washy on the car for some time and asked for time to discuss several times.  Jason simply said...""OK"".  The reason we bought from Gillman started with Jason Jaksha!  He was polite and not pushy!  He seemed honest and up front about the vehicles he was showeing as well as dealing in used car sales.

230,"September 29, 2010","I am a previous Eclipse owner.  I did not check the quality of work tab because, my vehicle was new.  I do think that there should be more selections to consumers, because when a buyer walks in, they do not want to be feel like they have no choice but to select from what is available.  My vehicle of choice was not on the lot, but was driven to me which put miles on it that I would have liked to put on the vehicle since I was paying for it. I guess there is  new vehicle alloted mileage to still be able to classify a vehicle as new.  There was no discount to me for that, even though I asked for two years of oil changes, I was only promissed one year and they would get back to me on the two years.  Haven't gotten confirmation on that yet.  It is not always necessary to try and make the consumer feel obligated or guilty becuase some of us already know what we want, but I guess that is apart of the game of selling vehicles. Some of the origninal numbers changed from the agreement I made with the salesman to the financial department when I signed. I myself new what type of vehicle that I wanted when I came to the store.  I was greeted promptly, maybe because no other customers where there at the time.  My salesman was respectful of my wants, because I explained that I did not need to buy a vehicle, I was there because I wanted to buy one and I didn't want to be there to long.  I did not get all of the functions of my car explained like how to open the trunk from the inside and all of the dipsticks to check my cars fluids, bluetooth connections, etc.  I do not think that all my cars fluids were checked, maybe because there was a rush to get it to me to close.

I would like to mention one issue that upset me. I went to the parts dep. a couple months ago for a new shifter knob and the man working quoted me an exurbanite price (like $150.00). I tried to explain that this could not be accurate and he refused to even ask his manager. I don't know his name and I have not seen him before or after.

He took out the time to assist me in finding my dream vehicle. I am so happy with the experience of purchasing a vehicle at Gillman with Mr. McCray's guidance that I am unable to express my gratitude in words. Thank you Gillman Auto and thank you Mr. McCray for making my first car purchase a memorable experience.",5.0
262,"August 17, 2010","Mr. Jim was very helpful in my car buying experience.  He greeted me with a smile as soon as I walked in the door, and was very helpful in choosing the right vehicle for me.  Once I chose the 2010 Galant he explained everything about the car, set up my navigation system, and bluetooth, and made sure he answered any questions that I had.  Once all the paperwork was done he even helped me transfer my things out of my old car to my new car eventhough it was after 9pm when I finished signing the paperwork.

I have been to the dealership a few times since I bought the car a few weeks ago and he has continued to help me in every way possible to make sure I am satisfied.  Mr. Jim has made this car buying experience very pleasant, and because of my experince I will refer my friends and family to him.  Thanks Mr. Jim!!!!  ",5.0
263,"August 17, 2010","Because of past unpleasant experience with dealership(s), went into dealership with a negative attitude, BUT THEN, was fortunate to have Ruben assist me with selection of vehicle.  Receved excellent service from Ruben.  Ruben was very sincere, honest, patient and a pleasure to work with.  Ruben made me feel like a friend not some stranger purchasing a vehicle.  I left with a smile.  Ruben, 'THANK YOU MY FRIEND""",5.0
264,"August 15, 2010","Great service from a great dealership. Friendly people, always made to feel welcomed. Details and facts were at hand and only on one possibly two occasions did they have to go and check up on information required or requested. Justin did a great job selling the 2 vehicles that we ended up buying, all in all I think everyone is happy.",4.8

The dealership was very helpful in not keeping us waiting. ",4.8
267,"August 14, 2010","My experience buying a car at this dealership was great. The salesman (Ruben) was very attentive and answered all my questions. He wasn't there to make me buy any car- he was there to help me pick ""my"" car. He was very knowledgeable- seemed to me he had done his research on every car there! I walked in that dealership being skeptical and nervous and I walked out of there with a huge smile- to me that counts. If asked if I would recommend the dealership / salesman to anyone, I'd say ""already done""!",5.0

269,"August 11, 2010",     Justin did a great job. Would recommend him to all friends looking for a car. He was a great help in all aspects of the purchase. Really love the car I recieved. Really liked the warranty that came with the vehicle. Would buy another when the time comes.,5.0
270,"August 01, 2010","I had called various dealerships for internet quotes prior to walking into Gillman for a test drive.  When asked what quote I had received, I gave them a ballpark range and was shocked that they had bettered my expectations without having to negotiate.  I had to negotiate to get the color and added options of my wanting, but the experience was friendly.  They will use common sales tactics (e.g. trying to sell you a different color, offering a today only price, etc.) but if you are prepared and knowledgeable, the team is very helpful and accommodating.",5.0
271,"July 30, 2010",Justin was very helpful and responsive to our needs.  This is my first Mitsubishi vehicle and it is great.  The dealership had a very nice atmosphere.  The dealer had to bring in my new Outlander from another city and this was done very expeditiously.,5.0
272,"July 29, 2010","I was very pleased with how much Justin pushed to help us get into our new car!  I will definitely recommend him to anyone I hear about looking for a new vehicle!  My husband even had to be back to our side of town in time for work and they made sure we were out the door on time!  They also worked with us on the phone days before so the process in the dealership would be as short as possible!  I am again very, very pleased!",5.0
273,"July 20, 2010","Verbally greed to price on phone, but when we arrived, we were told there would be ""additional costs"".  When a price was finally agreed upon on paper which we signed in person and then went to financing, it was a different price again... said they ""computed tax wrong"".  Don't care about ""formula""...had agreed to final financing price--rework numbers to come up with final price agreed upon.  Waited over 3 hours for a deal that should have taken less than 1 because our understanding was that it was taken care of on the phone before we arrived (we drove in 4 hours from Louisiana).  When we walked in, a credit check had not been completed (we gave all information i.e. social security numbers, etc on the phone), nor had any paper been processed.  Justin did not have any paper ready... had to go find blank copies.  There were no other customers in the store, so there was no excuse.  Additionally, Justin called 3 times that day and knew EXACTLY when we were planning to arrive to pick up the vehicle.  

The odometer confirmation form said the vehicle had 20 miles on it, which we signed, but in reality, it had over 220 miles.  No one could explain the discrepancy.  We were told that a ""new"" odometer reading would be mailed to us in Louisiana and told to go to another Mitsubishi dealer to confirm that the vehicle was ""new.""  ",3.0
274,"July 11, 2010","A friend of mine referred me to Hassan since I was in the market for a a cash car .
My salesperson didn`t put pressure on me ,but took enough time to find me the car,the price and the deal I was looking for.
Over all I have had the best car buying experience so far.
Thank you Hassan and Gillman Mitsubishi.

275,"July 08, 2010","Went to Glllman looking for a low cost cash car for my daughter's birthday (7/2/10) they showed me a 2002 Lancer that looked very nice I purchased the car and took it home on the way home it started vibrating at stop lights, after being parked over night the car developed a sour smell inside, then we discovered the key would not open the trunk.

My wife returned to Gillman on Saturday (7/3/10) to complain about the car thinking it would only be to make us feel better. To our surprise when she spoke to Hassan he called Matt who looked the car over had it checked out then told her the service department would be open 730 am Monday to please bring the car in then, we did .

THEY REPLACED 2 MOTOR MOUNTS REDETAILED THE ENTIRE CAR AND REKEYED THE TRUNK even thou the car was purchased as is these repairs cost us nothing.

Everyone there went above and beyond to make sure that we were happy with our purchase.

With service like that on a cheap cash used car I will not shop any other dealer.
