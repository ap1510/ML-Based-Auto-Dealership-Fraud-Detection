4,"August 24, 2019","Recently purchased new Highlander and worked with multiple sales associates and financing dept associates, both of which were knowledgeable, attentive, respectful, and helpful.  I felt no pressure during the process, and was pleased with the ease of the entire purchasing process.  Craig Rex was especially helpful, as well as Nathan Gomez, in the sales dept.  They took their time with me and really worked to help me find a vehicle that met my expectations and family needs. David Nimmo was equally as helpful and went above and beyond in helping me with financing.  Overall a great experience. Would definitely recommend to friends/family and would buy here again without hesitation!",5.0

7,"May 30, 2019","Craig at Toyota was very helpful in my car buying process, as a young adult it is sometimes tricky to make the best decisions on big purchases, but he made sure I was informed throughout the whole process to the best of his knowledge.

8,"May 28, 2019","Craig're spent SO much time with me, helping me clarify the sort of car that best suited my needs,. Though I was pretty sure II'd be buying either a Japanese or Korean vehicle,  I was pretty sure it would be a used one. But Craig  presented ideas that allowed me to purchase the best choice for me at a price within my budget 

And, yes, I WAS able to purchase a new RAV4! Thanks, Craig and the rest of the Huntsville Toyota  Family!",5.0
9,"May 08, 2019","Sam and Craig were so amazing to work with. Sam helped my daughter buy her first car last year, and made it a great experience. She bas continued to receive great customer service at this location. So when it was time to buy myself a new car, I went looking at Toyota of Huntsville. They recognized my needs and made it happen. I felt like more than a sales number at this dealership. Craig even came in on his day off when I picked up my new car.  I love my new Toyota and appreciate the team at Huntsville Toyota.

13,"April 13, 2019",Keith was more faithful to follow up with me than Gullo in Conroe.    Was a calm easy going man whom I enjoyed doing business with.   Go see him!,5.0
14,"April 05, 2019","Great job, nice people, satisfied with the service I recieved. I do think it would help if toyota provided software for their sales department that would reduce the need to rewrite by hand information such as contact info or vin. The processes was fairly fast, so no compliants about the sales department, just recomendation to help make the processes easier.",5.0
15,"March 31, 2019","I'd been a bit hesitant about going to Toyota given the experiences we've had with the Houston dealerships in the past.  However, the Corolla was clearly the best of all the cars we looked at.  We started working with another Toyota dealership while looking at cars and were ready to start the buying process.

We accidentally found out about Atkinson Toyota (of Huntsville) when, looking for price information, I submitted my contact information into TrueCar and didn't realize the app was going to send my information immediately to all dealers within range.  Atkinson's reply stood out right away as being a very good offer on the specific car we were looking for.  Once Keith Yeoman, our sales rep, got involved, things only got better.  

I contacted all the dealerships by text or email, but replied by phone to only two - Atkinson, and the dealership we originally started with.  While the other dealerships acted, well, like the stereotype, Atkinson was different.  In less than 24 hours we made the one hour trip from Houston specifically to talk with Keith.  Not only was he willing to make a deal over the phone and email, he stuck to the deal he made and even helped us get the best option for financing.  He's a great guy to work with, completely knowledgeable about the cars, the sales process and what the customer needs.  He's genuinely interested in making sure his customers are fully satisfied.  

That kind of outstanding commitment didn't stop with Keith.  The general manager and sales manager came by to see how we were doing.  It was like being on The Andy Griffith show - just good, salt of the earth people.  Be sure to ask them about their backgrounds - there are definitely some interesting folks there!  We were surprised about a monthly drawing held for all customers buying a vehicle.  We were pleased to find that the drawing was not for us, but for a $500 donation to a charity of our choice.  This speaks volumes about how good these people are.  The meeting with Chris for financing and finishing the deal paperwork was just as pleasant.  His presentation on warranties was anything but hard sell - we ended up with a package that perfectly fit our needs and within our finances.  

The entire process at the dealership took only about two hours.  The entire team worked flawlessly to make the whole experience fast and easy.  It was almost too bad that it all worked out that quickly - they're such nice people you could stay all day and enjoy every bit of it.  While we probably won't be in the market for another vehicle for a few more years, we'll never forget about Atkinson and will definitely be heading back there.",5.0

17,"March 23, 2019","We just traded in our 2009 Toyota Avalon for a new 2019 Toyota RAV-4 Limited at Huntsville toyota. What a wonderful car buying exerience! We were greeted at the front door by Keith Yeomans, a sales representative who guided us through the orientation to the RAV-4 and got us connected to all of the necessary cell phone apps that bring many of the features on the vehicle to life. Keith was very friendly and knowledgeable about the vehicle. Jeremy Cochran, the sales manager, also worked with us to give us a great deal on our purchase. Clint Reno in the finance department did a great job of facilitating the paperwork for our loan. General manager, Nate Lucas, visited with us while we were there. He, with his team, have created a welcoming and friendly atmosphere throughout the dealership. All in all it was a terrific car buying experience!",5.0

He was extremely knowledgeable about the vehicle we were buying (2018 4Runner TRD) and took the time to explain it all to us.

57,"November 27, 2018","Soft sale, comfortable atmosphere, excellent customer service definitely made this purchase  a pleasant experience.  Dealing with Sam Riner was a breeze & his enthusiasm is contagious.  His professionalism plus his down-home manner won our hearts.  This dealership allowed me to put $500 down on a truck- for a 6 day hold -fully refundable-  until we were able to make the 75 mile trip.  
We paid cash, so do not have a review on financing.  
 I am an owner/operator of a retail sales store for over 25 years.  Trust me, I know customer service and these guys are on top of it. ",5.0

59,"November 24, 2018","This is my second automobile purchased with this dealership,I'm 68 years young and have purchased many vehicles from many dealerships . I have never received the Care and Concern that I receive from the employees of Atkinson Toyota of Madisonville. Rachel answers the phone with a smile every time and truly makes you feel special from the start, Keith Yeomans the person I dealt with the most took the time and made the effort to ask questions and get to know me some as to better help with the right automobile for my family. Because I live over an hour and a half  away I spent a lot of time on the phone asking questions and comparing different options online, a couple of times Keith was either with someone or out for the moment, so I was then speaking to Billy Bean who knew about my conversations with Keith and he  also asked questions about my wants and needs ,showing true desire in making sure that was getting the best deal . Keith and Billy working with my credit score and the upside down trade in were able to let me drive out with a 2018 Toyota Tacoma with a low down payment and very reasonable payments, but before I drove away Carey Johnson reviewed the make ready process that had been already performed and explained the maintenance schedule and how the new Toyota's differ from some older models so that I wouldn't be worried and even set up a appointment for my 5000 mile 1st maintenance visit.
 I will recommend Keith and Billy as well as Atkinson Dealership of Madisonville to anyone and everyone because of the Outstanding Customer Service that I have received there, saying that they exceeded my expectations is a under statement    ",5.0

61,"November 17, 2018",I have purchased two vehicles here from Keith. They work with you and do not act stuck up like other dealerships. It was an easy process with them and nothing was hidden. When people ask where to get a car or truck I send them here. ,4.6
62,"November 17, 2018","This was my first time buying from Toyota and from my experience there I’m asking myself what took me so long.
From the first contact with Bill Jones and his willingness to work with me to find what I needed and staying late to see it through to David Nimmo making sure I understood my options and to Lindey Jenkins explaining the contracts my experience was the best car buying experience I’ve had.

Our sales person was Nathen I called a week ahead and told him what we were looking for he found it ASAP and had it ready for us to look at and test drive when we showed up. We got there at 2:30 and we were driving away in our new Toyota Highlander at 4:15 so not only did they get it all done but in a very timely matter and that included all the small talk and story telling. So when it is time to buy again we will be back. Thank you again for getting it done. ,5.0

119,"January 29, 2015","My husband and I saw a commercial for the Repo Joe Sale. I decided that we could go just to take a look at what they had to offer since my new job would require me to travel. We didn't have any intentions on buying that day since we hadn't saved any down payment. When we arrived David Nimmo met us at the door with a smile. He carefully listened to our needs and assessed his inventory accordingly. While I was on the lot David asked us if we were considering a newer or older model. We told him we were more concerned with the payments, David brought our attention to a 2014 Hyundai Tucson that had maybe 5500 miles on it. He asked if he could get the car in our price range would he have our business. Surprisingly, my husband said yes. David made great strides to cater to my needs and explain his reasoning for suggesting a newer car. Initially I was against the new car because I assumed that an SUV with that low mileage would be out of our price range. David reasoned: Although an older and cheaper car would have significantly low payments...eventually you would run into problems. After a little more reasoning and negotiating my husband gave him our price range. They found us an $8 difference. We didn't have to pay anything down and we got a decent rate. Afterwards the accountant made sure he thoroughly explained the terms of our finance and service contract and answered all 100 of our questions. This was our second time purchasing a car but the experience was totally different. It was unrushed, honest, and detailed. I really appreciate Atkinson Toyota taking car of us.",5.0
