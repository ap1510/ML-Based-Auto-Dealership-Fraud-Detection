0,"June 03, 2020","Closed a deal on a truck in April
Started the paperwork on Wednesday, already approved by Ford credit, salesperson pulled the keys, and I planned to pick it up on Friday. 
Another salemen SOLD the truck the next day! Took the file and keys directly from my salemen's desk, and SOLD the vehicle! Didn't even check with my salemen!!!  UNREAL!!
WOW!   HOW DISHONEST AFTER WE ALREADY HAD THE DEAL, COMPLETED COVERTS credit approval, and then just to screw me a day later!!  
Talked to the GM Chris Uranga and Will Taylor- their fix, pay an additional $5K on a different truck!  wow!  thanks guys-- Then they wouldn't even take my call to make it right!  
DISHONEST!!  AVOID!!!",1.0
1,"February 21, 2020","I am very sad to be writing this, because I am usually a very satisfied customer. If truth would have it, I give just about everyone the benefit of the doubt.
First, I had a horrible miscommunication with my service advisor. He thought I was dropping my car off just so it could stay in their lot. What? Haha, so it sat for a week. I called, but wasn't in the system. My car hadn't been touched. I learned this all over the phone.
So I went up to Covert to figure out what was going on.
I asked around, several times if someone could point me in the right direction. But alas, I'm a 25 year old female, and apparently also an idiot. I have never been a victim of sexism until my experience at Covert. The manager and two service advisors out of their 20 male employees were the only ones that treated me with respect. The rest of them wanted absolutely nothing to do with me. I feel sorry for the manager having to put on a face for his awful employees.

I spent 20 minutes frantically walking around trying to find my service advisor, which then lead to us arguing about communication. Yes, arguing, like children.
He called to apologize later that day, because I walked away in tears of course. Because of our argument, they put my car on first priority. It was finished in two days.

They left a GIANT plastic piece from my dashboard on the floor, instead of putting it back into place. I feel ridiculous complaining about that piece because I usually don't really care if it's an easy fix, but come on.

I will not be taking my car back to Covert Ford. I am so sorry you have the employees you do. Thank you to the ladies at the desk that were nice while I paid for my service (like normal human beings). The two starts are for fixing my vehicle. It's much better, thank you to the servicemen.

2,"January 06, 2020",So I had a major issue with my car and had to take it in to be serviced. Thankfully it was covered by warranty but they took 3 months to actually get it back to me. In that time I barely had any communication from them and to top it off I had to get a rental car because they had no loaners available. I was told because it was warranty work they would pay for my rental car. While they have still said they will pay for this it has been about a month and a half and yet they have still not paid for the rental which racked up quite a hefty sum. Now I am constantly having to call and get an update and still have not received any news regarding the payment. The only good thing is that the employees that I have worked with have been incredibly nice to me but overall unhelpful. I believe it is due to poor management and not the employees themselves. Overall the next time I need service I am definitely going elsewhere no matter what as well as never buying a car from this dealership again.,1.6
3,"September 28, 2019",Had to take truck in four times for the same problem. Running boards will not come down. 2017 F250. Expensive truck. Waste of time having to constantly come back to dealer,1.8
4,"September 28, 2019",They lied to me about a deal so I wouldn’t go with another dealership.   The sales manager never even bothered to call me back.   I was trying to buy a 90k car.   They should stick to selling the cheaper cars and leave the luxury cars to the professionals.   Sales person was Kristen and the Manager was James.  ,1.0
5,"July 31, 2019","
I saw an online ad for an older Toyota Corolla and made an appointment to test drive it. When I got there, I found that the car was completely mislabeled online, for ex: the ad said the car was a manual transmission, it was an automatic, the ad said it had a CD player, that player was broken. The car wasn't even cleaned when I got there and the salesman told me that it hadn't been through their service department yet. They just got the car and threw it straight online trying to flip it.

HERE's where things get BAD. The car drove alright and me and the salesman, Bob Nadeau, agreed on a price on the condition that I could have it inspected before money went through. He agreed and told me that their service department would look at it and if there were major problems they didn't want to fix, the deal would be off. The next day, Bob called me and said everything was fine, I called Auto PI and they went out and found serious problems with the transmission, $1,500 repair at best, several thousands at worst. When I called Bob Nadeau back, he wouldn't even acknowledge the problem and said ""we sell old cars as is,"" never mind the fact that his service department was supposed to catch such a big problem and call of the deal once they found it. So when I expressed frustration and told him that I felt his dealership had wasted my time and the money I paid to have the car inspected he hung up on me. Such childish behavior.

So at best, this place is incompetent, and at worst they're flat out thieves. STAY AWAY!",1.0

7,"July 25, 2019","We have purchased many F150s in the past and since this new service manager started, we have had nothing but trouble. Having to wait 2 months for parts is just one thing, but having to wait 2 days to have a keylock reset, is ridiculous. He told her that first come first serve is his policy without consideration of the size of service. So an engine overhaul comes before a keylock reset or oil change? How unprofessional and unorganized do you have to be to not see that this is the wrong approach. On top of that our employee was ridiculed by the service manager, when she complained. We have over 40 trucks and will look for another service center. Get your act straight. ",1.0
8,"July 20, 2019","Brought my car in for a simple oil change , I showed up at 7am when they open. Was told it would be an hour and half. 3 hours later I am still waiting. This dealership does not care about their customers at all there service department is a joke. Terrible service when I told them how insane it is to wait 3 hours for a oil change they just shrugged me off. I will never bring my car or truck here again. I will make the drive to Georgetown to go to a dealer up there. You have lost a loyal customer for the last 5 years . All of staff who work here on Saturday do not seem to care at all no one apologized just said oh well. At end it took them almost 4 hours for the oil change. Took them another 20 mins after it was done to pull the car around.",1.0
9,"June 22, 2019","Covert is open on Saturdays - first come, first serve.   We were first in line.  The service advisor said 1 1/2 hours.  That seemed excessive to me, but okay.  It has now been 2 1/2 hours and we are still waiting.!!   This is the worst service ever.  You would think that if a vehicle is promised in 1 1/2 hours and it is going to be longer than that, someone would come and let us know, but not a word!   I went to look for the service advisor and couldn’t find her!    Horrible service!   Never again!",1.4
10,"May 29, 2019",Be careful.  They will have you sign up for extra coverage like GAP insurance and then they do not actually file for the GAP insurance with Ford Credit like your signed contract shows.  We'll be taking them to court to settle a large GAP insurance claim soon.,1.0
11,"March 11, 2019","We have a Lexus and the dealer has great service and clean showrooms and service area. After reading Lincoln's pitch on the web about picking up one's car for service we thought we would give Lincoln a try. At Covert, there was no parking, dirty showroom and dirty cars. Went to the showroom and waited 1-1/2 hours but nobody wanted to wait on us no matter what we tried. So, we left.",1.4
12,"January 11, 2019","My sales person was Tim Elliott and what I really enjoyed about him, was that he sold me the car I wanted and there wasn’t any haggling or negotiating a better deal. He knew what was in the car and that’s how we approached the deal. They are in business to make a profit, but they are also in the helping business as well. He went to work for me and I could see that and appreciated it when we did our final paperwork! 
Tim stay in the business and keep that country twang in your voice. 
Thank you,

13,"January 02, 2019",We bought the vehicle right before we moved and the salesman talked us into a service plan . He stated No reason not to do it you can take it to any ford dealership and you get money back on your 1st maintenance. So not true! I call to schedule 1st maintenance at a ford dealership only to be told that you have to take it to the place where you bought the car! I can’t believe how shady people can be . We called the dealership to complain but no one returned our call :(,1.5
14,"December 14, 2018","I just bought a new f 150 from Covert. I did internet research for the truck I wanted and found one at Covert for the best price in town - I was somewhat hesitant doing the internet search because of past experiences being swarmed by sales people. To my pleasant surprise I was not besieged by Covert sales staff as a result of my search and vehicle inquiry. I just had one call from Chris in internet sales who put me in touch with Brooke Lambert. Brooke set up a convenient appointment for me to come in and test drive the truck. When I got to the dealership Brooke took me to the truck immediately and gave me the keys for a test drive. Over the following two hours she got me a good deal finalized without trying to sell me add-ons. Brooke was very professional, no pressure, no games, easy to reach via text and phone. She even offered tips and advice on financing. The Sales Manager Will also stopped by to introduce himself and check on how the deal was moving. I drove home a beautiful new F150 Lariat that fit exactly with what I was looking for and at the price I was shopping for. If you are looking for a new Ford I would recommend calling Brooke Lambert at Covert Ford on Research Blvd.",4.6
15,"January 08, 2018",I am new to Austin and was nervous about going to a larger dealership to purchase my vehicle. The vehicle I wanted was purchased by someone else.  Brian worked with me until I was able to get the vehicle that best suited my needs.  I will continue to do business there.  Everyone at Covert was very helpful.  ,5.0

17,"November 29, 2017","The finance side of this dealership so to be completely disorganized, rude and just unable to do their jobs. I worked with Thorne Smith and did not get my plates for 7 months because even though everything was fine with Ford Credit he kept saying I owed money. I still do not know exactly where this went but ended up paying just so I could get my plates. He bullied me into paying the money and then insulted me telling me that ""he didn't expect me to know where the money is going,"" and ""it is complicated to understand."" I feel ripped off and insulted. This place also had me sign the papers 2 different times because they forgot to have me sign certain at the dealership and then ""Forgot"" to get my first payment from me before I left the dealership. This place is absolutely a mess and I CANNOT recommend it to anyone. DO NOT go here! ",1.0

19,"September 03, 2017","I rarely feel the need to comment on a car dealership's customer service or lack thereof, but found this dealership's service so poor that I thought others should be warned.

I had been corresponding with the associate and scheduled an appointment to view a Ford Explorer the next morning with the intent to purchase. It was a two hour drive -- and not very easy to find gas with a current shortage after the hurricane. I messaged her a couple of times prior to leaving that morning and she let us know she was there. What she failed to tell us was that the vehicle was not and had been part of a trade dealership. Once there, they offered ""comparable"" vehicles then offered to ship it back from Killeen (with the extra mileage) and the price now was $1900 more on their website than it had been been the previous day (I had the screenshot to prove it). I have a quote now to have the same level vehicle shipped to my door from Oklahoma and still save almost $1000 over their best price after all the hassle. Incompetent and deceptive staff and a waste of our day and gas to get to their store. I advise everyone who values honesty and integrity to take their business elsewhere. ",1.0
20,"June 16, 2017","Covert Austin advertised a new car online-- on their own website-- for a decent price, but then quoted me a price several thousand dollars higher as ""bottom line"" in person.  When I pointed to the ad, Joel the inept salesman yelled at me, ""I already told you... this is our bottom line"".  

So I left.  Nobody wants to be treated like that when considering making a major financial/life decision.

My wife talked me into returning a few minutes later to speak with the sales manager, who revealed that the vehicle wasn't even available... because the dealership ""Owner"" decided he wanted it for himself.

Totally unpleasant experience.  I'll never return myself, and I suggest you find some place more professional to buy your vehicle from too.

Sarcasm: Sorry for trying to buy a car ""as advertised"" Covert.  

Nobody there struck as me being a quality/ethical individual.  I had wanted a NEW vehicle but will probably now buy used and from a private party now just so no slimy car dealers benefit from my purchase.

22,"May 05, 2017","I have been in the market for a new car for sometime now, not because I want one, I love my current car, I'm just afraid she's on her last leg and I'd like to purchase a new one before she full on croaks. Not needing a new car immediately has given me the luxury of taking my time and shopping around. I've had my eye on a new Ford Focus hatchback and did my research on features, pricing, etc. Covered all the bases. I found the perfect model on the Covert Ford website which listed the selling price as $17,777. The price was great, and I, not having purchased a new vehicle in some time, assumed I had just lucked out and stumbled upon a sale. I visited the dealership today and worked with Manny, who was polite and helpful. I have no issues with him. However, I did confirm the selling price several times and brought in a print out from the website clearly showing the listed price. I test drove the car, provided evidence of pre-approved financing, and we agreed on a price and monthly payments. They took my current car for appraisal and I signed an agreement stating I would purchase the new car today based on an anticipated appraisal estimate. This paper also listed the selling price of the new car as $17777. But then Manny came back and told me that the Internet Manager had ""fixed"" the price online. He had also scratched out the agreed upon price he wrote on the appraisal agreement and listed another. Apparently, the previous Internet Manager made a lot of mistakes and the price would actually be $3000 more than originally listed. They refused to honor the price that was listed when I came in. Yes, they literally raised the price $3000 two hours into the buying process. I understand mistakes happen. However, if you make the mistake, you take the loss. Period. This felt like a bait and switch, and was, frankly, insulting. Could I have looked at another model with a lower price? Sure. Could I have just agreed to the higher price? Sure. But this experience left such a bad taste in my mouth, I couldn't bring myself to buy any car at Covert Ford, ever. Incompetence is not something I can get over in a situation where I'm about to sign a contract and spend thousands of dollars. Listing one price and then demanding another, crying, ""Whoops! Our bad!"" is beyond incompetence. It is unethical, it is deceitful, and it is devious. Shame on you, Covert Ford. And to anyone considering buying a car there, please do your research, get them to confirm, confirm, confirm and don't fall for the same false advertising crap I did. You may just lose two hours of your life and end up with a strong desire to just take the xxxx bus, rather than deal with shady car dealerships and their ""mistakes."" I suppose I should have known better than to hope for an honest, competent, or even ethical, car dealership. But hey, that's MY mistake.",1.0
23,"February 25, 2017", I walked in the dealership looking for a new vehicle. When Matthew approached me. His demeanor came off pompous and arrogant. As I asked questions on different vehicles he his snide sarcastic remarks made me feel uncomfortable. I really wanted wanted this particular Lincoln and was willing to deal with his rude behavior until he changed the amount required on my deposit!!!  His response was this will fix my credit!!! So I left there without the car I wanted :(   Matthew Adams is a scamming crook. I highly recommend using another salesman. This was a complete turn off to the car buying experience. I will never go there again!  ,1.4
24,"February 02, 2017","I would recommend Covert Ford to anyone looking for a vehicle. I asked not to be hounded by phone calls and communicate via text or email.

36,"October 19, 2016","Mark Martin is hands down the best sales professional I have ever dealt with. Our experience was some what troublesome with the finance guy Travis as he was very stern and non personal at first, we got up and left. We loaded our kids up and was leaving because he said my payment would be 150 more than I agreed to. The sales manager had told me my trade car pulled to the right so he offered me 3k less than before and after he found out I only owed 11k instead of 20k. I reminded them the reason my car pulled to the right may have been because when I brought my car to have the oil changed Covert parked my car on the street where it was hit on the right side of the car. However, after all this everyone agreed to prices and now had better attitudes. We left with a great car and a fair price. Mark had nothing to do with any negative experience and as a matter of fact he cleaned my car, himself.

37,"October 14, 2016","I went to Covert Ford looking for a new car and Mark Martin was eager to get me the car I wanted. Covert had a great selection of different cars. I was looking for a Mustang and they had a great variety to choose from. 
I also cant say enough great things about Mark. He was incredibly helpful, especially considering it was the first time I bought a new car. Mark appeared to have injured his foot and was having a hard time walking, but that did not stop him from walking around grabbing keys to different vehicles and showing me every car I wanted to look at. Even after I purchased the car, Mark made sure to follow up with me and ensure I was enjoying my new vehicle. The whole time Mark had a smile on his face. He was able to answer all my questions and address all of my concerns. The next time I buy a car, I will remember how great Mark and Covert Ford made the car buying experience.

The last time I bought a car the dealership I bought it from had insane prices and never had any sales, they just expected you to pay a premium because they are an ""official"" servicer.

I was pleasantly surprised by the pricing here though, comparable to the quick lube places and sometimes they even have sales making them cheaper. 

I was also pleasantly surprised by the friendly customer service.   The previous dealerships service centers I have been to always felt like i was just a number, minimal contact.  I don't really mind that part but coupled with the haughty attitude that they are an ""official"" center made me avoid dealerships for service altogether.  But this place has changed my outlook.

If they serviced Mitsubishi I would probably take my old car here too.   So far excellent pricing and great customer service, I will be bringing the car back even after the warranty is up.

When I arrived at the dealership I asked for the salesperson Mrs. Lewis that I had been in contact with via e-mail and was told she was busy and I was directed to work with Mr. Macintosh.   His demeanor was such that he seemed disinterested in working with me and only doing it so I wasn't sitting around.  We walked outside to the vehicle I was interested in but it was blocked in and unable to be moved for a test drive.  Mr. Macintosh insisted that he would get a few cars moved around so I could test drive the car I was interested in even thought I told him it was quite all right.  I was asked to wait at the vehicle in the 100 degree Texas heat while he made arrangements.  10 minutes passed without any update so I choose to return to the building and look for Mr. Macintosh where I found him at his desk helping another costumer.   When he saw me walking up he quickly got up to greet me and asked what I would like to do next and I suggested we look into the trade in value for my vehicle.  At this point he asked me to wait until Mrs. Lewis' desk opened up and it would be about 5 minutes.  I waited for about 20 minutes without being tended to or addressed before I had enough and left.  I was appalled at such behavior and I hope you look into the matter, and make sure such an incident is not repeated.

96,"June 05, 2013","I should of never went back to the dealership... I wish there was a negative star option... Below is an email I sent to the person in charge of Covert Ford today.

Kenny,

 I was in you dealership today and thought I would shoot you an update.  I should of stuck to what I said below, but thought the service section might have been different.

1) When I brought back the Escape for the recall it sat at the dealership for a couple of weeks.  Understandable, would want to make sure the car was good before it left.  When I picked up the Escape, they had lost my car and kept trying to give me someone else keys...  Finally after an hour of them looking at my like I was crazy, the realized they had assigned the number they gave my car to another car.  Then it took another hour for the car to be pulled up.

2) I brought my truck by because it had a nail in the tire.  When I pulled up, I was informed that they could not patch my tire because I didn't buy the tires at Covert.  I thought the whole reason of getting the tire package was to fix items like this. It was explained to me by Travis if I ever had this kind of thing happen while I have the vehicle this would be covered.  Is it expected that there is only one set of tires for the life of the vehicle?

3) I came in today to get my tires rotated and oil changed.  I was under the impression that this was also covered in the care package on the truck.  I could have been wrong, and was willing to pay for it.  When the service tech asked if I wanted him to pull my paperwork from sales, I told him not to and that working with Travis and purchasing the vehicles were less than enjoyable and did not want to get him involved.  The service person comped my oil change, which is appreciated.  But on the way out to pick up my truck....Travis took it upon himself to stand in the door way starring, smirking, shaking his head before he laughed and when back inside.

Look, I know this is my fault, I should of stuck to my guns and not come back to the dealership in all these cases. I guess I am a glutton for punishment.  But seriously, it seems that this is more of a playground than a sales oriented establishment. I am in sales and still fell for Travis's crap deal.  I am not asking for comps, money or even an apology. I know I would want to know this and the bad PR is brings with it.  I sent an email to Ford Motor Company as well.",1.0

They basically gave me a high-pressure sales pitch and didn't listen to my requests or comments. They wouldn't talk numbers and they kept trying to sell me a vehicle that was too much for my budget. They also wouldn't leave me drive a truck by myself or leave me alone with the vehicles to figure out what the options were. I finally had to walk out.

That evening I sent email to Covert from their website and told what I was looking for (used or new) and the email ended up going to Paul Roberge.  He responded to me (a real email, not a fake one) and we setup a time for me to come in Sunday afternoon.

Wow!  What a complete difference.  Paul listened very well to what my requests were and we ran all the numbers before even looking at a vehicle.  We figured out what our price range was and then he printed several options out and got me the keys, walked me out to the trucks and said ""have fun!"".  (Covert has done this every time I've bought a vehicle there!).  My wife and finally chose the truck we wanted and then decided on a color.  We went back to Paul, told him our decision and we closed the deal.  Talk about a completely different experience!

Price? The incentives were unbelievable ($7,000) because I was trading in a Ranger. The cost appeared to be comparable to the other dealer but they didn't provide enough details to explain how they got to their cost. Could have had a sale there Lief!

Paul lived up to the previous experiences I've had at Covert.  Other people I've dealt with were Connie (Covert Saturn), Johnny (Covert Saturn), And Colin (Covert Ford).  All of these people treated me like I had a brain and could make logical decisions.  They let the vehicle sell itself and only interjected when I didn't understand something.

Fantastic experience and I will continue to send all my friends and family to Covert for the foreseeable future!  As far as I'm concerned, there is only one Ford Dealer in ALL of Texas...  Covert Ford!

Thanks Paul!!

128,"April 16, 2012","Got the WOW factor here! 
OK so I bought a used 99’ Buick from Jeff Shepperd at Covert Ford. Took it home and parked it in the garage for 3 days while it was raining, sounds silly but it was all clean and I didn’t want to dirty it.  Finally drove it and noticed the transmission was shifting hard. Brought it back on a Saturday asked for the manager, Scott F. assisted me, I told him what was going on with it, he said let me grab a mechanic and see what it’s doing. Within 5 min we were on the road and it was shifting hard again. They thought it might be a programming issue so they suggested I take it to Covert Buick and let them reprogram the shifting chip for the transmission. Scott F. said he would take care of it and to ask for Mark C. there. Well Mark stated they go by appointments and couldn’t get me in until Wednesday or Thursday so I said that was fine. He had me taken home within a few minutes after leaving my car there. I though this too was great customer service.  Well after getting the car back it continued to start shifting hard again. I was concerned at this point thinking I may have been had.(everyone thinks this) I started a Google search found 3 items it might be. I called Scott F. again, told him that wasn’t the problem he said bring it in as he had a go-to mechanic that should be able to find the problem.  So I took it back to Buick to David and he and I took it for a drive. The car did exactly what it was doing (shifting hard) and then the front wheels bounced off the ground. I told David I did a Google search and thought it was a pressure control solenoid. He said he too thought that was the issue. Well long story but that’s what it was and they took care of the problem in full. I just want to add... this is what will keep me coming back to buy another car at Covert. The Coverts know customer service, keeping it fair and doing what’s right. I must say they did not have to do anything as I bought used.  I think being family owned is the key. You want your customer to come back! Plain and simple. Thanks for the WOW factor! Maybe your competitor’s should take WOW factor 101 from you, but then again, why share what you do best. Thanks to all involved in making this right.

142,"February 16, 2012","My experience with Covert Ford was very positive. I was in the market for new Explorer for my wife. I have sent a quote request to all dealerships in Austin area using the Ford website. Several sales reps called me and were trying to sell me cars they had on the lot but nothing really matching my criteria. Some of the local dealers must be selling hell lot of cars at the moment because I could tell that after they realized they cannot sell me a car from their lot they were not too interested in my business. Well it wasn’t the case in case of Covert and one other dealership. They both looked up the closest car matching my specifications in their system. 
I got better deal at Covert and they were about to arrange vehicle swap with the dealership in Dallas. Unfortunately the car was sold over the weekend before they were able to get it (It was Friday when I told them they can pull the trigger).  Paul the sales rep from Covert walked me through the options we have and he offered that he will check whether there are cars matching my specifications popping up in area as new inventory was delivered to dealers from the factory. Paul stayed in touch and after about two weeks he called me that he has a car for me. 
After that everything went very fast and smooth, no problems with paperwork, he was able to answer any of my questions during the process (and even after I took the car home). In general very pleasant experience I almost didn’t notice how much money I left there :) I guess it had something to do with the fact that I checked the price range on internet how much cars with my configuration are selling for and I got a GREAT deal.
I strongly recommend Covert and if you want professional service and honest partner to work with, you won’t be sorry, I would get in touch with Paul Roberge. Other people in the dealership seemed to be professional and nice too (didn’t need to deal with many of them, did I mention how fast and painless the process was?). I think I know where I’m getting next car, this time for me.

As most parents, we wanted a truck that was safe and in good condition, but we also needed to find one in the right price range that allowed our son the ability to make the payments on his own.  Jeff Shepperd worked relentlessly with us in trying to find just the right fit for our son.  We eventually found the truck that not only met the financial needs, but that met our concerns for our son's safety.  Jeff walked our son through every gadget on the truck and in doing so discovered a lock on the tailgate that wasn't working and immediately had that fixed.  

Not once did Jeff ever rush us through the process.  He seemed more interested that our son loved the truck and that he also knew how to operate all the different gadgets in it.

159,"December 15, 2007","The letter I sent to the Better Business Bureau sums it up:


Dear Better Business Bureau:

I am submitting a claim against Covert Ford in Austin Texas. I had purchased a Ford Explorer from them. On 10/20/07 my O/D light came on. I had 59,500 miles on the vehicle and it was less than 5 years old. I took it to Covert Ford on 10/22/07. They charged me $89.99 to tell me that the transmission was completely bad. Something I already knew from reading websites before I took it in. The 2nd and 5th gears had gone out. They wanted $3200 to $3500 to fix the problem. I claimed that this should have been covered under warranty, or at least partially covered. A transmission should last longer than 59,500 miles. I took very good care of the vehicle. I have all my receipts for all servicing. Covert Ford also did the complete 30,000 mile checkup. I have receipts to back up. Covert Ford claimed that there was nothing they could do – that I would have to pay the $3200-$3500 to get it fixed. Apparently, there was nothing unusual in their mind having to pay $3200-$3500 less than 5 years after purchasing the vehicle for $32K. Believe me, had I known a big expense like this could occur and not be covered, I wouldn’t have purchased the vehicle. 

I decided to take it to a transmission specialist – B&M transmission. They charged me just under $2200 to have it fixed. I then called Covert Ford back and complained that I believe they should have been able to help me. At that point the manager, Kenny Covert claimed that had I contacted him he could have helped me. But now it was too late since I had it serviced somewhere else. That was an unacceptable response to me. First of all, it undermines his service managers if they are not empowered to help me. I shouldn’t have to speak to the general manager of the facility. Secondly, I offered several ideas how he could make the situation better without having to reimburse me directly. Ideas such as: provide an extended warranty, give me credit at the service department for future repairs, reimburse the amount at trade in time if I purchased a new vehicle etc… I kept sending him emails asking for a response, but no answer. I then mentioned that I would contact the better business bureau – at which point he said he couldn’t help me.

160,"December 26, 2005","Several items to mention:
I bought a new '97 F-150 in April of 1996. The sales approach just blew me away. Sales guy saw me on the lot, came running out, told him I wasn't ready to buy, he said fine, gave me his card, wished me a good day and went back inside. Note:sales managers get pissed when this happens and sales guy will get fired for this at any other dealership. 
I had some service issues with the truck that required a few trips but service advisors never gave me any hassle and diligently worked with me to find/fix problems, even when I had to return 3 times to finally pinpoint an intermittent problem.

In '98, I was ready to buy a new Explorer. It got down to the wire and then we discovered a difference in the motors (4.0liter V6 vs 4.0liter V6 overhead cam), big power difference. They didn't have the OHC model and reluctantly sent us on our way without trying to pressure us into buying the other model. We found it at another dealer, one that I will never shop at again. This vehicle also had some service issues. I id'd an issue that service was too lazy to find and on the third return I called up and chewed out the butt of the service manager saying the problem existed but their technique of finding it obviously wasn't working too well. That service manager took his chief mechanic for a drive in my car, called me back 30 minutes profusely apologizing saying the normal procedure would never have found it. Moral of the story: I would have never had to do this at Covert.

In '99 I needed to buy  an F250 crecab SuperDuty diesel, and went back to them again. They didn't have the model I wanted as those trucks were selling out as soon as they hit the lot. Again, they didn't try to push me into anything I didn't want and I had to go elsewhere to purchase it, to another dealership it turns that I will never shop at again. Service issue: when I bought the vehicle it had some paint damage from removing a prior dealer decal since it was a dealer trade (something they denied even though I found the other decal under the rear seat). They promised to fix it. I don't call putting 2 dabs of paint on the spots, then buffing it out, and leaving all the wax residue on it ""fixing it"".

Moral of this posting:
I NEVER had any service or sale issues with Covert Ford and would gladly take my business there again. When servicing the Explorer and F250, they NEVER gave me a hassle about not purchasing the vehicle there and they were _always_ completed in a timely manner.",5.0
