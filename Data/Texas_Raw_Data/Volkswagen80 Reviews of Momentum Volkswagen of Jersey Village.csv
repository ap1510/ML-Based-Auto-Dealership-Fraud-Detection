2,"February 06, 2019","My 2013 VW was having an over-heating problem , I called and Willie got me in the same day! I barely made it into the service center before my car overheated. I was so worried, Willie helped reassure me, I was provided a loaner until my car was ready- which only took a couple of days. They had a big job ahead of them replacing many damaged parts.

Upon the return of my car, the battery decided to die with no previous warning. The Service Manager and Willie truly went above and beyond to make my ordeal as painless as possible.  I really appreciate all their help.  They were truly my hero’s!  I’ve never had better service anywhere!

Thanks JV VW!!",5.0

5,"September 26, 2018","I contacted the dealership the day before to coordinate a visit for the next day for a new car purchase and to verify the vehicle I had been looking at on line was still available.  I arrived the next morning and met with Richard Acosta and we checked out the vehicle, he was very helpful in explaining the various items and accessories in the vehicle, he arranged for the inspection of my trade in vehicle and worked with the department manager to make the purchase happen.  I met the Service Center manager and the Sales Manager and everyone was very friendly and made me feel welcome in their dealership.  After finalizing the purchase Richard spent some more time with me in the vehicle demonstrating the operation of the systems and even helped sync my mobile phone to the cars system.  I highly recommend Momentum VW of Jersey Village for your next new vehicle purchase, fair prices and honest people make for a stress free purchasing experience.",5.0

7,"May 21, 2018","This review is more based on the vehicle service center and not the sales floor. I arrived at the service center at 6:50am in need of an oil change. I was the first person there and another gentleman showed up about 5 minutes later. The center opens at 7:00am so I had no problem waiting for them to open. That wasn't my point of concern, it was the amount of time I had to sit there just for an oil change. I was told it would take about 45 minutes to complete the oil change. That in itself is not an absurd amount of time but quite a bit longer than I had expected at the dealership when it was just another man and myself. Once again that wasn't the timing issue I had, it was the fact that I watched my car be lifted, the oil changed, and then taken down off of the lift. I waited about 15 minutes and inquired about my car. I was told that it was probably getting washed since they hadn't pulled it around to me yet. Another 10 minutes passed and still nothing so I went to search for my car. I found it sitting by the car wash all by itself still not washed. I had to argue with the service advisor to pull my car around so that I could leave. I didn't need or want the wash at this point. Now to the second part of my title. Online it was stated that the oil change would cost $79.95 but in store the price was $89.95. When I brought that to the service advisor attention he told me he couldn't find that price online but that he found a $25 coupon that he could apply. I found the price online and showed it to him on my tablet. I was told that it was a special sales price and that he couldn't apply the sales price and the $25 coupon. It was not stated anywhere on their webpage that it was a specially discounted price, it was just the regular price for an oil change. I'm thankful for the coupon but if I hadn't said anything I would have been charged $89.95, $10 more than what was stated online. Overall I was not happy about the service I received. I wasn't happy about having to argue to have my car pulled to the front after it had been sitting unattended for no reason for a lengthy amount of time. If this place was busy I could forgive them for taking longer than usual but when it's just another guy and myself. There is no reason I should have had to wait an hour and 15 minutes past their opening time to get something as simple as an oil change. I assume the car was forgotten about since it was just sitting there for no reason. ",1.6

12,"August 17, 2017","If I could give 0 stars I would. As you can see from other reviews besides mine the service department is out of control in their actions towards customers. The GM Mark  did not rectify an issue, but instead blamed me for asking questions about my car and it's service before I go and drop $120 on diagnostics which I already know why my car's check engine light was on for. My check engine light that is on has an extended warranty for the code.  Also, they have a special on diagnostics for 59.99 which they never mentioned. The service manager Scott Adkins was even more rude. While I was asking questions about even though my engine codes are showing what the warranty covers it had to past further testing and if that didn't match up with the codes I would have to pay the $120 diagnostics fee. He got frustrated after I asked basic questions and just flat out told me he wouldn't book me an appointment without even meeting me because I was a ""problem"" customer. (we spoke on the phone 2x for about 4 minutes each time). When I spoke with Mark the GM instead of giving proper customer service stated that (3) people have talked to me and it was all the same story. Funny how the calls were not recorded even though they say they are. I decided to go to a different VW ,  as I have researched more about this location and only have saw horror stories. I have already reported them to VW cooperate and filed  a complaint the District Regional Manager. If you don't have to go here please stay away. I am going to a different location by different owners and they treated me with the respect and gave the best customer service unlike Mark and Scott ever could have done.",1.0

16,"June 01, 2017","Mr Hesler treats you with respect and spends time making you feel comfortable. I experienced the whole sales process very pleasant and easy going.

Being a foreigner I had several disadvantages; 1) I was not sure what expectations to set and 2) I was unfamiliar with finance options, the local team was very pro-active and ensured they answered all my questions and I was well informed. Paperwork remains a true US hazzle but we got through it very quickly and constructive.

At the end made we closed the deal for an almost fully loaded Jetta GLI under VW financing using the VW Business Foreign plan, despite lack of credit history. 

So far no issues with or service provided to the car and therefore no experience with the Shop.

Aftersales provided by Mr Hesler is very personal and he ensures he meets your needs.",4.6

19,"March 30, 2017","Roy was my service attendant and I couldn't have asked for a better person. He took the time to explain in detail the process with my car, made sure the shuttle picked me up to bring me home, called me every step of the way with updates on my vehicle. He was an ABSOLUTE pleasure to work with and VW is extremely luck to have such an asset on their team. Because of Roy, I am certain to return to this location. ",5.0
20,"February 24, 2017","Hooorraaay for the 1st class service from Roy Schaff, Service Advisor and the technician who did the emergency alignment on my wife's car.

She needed the alignment after a near collision with another vehicle in the parking garage her employer.  I called Roy and brought the car in same day.  Roy explained the options / gave the prices and even a timetable for how long the car would be in service.

He always calls back with any update and the job was done accurately and fast.  Very impressive!

25,"April 29, 2016","Absolutely awful... I have a 2013 beetle that I bought brand new.  I hardly drive the car and it has less than 8000 miles on it.  The car has been housed in the garage and hardly saw any rain.  The engine light and EPC light came on.  I lost all power on the busiest highway in Texas.  I was able to get it to the dealership where they would not even look at the car unless I paid them 138.00 to hook it up and read the codes.  This is a brand new car that I bought from them. (in fact I bought 3 new cars from them that year)   They said it was 2 months out of warranty.  I would NEVER buy a car there again.  I had the car there before for the blue tooth in the radio and they said it was fixed, but still have the same problem.  VW does not stand behind their cars and they do not help the customer.  This company deserves to go bankrupt because of all the lies they have told there customers and they are trying to make up the lost by ripping people off through repairs.  
Other cars have more than a 3 yr. warranty.

they don't even deserve 1 star.",1.0
26,"January 10, 2016","I first want to say that my husband and I have been to many dealerships and have purchased at least 10 cars in the past 7 years. Therefore, it's no small thing for me to say that our experience at this dealership was the BEST out of them all. I think that the other places need to take notes and they would greatly improve their customer satisfaction. We came here at were casually approached by Paul, our salesperson. He wasn't pushy and yet he was attentive to our every need. We genuinely enjoyed dealing with him and are so glad glad that he was the one that greeted us upon our arrival. Once it was time to get down to the details of our trade value and ultimately the purchase of a new car, Beth, one of the managers came to speak to us. She presented the numbers and my husband and I felt like she was very fair in their offer. I usually feel a little slighted at this point in the deal but in this instance I must say I didn't feel that way at all. I am so glad that we came here and if I buy another Volkswagen in the future, we won't go anywhere else. 

Thanks for such a great car buying experience!!",5.0

I brought the car back and spoke to the manager of the used cars department.  He wanted to make things right.  I traded the car in for a vehicle that was 5 years newer..a 2013.with 60k less miles....  The manager worked with me and kept my payments close to what I was paying..all with no money down. The manager seem to care about the customer and making sure the customer is happy with their purchase and not just selling  a car.",4.2
31,"September 10, 2015","Greg was very frustrated because I requested copies of all documents and stressed that mileage and my name was incorrect.  Plus he refused to change correct county for taxes and title.  Said I could not cross through or write correct information on document.  The last straw was the temporary tag had my name incorrect and Adrian Rodriguez stated he was unable to correct. I only wanted correct paperwork to reflect the transaction I WAS PAYING FOR.

Bobby Fountain was so helpful and knowledgeable when it came to any questions I had about Volkswagen vehicles and accessories. Very stress free environment and I didn't feel like I was being sold a car, but more like I was given the opportunity to find the vehicle that best suits me. I must say, I felt as if I was right at home. It's so great knowing that there are car salesman out there that want to help you find the right vehicle for you and that they aren't just trying to make another sale.

Stephen Ruiz went above and beyond my expectations when he acquired the exact GTI spec I was looking for!  Within a week and a half, it was on the dealer lot for me to pickup.  Communication during that time was fast and responsive.  The team was even able to fulfill an odd PDI request of mine.

On Monday he TEXTED me asking how I liked the car and I asked him what time I should be there to pickup the tire. Stephen then states that he had to order a tire and it wasn't a tire there.

52,"May 06, 2014","I have taken my car 35 times to this dealer, They have to fix any problem yet.
Every time that I complain to VW USA they told me to go to a different dealer.  What is the point to have a dealer that is just causing problems to the customers and the brand.

They were incapable to find a loose wire that caused my VW CC 2010 to loose control on what gear was.  If the car for any reason was turn off and you press the key, it didn't start for about 15 to 30 minutes.  A warning message ""Put it in Parking or Neutral"" showed all the time.

It was in parking and moved to neutral so many times, it didn't work.  You have to wait half an hour to start the vehicle. The danger is when the car stall in mid traffic when my wife was driving it.  She couldn't start the car, she was lucky didn't get in any accident.

3 times went for this same defect in a 2 week periods, I was told they will pay for rental car, when they called me to pick the car (it was not fixed, they couldn't find the problem) I was told that I had to pay for the rental.  I started a law suit against Momentum VW in small court.

I went to West VW in Katy, they fixed in 1 day, they found the loose wire and it is working.

Avoid Momentum like your life depends on it.

They gave me top dollar for my trade and a great deal on the new car.  I walked in at 11:15 and walked out with a new car at 4:00.  Picking it up today. Everyone was so nice and honest. From Stephan to the guy in finance (whose name I will not put in here since I don't know how to spell it and I don't want to butcher it!) they were helpful, kind, honest, and professional.

Every time we had the same sales representative - Stephen Ruiz -, and his service is outstanding. No need to haggle, no questions like ""what will it take to sell you this car today?"", no delay tactics you get at other dealerships (""let me ask my manager if we can do this""). Stephen answered all our questions,  addressed any concern we had, and all available discounts were applied automatically.

63,"August 30, 2013","Firstly, I fault myself for letting this dealership know that I was in desperate need of a good used inexpensive car because my regular car was involved in an accident and it was not in drivable condition. So now, they had a ready and willing victim in waiting.

Although I knew that I was buying a used car in ""as is"" condition, I did not expect a salesman to blatantly lie to me in order to get me to buy this lemon that they advertised on their Momentum Volkswagen of Jersey Village website. I made it understood to Rodrigo Vargas that i did not want something that was going to break down soon after i drove it off the lot, but I guess I was asking too much of him. while I was at the car lot, I asked Vargas why was the check engine light on and he told me that it was probably because of a loose gas cap and he would have a mechanic to check it out and replace it. He said the check engine light was not on before-I think that was a lie also. I asked him, is it all right if i hire a mechanic of my own choosing to check the car out and he said yes.

After approx. half and hour of evaluating my situation, i thought surely they would not let me pay $100 or $200 for a mechanic to drive all the way out here to check a lemon! well... that is what i get for thinking. obviously they were going to let me do just that. If it wasn't for low class they wouldn't have any class at all!

The odometer miles showed:152,069 was the same on the day that I bought the car as it is now. So the odometer is/was defective but Mr. Vargas conveniently chose not to bring this to my attention either. The fake looking Invoice implied that the odometer was operational because there was a mileage difference listed on the the invoice and the Bill of Sale- Although obviously, the odometer was/is not working at all. In other words the Carfax report did not match the condition of the car, as there was not any information about the bad engine in that car that began overheating and then locked up on me about a month later.

 I brought this incident to the attention of the GM- Shed D. and offered to give his car back in exchange for the money I paid them. He basically said that there was nothing he could do and he was not willing to take the car back and return my money. Would an honest company sell something that they were not willing to stand behind-I don't think so! 

In the future, I will greatly limit the the amount of business I do with corporations and their representatives, as they own the Justice system and there is almost no recourse to to be had if you were to get screwed by them. ",1.0
64,"June 16, 2013","I made a 200 mile trip to visit this dealership specifically to trade my 2007 Dodge Charger for one of three Volkswagen Jetta TDIs listed on their website.  I had verified the trade-in value of my Charger through AutoTrader, and was prepared to 'close'.  My credit rating is high 800's.  My salesperson assured me they subscribed to AutoTrader and would honor my quotation.   I was prepared for a 'no-deal' outcome for any legitimate reason - - -.  If there was 'no deal' I was prepared to move on to another dealership - - Again, I was an 'out-of-towner', with a specific agenda, and limited time.   

It took an hour for the dealership to confirm my trade-in price, and another half hour to determine they had none of the vehicles listed on their website.  I made a trip to BUY A CAR.   I sat at a showroom table for over an hour waiting for my salesperson to figure out they would not be able to help me.  

I don't mind when inventory moves unexpectedly - - that happens - - - I DO mind when salespeople don't know what they have for sale.  I DO mind when an hour and a half of my time is wasted.  I DO mind when customers are treated at 'incidental' to a dealership's business!

Avoid this dealership.  Their head is somewhere other than where the sun shines - - - ",1.3

66,"May 31, 2012",I think I got a decent price on my new car but the customer service was not great and as soon as I purchased the car it got even worse.  We were there for about 20 minutes trying to get someone to let me test drive a car - everyone ignored us.  I am all for non pressure but a little assistance would be nice. After the purchase I was promised an extra service to be included with my purchase price.  I called 5 times over the course of a week trying to schedule that service - each time being told I'd get a call the next day which didn't happen.  After I finally pinned down my sales person (who acted like he didn't remember putting this in the deal) I was able to schedule with the service guy.  I give extra credit to this person as he worked a later day to fit me in due to the Salesperson's lack of response to me.  It seems that once I paid for the car I was forgotten.  I only hope I am not in for the same &quot;service&quot; overthe next five years. ,3.0
67,"May 22, 2012",The absolute best experience I have had purchasing a vehicle (have purchased 27 over the years)!!!  Hassle-free and as described by the salesperson.  We did have a service issue quickly after purchase and were treated incredibly well by the service department to the point that I will drive by the Katy dealership (we live in Katy) to have my car serviced here.  I will definitely purchase from this dealer again and hope they keep the same philosophies and training of their employees that is evident today.,5.0
68,"February 25, 2012","I had an overall wonderful experience with VW of Jersey Village. AJ Wood was so incredibly kind, thorough, honest, and helpful from the moment we walked up. He made the the experience of buy a used car extremely easy and enjoyable for me and my family. We left feeling really good and confident that we bought a great and safe car at a great price! I would recommend AJ (and the dealership) to anyone!",5.0
69,"January 17, 2012","I caution anyone thinking of doing business with Momentum Volkswagon!!!!  My wife and I bought our used car from them and they keep pushing the CarFax in front of you as if it is the standard.  They said that the car had been inspected by them and the Car Fax shows no prior accidents.

However, a few months later....The Car Fax now shows an accident.  I went back to the dealership to speak with someone/anyone and I was told that they could not have known about the accident and all used cars have a fender bender of some sort.

I explained that if i went to a jewelry store and bought a 1.0 ct diamiond and left only to find out it was .9 ct it would be considered deceptive sales. 

I asked how they determine the price of the cars and they said ""on looks"" WTH?  Me- Sooo, you dont look under the hood of the car you are selling but you look under the one that is getting traded in?

They offered to ""make me a deal on a new car"" and they would pay me below average for the trade in.  I told them I they did not charge me a ""below average"" price.  

They are worthless and do not care about the customer after money is spent.  

The manager and a few sales people need to be fired.

71,"August 19, 2011","DO NOT buy a car from this dealership. Shedrick Donnette said that he was getting me an add-on accessory at ""cost"". We assumed that this accessory came with the car since the car that was traded in had this on it. The ""cost"" he gave is what West Houston V.W. charges retail. When I provided this information to Mr. Donnette, he became very defensive and quite rude stating that West Houston V.W.'s price structure must be different. It is sad that instead of being honest and insuring the total satisfaction of the buyer...Mr. Donnette would rather upset a repeat customer and tarnish the reputation of the entire dealership.",1.0
72,"April 26, 2011","RUDE & UNPROFESSIONAL - AVOID,AVOID, AVOID!!
 I was bidding on one of their vehicles on ebay. Although I won the auction the Reserve was not met. The ""Buy It Now Price"" was $19999.00. However, the salesman said they would except $18999.00 and end the auction early. I inquired directly at their website and was quoted $18999.00 (Which is their everyday internet price). So truly he was not offering any discount. 

After the auction had ended I sent this message........................ Dear jerseyvillagevw, Are you flexible on the price at all? $18900 is a little more than I want to spend. 

This is the response I received.......... Hi, How flexible we should be to earn your business? I just droped my price by $1091. Thank you, Keivan Esfandiari - jerseyvillagevw 

I could not believe the complete lack of professionalism. As I can see from the other reviews online this is not an isolated incident. Keep in mind that I live over 800 miles from the dealerships location. I would have to fly and then drive the vehicle home. I was looking for a very small concession, maybe enough to cover the cost of fuel home. Please consider other dealerships before buying at Momentum VW!!!",1.0

Called sales rep about a used car Tues night (2-22-11) around 8:30 pm.  I told him I was interested in this particular truck and wanted to see if they would be open to a certain offer. He told me my offer was probably within the acceptable range and he would talk to his boss who had already gone home an let me know.  He did not call back either that night or the next morning.  
When I showed up at the dealership the next day... the sales rep was not there, but another worker showed me the truck and let me test drive it.  Then, I was ready to make an offer.  We walked in to the sales office and talked to the manager.....and guess what.....the F'in car had been sold to an employee the night before!  
I will never waste my time at this dealership (or any other) again.  These jerks did not have the common decency to let me know what the hell was going on and didn't give a flip.  The sales manager offered NO apology and didn't even speak to me. 
Over the years, I have have found dealers to be arrogant and greedy (trying to squeeze every nickel they can out of you). This experience just reminds me again and reinforces by long held belief that dealerships should be avoided like the plague. ",1.3
