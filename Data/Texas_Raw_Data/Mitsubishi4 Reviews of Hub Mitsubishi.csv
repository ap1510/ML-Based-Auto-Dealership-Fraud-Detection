1,"October 04, 2017","the worst experience on car repair, hands down. I bought a Mitsubishi evo x MR from Carmax and took it to them when I have the transmission issues. The car still under warranty and they won't honor it, according to the lady manager. I have to call corporate and report them before they fixed my car, two months after transmission won't work again took it to the same dealership it's a warranty repair but never got a loaner, I have to beg to ask for it but nothing was provided. Overall i have to rate the staff, the car, the brand as the poorest of poor . It's a shame that I used to admire mitsubishi a lot in the past. But there is always a reason why they are falling behind other brand. Will never get a Mitsubishi again. ",1.0
2,"May 16, 2017",I was with a friend while servicing her vehicle. Lisa was very friendly and had an impressive knowledge base of the product. I will certainly consider a Mitsubishi for my next vehicle simply because of the service and friendly helpful atmosphere. I would rate Lisa a 9,4.8
3,"May 09, 2015","I traded my Outlander Sport for an Outlander and Ray K. made the process so easy and pleasant that i'm taking time to write this review to encourage people who are looking for great value and hassle free experience.

Ray's been in the business for a long time and he takes care of his customers. I highly recommend him and will definitely consider buying from him again.",5.0
