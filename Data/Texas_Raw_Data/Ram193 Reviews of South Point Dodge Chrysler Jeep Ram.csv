0,"June 20, 2020","1) Poor communication- did not return calls or text message.
2) Mislead me on pricing / services rendered
3). Did not honor warranty on Jeep engine because I changed from com local mechanic to Their Jeep dealership.   I had Jeep at local mechanic before warranty ran out (engine), but when we moved it to the Jeep dealership the date expired.
4). After spending $2.7k without a single service rendered (expense was supposedly for amount of time they had it) I had it towed to Jeep Master.   I found out Southpoint could have sent my case for a judgement on whether warranty would cover it based on the fact that it was at a mechanic before the end of the warranty but they never informed me of the opportunity.

11,"April 22, 2020","We met Mark, our salesman right away & he spent time showing us what we really wanted...the Jeep Wrangler until we realized us we couldn't swing it.  So then he showed us the Jeep Cherokee Latitude which he offered us to test drive one.  He was so patient with us, as I had to see every color & option.  With so many choices...we finally chose one.  Besides so many choices; best of all our salesman was NEVER pushy.  THANKS Mark H.  Way 2 go!!!

31,"November 25, 2019",VERY poor service...I took my Ram 2500 in for service on October 17th to fix 5 factory safety recall Issues.  Before I took my truck in I was told it would take one day to complete repairs.  Upon arriving for my appointment I was met by Franchesca who seemed very unfriendly and disinterested in the whole process of doing the intake.  She didn't greet me as one would expect and acted like she would rather be somewhere else.  No smile and made no effort to see if I needed transportation home. The truck was not ready in one day.  I called the main number and the service number approximately 25 times the 18th and 19th to check on the status and NEVER had my call answered as it went to voice mail everytime.  I left 3 messages asking for an update on my truck and never got a call back.  Finally I left a message for the GM.  NO call back...  I gave up trying to reach them and they finally called late on the 21st to update me.  Truck was still not ready.  They were waiting on a item(seat buckle)OUTSIDE the scope of the safety repairs I had brought the truck in for.  I told them to fix the recall issues and not hold up the process for the buckle.  The truck was ready on the 22nd.  I'm still waiting on the buckle.,1.5

33,"November 23, 2019","I‚Äôve had an awful experience on buying a vehicle from this dealership, my biggest mistake was that I did inspect the vehicle properly and thoroughly before driving off the lot, and obviously the salesman failed to delivered the vehicle properly. To this day, I‚Äôve encountered one problem after another. I thought I purchased a new vehicle and paid for it cash, but to my surprise, they sold me a used and a loaner vehicle. I‚Äôm very sad and disappointed about the whole experience. ",1.0

37,"November 06, 2019","When I bought the car everything seemed great in the beginning...but less than a week after my purchase I started smelling smoke when I would be driving and at first I thought, ‚Äúmaybe the engine is running a bit hot...‚Äù but then I started noticing pools of brown liquid under my used car everywyhere I would park. So, I took it to my local trusted mechanic and they told me that the car I bought has an oil leak from the oil coolant block and that the oil had gotten into the break fluid receptical so I had to get my break oil flushed and changed because the oil had contaminated that and there is a minor leak in the gasket that will need to be replaced....over $3,000 in work that needs to be done to a car I purchased less than 3 weeks ago...that is unacceptable business in my eyes...steer clear of south point dodge unless you want to fork over extra cash for repairs that should have been done by the dealership prior to them putting the car on their lot to begin with!",1.0
38,"November 05, 2019","read all the recent reviews, it is not very common for so many people claiming that the sales manager is rude and that the agreed on price was changed or that the trade in price was way off..This was by far the worse experience i have ever had buying anything. i was pre approved and they ran a hard inquire on me after i told them not to. they will not honor there internet prices. i locked in a price of $36000, they put $45800 on the contract, $700 over sticker price. then changed it to $45100 , put my trade in $3000 under the agreed on price. they ran my credit after i told them not to because i had approval from my bank all ready.

39,"October 30, 2019","What a waste of my precious time, after a horrible experience with one of the sales associates, I left without giving them my business, then I had a call the next day from a nicer gentleman name Joe who apologized for the bad experience and promised to make it up to me, he wanted to earn my business, so I obliged to go back. Right after work on Saturday  Oct. 25 2019  round about 2:30 pm I got there, I was met at the entrance by Joe one of the sale managers I introduced myself, he again apologized for the previous day, he passed me onto another sale associate Brandon who happened to be exceptional, he took me through all the nine yard I test drove the vehicle I was interested in, it was time for the numbers, he left after a short while Brandon returned with another guy who claim to be the ""boss"" the guy is soooo disrespectful and so arrogant I wonder how he is able to fit his head through a door, after a little heated exchange of words this fool got up and said he would not sell me a car, it sounds kindda funny though, I brought them business, and this ""KNICKAPOO"" threw it right back at me forgetting there is a bigger market out there. If he is really the boss, he must be a liability to the company, he should either fired or sent for training in customer relations.",1.0
40,"October 14, 2019",Great support and great price in the Jeep I purchased and the car I used as a trade-in.

41,"September 26, 2019","My intention was to purchase a used vehicle.  I arrived at approximately 6:30pm on a Wednesday night.  Shaun asked the questions necessary to assess and identify my vehicle needs.  Shaun and I then discussed new car options.  Shaun was knowledgeable, communicative, and attentive.  Marcelo Rosales, F & I Manager made the purchasing process efficient. I signed all the paperwork and walked out of the dealership at 8:30pm.  Please note the majority of the time was taken in the test drive.  Thank you to South Point Dodge and staff as my vehicle purchasing experience was positive and enjoyable.

42,"September 22, 2019","I like that I was able to walk around looking at vehicles on my own without being descended upon like I was roadkill for the buzzards.
      Once I decided I was ready to talk I was greeted warmly by Shawn. He was pleasant and engaging. Once I told him what I could do he worked the numbers and never pushed me towards vehicles I could not afford. I also appreciated his honesty by telling me it was his first week at this location and some patience might be needed.
    We went outside to look at trucks in my price range and even though the one I chose was hemmed in by numerous other trucks he offered to get all the keys to move them all around so I could test drive it. It was over one hundred degrees that day so it would‚Äôve been a royal pain for him. I opted not to drive it since I‚Äôve owned the same kind of truck for years, but the gesture was welcome.
        Shawn was able to traverse all the paperwork involved relatively quick,especially since I was trading in two trucks. Oscar was a big help during this process. 
        Marcelo in finance also helped a ton during the paper signing dance. I chose to get the extended warranty and appreciated that he wasn‚Äôt pushy with the up sell.
      When I arrived the next day to drop off my trucks and get the new one Shawn was right there ready to go. Make ready had forgotten the floor mats so he personally went truck to truck to find the right ones for mine despite it being their busy day. So if you‚Äôre going to South Pointe do yourself a favor and look Shawn up.",4.6

Bummer.",2.8
45,"September 09, 2019","My car had broken down hard in the middle of the road over Labor Day weekend, and I had to call Austin PD to push me into the nearest parking lot. So when the tow service asked me where to drop off my car, the dealer service center seemed to be the best option. John Fontaney was very helpful, putting my mind at ease before I left. That‚Äôs about as stellar as the service went. The entire time my car was in their care, I couldn‚Äôt get anyone on the phone who could tell me what was happening with my car. The call went to voicemail, the operator would transfer the call to a service tech voicemail, or the operator would just hang up. It wasn‚Äôt a bad connection; I heard breathing, a fumbling receiver, and a prominent hang-up ‚Äúclick.‚Äù My initial issue was resolved and they got my car to me, but here‚Äôs the insult to injury; I also asked them to repair the driver‚Äôs side lock, which needs to be locked and unlocked manually because the electronic controls do not work. The write up on my bill states the issue, says they recalibrated the door, and a charge. The door still doesn‚Äôt work. I didn‚Äôt find this out until I got home because it was late and I just needed to get my car back for my kids. I called the dealer and left a voicemail that said that they didn‚Äôt fix my door and requesting a refund. It‚Äôs been almost a week. Nobody has contacted me regarding this issue yet. Regardless of whether they resolve this issue, I would never take my car back to this service department again. The entire experience was hassle and hustle. ",1.0

49,"August 22, 2019","I went to this dealership to test drive the new Jeep Wrangler which I was very interested in the new model that was just released. I was approached by the sales person whose name was Joshua Moore and I told him I also had a $50 gift card offer for test drive. He took the paperwork and came back with his sales manager whose name was Jake. The first thing the sales manager asked me was if I was interested in the Wrangler or just the money (*money was his description of gift card promotion). Being a sales manager myself and working in luxury sales environment for 25 plus years I found the question very inappropriate and insulting as a client. At that point I had no desire to do further business with these people as he suggested he could just issue the gift card and I didn‚Äôt have to test drive, since they were quite busy! No discovery attempt or understanding client‚Äôs needs. So I just told him issue the gift card and I won‚Äôt take your time. This type of sales approach is against any ethical practices. This dealership has no right to use this type of cheap bait and switch sales techniques and play with the intelligence of their clients who visit them. Nobody should waste their valuable time for this nonsense. I regret going to this dealership. By the way it‚Äôs been several weeks and expectedly no gift card has been issued and all calls regarding the status has been ignored. I hope someone in charge will take these feedbacks seriously and value their clients rather putting them in awkward position. People take your business somewhere else. There are dealers who are willing to treat you properly.",1.0

53,"June 27, 2019",This was my first time buying/leasing a car and it was on my very first day arriving in Austin. I was helped by an awesome man named River who helped me navigate what I anticipated to be a stressful experience. River made me feel the exact opposite. He reached out a few days  before I arrived to make sure I could come at a time he was available to prepare and show me a specific Jeep I was inquiring about. He was prepared with this beautiful Jeep and took us on a test drive to show all its features and he really knew his facts. He was able to deliver all the details while composing a relaxed and super professional demeanor. Never felt awkward or pressured and once we got inside to talk numbers his customer service shined even brighter. He walked me through the process (again which I‚Äôve never done before) and made me feel comfortable and confident in signing off on my new Jeep. He was patient and productive in sifting through all the buy/lease/finance options with me in order to find the best approach for me. I‚Äôd HIGHLY recommend that if your taking a trip to South Point ask to see River before you ask anything else and you‚Äôll be in the best of hands! Oh and by the way the Jeep itself is everything I dreamed of and I look forward to returning for future needs for now I know how well I‚Äôll be taken care of!,5.0
54,"March 18, 2019","David Gillihan was great to work with!! Everyone at the dealership worked hard to meet our needs and were very friendly and respectful while doing so. However, the car we purchased has had issues since day one. Seven months later, the issues have not been resolved. Things are not handled in a timely manner and professionalism is questionable. I would not recommend this dealership when it comes to purchasing a vehicle and absolutely not for any kind of repair or service.

Update: after the 6th or 7th attempt to have the issue repaired, they have now said they are not able to recreate the issue (which was recreated in front of the service manager) and therefore aren't able to fix it so I can come pick up my car and continue to have the problem. I was told there was zero contact made with corporate even though I have a case, a case worker, and was told a special technician would help them with the issue. At this point i will never purchase another dodge product from any dealership let alone this one. ",1.0

He even had the service department put the plastic back on the floor for me so I didn‚Äôt get my brand new car dirty with all the bad weather. 

Hector was also super helpful and so kind. Not what you typically see out of a manager. He even took the time to help us understand how to refinance if need be. Every person we encountered was super nice!

He immediately asked me what I was looking for and walked the lot with me till we found something comparable.

In a month or so when I‚Äôm ready to purchase the truck and my current lease is over, he will be my go to person.

64,"August 23, 2018","I have never in my life had a car buying experience like this one. It was my only day off this week and I wound up spending over 5 hours at this dealership. No one seemed to know what they were doing and they seemed to be short staffed. I went in with the intention of buying a Jeep and was talked into leasing one instead (with all the reasons it would be better for me in my situation). In looking back, I am sure the salesperson makes more money on leasing than purchasing. 5 hours later I drove out with a new Jeep Wrangler after trading in my Hyundai Sonata 2.0 Turbo. When I got home, I realized that the odometer statement I signed had false information on it. They had me sign that there were only 25 miles on the vehicle when in fact it was closer to 125. I called the dealership repeatedly to get this rectified and left no less than 6 messages on various voicemails. I never once received a return call. I guess once they had your money and a sale, you didn't exist anymore. Almost a month later when I still had no finance company information or a payment booklet to make my auto loan payment, I started calling the dealership again and still could not get my salesperson (Alan Garcia) or the Sales Manager (Jet) to return my calls. It took me threatening to come in and make a huge scene in their showroom to get a return call from someone. Once they looked into it, they realized my loan had never funded because the finance person did not do the paperwork correctly and did not collect the first month's lease payment. They would have figured that out if they bothered to return any of my many calls. They never paid off my trade in vehicle and so I was getting nasty messages from the bank that my payments were overdue and I was in default of my loan. I demanded my vehicle back as I wanted no further dealings with this dealership and they told me my car had been wholesaled. That was a lie. They sold my car to another unsuspecting consumer. How can you sell a car you didn't pay off and don't have the title to??? They had to call that buyer and have them bring my car back to the dealership and that buyer was sad because she loved my trade. You can't make this stuff up!!! There is a new GM and a new Sales Manager at this dealership that tried to make the situation right (they weren't at the dealership when I bought) and they claim they are working to fix things. They have a lot of work to do! I have since purchased a new Jeep from a great dealership in Bastrop. ",1.0

66,"August 17, 2018","This was my first visit to South Point Dodge.  I had read the online reviews, but I was willing to see what kind of experience I would have.  I dropped off my 2014 Dodge Grand Caravan at about 7:30 Tuesday (08/14/2018) morning, because I was hearing some rattling sounds and a sound like I had driven over a rock that could have bounced back up to hit the bottom of my van. Those sounds were not constant, but I would hear them often when driving my van.   Anthony called me a short time later (at about 9:12 am) to give me a diagnosis of the repair costs and about how long it would take.  They repaired my van's sway bar bushings and took care of a recalled item.  Anthony called me about 3:07 pm (according to my cell phone log) on Wednesday (08/15/2018) to let me know that my van was ready for me to come get it.  I decided to wait a day or so, before giving a review - just in case I heard those sounds again.  I don't hear the sounds.  They fixed the problem.  I was pleasantly surprised at the good customer service and their quick and efficient responses.  I can't speak for other customers and their particular experiences, but my experience was a good one.  I would visit them again.  Anthony and other staff members (Faye and Ricardo, if I remember their names correctly) displayed good customer service to me.",5.0

71,"April 23, 2018","I dropped my 2500 Ram off on March 15, 2018 due to my engine light coming on. After running the quick diagnostic, the computer kicked back a transmission error code. A little concerning on a truck with only 27,000 miles, but hey, that‚Äôs what warranty is for. My service advisor told me there was currently a 3500 up on the only lift they could use on my truck, and it would be 5-7 days before they could look at it. Ok, figured it wouldn‚Äôt be an instant fix, and off I went. The service advisor was very good about calling every couple days and letting me know it was taking a little longer than expected to get the original truck off the lift; but then he either quit or got fired, and it was a quick decent downhill from there.

After not being able to reach my original advisor for about 3 days, I got the assistant manager Robert Cruz info off the website the next morning, leaving a voicemail on both office phone and cell. NO call back. Called again the next day, leaving more messages; not a peep. Finally drove down there the next day on my lunch break to speak with him. That is when I found out my original guy was no longer with South Point, and pretty much since I was on his schedule, they had to remember to go pull up my file to look at my truck. Post-It notes are hard, y‚Äôall. It was pretty clear to me they didn‚Äôt even know my truck was even there much less had done anything to it. It was still in the same spot I‚Äôd parked it, with just a bit more dirt. Mr. Cruz, the assistant manager, was very apologetic, and promised he‚Äôs have someone look at it, and he promised he‚Äôd let me know something by the next day.

If you are thinking he called the next day, you‚Äôd be wrong. After several voicemails, I had to drive back up there to talk to him. He said he hadn‚Äôt had anyone look at the truck, since there was now another truck talking my spot on the lift. He also said it was normal for them to take 2-3 weeks to do trans work on the bigger trucks. How one can get 5-7 days and 2-3 weeks confused is beyond me, but sometimes calendars can be tricky. When I asked why he couldn‚Äôt have just called to tell me that, he said he was busy. I then asked about a truck rental, as I had to haul a load of cattle that weekend. Robert asked what kind of trailer I had, and I told him gooseneck. He said he‚Äôd get me setup and to come back tomorrow. Come back the next day, nothing has been setup, so he calls Enterprise while I‚Äôm standing there. Off I go to Enterprise, only to be put in a 1500 with neither hitch. Ended up having to cancel my load.

Five days later, I get a call from Enterprise, saying South Point has cancelled my rental, and I need to bring it back. Called South Point, they still haven‚Äôt even looked at my truck, but yep, they‚Äôve pulled my rental. They did offer to put me in one of their vehicles, but at this point I wanted as little to do with South Point as possible. Another couple weeks go by, and after a couple more voicemails, they finally let me know they have my truck on the lift and are looking at it, but didn‚Äôt know exactly what was wrong.

Finally, April 21, they call to let me know it‚Äôs ready. YAY!!! So off I go to pick it up, they guy hands me my key, and walks off. Apparently no one thought it would be necessary to explain what was wrong, or any of that silly information. Still don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with my truck, other that it was a transmission issue. I‚Äôm not even sure calling back and trying to find out would get me anywhere; and I‚Äôm tired of wasting my time with this place. They are, by far, the worst mechanic experience I have ever had; and I‚Äôm used to being not taken seriously, being a woman. I don‚Äôt think my treatment in any way was due to my lack of a certain appendage, more of just they don‚Äôt have their poo together.
I can‚Äôt rate their quality of work, since no one bothered to tell me what they did. ",1.0

I told the salesperson, Chris Jackson, that I needed more for my car than they would offer but he assured me it would only take 5 minutes and I would be surprised. Despite knowing the car business well, I agreed. While I was there, Chris asked if he could run my credit and I said he could look it up without running it and he said okay. He ran it anyway.

73,"December 22, 2017","Found a car I really liked but looked online a little more and found the exact same car at a dealer in San Marcos for same price except 15k miles less and automatic transmission.  Took off work and drove down to San Marcos to look and called back to South Point Dodge Chrysler Jeep in Austin to see if they would beat the price.  They came down a reasonable amount so I turned down the San Marcos deal and drove back to Austin to buy the car from South Point Dodge Chrysler Jeep.  I was so sure of it I had my friend drop me off and told him to leave. When I walked in they told me that price was only if I financed through them at a higher interest rate.  We had already discussed that I would be taking care of my own financing and had a check in hand.  They said if you use your own financing we‚Äôll only sell it to you for the original sticker price.  I walked out.  Guess I showed my cards by letting them know I was ready to sign and let the sales guy witness me telling my friend to leave and drive away leaving me there when they were about to close.

I wasted a day off work, a trip to San Marcos and gave up a car I would have otherwise bought.  I was hoping to have a new car to drive out of town for Christmas.  Extremely disappointed.

They used old used car sales techniques - good buy, bad guy.  Salesperson (Brandon) left pretending to speak to his manager a couple of times.  At the end he said ‚Äúlet me see if they will talk to you before you leave‚Äù and came back and said something to the affect that ‚Äúthey are too spineless to tell you themselves‚Äù.  I have no proof that he didn‚Äôt speak to someone but I strongly suspect it was an act.  I thought this kind of old school sales stuff was ancient history.

Once I arrived they quickly got me into the finance office where the finance manager went over numbers with me.  I noticed an $1875.00 add on to the deal and I was told that if I wanted to buy the car at the advertised price online I had to pay the $1875.00 for additional add-ons.  I was told I was being charged for pinstripes, door edge guards and other various protections.  Funny thing is that the truck I looked at had no pin stripe and no door edge guards and the rest of the ""protections"" were supposed to be paint and fabric protections.  No way to tell if that was ever even applied.  When I said that I didn't want these services I was told then they would have to raise the price of the car by $1875.00, higher than what I was told and what was shown online.   I left the dealership after I realized the low online price was nothing more than a way to get you in the door so you can be up sold.  I was NEVER told about this add on prior to driving from another city to get there and there was no addendum on the vehicle itself to show anything was even added.

76,"October 17, 2017","My review is solely for the service department, I did not have any contact with other staff.

My wife lost both pairs of keys for her Jeep Cherokee (her fault) so we googled the closest Jeep dealer without reading the reviews (our fault). ¬†She called at 730am yesterday to double check that they had the car key that she needed. ¬†She spoke to Bubba (that's what the manager told us his name was) and Bubba assured her that they did have 1 key that would work for her car so she said great! ¬†

At 230pm we had her car towed to the dealership and gave him all of the information to drop it off for us. ¬†The tow truck guy dropped the car off in the back of the dealership and didn't give them any of our info (his fault). ¬†So far everybody has accepted responsibility for their mistakes/actions....that my friends is about to change, listen up.

My wife calls the dealership from her work a total of 7 times throughout the day to verify that her car is being taken care of. ¬†4 times nobody answers 3 times she gets 3 different receptionists that can't find her car in the system...ok tow guys fault.

I leave my job early to pick my wife up from work to go to the dealership in person to see what is going on since the phones don't seem to work that well. ¬†When we arrive we speak to Gale Tolson who is very friendly and assures us that we will get taken care of (he was nice) Gale hands us off to Robert Cruz (he had decent customer service but did not take responsibility for his actions) ¬†Mr. Cruz explained to us how the tow truck driver screwed up etc...and continued to explain how they don't actually have a key, it was sold to another customer even though Bubba told my wife that she could purchase it at 730am that day. ¬†I asked Robert what our options were...after going back and forth with him for a bit he said he could get a key from a different dealership in the morning, have everything installed and send the free shuttle to pick her up from work at noon.

Well Folks, you guessed it, that never happened and the dealer never called her, she called 4 times and finally got ahold of the shuttle driver who was never informed that she even needed a ride. ¬†Finally at 6pm ish she was picked up and taken to the dealer.

Long story short Robert made me several promises last night to mitigate the situation but apparently didn't tell any of his co-workers (his fault) and I didn't get it in writing (my fault). Jeff (a manager) told my wife to leave and never come back as he was calling the police.

I called Jeep customer service line and spoke to a very helpful representative who listened to my issue, called Jeff and said that she wrote down notes on the dealer....Unfortunately this dealer is a poor reflection on the Jeep brand. ¬†I feel sick to my stomach at the very low level of customer service and agree with the majority of reviewers that this dealership is sub-par and does not meet the standard of excellence that we as paying customers come to expect.

I think that the root of the problem with this dealership is a huge lack of communication, a number of employees who don't care and poor management. ¬†Compared to my last Jeep dealership who bend over backward to get you back on the road and who own up to their mistakes, this dealership is the polar opposite :( ",2.0

78,"September 17, 2017","Simple repairs under warranty isn't simple.  To add complexity to the problem, a major shake down on staff turnover, including the service manager.  Service advisors lied about certain repairs be completed; they weren't performed at all.  Service advisors did not keep in contact; always chasing them down.  Chasing down ANYONE in service is a challenge, including Service Manager, Assistant Service manager and service advisors.  When someone answers in service and ask to call you back; don't let them hang up because you will NOT receive a return call. You will have to chase them down again. 

I asked for an estimate on out of pocket repair costs from 1st day; by day 31, I had not received the FIRST initial estimate for any out of pocket cost not covered under warranty.

I was contacted on day 30 to pick up the vehicle; I insisted on taking the vehicle for a test drive prior to my acceptance.  The vehicle was NOT service ready.  In fact it had scratches on the vehicle door, grease on the exterior paint, and parts left over inside the vehicle.  Going through the list of repairs; 50% percent of the repairs still remained OPEN, not completed. One of repairs was identified as a do over as it failed quality check.

I met the director of Service; the one who fired over 20 staff personnel within the past 30 days and he was very passive and did not engage in any promises of expectations.  He was not apologetic, nor empathetic.  He shadowed the service advisor; waiting for me to ""blow up"" on them.  Patience ran very thin, however, remained calm and direct.

NBC has news segments covering the poor quality of Jeep and service. Jeep placed #20 out of 20 as the lowest rating in the industry. However, I had to experience it first hand to understand the impact. I will NOT make the same mistake of buying ANY BRAND of vehicle under this auto company. 

I would NOT recommend purchasing a Jeep vehicle ever.  Very pricey and IF you have to use service (which you will) then you might as well throw money into a grill, pour some gas on it and light it up.  It's very poor investment; one of which I am paying for Jeep's poor service and lack of disciplines to run a successful business.  If you have stocks, pull out before you lose everything. No wonder the whole auto company went bankrupt. 

I will NOT be a customer EVER again. And the dealership will soon answer questions to the Attorney General of Texas, Better Business Bureau, KXAN, KVUE and possibly the Local judicial system.

86,"June 14, 2017","Due to a very bad experience at South Point Dodge last year (described below) I said I would not ever darken the door of South Point Dodge again. After receiving and replying to a promotional email from Craig, the new GM, on Thursday May 25th, I explained that I would never darken their dealership doors again!  In my reply I also explained my previous experience with South Point Management.  

On Friday morning I received a email apologizing for my treatment from the previous management team and asking that I give him a call.  I did and he explained that I wasn't the only one who experienced that type of treatment and that the owner had recently cleaned house and brought in all new management and sales staff. He said he and his new team were trying to rebuild the dealership reputation.  He ask what it would take to make up for my issues with the previous management. I figured OK this guy is a car salesman and only wants to get me back in so he could haggle with me.  I figured I'm in the market for another truck so I played along.

I explained that I had been thinking about trading my 1+ year old 2WD RAM (purchased the same day as my previous experience but from another dealer) for a 2017 4WD RAM (almost lost my truck twice in the past year on slick boat ramps).  

Craig ask that I give him the VIN for my truck, pick out a truck from their online site, and send him the stock #, which I did.  The deal he came back with blew my socks off.  This was late Friday evening and Craig said to come by and pick up the truck, drive it all weekend, and if I liked it I could come in on Monday and sign the papers.  Now keep in mind the deal occurred over email and text without any haggling on my part.  I met Craig and several staff members when I went in on Monday and I could not believe the difference in attitude from my previous experience at South Point. Needless to say I drove away a happy customer with my new 4WD 2017 RAM Lone Star!!  My payments are within $15 of my old truck and the new truck had a sticker price of over $10K more than my old truck.

I would highly recommend South Point under the current management.  The people I dealt with were incredible.  

My previous experience (01/01/2016):

In January last year I had a deal for a 2016 RAM Lone Star on the table and approved by the New Car Sales Mgr. After the Sales Mgr. went to get final approval from the General Mgr. the GM came down and started shouting that I was trying to steal thousands of dollars from him. As I walked across the lobby to retrieve the keys to my old truck so I could leave.  The GM followed me and continued to berate me in front of other customers. If there was a problem with the deal the Sales Mgr. should not have approved the deal in the first place.   

I then drove to another dealer and made a deal on a new 2016 Ram Lone Star 2WD equipped just like the one I was going to buy from South Point and within a few dollars of the deal I walked away from at South Point.",5.0

Louis came to greet me and began to ask me about things on my credit and I told him me and ALDI discussed this already so I was confused on why we were going over this again.. he began to tell me that my credit has not been ran and that they were just now going to send my credit to the bank to get approval and at that moment I WAS LIVID!!! I asked him to get ALDI he went to get her and was gone for 20 mins and she never came!! TO SAY ANYTHING TO ME he came with more bad news that I needed a co signer and so fourth and so on and or a down payment this time with another manager I believe Mr Walton is his name he was also nice but It did not matter to me at this point!! all of this B.S because of Aldi lying and she not once came down to address her lies or to give me explanation... I could have went more into depth but I AM already tired of dealing with this company... BEWARE OF ALDI AND HER LIES SHE HIDES BEHIND HER EMPLOYEES AND WILL BUG U TO DEATH TILL YOU COME AND THEN SHE WONT EVEN DEAL WITH YOU AFTER THE FACT!!! I WILL NEVER DEAL WITH THIS COMPANY EVER  IN LIFE AND WHAT I AM MORE LIVID ABOUT MORE THAN ANYTHING IS THE FACT THAT I TOLD HER I DID NOT HAVE TIME I DID NOT TRUST DEALERSHIPS I DID NOT WANT MY TIME WASTED ETC... AND SHE DID EXACTLY WHAT I TOLD HER I WANTED TO STAY AWAY FROM!!! NEVER AGAIN AND IM SURE IF THE DEAL HAD OF WENT THRU IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE LIES!!!

95,"February 15, 2017","Sales staff and the customer service reps are by far the most unresponsive and unprofessional I have ever experienced. Don't walk out side if there is water on the ground. Service was driving vehicles at a pretty high rate for speed for a lot and where hitting the puddles and managed to get water all over me.   I walked around out front for quite some time waiting for sales and not even one person walked up to me and said hello. I don't think they are that busy considering the parking lot was empty.

97,"October 31, 2016",When you go in their everyone is quick to help you and get you the loan for the car of your dreams.  Once the loan is supposedly approve you go to the finance dept. and do all the paperwork.  You leave and two weeks later they call you to tell you that the loan didn't go through and that you need to come and redo paperwork with a higher payment.   When you ask why it took them so long they just say well the bank rejected it and they expect you to sign everything again and they don‚Äôt want you to ask any question.  When you challenge what they tell you they get upset and act like you are causing them issues‚Ä¶ If they would have done their job right I would have to go and waste my time again with them.  Of course by the time we go again they all have attitudes and aren‚Äôt friendly any more‚Ä¶. I have bought about 10 new cars in my life time and have never gone through unprofessional like this‚Ä¶.

98,"October 28, 2016","My 2009 Jeep Wrangler was making a squealing noise coming from the rear axle or brakes. I took it in to get the squeal diagnosed. As long as it was going to be in I requested to change the oil and rotate tires and to please let me know what was causing the loud squealing.  Later they call that my Jeep is ready. They did the oil change and tire rotation but rear end still squealing. Service writer says, ""its nothing its just dust on the brakes""  Well after a few weeks I decided to find a real mechanic and he showed me the brake rotors needed to be replaced. The correct work is done and no more squealing. They need to get someone older than 23 or at least more knowledgeable about auto mechanic. Why would they leave me to drive off with an 85 decibel squealing axle. If they had fixed it I would be going back. NEVER again. I've BEEN GOING THERE SINCE 2009 WHEN I BOUGHT MY VEHICLE THERE AND THEY DO GIVE YOU A GOOD SALES PRICE, BUT DON'T GO BACK FOR SERVICE.

101,"October 08, 2016","I visited this dealership looking for a Jeep Grand Cherokee but was out of my price range. The next day I called the sales agent for pricing on a Jeep Cherokee with all the features I wanted. I specifically listed every feature that was a deal killer if the car did not have it. They told me they had exactly what I was looking for. The manager called me to tell me the price. He was very vague about the price and would not give me an exact walk-out price, however He did say it had all the features o wanted and the walk out price would be under $35,000 but he's work out the exact amount when I'm there. I drove all the way to south Austin expecting to take home my new SUV. When I got there, I had to wait 30 mins just for them to get the car. While test driving it, I determined it did not have all the features I wanted. I asked the sales guy ""Why am I here? Why did your manager have me come all the way to South Austin if this isn't what I asked for??"" The sales guy told me to wait in his office while he called his manager. I waited another 25 mins for the manager (by this point, I've missed my friends baby shower in North Austin, which they knew about and still asked me to come in When they didn't have what I wanted.) Then the manager finally came in the office and had the nerve to tell me that I had 2 options, I either needed to increase my price to get everything I wanted or I needed to give up certain options. ... I could not believe he had the NERVE to Waste my time by telling me they had what I wanted for the price I wanted, make me wait a very long time just to see the car, miss the baby shower I told them I was going to, all for a sales pitch for a car I didn't want. I will never go back to this dealer again. I highly suggest you don't waste your time either!",1.0

103,"October 05, 2016","Go to Covert Dodge and talk to Charles Black! They are much better people then South Point Dodge....here is why!


I saw an advertisement on Google for $18,000 off Ram Lone Stars. I called and asked the gentleman that answered the phone if the deal was going on. He said yes so I drove 45 min to meet with a young lady and she assured me the deal was going on. I sit with her and go over all my needs as far as payments and all that. I tell her what my max payment needs to be. I explained to her to please not waste my time because they are not going to push me into something I know I can't afford. She explained that she wanted to get my payment amounts to make sure she doesn't show me something I can not afford. Fair enough I thought. Then the typical sales stuff starts of going back and forth...she leaves and comes back and says No it's not going on for the $18,000 but we have another deal on for $16,000 off this ONE truck. I was confused on why I have the screen shot of the advertisement for $18,000 from 2 hours before was not going on. She said it ended yesterday. Well, I have the advertisement from Today and 2 employees already said it was going on. Now all of a sudden its not and its $2000 dollars less? She didn't really have a response. She explained to me that she and another person in the back worked the numbers with the payment I could afford and said they could give me a good deal that fit into my payment on this ONE truck. I decided I wasn't going to fight it. She showed me the truck. She explained to me that it was $16,000 off the $36,000 dollar price. I liked the truck, even though it was not the I went there to get, and decided to go with it. We go through more stuff and she asked me to fill out a credit app. I didn't want to at first cause I wanted to make sure everything as she said was accurate. She reassured that everything was good. I went over the price with her several times and she made me feel comfortable that I was getting a good deal. So I filled out the credit app and they run my credit, which I have a good credit score, and she comes back with a paper that shows my payments on the truck. WTH ...now the truck has jumped up $11,000 dollars!! Making my payments double!!! She didn't really have an answer for me and sends someone else over. I can't remember his name but I am assuming it was a manager. He explained she made a mistake and was sorry. He showed me how all of a sudden the numbers changed. Some how on his paper the value of the truck went from $42,000 to $47,000! Come on really!!!! Its not a fancy truck and with no leather no extras but a back up camera.  I have spent several hours in here and delt with 3 different of your employees and all 3 don't know what the heck they are doing around there!?! He showed no concern about my experience with South Point Dodge. He didn't care at all that they have false advertisement and that the employees there don't know what they are talking about! I was extremely disappointed in my experience with them. He wouldn't even meet me half way on the price even though THEY made the mistake and more then ONE mistake involving 3 employees. I know how car sales go, but dang people. You have 4 people working for your company that either don't care about your reputation, don't care about the customer, don't know what they are talking about, and just waste your time for HOURS!!!. I know they were probably hoping I would give in and buy it at that price but seriously $11,000 more!! I did not come in there trying get something for nothing. This was y'alls advertisement on Google and they the words from YOUR employees. I came in there with every intention of buying a new truck I was not there just tire kicking. Its unfortunate you have people like that working for you and that you would lose a sale because of their lies and decent and your false advertisement. I really hope no one else goes through what I went through with this company. I am still in search of the truck I want and I met Charles Black at Covert Dodge and he has been AMAZING so far! He is kind, and listens to my needs and not one time pushed me around or tried to sell me something I can't afford. Stay away from South Point Dodge.",1.4

I test drove the car and Amanda went over all the options it had. It was nice to have a sales rep that knew everything about the car I was test-driving. I went back to the dealership negotiated a little and signed papers and was out of there in 2hr.

117,"September 23, 2016","First and foremost, I am not a vengeful person. I never leave bad reviews, but I honestly feel like I have a duty to share my experience with South Point so it might help someone else avoid the utter drama I went through. 

I bring my car in (while it‚Äôs running fine) because every few months the car battery dies and I figure there is a slow battery leak occurring via a wire connecting the alternator with the battery. The service tech seems great a first, tells me they might be able to diagnose it the next day. Fast forward a week and the car is finally looked at. Keep in mind though, communication is horrendous. My service tech often seemed impatient, aggravated and annoyed. He tells me it‚Äôs the battery wire harness and that it will be $670 to fix, which I don‚Äôt dispute because I knew taking it to the dealer would be expensive.

Well, when I am due to pick it up, the service tech tells me the battery light is now on and my battery is faulty and needs to be replaced. This alarms me because I JUST replaced the battery two months ago and it‚Äôs under warranty, so I call AAA to come out to South Point and replace the battery for free. I am told once the battery is replaced, I should be able to take the car home. They seem certain this is the only remaining issue. As my AAA agent is replacing the battery, he brings me over and shows me that a part of my air filter cartridge is broken and a clamp on the side is missing. This was a clean break that must have JUST occurred. He stresses that I tell the service center and have them replace it for free since they must have just broken it while repairing the vehicle (the part itself was not broken before I took it to South Point). Anyways, I put that issue to the side for the moment. Even after the battery has been changed by AAA the battery light is STILL on. And the car starts dying. After leaving South Point without my car, my service tech calls and tells me they overlooked something (a wire) that was causing the battery light to come on again and the car to smoke up. They ‚Äòfix it‚Äô a few hours later. I tell them about the broken air filter cartridge, and they blame it on the AAA agent. Refuse to fix it.

I spent $40 that day just getting to and from the dealer on a ride sharing app, missed lunch, had to deal with grumpy unaccommodating service tech, only for them to tell me they need more time to fix it because this wire was ‚Äòoverlooked‚Äô. The LEAST they could have done was reimburse me for the $40 I spent that day on rides to get there- taking it off my final bill. I spoke politely with the service tech to express how unsatisfactory the entire experience was. Does he offer any apology, small discount, anything? No. Simply blames previous mechanics who worked on the car for the ‚Äòshotty‚Äô work they did. 

Here‚Äôs the cherry on top. I pick up my car, pay the full amount, and it‚Äôs not starting properly. This has NEVER happened before, it was now chugging to start. I knew something else was now wrong. I was so upset at that point that the thought of arguing or leaving my car there another day was too painful, so I left and took my car to another more reputable mechanic and sure enough, there was another issue that needed to be fixed.

Please, please, please, do yourself a massive favor and avoid this service department. The lack of accountability, customer service, communication, actual maintenance... it's alarming and unlike anything I've experienced before. I should have read the reviews, and I take blame for that. ",1.0

As we negotiated on price I made a few concessions on the used vehicle that I wanted fixed and they agreed!  While I was away, I called every two day to make sure they were getting the deal done on minor repairs we had talked about and signed off on!  I even put 1000.00 dollars down the day we made the deal!  So this is where it goes bad... I call in the middle of the week to make sure everyone is doing their job in getting this jeep ready for me to pick up on a Monday when I get back!  Was told three times, we can't sell you the jeep, it has a recall...... I asked then why can't we fix the recall and move forward? Got a call two days later and was told well the part could take 8 weeks to a year maybe to get the parts from Chrysler!!!!!  I was now re thinking my time waisted at this dealership!  Should have went to Benny Boyd!  General manager there is worth a million bucks!  They just didn't have what I was looking for...all of this was a bunch of crap!  They told me the recall for the airbag was the reason they couldn't sell the jeep And it was grounded!  So I called Chrysler and other dealerships to ask in fact was this true?  Chrysler and the other dealerships said they had never had heard of such a thing!   In my opinion I worked a good deal that day with some of their inexperienced sales people and by the end of the day the general manager saw the numbers and that they were losing money on the deal and used the ( airbag can't sell deal) so I would walk away!   I filed a complaint with Chrysler corp. about all of this !  I Coles the deal 14 days later!  Day after I brought the jeep home, ( get this)  the GENERAL MANAGER CALLS ME AND SAYS I WOULD LIKE YOU TO BRING THE JEEP BACK!  I want you to be happy ha says!  Then he explained to me I got a REAL GOOD DEAL!  Then he said ""you know we could sell that jeep for a
whole lot more Money!""  Are you kidding me?  That's what all of my 14 days of dealing with this sorry excuse for a dealership WAS ABOUT!  It was a good deal for me, not them!  They made a sales deal that they ""supposedly lost money on"" and treated  me like crap.  Told me they couldn't sell me the jeep because of a factory recall?

148,"July 22, 2016",On Saturday July 16 as my daughter was backing out of the HEB parking lot her 2013 Dodge Dart with 60900 miles on it decided to go into reverse but after that it  did nothing you could move the gear shift but nothing happened. It stayed in reverse the key would not even pull out.The only thing we thought could be done was have it towed to South point Dodge. BAD MISTAKE IT HAS NOW BEEN A WEEK AND THEY TELL HER SHE DID NOT HAVE AN APPOINTMENT SO THEY HAVE NOT EVEN LOOKED AT IT TO TELL HER ANYTHING. HER DAD AND I ALWAYS SAID DODGES ARE A HORRIBLE CHOICE OF A CAR TO BUY. YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT DON'T BUY ONE AND RUN FROM SOUTH POINT DODGES AS FAST AS YOU CAN. I HAVE A KIA FORTE WITH 60000 MILES ON IT THE EXTENDED WARRENTY IS 100000 HERS RAN OUT AT 60000 SAME COST SO 900 MILES  OVER AND SHE CAN'T EVEN GET A SERIVCE TECH TO LOOKED AT IT PAYING CASH.

149,"July 21, 2016","The only reason I gave a star is because you can't leave zero!  My salesman Scott Gilmore was a complete idiot!  I was told I would be getting a $500 visa card for buying a jeep from them and when it came time to hash out the numbers I then asked them to just throw that $500 towards my down payment. I was told that because I didn't buy  jeep off their lot I wouldn't be getting the $500 Visa. I was never told of any stipulations. Finally we agree on a Jeep(that i did all the leg work for) that required dealer trade.  So I'm about to sign papers and my salesman tells me that the jeep we agreed on was sold week prior.  Now I knew it wasn't sold because I asked for the invoice day prior.  So they ask me what features I want on my jeep they have to find. I told them everything thats on the jeep we agreed upon is what I want, and if there's extra features you'll need to eat the loss. So after 7 hours of going in circles, I leave with a loaner jeep.  I get a call 48 hours later that my jeep is in.  I go in and my first question to my salesman was ""where did you get it?""  He tells me it's the exact jeep I wanted from the original dealership.  I then ask if they swapped my prior plate as I was registering out of state. He looks at me and says I don't know. How can you not know? It was something I asked you to do and yet he drops the ball AGAIN!!! I ask for a copy of my papers I signed and we go get them from the finance guy. I asked the finance guy about my plate transfer and was told he would take care of it.  So my salesman heads outside and takes a picture to email the finance guy my plate info.  While he was out there I was telling the finance guy this whole process was #$^* and completely uncalled for.  Oh and the finance guy, Joel wasn't any better.  He said I could call if there were any questions.  I call the guy and no answer.  I called at least 15 times throughout the week and still no answer.  So I make one last phone call and ask for the title and registration department.  I asked if they had everything needed for me to swap my plates off my trade-in.  Lauren, very nice and helpful took care of me and got everything situated, well will see come August.  I mention to her that I had the worst time buying a car from there and wanted to speak with the manager.  Almost 2 weeks later he calls and I tell him EVERYTHING! I was asked what can they do to make up for un called for service i endured.  I said give me the $500 Visa.  he couldn't spit out NO! fast enough because that deal ended end of June.  

Bottom line, AVOID South Point Dodge at all costs!!! 
You'll thank me later.",1.6
150,"July 06, 2016","My car overheated so I had it towed to South Point Dodge - it was towed in on Monday night.  First thing Tuesday morning, (7:00 am) I called and they could not find my car - said it was not there.  I called other dealerships thinking AAA had made a mistake but they did not have my vehicle either.  I called back to South Point and ask them if they had found it and they said no.  I finally reached Marta who got up out of her chair and went outside to look - she called back and said yes the car was there.  It was now approximately 10:00 am.  I waited all day and no one called - I called back at 3:00 pm and left messages to no avail.  Left voice mail for service and for the service manager - no call back.  Finally called and asked the receptionist what I could do to get a call back and she said she would personally ask the service manager to call me.  He did call me and was quite rude - told me they have over 200 vehicles on the lot for service and that people make an appointment 2 weeks in advance to have their car serviced.  It appeared he thought he was doing me a favor.  At this point no one had even looked at my vehicle so Tuesday as lost for repairs.  I rented a car and hoped for the best on Wednesday.  
Wednesday Morning, the service manager called to say they had replaced a hose the car held pressure over night and once they test drove it, I could pick it up.  Ten minutes later the phone rang and it was a service rep telling me that both of my fans had shattered  and one had put a hole in my radiator.  The car needed two fans, one radiator, a thermostat and then whatever else they found when they brought it back up and running.  Length of time for this - at least a day.

It is now Thursday and they called around 3:00 pm to say the car was ready - however, I was in a meeting and could not make it to the dealership by 6:00 pm.  

It is now Friday and I went to pick up my car - it took 45 minutes once I paid the $1700 bill for them to bring the car around - there was no service person to explain the work.  I determined that day that this was my last visit.  If I am going to do a favor for someone, I will pick someone else to offer my $1700 to.  

And, the top of the cake is that I received a call today from South Point Dodge asking me if I was in the market for a new car?  Really?  Of course the answer was only from South Point when xxxx freezes over - do they not even keep records of who they have provided unsatisfactory service to so they do not call them to sell them a car.

152,"May 02, 2016","Took my 2012 Ram Cummins 4x4 in for two warranty leaks and was told it would be three weeks until someone could look at it so i made an appointment. I waited the time and took the vehicle to them when they requested me to do so per our appointment. Upon arrival i was greeted 10 minutes later by someone with an iPad who didn't know anything about cars, couldn't type in basic complaints/ repair info and was disconnected from reality. He tried to get plugged in to my OBD2 connection which i declined as my truck i rigged how i want it. He didn't know how to enter my information manually and told me he couldn't help me unless he plugged in!! I refused to allow this because my OBD2 is already used and he doesn't need to plug in to get my VIN and there were no hard or soft codes on the truck. I then waited about 10 more minutes for a gentlemen named Thomas i believe to come out and help me. He too was rude, incompetent and took 5 minutes to try and write down my 4 basic squawks which were: front drive shaft pinion seal leaks (again and Southpoint did previous repairs), front timing cover (front main) leaking oil, lube front drive shaft and get rid of belt bearing squeaking. I feel as if this is pretty clear and easy to write down considering i diagnosed the vehicle for you. Simply confirm it, fix it on time, communicate decently and i am a happy customer who would be back in the future. After dropping off on 4/26/16 (3 weeks after waiting for appointment) i get a call from Thomas saying they aren't going to warranty my vehicle even though it is under warranty blaming an exhaust system and intake on an oil leak (wrong and illegal). I call Gale the service manager who is a man of few words; says he will look into it and calls me back with info. He calls back in a reasonable time and says, Thomas was wrong we will cover it and you will be done in a day or two max. On 4/31/16 i follow up and am told the truck is almost done by Thomas and should be done tomorrow (5/1/16). 5/1/16 comes around and nothing so i follow up and he tells me it is almost done and they will have it back to me before the weekend. Weekend comes and nothing. i follow up Monday and Thomas says, ""nobody called you? They were supposed to call you"". I tell him no and he knows nothing about my vehicle. At this point i am tired of dealing with incompetent, unethical and low integrity employees so i tell him i am coming up there to check on the truck and settle this in person. Thomas pauses and says, ""let me go check on it"" puts me on hold and returns to tell me, ""we are working on it"". Now lets get this straight, i have heard the same thing numerous times so i know he is full of it. He then tells me after i probe him on the truth that they they really haven't even started on it and it is now 6 days of nothing. He blames the tech and says he is slow and behind and that he is just a messenger. Hmmm, why don't you walk outside and check in it yourself before making stuff up? It is only 100 yards to the back of the shop. I request a loaner be delivered about 9 am on 5/2/16 to my work and he said he can't until the afternoon. Really Thomas? You are doing pretty well so far and have made every mistake imaginable. I request a manager in which he says he is busy (mgr Gale never calls me back despite numerous requests to Thomas for a manager to call me). I am guessing Thomas is so bad at his job this isn't the first time and he didn't request a call from Gale on my behalf as requested. About 1:50 PM they finally show up with a new 2015 Ram 1500 that is a dirty, soiled loaner with paper tags on it. I am thinking wow is this how you keep your new cars? As of day 6, no legitimate updates, no communication and nothing but lies and more lies. Tell the client what they want to hear and deal with the rest later.  I am sure the owner will make a blanket statement for me to call up there to sort it out but why? I have called up there for 6 days and your team is uninformed and blame each other. I just want my truck back, fixed properly by a company who communicates and has integrity. ",1.0

154,"March 23, 2016","This place is the home of bait and switch tactics. At all costs avoid salesperson Alton. He is without one
of the lowest forms of humans I have met in sometime. First experience I called the dealership and spoke to Jennifer. I explained to her what car we wanted to see. This was after they sent us a guarantee of trade in amount. She said the car we wanted was there. I did not see it on the website so I called back and asked again she said yes it was there so my wife and I went there under those circumstances. We met John a very amiable fellow. I asked to see the car when my wife showed up. I guess we sold it
last weekend. Because we were still interested he showed us other vehicles. We then met Alton and he said that i will make you a deal to earn your business. Long story short they sold us a manual transmission of the automatic that we originally wanted. I said well what the great deal you will be making us. Well as it turns out he sold us a car that was on his internet for 500.00 over the price. I asked him because I had a phone to look this up. His response was oh that car had 8000 miles on it. Really I said then why is it on your new inventory list? Please show me a record of this vehicle I asked John where it shows the milage? Well no records to be found. I almost forgot my wife was interested in a 2015 challenger except the color was blue..Alton said he would make me a special deal if we could overcome the color...my wife was set on black. Fast forward next day I look up vehicle and they are showing 4 challengers for the same price which was $500.00 Less than what we payed for. My wife and I decided that we made a error in judgement do the manual transmission and the automatic that we were originally led to believe was there. We decided that we would see if we could swap vehicles now this is just 1 1/2 days after our purchase. We met John and explained to him the situation at 9:OOam. He said the gm would not be into 11:30 am so we would need to come back then. We came back met Alton and John and they said they were working on it to be patient that the G.M. was there and working to make us happy. Approximately 1 1/2 hours later they return we are going to take care of you. It will only be $4,500 dollars more for a car they were going to sell us two days before for 33,000
now it is 40,000. At this point I am now getting pissed off. So I decide to talk directly the the G.m.. I walk to the office where there is about 7 guys sitting around. I ask for the G.m. Oh he is not here today.
Now I am just plain incensed. I explain to the head lackey this whole situation and try to be reasonable and he says no one put a gun to your head to sign the contract. He said they lost 3,500 dollars on our deal and the new one they would lose 6500. He was not going to do that. I said if you lost $3500 dollars on our original deal then just give us our car back that way you would not lose anything right? Oh we can't do that ........Does any of this make since so I told them what I thought of them in no uncertain terms....We have purchased 59 cars in our lifetime never have I ever been more mad with a dealership than this one. I will write the attorney General a complaint soon. For all those out there considering purchasing from South Point Dodge  watch our for Bait and Switch tactics and do not ever and I mean ever Deal with a guy Named Alton!

160,"November 19, 2015","Right now, I feel duped again.  The day after I put my complaint on the site, I received an e mail from Jessica Wuench.  She told me she wanted to make me happy, and she was going to have someone contact me.  She put Jared on the case.  He asked me what I wanted.  I told him I knew the car was no longer under warranty, but I believed because I had come in several times priour to the warranty expiring (three to be exact) they should just repair it at no cost to me and they should also put me in a rental car for free while it was being repaired.  That is what would have happened had they not just tucked the rubber back in the trunk and been done with it.  I was told by Jessica that Jared would handle it my problems.   Jared set it up with the manager, a guy named Jay, but no one told me that Jared was no longer going to be there when I took my car on November, 2, 2015.  I talked to him on October 26, 2015.  He spoke with me, and then he called me back after speaking with the service manager and then he left either the company or the location, so when I went into the dealership on November 2, 2015, no on knew anything.  What he said to me on the 26th was that the car would be repaired with NO cost to me nor would I be charged for the rental car.  (Three other people heard him say this.  One is a Catholic nun.)   I spoke to Jessica, and she told me Jared had been transferred to a different property, and then Jay called me.  He told me the guys would be able to tell what was to be done when I came in so that all they had to do was to stick some instrument somewhere under the dashboard and they would get me in a rental and I would go off.  I was going to return to the dealership on November 9, 2015.  I had a window between my first job and my second job.  However no one explained that we had to go down the road to Enterprise to get the rental, so after fooling around not having the information, they explained the Enterprise trip to me.  Well, guess what.  Now I don't have time to get the rental car.  I left, called the service manager and Jessica, and ya'll were supposed to have the guys on top of it on Monday, November 16, 2015 when I would again return.  I did, and I sat there for 20 minutes before they could understand what was going on.  I kept telling them to call the service manager.  Alan finally said he was going to take care of me himself.  I finally got the car, and then surprise, surprise, surprise, Alan called me that afternoon about 5:30 to tell me that it was going to cost me about $450.00 to get the car fixed.  I told him not no but xxxx no.  This was supposed to be on your head.  (company)  He was to get back to me in less than an hour after talking to service manager.  It was about 1:00 p.m.  the 17th before I heard back from them.   He told me because the car was out of warranty, they would not do it free, but they would do it for half price.  Well, if you had repaired the car when I brought it in three, five and seven months after after I purchased it, it would have been repaired, but they kept sticking the rubber piece back in there, and guess what, that did not fix it.    I have had chemo, and I am still doing some post chemo things, and I have not not missed a single day of work, and I have not had the energy to deal with the ineptness of your people.  One time I sat there in the driveway for 30 minutes with the Sister Kathleen in the car with me, and she was quite disturbed with the failure of the people to do nothing more than stick the gasket back in.  I want to make it clear that I never got out of the driveway there with the car when I took it in the first 8 months of its life.  They just kept putting the strip in and telling it was repaired.  If it is repaired, why is it the still leaking.  I asked that one time, and they told me they were the experts.  

When I talked to Jessica yesterday, she told me that the company had changed hands once again, Jared was not there any longer, and they offered what best they could.  LIES!  I started working on this prior to Jared's leaving.  Jessica was involved, and she could have done something.  LIES!  MORE LIES!  
I retrieved my car, still broken trunk.    Jared lied to me as their  representative.  Jessica lied to me as their representative.  She wanted to make this right.  Well, it is not right.   Ya'll once again have lied to me.

Bottom line is they have horrible customer service, they are only looking for their own gain and they lie. Save a headache and don't shop here. From my understanding they are under new management, but the 2 people whom we talked to are still there so you cant break a person from their habits. Trust me, read the reviews and decide for your self. We were establishing our credit and we basically went in blind and they saw that. I'm desperately trying to trade in this vehicle and I went to George to try to do so and he lied to me just like John D when we first bought the car like we were getting a ""great"" deal.  I finally expressed my hatered to the general manager (nice guy by the way) and he apologized for the poor salesman ship and the way my husband and I were treated.

1. I was given the complete run around, pressured into financing with them - even though I said I wanted to stay with USAA. I said sure, hey, if you can beat their rate, I'll consider it.
2. I was told my credit WOULD NOT be hit - and that it was a soft credit check. 30 minutes later, I got an email notifying me that my credit had a hard pull. Took it down 10 points. When I brought it up, the sales guy said ""oh. that shouldn't have happened."" Instead of asking how they could help or remedy the situation.
3. Was shown a car that was well over my budget - even after expressing I did not want to see a car over my budget. I pointed at the price, and he insisted it was in my budget. I was then told ""You need to buy this car now because someone else is trying to buy it right now!"" - at $5K over my firm budget. 
4. Was then given an offer for a different car, but was told "" I NEEDED to finance with them"" in order to get that deal. Then, when I questioned the rate, it was 5%...""Because I was a first time car buyer"".... which was 3% higher than I was getting with USAA. 
5. Then when I said no, they denied that they said I needed to finance with them. EVEN though it was written on the paper, circled in bright green marker ""must finance with us""
6. ""I'm the most honest sales guy you will ever meet"" - that should have been my red flag.

I walked out, emotionally drained, and BEYOND furious. I can't believe I wasted my time. 3 hours of my life I will never get back.

169,"February 18, 2015","The service department is incompetent to say the least. I made an appointment to have a safety recall corrected, I showed up on time and began to wait as the recall stated the work would take about 30 minutes. 2 hours later I asked about the progress and was told they hadn't even started yet. It took them the better part of another hour for them to bring me my vehicle (without completing the work) and I left. I called a few days later to schedule another appointment to get the safety recall addressed. I spoke with the service manager and explained my previous experience. This time I dropped the vehicle off and took their shuttle, several hours later they called saying it was ready and the shuttle was on the way to pick me up, over an hour later I called to see why the shuttle hadn't picked me up yet and was told it was on the way. About 30 minutes later my jeep was dropped off at my house (which I thought was a nice touch) but not all of the work had been completed. I call the service manager again and he explained that they would have to order a part. This wasn't a big deal but I didn't like the lack of communication. About 30 days later I get a text from the dealership asking about my service experience so I explained my issues and asked about this part I have been waiting for. He looked into it and found that the part had arrived some time ago but they had failed to notify me. I made an appointment that week for early AM and was very clear when I asked that I get in and out ASAP. I was there for nearly two hours. Do yourself a favor and drive to another dealership, even if it's in another city. ",2.0

She was so excited about her jeep, she suggested I trade in my 2006 jeep for a new Willys as well. We went together and had my 2006 appraised and worked on an awesome deal with Mike Broderick. Both transactions went very smooth. In addition to meeting Mike and Justin, we met most of the management team that treated us very well and made us feel very comfortable. We would especially like to thank Josh Walters for all of his efforts and his great listening skills...he really made the 2nd jeep purchase happen, and we are very grateful that we met Josh. Everyone listened to our needs and worked with us on the price of both vehicles. We have purchased a few new cars over the years and have never had such an enjoyable experience.

174,"October 22, 2014",I bought my second car in 2 weeks from south point. I wanted a 2014 ram lone star with a trade that had 6k negative equity. Nyle maxwell told me 15% and 780 a month they said with my credit there wasn't anyway to get it lowered. Went to south point and got an 8.3 interest rate and more then 100 a month cheaper with gap and extended warranty. Second car my wife and I took a terrible deal from drive time because we didn't know we could do better. Long story short went to clay Cooley and they tried to convince me giving my car back to drive time and buying one from them wouldn't hurt my credit but actually help. What kind of dealer sells bs like that to their customers also said there wasn't any bank or dealer that could get me out of the negative debt. So we went back to south point between James mike john and javin. We walked out with a better deal then we could have ever expected. It's Unbelievable the work mike Broderick ( sales man) James (finance guy) and John (finance guy) can do. They can get it done. The bottom line in my experience is clay Cooley is slimy. Nyle maxwell is a joke. South point will get it done!!,5.0

Since I needed to get my tire plugged because I could see a nail, I figured they could change the blinker as well. After calling a day ahead to make sure they could fix my car (which would probably take 10 minutes), they told me to come in the next day. I went in at 8am and was told they would have my car ready by noon. I knew my two items took no time, but understood those were there first. After calling to check at 11am, I was told my car was with the technician so I headed over to the dealership. I had to wait another hour and fifteen minutes before I saw the service manager. By this time, it was past the time I needed my car. It took them another 20 minutes to get my car after I stated that I wanted it now. In the end, my car was at the dealership for almost 5 hours with NOTHING done to it (even though it supposedly was with the technician for the last 1 1/2 hours).

I brought a brand new car off the lot in Nov, I was told that my plates would be sent to me and they never were, I had to pick them up and put them on myself.... I was told that they would send me the spare key to my brand new car and they never did. It is now June and I don't have an extra key to my 2012 Jeep.

Before going I called and e-mailed on a Thursday and was promised that they would have a Crossfire for me to look at when I arrived on Friday. When I arrived they didn't have any but asked me to hang tight and they would get one ASAP.

I waited a few hours until they told me they couldn't get it, but it was a black convertible and they would have it that evening if I could return. I couldn't return due to work so they PROMISED me that if I came back on Monday, they would have several for me to look at and decide between. When my wife and I returned on Monday they still had NO CROSSFIRES, and no idea when they would have any, including the black one the told me about. They did have a red one traded in on that Saturday but it wouldn't be ready for display until that evening, and it wasn't the style of Crossfire I was looking for any ways.

My wife and I sat there looking at each other in amazement. Did these people not want our business? We had several thousand dollars ready to put down right then and get our Crossfire, and they were telling us they couldn't help us, after PROMISING to do so several times! They even had a finance manager tell us we were clear and ready to go paper work wise once they got the car in, yet still made NO EFFORT to get a Crossfire for us.

191,"March 23, 2011","My Jeep would not start so it was towed to SouthPoint Dodge on Feb 18th. 2011,  and now,  $1400 and one month later , it still is not fixed and this has been a complete utter waste of time and money. This situation has been outrageous. Their so-called technicians were guessing the entire time, first saying the P.C.M. computer was bad, then after replacing that didn't work, they blame it on another computer module and then a third (B.C.M. computer). After replacing each module did not repair my Jeep, they try to find another potential problem so there would be more charges added to my bill. After a month, they still wanted another 2 weeks to diagnose the problem. They have had way more than enough time, and my patience is gone and there is no way I am letting them charge me more money for repairs that failed to fix my vehicle. So I had my Jeep towed away on March 18th. The auto repair shop that I took my Jeep to was able to fix it in 2 days, and my Jeep was starting like new again. The problem turned out just to be the ignition switch and crank sensor. These parts cost me only $100. This was unbelievable, South Point Dodge dealership could not diagnose common and simple car starting problems like the iginition switch? But they had to keep blaming it on expensive repairs and wasted so much of my time.

       And in addition, the employees are rude, atrocious customer service. and the manager of the service department, kept saying they are working on it (when they are not). At one point he said 6 people are working on my Jeep. Just more lies. He even told me it be ready when its ready. They even had to call Chrysler support for help b/c they did not have a single competent mechanic with the expertise to figure out this basic car problem. I have filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and South Point Dodge has not responded to their request, which is just more proof of the type of business they are running. 
        SO BEWARE, do not give these lying crooks any business, not even an oil change. They will either not know what they are doing or will keep lying to you to try to run up the bill so they will make as much money as possible.
