9,"May 26, 2020","My daughter is a young active-duty service member, stationed at Fort Bliss.  In early April, she and her young active-duty boyfriend went into the dealership to look at a used Kia that she had seen listed online.  When she arrived at the dealership, she was helped by a salesperson named Travis - after looking online, I'm going to assume that this is Travis York.  Travis informed my daughter that the vehicle she was looking for was no longer available, but he had an almost identical vehicle for sale at his home.  My daughter and her boyfriend went to Travis's home where a Kia was parked.  My daughter and her boyfriend were then told that this was not actually Travis's car.  It actually belonged to a third-party and Travis was just brokering the deal.  Both parties came to an agreement on price after both Travis and the seller assured my daughter that the car was in good order, no issues, one owner, etc.  My daughter secured her financing, and Travis scheduled her to come back to the dealership to do the paperwork for the sale.
A month after taking possession of the vehicle, the car began showing severe issues.  The car was taken to the service department at the Kia dealership, and was told that not only had this car been in a pretty severe wreck, but the engine was not correctly repaired, and additional damage was inside.  
My daughter went back to the dealership and was told by the sales manager, (I'm not sure which one,) that Shamalay Ford was not responsible because they didn't sell the vehicle.  
My questions begin with - Why does Shamalay Ford allow it's salespeople to make side deals instead of showing the customer other options at the dealership?
Since the salesperson offered the vehicle at the dealership and had the paperwork done at the dealership, why would this not be a dealership deal? 
Is Shamalay Ford encouraging it's salespeople to not sell piece of crap cars through the dealership so they don't have to pay for the repairs?
Why would Shamalay Ford tout it's love for the military, while taking advantage of young active-duty service members?
I know that this is a long post, but I hope this will stand as a warning to others.",1.0
10,"February 04, 2020","Went to look at a used vehicle with the salesman Sall Hernandez during my lunch break. After the quick test drive, I got a call to head back to work for a last minute task. Which everyone who has served in the military knows all too well. I told Sall that I wanted the vehicle and explained my situation being in the military and made my offer as I left to head into work. He said no problem and he would be in contact with me. 

Sall comes back with a counter offer and I counter again over text messages after I left the dealership. Then, no communication from Sall and this “military friendly dealership”. I then reach out to see after a couple of hours passed. I had to prod him, since he was obviously not interested in my business. We exchange a few texts and agree to a price. A true handshake deal.

I was excited and called my bank to get a loan, which I was holding off on doing until I had a deal due to the credit hit of setting up a loan. Immediately after this, I get another short suspense task which prevents me from going down and completing the deal. I then call Sall and tell him this, and that I’m willing to put my down payment now over the phone to secure the vehicle. He then tells me if I can’t get there now, that another customer has an appointment to look at the vehicle. I then explain my frustration of setting up a loan and the effect on my credit, but he doesn’t care. The dealership doesn’t care.

I then have to again reach out to Sall Hernandez to get any response. Even though he said he would keep me informed. Sall and the not military friendly dealership come back to tell me they just sold the vehicle. So now my time and credit are wasted, while Sall and this price gouging dealer are making money.

This is not a military friendly dealership, which is ironic being in a military town. ",1.0
11,"December 30, 2019","I took my vehicle in for an oil change based on a special deal coupon Shamaley Ford has advertised on their service page (expires 12/31). I have two Ford vehicles that I bought at Shamaley and have always been serviced by Shamaley. My other vehicle is a Toyota. I took this vehicle in for service and the representative told me that they would only honor their coupon if my vehicle was a Ford. This appears deceptive as I could not find anywhere on the coupon, or the service page, where it says they will only service Ford vehicles. I was also kept waiting and felt ignored as I stood in the service bay waiting for a service rep to tell me they would not honor their advertised service specials (there were no other vehicles waiting).
Many of my family members and I have been loyal customers of Shamaley Ford for many years. I agree with other customers' recent reviews, Shamaley Ford's service department is not what it used to be.

16,"May 10, 2019","Hace 6 meses compre una camioneta y hasta el día de hoy no me han cumplido varias cosas que me prometieron son obvias al comprar un auto nuevo. Nunca me dieron una llave extra, o un juego de tapetes para el interior, como tampoco un protector anti manchas para el interior el cual nunca le aplicaron para los hacientos de la misma. Un tanque te gasolina gratis y un lavada que supuestamente no la hicieron porque era tarde y las bombas de gas ya no funcionaban. He todo 3 veces a tratar de exigir todo esto en persona pero el personal so lo o me manda con uno y con otro y todos me dicen que me van a hablar cuando algo este listo mientras se meten un pinche pedazo de pizza a la boca.  Definitivamente la peor agencia de el paso. En serio, hay muchas opciones en el paso por favor no vayas a esta y si ya estás alli exige todo lo que te prometen estos tipos con tal de que compres y agarres todas sus aseguranzas. Mi camioneta solo tenía 300 millas cuando la compre y no me la vendieron como nueva fue como usada tal vez yo cometí algunos errores en aceptar eso pero creo que cualquiera que gaste 36000 dlls en un carro merece unos pinche tapetes , una llave extra y su pinche protector de interiores que como insisten en que los compres.",1.0

18,"January 25, 2019","Absolutely terrible experience. Will never go here again, and after the treatment I received will likely not purchase a Ford again. They treat military members terribly. Took my vehicle in for damage due to an improper tow and was treated poorly from the beginning. The service advisor and service manager were extraordinarily rude to both my wife and me when we would call asking for our vehicle. They lied about when we approved the fix to take place. To put this in perspective, they took 46 days to fix my differential and stuck us with all but 10 days of the over $1000 rental car. Then, they came to an unfounded assumption that was disproven by a third party investigator hired by my insurance that a worn out bearing on the ($1000) driveshaft was related, so they wouldn't process that under my original new car warranty. I was promised a call back by the main service manager, but (unsurprisingly) didn't get one). I'm now deployed with the Army and trying to process all of this from a distance and have received no help or response. I have filed a complaint with the BBB, and am also in the process of contesting this with Ford Motor Company, but I would not recommend anyone use this dealership to service their Ford. If this review is still up, it means that Shamaley or Ford has not taken care of the issue. ",1.0

21,"September 09, 2018","Please do not take your vehicle to Shamaley Ford, they have no respect for a customer's time. First of all, it took them close to 3 hours to do a simple oil change. I've had my oil changed at other dealership service departments and they take about an hour and include a nice car wash, which Shamaley didn't. The worst part of this experience was the utter lack of respect for my time! When my car was finally ready, they left my paperwork on the desk of an advisor who was out to lunch. Had I not asked other advisors standing around, just chit chatting and laughing, for an update on my vehicle, I would have had to waited until this employee finished his lunch. I'm not paying to wait for employees to have lunch! To top all this off, I get a call from someone at (915) 591-8600, 2 days later, not only trying to justify their incompetence, but demanding to see receipts of my previous experiences at other Ford dealership service departments, implying I was lying about their great service. He was rude and would interup me as I was explaining my horrible experience at Shamaley. Minimizing their shortcomings, saying the incident with my completed paperwork sitting untouched on an advisor's desk who's out to lunch, doesn't happen very often. His apology was so insincere that I refused his offering of a free vehicle wash, why would I trust him, when he seemed angered at my posted reviews. He went as far as to ask me where and how many reviews I had posted. Please keep away from Shamaley Ford's service department!",1.0
22,"August 22, 2018","My husband and I took both our Ford vehicles to Shamaley Ford today to have them serviced. We received Exceptional customer service from our Service Advisor Ryan Gorman. From start to finish, he was very knowledgeable, organized, and pleasant to deal with. He had both our vehicles back to us within just a few hours, with the work having been completed to our complete satisfaction. We’d both like to tell Ryan “ Great Job”. From one Veteran to another, We both Thank you.

26,"January 13, 2018",I took my ford escape for service since the power steering vehicle failed completely. I was in town for the holidays and the situation was bad as it was. The dealership told me that the towing was at my expense and my responsibilty as well as any other costs involved becuase of the incident. I had to borrow a car so I could go back home to Arizona and come back once the vehicle was ready. It took 1 week and a half to get the issue resolved. Overall my view of this dealerahip and Ford is just complete diassapointment. I am never recommending Ford vehicles or purchasing any new Ford vehciles as it seems that the quality has worsen over the years.,1.8

30,"December 27, 2017","My wife and I gave Shamaley Ford a 5 star rating for the excellent work provided to us by Gilberto Martinez . We first met Gilbert several months back on a late Saturday evening after the dealership had closed. We were browsing the lot when he saw us near the Ford Edge section and kindly came over and introduced himself. From that meeting going forward he kept us informed and was always following up with the specific Ford Edge we were looking for . His professionalism , honesty and loyalty stood above the competition ( Casa , Viva, Dallas and Alamogordo dealerships ). I am proud to say we have a friend in Mr. Martinez and Shamaley Ford is very lucky to have him on their TEAM. Please acknowledge his superb job . Please thank Rocio Herrera for her attentiveness as well ! Thank you. Henry  and Rose

35,"November 20, 2017","My power window was no longer operable. I was given a drop off appointment for 8:30am. My job was assigned to Jesse Bair, who advised me upon arrival that it could take up to one and a half to two hours before they could diagnose the problem. Jesse advised me that most likely my vehicle would need to have the window regulator replaced. I informed Jesse that because I needed my truck for work, I would wait for it in the lobby. After two hours had passed, I went to check with Jesse at which time he informed that they were looking into the problem. During my wait, I received a text msg from Almendra Maese, service administer, advising me that if I would like an update I could text her. So after 4 hours of not hearing anything from anyone I sent Almendra a text asking for an update. One half hour later she replied that she would check with Jesse and get back. After not hearing anything for half an hour, I texted Almendra again looking for an update. She then advised me that Jesse would soon come out to see me. When Jesse appeared he could not tell me how much longer it was going to take. Instead, he re-assured me that the window regulator would need replacement and he would look into it. My vehicle was finally turned over to me at 4pm along with shocking bill for over $400. In retrospect, Shamaley Ford did a horrible job keeping me informed of the progress on repairing my vehicle and advising me on what charges to expect.  No amount of fancy advertising will ever get me to return for any reason. I regret not having read some of the negative reviews prior to my decision to bring my vehicle in for repair, or I would have most likely decided to take it elsewhere.",2.0

78,"May 30, 2017","The worst service I've ever had in 50 years of owning a car.

My 2013 Ford Escape was towed to Shamaley Ford May 18, 2017. It needed the battery and the passenger-side door handle replaced. They finished the repairs on May 26, 2017. The delay, apparently,  was that the wrong door handle was sent to them 2 times. The problem, for me, was that they never called me to explain the delay. I had to call them to find out what was going on. Terrible customer service. Then, as I was about to leave with the car I noticed the inside door panel was loose. So they took the car around back and fixed that. Then, I noticed the battery light was on. So they took the car back in and were gone a long time. When the service manager finally returned to car to me he said they couldn't find anything wrong and acted like I was an idiot for even mentioning the battery light problem. 

In El Paso we really only have 2 options as Ford warranty customers:Viva Ford or Shamaley Ford. I live close to Viva, but their service is horrible so I drive clear across town to Shamaley.

One hour and half later, called me and informed me couldn't find any of the noise that I had told them it had, then I asked are you serious ?

Then I checked my invoice and u said no wonder they couldn't find the noise. It said:“poping noise coming from vehicle when turning or going over speed bumps""

109,"December 29, 2013","I bought a 2013 F150 after sitting there for 3+ hours with my family on a Saturday. I went in early in the morning to pre-do the financial paperwork, this was an additional 2 hours. When I finally received my vehicle it was not cleaned. I had to peel the stickers off the windows myself. I was not shown how to operate anything on the vehicle. I had some stipulations on my 2010 F150 FX4 that I was trading in. I even asked the loan officer if I need this in writing and he stated “No it seems legit”.

I was to bring in the stock head lights and tail lights. I held up my part. I was to receive the aftermarket head lights, tail lights, light bar, and mud flaps, bed cover, tail gate extender, and floor mats. 

Four days after purchase I was afforded the opportunity to get the vehicle cleaned. Shamaley installed the bed cover and bed extender. The sales rep Javier Martinez stated “They were really busy and he would call me when they have been swapped out”. Only reason this is a concern at this point is because the company is advertising the vehicle with the after-market items on the vehicle. It has in the last week been marked as sold with an $11,000 profit. 

Once I got home I inspected the vehicle and it appeared clean but when I lifted the floor mats it was dirty the inside windows at night you could not hardly see out them. 

The mileage on the statement I signed was 15 miles, but the actual miles were 265. I told the sales rep about this and he stated this will not affect my warranty. Speaking with Ford the mileage starts at 15 so I could lose 250 miles off my warranty.
I have used their chat room to try to rectify the situation and have sent an email through the main web site. I feel I have given them ample opportunity. I was told over and over by Javier Martinez his boss and the loan rep that I would be taken care of and given the best prices on both the purchase and trade in. This did not happen and I trusted him. The 5hrs of sitting around with a hungry 5 year old and a frustrated wife didn’t help with my decision making. It seemed like once they made the sale they were done. They have not called once to see if I am satisfied. I will not recommend this dealership to anyone and I will warn everyone I know of the treatment I have received.

When my wife and I  began looking for these cars I went to another Ford dealership (Caca ford) in the area and was treated very disrespectfully. The sales guys were too busy gawking over my wife than helping us with cars. I told the manager about it and spilt. I arrived at Shamaley ford and it was a completely different story. Everyone went out of their way to help us. They were very respectful and professional. My sales guy Jerry was extremely patient with us.   We looked at several different cars and colors until we found the right ones. He was professional thorough in the explanation of the cars features, price break down and when out of his way to hook us up with the best financing.  Jerry and Todd got me a sweet deal on a 2010 Platinum F-150 I don’t know how they can swing such great prices but glad they can. Mike detailed it in record time and I was back on the road in no time flat. I have also work with the service center and Chuy is great. He is always very friendly and for a dealership gives me unbelievable prices on work.  So, If you lives in another city or even another state, Shamaley in the place.

116,"March 10, 2010","I had originally taken my '08 Escape for hail damage repair and Todd Roth was helping me out.  Todd suggested I test drive a '10 Escape and I was very happy with all the upgrades it had.  I own a small business and it is very difficult for me to go car shopping, so Todd and Enrique brought the Escape to my business and let me keep it overnight for test driving.  They were both very courteous and helpful and I did not feel like I was being pushed into buying a new car.  I really liked all the new features the '10 Escape had but I was not happy with the color.  Todd searched other dealerships and found the exact interior and exterior color I was looking for.  Todd went above and beyond my expectations in getting my car to El Paso.  I am very thankful for the professional help they both provided and are still providing.  So happy that I decided to buy a second car for my daughter.  Todd let my daughter test drive various colors until she decided on the one she liked and again Todd made my second purchase a great experience.  I have visited other dealerships and have always felt I was being pushed into purchasing something right away, but Todd Roth and the Shamaley group made it easy and pleasureable. I felt like they were there to help ME make the right choices on my purchase of both vehicles and not just there to make a sale. Thanks again for your courteous and professional service.

Todd Roth, New Car Manager and Jerry Jinkerson made sure we could search their inventory for all vechiles that fit our criteria.  Not only did they offer us their inventory, but searched other dealers inventory to help us find the right vechile.  Once we found the vehicle we liked, they let us keep and drive the vechile overnight. Everyone at Shamaley was friendly, courteous and helpful.  They never rushed us to make a decision and didn't try to sell us something that we did not want.  After we purchased the vehicle, we headed for Colorado for a real test drive.  When we returned to El Paso, they promptly scheduled a maintenance appointment to install a remote start.

118,"March 03, 2010","     Our experience with Shamaley Ford has been outstanding.  Having arrived in the area in 2004 from the east coast, we had to establish a local set of ""go to"" contacts.  We were advised by an independent garage owner that Shamaley was the best for dealer service, such as Ford recalls.  We used Shamaley and were satisfied with the work and pleased with their accommodations.  Coming from the neighboring state, New Mexico, they thoughtfully provided loaner vehicles.
     In the summer of '09 we wanted to participate in the Cash-for-Clunkers program. Ours an '87 Econoline 250 was our first tow vehicle in our move west.  Although running, it was time - as you see we keep our vehicles for the long haul.  We are retired chemists and look for durability, technical advances, performance and service support.  
     In an open search ranging from hybrids to trucks, we contacted many dealers. Todd Roth, new car manager, and Nancy Lovrenich on his team were the most responsive, informative, technically savy and patient.  Our clunker turned into a 2010 Ford Fusion Hybrid.  Todd told us about his new Fusion, his driving habits and car's response. Nancy programmed our car computer.  No Flim-Flam.
     We recently experienced a recall to adjust the internal computer program.  Again, the same excellent service and accommodations.  We travel with two Chihuahuas. This time we forgot to transfer a small cooler with their food.  When we arrived home, Nancy had already left a message of our ""oops.""  They even care about our muts!
