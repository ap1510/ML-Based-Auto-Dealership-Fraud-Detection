0,"March 17, 2020","I found a used vehicle on their web site and through conversation with a very helpful sales agent was able to make a deal agreeable to both of us.  I live in a town 35 miles from this dealership and when they were not able to do a complete detail job on the vehicle, they volunteered to deliver the vehicle to my home later that evening, and followed up doing just that.
After a week and a half, there was a small problem with the windshield wipers.  When I called to get advice on what I could do to fix this problem, there was no hesitation in their telling me that they would ""Pick up"" my vehicle and make the repairs.  They picked the vehicle up, made the repairs, then returned the vehicle the same day.  This, in my opinion was above and beyond service provided by any other dealership I have ever dealt with.  
Thank you Ashlyn (sales) and Johnny (Service).  I will be back and I will recommend this dealership to everyone I know.",5.0

2,"September 17, 2019","I was very pleased with my recent car purchase at Stanley Ford in Andrews, Texas.  They took very good care of me and I got exactly the car I was looking for.  The men in service were very nice and polite and I look forward to getting my car serviced there in the future.  Kristopher got me a great deal on this car, and I would recommend both him and this dealership to anyone I know looking to get a new vehicle.  Thank you so much!  I hope this review is helpful to someone.",5.0

5,"September 02, 2019","I bought a car from these folks a couple weeks ago, and it was a wonderful experience.  Kristopher was very polite and helpful, and I was in and out of the finance office within minutes.  This was by far the fastest and most pleasant car buying experience I have ever had.  The guys in service were great to talk to and answered every question I had.  I will absolutely recommend Stanley to all my friends and family.  The atmosphere was welcoming and very laid back.  They even offered my family some delicious pork chops fresh off the grill!  I will be getting all my future vehicles from Stanley in Andrews.  I hope you all find this helpful!",5.0
6,"March 16, 2019","I purchased new 2018 F150 Powerstroke pickup from them, great selection/price, Rick M. salesman and all the sales/finance crew I dealt with were awesome. HOWEVER, truck had 3 recalls and could not be sold until recalls performed. Service Department mechanic took my brand-new complete truck and returned it to me disassembled and unsafe. All the wiring harnesses were left loose rubbing on steering shaft/engine, clips to hold the wires were all broken, 4 bolts holding the coolant pipes to brackets were missing, 2 metal engine fuel line brackets were missing (thrown away apparently). While they offered to repair it again, I respectfully declined. Their Parts Department (awesome too) was able to get me new fuel line brackets and I purchased new bolts/nuts/zip-ties from Tractor Supply. This is not all they left unfinished, but to keep it short you get my point.  Doing the repairs myself (to their repairs) has taken me a month to finish the job right, waiting on parts etc... All of this is documented in correspondence as well as pictures. Great Sales Department staff, best ever, but beyond bad Service Department. Mechanic can take credit for this review, all on him. If you buy from them, make sure there are no repairs needed before purchasing, if there are, walk away.  ",3.6
7,"November 08, 2018","I have made an appointment 2 weeks in advance to get my truck look at, the dealer opens an 8:00am my appointment was at 8:15am but I walked down the door at 8:00am, when I walked in I told the clerk about my appointment being at 8:15am and right away the service clerk said: “there’s no way I can get it look at right now maybe after lunch” and I said sir Thats why i did my appointment  2 weeks in advance so I won’t run into any surprises like these because I come from out of town. and I’m even 15min earlier, the clerk said that one of the techs didn’t show up to work but I saw 3 or 4 techs pulling into the dealer at around 7:30am so that means that the tech thad didn’t showed up is the one that was going to get my truck checked out, all the other trucks are going to be worked on but mine, thats not fare the service sucks and I will never come back here.",1.0

10,"July 24, 2017",Eddie was a great help in getting the truck that I wanted. The process was quick and easy. A very enjoyable experience! I recommend them to friends and family. ,5.0
11,"July 23, 2017","Mercedes was very helpful getting us in the car we wanted! I had called prior to showing up telling them I wanted to look at the Ford Flex, when I arrived it was waiting for me to test drive. The paper work was quick and easy. 
The best thing is I didn't feel obligated to buy. They aren't the type of car salesman that chases you out the door and they also got me the best deal on the car. ",5.0
12,"July 21, 2017","I really loved my first experience at a car dealership at Stanley Ford. The process was not rush nor was it unpleasant. The people were very nice and patient. Overall, I love it and my new car.",5.0
13,"July 21, 2017",This dealership and salesmen are a great team.  Everyone was super friendly and easy to deal with. They worked with us to get us in something that worked for our family without pushing us into a deal we didn't want! I would recommend them 100 percent. ,5.0

15,"July 01, 2017","***ZERO STARS*** I contacted this dealership through CarGurus.com. I received an email from Hunter Emfinger at 4:44pm on June 30th saying they had the vehicle I was interested in ""available and on sale."" Hunter Emfinger with Stanley Ford Andrews followed up immediately at 4:45pm. Hunter Emfinger confirmed with me that they still had the vehicle for sale and set up an appointment with me for 3:00pm on July 1st. I told him I had to drive 94 miles and that's why I was confirming the vehicle's availability. He said yes, and he would see me at 3:00pm on Saturday. I have looked online at hundreds of vehicles over the last few months. I would NOT have driven to Andrews TX from Lubbock TX had I not had a VERY strong interest in this vehicle. We have many more vehicles to choose from in Lubbock. This vehicle happened to be exactly what I was looking for. Me, my son and my 3-year old granddaughter loaded up in the car at 12:30 and headed to Andrews. We stopped for lunch and arrived about five minutes early for my appointment. I walked into Stanley Ford Andrews and told them that I was there for my 3:00pm appointment with Hunter Emfinger. They all looked very puzzled and a girl that works there went to get someone. A man came out (did not give me his name) and said Hunter had left early, was there something he could help me with. I told him about the vehicle I was there to see. He looked confused and told me they sold that vehicle and delivered it to another customer at 7:00pm the previous evening. Okay, it doesn't take rocket science to realize that if they delivered this car at 7:00pm, they already had someone making a deal for this car at 4:45pm the same day. I made it very clear I was not happy about this situation and told them that this is not the way to conduct business. It's not even about them selling the car to someone else. It's that Hunter Emfinger couldn't make time for a 10-second phone call to let me know that he made a mistake and the vehicle was sold. When you are in the customer service business, you better know customer service. This place definitely does not. They stammered and stuttered and brought the manager, Jesus, over and he said....Um. Um. Um. We can....we can...we can.... I said ""You can't do anything,"" and walked out and drove all the way back to Lubbock. I don't care if they have good prices. Their selling practices are sub-par. I wouldn't give them a dime of my money now. I would rather pay a little more somewhere else. I'd buy from Reagor Dykes here before I'd buy from these people. And, that's not saying much. Just one more example of ""typical"" car salesman mentality...short on integrity and long on lies. I researched and researched for months to make sure it was the car I want because I can't stand dealing with car dealerships/salesmen. I always want to give the benefit of the doubt, and once again, I was not disappointed {sarcasm}.

A simple, quick phone call would have avoided this ZERO STAR review. I could have been relaxing by the pool all afternoon instead of traveling four hours on the road FOR NOTHING.

To top things off, I tried to leave a review on CarGurus.com for this dealership. It said I had already left a review for this dealership. Ummm, no. So, I'll leave this review on every social media platform I can find instead.

Half a tank of gas later, four hours wasted, nothing to show for it and a very tired grand baby. DON'T GO TO THIS PLACE.",1.0
16,"June 30, 2017","I had a great buying experience, was not pressured to buy(big plus for me), the truck was everything I expected plus some, and PJ and Hunter did a fabulous job with the sale from start to finish couldn't be happier with the purchase.",5.0
17,"June 26, 2017",Stanley ford was of great help to me. They were patient and took the time to sit down and explain everything to us and made sure we drove off in a new vehicle. I will certainly recommend Stanley Ford to everyone. Thank you Mercaides ,5.0
18,"June 26, 2017","The assitance with finding and choosing a vehicle was excellent. I could not have asked for a more simple, easy process that focused on my needs.",5.0
19,"June 26, 2017",Eddie was easy to deal with and straight forward just like me. I shopped around a lot and this truck was what I wanted and Eddie made it happen and didn't make empty promises. I will go to him on my next purchase. ,5.0
20,"April 17, 2017","I really loved working with the team as a whole, but individually my salesman seemed truly interested in what I wanted as well as what I needed. He was always very straightforward and didn't give me a complete car salesman run around like I have encountered before. He truly seems like he loves his job and is willing to do anything to make his sales happen. ",5.0
21,"April 06, 2017","Although I haven't made it up to Andrews yet to look at vehicles, I inquired about their stock online. Tristan notified me immediately to offer his assistance. He has kept in touch with me via text message and has been very understanding when I am unable to keep appointments. Life happens, right? I look forward to getting up to Andrews in the near future and meeting Tristan face to face to get a deal worked out on a new vehicle.
I only gave 4 stars because I have not visited Stanley Ford in person yet. But I'm sure once I do, there will be 5 stars. ",4.3
22,"April 06, 2017","Seems to know a lot about his job and the vehicles he is dealing with. Cares about what he is doing and the person he is helping out, regardless of them buying the vehicle. Very informative anf helpful.",4.0
23,"April 05, 2017",Great sales man very enthused about his job and what he is doing for the community. Likes to make you feel like family and try and find the perfect vehicle to suit the needs you are looking for,5.0
24,"March 06, 2017","Sold us a car with shattered glass in the seat pockets and air vents. Told us they would put a fob on our key considering it's supposed to have one. Didn't do it wanted to charge us $700 for a remote to lock and unlock. Let us buy the car without telling us there was a recall for door handle. Told us that would take 2-3 days. Took it to different Ford house recall took 2 hours to fix and fob +service was $218. WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THE ANDREWS FORD HOUSE! Had car listed as 11,400. Wouldn't sell it for less than 12,000. Complete rip off. Don't put a price on a car then expect $600 more than you listed it for",1.4
