0,"December 20, 2018","I don't know where to start. Tried to buy a new Cadillac and was lied to from the very begining by everyone involved. They lied to us about the car being availble, then it wasn't, then it was from a different dealership then it wasn't. This went on for FIVE DIFFERENT CARS. They outright LIED to us the car was available and was on a trailer three hours away. Then they took a $1,000 deposit. The car never got there. Then they told us the car had a blown engine. Remember this part. 
Then then they had another one just like it in Chicago. Then it was not available. Then they had one locally but it was a lot more money than we agreed to pay. Can you say ""Bait and Switch""
Then they LIED about the Cosco discount program. They tried to steal the gift card from Costco. Can you say ""Theft""
We told them just give our money back and we will go to a ""Real"" Cadillac dealership. That was three weeks ago. Again can you say ""Theft"" We still do not have our money back. And no one returns or takes our calls. 
We went to Sewell Cadillac and took delivery of the car we wanted in one day. The car with the ""Blown Engine"" was another LIE. The car did not have a blown engine. Can you say ""Deceptive Trade"" The dealer that had the car told us they just could not do business with Cadillac of Arlington. 
Folks if Cadillac won't deal with these people neither should anyone else. We still do not have our money back yet. 
We will be filing suit against the dealership.
Do yourself a favor and avoid this place like the plague. Even the General Manager will not call us back. All we tried to do was spend $45,000.00 for a car. ",1.0

3,"January 15, 2018","I have provided a score of 5 because the service department always does a phenomal job with a smile. My visit on today was not any different than the previous one for my service checks. Erick Rancher Sr always goes above the call of duty and no matter how busy the service department may get he always focus on the task at hand. I recommend not only Erick Rancher Sr but the entire service department for doing such a great job. I will continue to buy Cadillac vehicles due to the service that you ALWAYS receive at the Arlington location on Collins St.

4,"January 12, 2018","I cannot say enough about my sales person, Kevin Beasley. He is professional, well informed, very responsive, hard working, presentable, caring and, above all, honest. After purchasing close to 30 cars in my lifetime Kevin actually provided, in addition to all the above referenced qualities, a hassle free experience. He worked with me on the price even though the car was already deeply discounted. Overall it was a great experience!
Moreover, the gentlemen I met from his office like Tyler and Jimmy in finance were also terrific to work with. In addition to Kevin I especially like The other sales person, Greg Moreland, who accompanied Kevin to my office. 
Kevin and Greg were also very patient and respectful which I really appreciated as we were very busy in our office. 
Kevin and Greg represent Cadillac very well. I look forward to buying another Cadillac again soon from Kevin and Greg at Cadillac of Arlington. I am proud to be a member of their family.",5.0
5,"December 19, 2017","I am very pleased with my automobile purchase.   What I am more pleased about, is the buying experience overall.  There was no pressure and at no time did I feel rushed.  My salesman Kevin, made me feel very comfortable from the initial introduction.  He impressed me most with his professionalism and his vast knowledge of the products. He even has a great personality! üòä
 Kevin gives incredible service and is the person you'll want, aiding in your vehicle search.
My satisfaction was his highest priority, so; if you‚Äôre in the market for an automobile, I highly recommend ‚ÄúKevin Beasley‚Äù of Cadillac of Arlington, TX.

34,"October 23, 2015","Good experience with Ron & JJ in Arlington, TX. Nice people. The negoiation experience was professional & worth the time. A couple fo items need to be fixed or changed & Ron put this in writing. 

I wasn't as happy with the Finance experience. Pressured when it came to extended warranty. Some other comments were made that I thought were unprofessional. I'm in Sales so I'm in this world. There are things I would never say to a client.",4.2
35,"October 23, 2015","This is the second time I brought my cts-v in. The first time (a few months ago) they performed routine service and an alignment. They did a poor job and I ended up with a vibration so I brought it back. Unfortunately the poor alignment caused the tires to wear unevenly so I will need new ones. I also wanted to see about getting a replacement front bumper liner extension as mine had been slightly damaged..

While it was in for service though they called and said since the car has 33k miles on it I needed new transmission fluid and an upper intake fuel cleaning and decarb which would cost a total of $440. This is not mentioned in the service manual and he didn't have any other reasons when i pressed him on it. I then asked him about the liner, it retails online for $35 with an MSRP of 53. He wanted over $100 for it not including labor!

They re-did the alignment even though I just had one done in June and charged me $100. I paid it just to get out of there but I highly recommend staying as far away from these guys as possible!",1.2

37,"August 21, 2015","We needed some routine service on our 2012 SRX, and our Service Advisor, Doug Spivey, notified us of some other recommended scheduled maintenance.  We agreed to have that done as well, but Doug noticed that our tires were well worn.  He gave us a cost estimate for the tires & installation, and the price was very competitive with the ""Tire Stores"" so we agreed to have that done as well. Doug was in touch with us regularly to update us on the status, and made sure we had a loaner car.  Now it's like new!  Will certainly return to Cadillac of Arlington - Doug was fantastic!",5.0

44,"December 18, 2014","I found information of a Cadillac luxury SRX on their website and then went there to take a look. I did not contact anyone in advance. When I got there and told them the vehicle information, they showed me a base one but with same stock number. They told me that they could not find that internet one in their inventory. I wasted a hour there and got nothing at end. At night when I got to their website, the wrong information was still there. I figured out that they use that strategy to attract customers to come then introduced other vehicles. Liar!!!!",1.0
45,"November 01, 2014","My husband and I came in yesterday 10-31-14. We looked online the night before. I saw a 43,999 XTS. I emailed and asked if they would negotiationate more off the sticker. AB said yes. We went in the dealership AB ended up being our salesman.  His email said he was the internet manager. He recognized my name and remembered my email. He took a long time looking for a XTS. He took a long time showing us every feature. We asked the mileage. He didnt know. He told its was a Luxury model. We mentioned it was a Premium model. Which is a lot more. We told him we wanted to look at a different model because the car was new but had 5k miles. We asked about the other XTS. He didn't know that was a 2014 and didn't know the mileage. We spent 45 minutes waiting for an appraisal on my car. We were told the car I was looking didn't qualify for any manufacturer rebates because this car was a retired loaner car. He would only give us $ 900 off the sticker.  We said no way would we make a deal. I asked him to show me the vehicle that I thought he was showing us the email one priced at 43999. He said they didnt have one. I showed him the car on their website.  He said didnt know where that car was. And that we were combative. I was insulted with that comment. We asked for my keys. Before we walked out the Manager asked us why the sell didnt happen. We told him everything.  I got a  email a few hours later. Asking me to call the manager. I sent an email today saying what we were willing to pay and the price for my trade in. Its been a few hours no response.  I called the dealership asking for the manager. After a few minutes they said the manager was busy and would have to call me back. This the worst experience. I would never go there again!",1.0

47,"September 20, 2014","On Thursday, I saw a pre-owned car on the internet and loved it. Put a $500 deposit down over the phone with Greg. He told me he was the sales manager (I later told he wasn't) I was told the car had never been in an accident; CarFax was clean and indeed it was. So I made arrangements to come in Saturday morning at 9AM to buy it. 

I told Greg I needed an Autocheck report and upon confirmation of that and a test drive, we had a deal. He promised to email it to me. 5 hours go by, no email. I called him and he said he was working on it. Next morning (Friday,) no email. I emailed the dealership. Received a response with a link to the Carfax. Finally that afternoon I ran my own Autocheck. 

Lo and behold. On 9/4/2013 in OK a side impact accident reported. So disappointed. I still wanted to consider buying the car but now at a lower price. I didn't want to deal with Greg anymore due to his failure to send me the Autocheck so I called the main number.  

Literally all day there was a phone voice loop that after hitting 0 to speak to the operator it would ring, then go back to the voice loop. Rinse repeat. All day folks. I'm not kidding up to 6PM. 9 hours and no one ever answered the phone at the front.
 
So I called again, hit 1 and got the service dept. He transferred me to the GM. I left a VM. Next day (Saturday) still no return call. I managed somehow to get his assistant‚Äôs VM. Left message. Next day (Saturday,) still no return call. Being the weekend it's possible they weren't in. I understand that. 

I then broke down and called sales Friday night and spoke to another sales manager, Brian (I think) who told me Greg was a salesman, not a sales manager. Brian seemed pretty disintersted in the whole thing. I emailed him the Autocheck. He did tell me that ""We use CarFax. You know ""Show me the Carfax!"" At that point, I knew I wasn't going to get anywhere and I told him I would just speak to the GM on Monday. He replied, ""sorry we couldn't help you out. Wouldn't you think at that point a good salesman would have at least made an attempt to offer customer service.

It's now Saturday morning at 11:20 AM. This has been going on since Thursday and I have yet to get even a residue of honesty, customer service, a resolution, explanation, call-backs, an apology or anything from this dealership. How they remain in business defies logic.",1.4

He put me at ease during a very stressful situation, expained the problem and solution and followed thru on everything he promised. He helped identify and explain a few other potential service problems I was not aware of that could have caused severe damange later.

Rob tried to help us, but we burned almost three hours and I was frustrated so we left. Husband gave TWO of his cards to Rob and asked him to email us when it was all sorted out because we were interested in not just one, but TWO, cars. Never heard a word from them. He assured us he would straighten things out and contact us. Never happened. Cadillac of Arlington lost out on an opportunity to move TWO cars and has solidified the fact that we will NEVER purchase a car from this dealership again.

I really appreciate their courteous customer service and friendly sense of humor. The dealership is clean and the refreshments offer a nice, convenient touch.

When I left there and returned my previous lease to its dealership, I couldn't get over the difference. I'll honestly never go back to the old place now that Mortiz Cadillac & Bob have set the bar so high. I never knew what I was missing.

64,"July 24, 2013","I went in to lease a 2013 CTS Coupe. Chauncey, I have to say, will be my sales person for life. I know the stereotype ( your rolling your eyes thinking is this girl for real). Very honest and I really trust him. My last car was a BMW purchased from Moritz, by the way loved that car also.
I went in and immediately fell in love with this coupe and I had to have it. They make so few of these cars I thought I would have to wait a few weeks, which I would have. I was almost in tears when Chauncey said the one I wanted was on the truck headed to the dealership. I also sent the wheels out to be chromed and windows tinted. I didn't want to take my car home until it was perfect. I was introduced to my service advisor should I have any issues for my scheduled maintenance. Ken Moore worked above and beyond with this one issue on my credit report. I was so proud when I signed the lease with no money due at signing and the agreed low payments. 
Cadillac makes such a great product right now and this has been my favorite car I have ever owned. Please call Chauncey for your next test drive. You will walk away saying the same thing I did, Chauncey is yours for life. I have had my car 3 months and I love driving it!!!!",5.0

We were interested in a new Cadillac CTS.  We drove a gold one that had some problems.  Bob took it right over to get it checked out.  We then drove another white Cadillac and found it to be just what we wanted.  Bob was able to get the deal closed at 8:50 p.m.  We have had a red Cadalliac CTS 2011 and have been very pleased with it.  We look forward to driving this one even longer.  Bob was very helpful in showing us how to operate the new car especially the navigator which I did not have on my previous car.  We were pleased with the no pressure sale.   Orbie Von Tungeln  ,5.0
69,"May 24, 2013","We bought our car from Mortiz back in January and this is our first encounter with their service dept.  I have to say I'm more than pleased by the level of service I received by everyone there.  Bill Hale greeted me upon my arrival and helped me transfer carseats to my loaner car while Doug Spivey had all the paperwork drawn up and ready to go.  Lorena Juarez brought everything to me so that I didn't have to lug my baby and sleeping toddler inside to fill out paperwork.  I initially had three concerns with my vehicle, two of which parts were necessary and ordered.

I took my vehicle in for a diagnostic regarding the struts, only to be called a day later by Jim informing me that my radiator had busted and ""I was responsible for the repairs & labor"".

The radiator worked fine when I dropped of the car, I just felt swindled and taken total advantage of.  I wouldn't refer my enemy to this dealership.  I think they should be investigated, God only knows how many more victims are out here.

My hats off to Ms. Juarez, I want to sincerely say Thanks to her for the outstanding customer service and for making me feel welcome.

146,"June 23, 2012","My visit to Mortiz was 100% pleasurable.  Mr sales person, Mr. Bob Paul, was pleasant to deal with.  He was not pushy.  He was able to provide detailed information for the vehicle that I was interested in.  Mr. Paul, along with two managers I worked with, were willing to spend a lot of time with me due to my limited budget, and able to accommodate my needs at the end.  I left with my brand new car with a smile on my face.",5.0
147,"June 13, 2012","In all our years of purchasing vehicles, we would have to say that this has been the most pleasurable and rememberable experience ever. Coming from a strong customer service work ethic ourselves the service we received from Moritz was over the top. Our Service Consultant Yaw Owusu definitely went the extra mile. Not only was he professional but his honesty and knowledge of his product was awesome!Our Financial consultant Tony Canaday made the whole tranaction just a joy! Most people dread the idea of car shopping. Yaw and Tony were on top of their sales and customer service from beginning to end.Its a wonderful feeling to purchase a vehicle knowing you have purchased a great vehicle and established relationships within the Moritz family that make you want to purchase nowhere but from there and to refer all your friends and associates.We wish everyone could experience the awesome experience that we had of becoming Moritz family, because that is exactly how everyone there makes you feel.",5.0
148,"June 12, 2012","I absolutely loved getting me car from here! I got my first car here, and it was such a breeze I couldn't believe how smooth it was! Any questions I had were answered directly and honestly, and everything kept moving. I went in with John knowing exactly what I was after, and he didn't bother me about anything except what I wanted. I really appreciated being treated so kindly and I would definitely recommend this dealer to a friend! I am so happy with my car, I'm glad I didn't go anywhere else!

149,"May 24, 2012","My visit to the Moritz Cadillac was an awesome experience. The customer service is great and I would and have already recommended Moritz to indivduals that have inquired about where I purchased my vehicle. Bob Paul treated me like I've known him for years and met my needs in a very timely and expeditious manner. Bob has my vote for salesman of the year. Ken Moore played a key role in helping to meet my financial administrative needs accordingly. Pat Austin was there to assist in a major way and provided a very high level of patience especially when I left my wallet in my vehicle that I dropped off to be detailed after regular business hours. He waited until I returned. This entire staff (even indivduals I didn't directly deal with) is very friendly, helpful, and knowledgable. I was very impressed and overly satified with my experience at Moritz Cadillac in Arlington Texas. Moritz puts their customers first. ",5.0

Most car dealerships are pushy, he was  not pushy at  all. He made sure I was satisfied with my purchase and made buying a new vehicle fun, and not stressful for me. ",5.0

153,"April 24, 2012","Purchased a new SRX from Moritz last Saturday. Everything from start to finish was painless and we felt it was a win win for us and the dealership. The process started with a call to Jeremy in (internet sales) who put me in touch with Pat Austin (new car sales mgr.). Pat and I worked on the number for a day or two until we reached a deal we could both live with. Bob Paul (salesman) closed the deal and trained us on all the great features this car has. We could not be happier with this car.

Thanks to everyone at Moritz for making this a great experience.",5.0
154,"April 24, 2012","From the very first telephone call with Charlie and thru my purchase completion with Gary this was the most professional dealership I've ever dealt with.  The car I wanted to test drive was waiting for me at my appointment time and others were brought right up when I decided to drive a different model.  There was never any pressure to drive any other cars or to buy a car!  Every encounter was professional and low key and HELPFUL!!  The actual sale went thru quickly.  I've been back with questions and it just seems that all their folks can answer any question you have.  They truly know their product.  

I recommend Moritz to anyone looking to buy a Cadillac!",5.0
155,"April 21, 2012","I was able to purchase the car I wanted with the features I needed.  And the price was very reasonable.  Pat Austin, Chauncey Bivins and Ken Moore were friendly and personable, and they made sure my experience was very positive.  I would definitely recommend this dealership to my friends and family members.",5.0

158,"April 03, 2012","We recently bought a new vehicle from Moritz in Arlington.  The experience has been refreshing.  They had what we wanted at a fair price and gave us a fair price for our trade in.  They were very knowledgeable taking the time to explain what everything did.
I would suggest them to my friends or anyone looking for a vehicle.  We will buy from them again based on our experience.
We have also had dealings with the Service Department at Moritz and this has been a good experience as well.

Thanks to everyone involved.",5.0

Unlike many of the previous visited Dealers, Moritz sales approach was refreshing & transparent. If you are considering a future auto purchase, we can tell you that Moritz treated us fair on our last Cadillac purchase. We will definitely give Moritz a chance at our future Auto purchases.  ",5.0

164,"March 30, 2012","I have had the most  pleasurable experiences  with Mr. Pat Austin over the past three years and he is the only reason why I have purchased my second CTS V from Moritz Cadillac.  I have  dealt with many dealerships, sales managers, and sales persons, but have never felt, nor been treated in such a classical manner that Mr. Austin has conducted business with me.  He is extremely professional, knowledgeable, caring, concerned with me as an individual and not some potential sales to make a quota.  Mr. Austin is a rare breed in the industry as he took the time to response quickly to my email inquires, kept me informed, answered question during telephone calls, or returned calls with answers to my questions.  I indeed look forward to an on going communication with Mr. Austin in the future.

165,"March 29, 2012","Choice had narrowed to Cadillac (CTS and the SRT-Crossover). My first contact was by phone from Charlie Thompson who handles internet contacts. We spoke for some time, he answered my questions and offered info I should know. Very professional and informative.

At Moritz, I was introduced to Bob Paul, a veteran sales rep. He was everything one could wish for in a sales position. No pressure, no hype, just very knowledgeable. I told him what I liked and didn't and he pointed out the pros vs cons between the CTS and the SRT. The crossover won me over with its large cargo area. Wonderfully comfortable interior which mirrors the sophisticated body. 

I hoped to get more on my trade-in, but I knew the highs and lows that could be offered. Even at the low end I could live with it.

I live in Duncanville, TX, and the location of the Moritz dealership is Arlington, TX (15 min. drive). A significant factor in my choice of dealership. I detest driving in Dallas unless absolutely necessary. Sewell Cadillac was my secondary contact, but too late. Regardless of the pressure and hard sell tactics (which I did not appreciate)I told them I had an agreement with Moritz and it was firm.

In closing, Moritz personnel (especially Bob and Charlie) were friendly, knowledgeable, did answer all my questions. I feel very comfortable with my experience at Moritz Cadillac.

166,"March 29, 2012","Thank you to our sales rep, Bob P., for such a good overall car buying experience. We were able to get the exact car we wanted - color and model!  Bob was so nice and helpful - answered all our questions and took plenty of time to go over all the controls, intruments, navigation system, and OnStar. We are completely satisfied and enjoying our new CTS!  ",4.8
167,"March 28, 2012","Chauncey could have not been nicer or friendlier. Working him was a pleasure because he got to the bottom line very quickly without us having to haggle. He made suggestions of ways we could lower the price, and we took advantage of the one that we qualified for. It was by far the easiest and least stressful of all the car buying experiences we've ever had.  Thank you Chauncey!!",5.0
168,"March 28, 2012","Bob has been wonderful to work with, his knowledge of the working systems within the SRX and the in/outs of the pricing/financial community was great.  Bob took the time to explain the functions and setup process within the car, working with him was a joy.  ",5.0
169,"December 28, 2011","I enjoyed my experience overall with this service department.  Ron was my service coordinator and he was on top of things from the get go. This clearly stems from his history as a former business owner.  I made an appointment, as I needed a loaner vehicle and he had it ready to go. They checked everything over very well and brought to light all issues.  At 125 per hour I suppose things can add up pretty quick but I believe its somewhat in line with the market.  Ill tell you this....I had an issue with a noise that ended up being a simple axle bolt tightning issue...they could have charged me for this and never said a word...Ron explained it and said ""no charge"" which caught me by suprise.  Most places will gouge you.
My only area of minor concern was that when I got my car back it was not cleaned.  Maybe the Grapevine dealership spoiled me and honestly its not their job to do so but I guess I was kind of used to that little extra bit of service.
Again...not really a complaint because I would definitely go back again and will use this shop from this point forward.
