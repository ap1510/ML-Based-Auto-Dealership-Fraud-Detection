My only issue to date is my own neglect at checking the fuel tank size. It is too small. We have always had bigger tanks on our vehicles and with the towing pkg, I would have expected a larger capacity.

We have taken the vehicle in for recalls and had very good service.  The service dept has gone the extra mile to help solve issues ( no solutions found) with after market camera and fuel tanks.  

Overall, I would definately recommend this dealership to anyone.",5.0
1,"December 14, 2019",Braden and Isaiah were amazing! They helped me get the vehicle I loved for a great price. Very helpful! Definite recommend to every one I know ,5.0
2,"October 14, 2019",Isaiah was great. The vehicle I originally wanted already had a deposit so he showed me a few others I was interest in. He knew we had some constraints but he worked to get me what I wanted. We’ll be back for sure ,5.0
3,"October 30, 2017","I would not give this dealership even 1 star. Worst customer service and sales team I have ever come across. I looked online and found a vehicle I wanted to purchase. It was MSRP'd for $57860 and stated my price would be $50500. The next day I went online to see if the vehicle was still there and it was, this time online stated MSRP $ 57860 and my price would be $48809. I immediately went to the dealership to look at the vehicle, looked really nice. The sales guy Scott gave me a ride to Stanley Dodges to discuss price because they were renovating the Chevrolet dealership. Once inside he took my name and number and said let me talk to my manager and get you the best deal. He came back with $48909, I said how is that a good deal when online states the vehicle is $48809? He had nothing to say, so I countered with an offer and he stated no, manager will not go any lower. I said aren't you going to take my offer to him he said no. I said okay, I got up left. He didn't even bother to offer me a ride back to the Chevy side which is about 1.5 football fields away. Even though I had a bad experience that day, I still wanted that vehicle. So the next day I looked once again online to see if the vehicle was still there and it was but the price changed again to $51500. I still called Scott and said I wanted to make an offer of that vehicle, he said okay I gave him my offer over the phone and he came back 45 seconds later and said manager said no and anyways that the vehicle sold yesterday at 3:00 pm. I said it still showing on your website and the price changed again, he said online error either way it’s gone and hung up on me.  For some reason I felt as though he was lying to me. About 2 hrs later I had a co-worker of mine call and inquire about the same vehicle and he was told that it was still on the lot and they asked him when he wanted to come in and see it. I couldn't believe it. 30 minutes later he and I drove by there and sure enough it was still there.  I was very upset of how I was being treated. The next day again I looked on line and it was still listed, so I called again, this time spoke to another sales person and I asked if the vehicle was still available and she said let me look in the system and ask the manager if anybody is working it, she came back on the line and said still here, when would you like to come in and see it. I said are you 100% sure it still there? she said yes I just saw it sitting out in the lot. So I said that's funny cause I was there the other day made an offer, and just yesterday I called back to make another offer and they told me it sold. She asked my name and said standby. I waited for about 10 minutes and she came back and said oh yeah it sold the day before at 6:pm and hung up the phone. Not sure why I was treated like that, xxxx I had my own financing already.  I'm in the military and would not recommend any Stanley dealership to any one especially military. ",1.0
