1,"May 26, 2020","We purchased a pre-owned Jeep and overall it was a great experience. Trey, the sales manager, was always attentive and was willing to negotiate to get the deal done. The trade in offer was great and it was easy. David was an excellent salesman that followed through even after we drove off the lot, which doesn’t happen at other dealerships. Highly recommend. ",5.0
2,"May 21, 2020","While I had been to other Covert dealers in the past looking at other vehicles, this was my first trip to the CDJ facility.
I had inquired on their website about a few Jeep Gladiators, and Freddy got back with me nearly instantaneously.
We spoke on the phone for a few, where he asked some really good exploratory questions...in the past, with other dealers, it’s more like “So what brings you to us today?”  This was refreshing...
We then primarily corresponded via text before I visit the dealership in person.
I met Freddy for the first time...just a truly nice, professional, and good guy.  I could tell that he’s been doing this for a long time...
He asked me if I wanted to take a drive, and I said sure. He didn’t even ask me for my license...just gave me the keys...that’s trust.
I got back, we sat down for a few, and I provided him my purchase parameters, both for the new rig as well as my trade.  He listened, took good notes, and said he would get back with me.  This was on a Saturday.
I did leave, for the day was getting long in the tooth, and Freddy needed to work some numbers.  I checked in with him first thing Monday morning and he said we have a deal.
I showed up a few hours later, the new rig was all clean and out front, and I was in and out in about an hour.
Great experience...I will go back for both service as well as a next purchase.  I’m also telling my friends at AJP that his is a great place to go.",5.0

8,"February 17, 2020","My experience was such a great one. Salesman David Hassenmiller was very knowledgeable on all aspects and was willing to answer any and all questions. He really took the time to make sure I was comfortable with my purchase. 

Rusty in finance was very prepared and quick with my financing. 

Jeramie is the Manager of Used Cars, he took the time to come out and diagnose what was wrong with my vehicle, it was the fan motor. Jeramie asked David to put me in a loaner, then he had his head tech order the fan motor for Monday.  On Monday it was installed, I picked my vehicle up and I couldn't be happier with the prompt service I received!!!!!!! 

I highly recommend for anyone who is thinking about buying a new or used vehicle to contact Covert Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram.

He then had the newly arrived car brought around and the rest is history. I could not be happier with my new car. David and the Covert finance department made it all happen at lightning speed.

48,"August 31, 2019","I really appreciated Edgar because of his knowledge of the vehicle, his no pressure attitude, and how quickly he found the jeep for me.  Beside knowledgable, Edgar also had the trait of no BS, which what a major reason he worked for me.  As a realtor, I know on a first-hand basis how referrals are. When I refer a person, I put part of my reputation into that referral.  I have already referred Edgar to some potential car buyers and will continue to.
On Jonathan Alcaia, I bought my 2012 Jeep from him when he was in sales.  He continued our relationship past the sale and that is what brought me back to Covert 7 yrs later. He is now in financing and he did an excellent job and had me out pretty quick.
In all, my experience with Edgar and Jonathan were over 5 stars and Cover has my next Jeep!",5.0
49,"August 31, 2019","Since the beginning of time, man’s greatest struggle has been buying a car. Occasionally the experience can be compared to the feeling of an animal getting hit by a car and excruciatingly waiting for the vultures to slowly pick apart it's dying carcass. This experience was the complete opposite.  My experience with Edgar was similar to having a fast pass at Disney World as I slowly walked toward Space Mountain with a ice cream cone in my hand skipping the line and having the best two minutes of my life (wink, wink).  All jokes aside, Edgar was professional, courteous and most importantly friendly.  Not as funny as I am, but he was pretty funny.  ",5.0

53,"August 19, 2019","I recently purchased a vehicle with Adam at COVERT CDJR and I really love it! Their pre-owned selection is full of various vehicles it's hard to believe that they dont have something you will like. The service department is on top of their stuff, the car I purchased rides like a dream. Mr.Gordon is a trustworthy associate who will work with your budget to get you into the ride you want and won't just stop there. I will definitely be back to purchase my next car with him!",4.8
54,"August 19, 2019","10/10 would recommend this dealership to everyone! Specifically, Dylan Scott! After my dad drove 4 hours from Houston, we started the day with plans on purchasing a vehicle from Nyle Maxwell GMC in Round Rock. However, when we showed up for our appointment, we were thrown to the side and expected to wait behind a different customer that didn't have an appointment, we were forced to wait outside in 105 degree weather for an hour, and the sales guy, finance guy, and manager all disrespected us to the point where we left and told them not to call us. 

At this point, we were upset and frustrated. We called up Covert Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram and told Dylan our situation and what we were looking for in a vehicle. He told us what they had on the lot that matched what we were looking for and we headed that way. When we pulled up, he had a Jeep already pulled up front for us to test drive that was EXACTLY WHAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR! It literally checked all of our boxes and he was extremely helpful throughout the entire process. He answered all of our questions with confidence and walked us through everything with extreme patience. We could tell that he truly cares about his customers and we couldn't have asked for a better experience. We will definitely be coming back to see him with all of our future purchases and will be telling all of our friends and family. Thank you so much Dylan for making my first car buying experience so enjoyable. You're the best!",5.0

Upon visiting and working with Albert, I was instantly impressed with his knowledge of very specific questions I was asking around the car and packages. Albert was able to help me navigate around the confusing / lack of information by looking directly into the Jeep parts database. Also helped me immediately when we noticed there was a missing floor mat by ordering a full new set! Overall I am not a big fan of dealer pressure tactics, hidden feeds, etc. and I found none of my fears here at Covert. Pricing was honest and we were able to work together on some key areas. Low dealer fees and transparent pricing are key in my mind and I found that here at Covert working with Albert. Would definitely recommend and I'll be a repeat customer. Thanks!",5.0

71,"July 29, 2019","A few months ago I decided I wanted to get a Jeep, on Wednesday July 24 I found the listing online for what I was hoping would be the Jeep I wanted but couldn’t be sure since it was so newly listed it was only a stock photo. Dylan reached out to me first thing Thursday morning and was awesome! He took the time to send me pictures (which confirmed my hopes, this was the EXACT Jeep of my dreams, lift, tires, rims, color, bumpers, EVERYTHING) and worked up an offer on my trade-in to have everything ready for that Saturday which was the earliest I could get to Covert. We got there 30 minutes early and Dylan already had EVERYTHING ready to go. We left the dealer with my perfect 2013 Jeep Wrangler in record timing (my appointment was at 9, we got there at 8:30 and left around noon). My trade in was purchased at David McDavid Acura right up the road a few years ago. They were terrible, absolutely rude because I wanted to purchase a used vehicle off of their lot instead of a brand new Acura. They wouldn’t listened to what I Had to say and we were there for over 8 hours. I will never go to another dealer again, Covert is worth the drive for the amazing service. Thanks Dylan Scott and Jonathan Alcala for making this happen for me and truly understanding my family’s situation with the loss of my little brother and my need to be happy with my dream vehicle.

Our experience at Covert with Dylan and Matt was exceptional. The level of customer service, professionalism and friendliness was unmatched by any of the previous dealers we visited. I grew up in the Pacific Northwest where Nordstrom sets the standard of customer service for everything. These two individuals made Covert ""the Nordstrom of dealerships"" in our minds.  They were upfront, honest and responsive to our requests to fix a few minor things on a used vehicle. They treated us as if we were buying a brand new top-of-the-line vehicle.  I have already recommended them to friends.  We are definitely going back to give them first crack at our business in two years when it's time to buy our daughter her first vehicle.

Many reviews called out Dylan and let me tell you this guy lives up to the hype.  I called and asked for him specifically, he and I spoke briefly about what I wanted to come look at and he grabbed the keys while we were on the phone.  A few hours later I showed up to the dealership and the vehicle was waiting out front for me.  Dylan is very nice and I felt no pressure.  He's knowledgeable and easy to work with.  I went in with a financing deal in place and he was able to get an even better deal for me through the same company which was awesome and unexpected.  Irene in the finance office was also very nice and pretty quick.  Over all the car buying process is never fast but I was working with  a time restraint and Dylan worked hard to not waste my time and kept checking with me to make sure he was moving along at the pace I needed.

95,"July 02, 2019","Third time buying from Covert, and 1st time working with John Read. He is the reason I will return to Covert CDJR for next purchase.
John embodies a true salesmanship that is lost on the new generation of car salesman. Wasn't pressured to buy something I didn't want or a price that wasn't for me. John went above and beyond to pull a truck from another dealership in Devine, but due to other dealership dragging their feet I ultimately went with a local truck. He took the time to figure out what features I needed with the vehicle and worked the deal, with me leaving with the vehicle that fit both my professional and personal needs. 
Thanks Mr. Read.

This time I went for the Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Rubicon after owning two Jeep Grand Cherokee's. I worked with Freddie Anguiano, who was very knowledgeable, patient, and helpful throughout the entire buying process. I showed up one day, test drove three wranglers with Freddy, and I was sold on the 2.0L Turbo engine one.  I told Freddy what configuration of Jeep I wanted,  and he immediately started searching wranglers with all my requirements. We reviewed 12 different Jeeps until I found the one that met my requirements. As soon as I made my decision, Freddy ordered it, and I was driving my new jeep the next day. He was super patient with me because I changed my mind many times until I got the one I wanted. Once we found the one. The rest of the process took no time to finish. I could not get a better price anywhere else, and the customer service was excellent. I know most people dread the whole car buying process and the negotiating price, but buying from Covert, you will always get an honest answer and the best value for your trade-in.

After attempting to fix the issue on my own (five unanswered emails and a few phone calls), I realized the hard way that this was preventing me from getting the car registered and receiving my new plates. Attempted to follow up with them multiple times, most recently on 5/14 and they stated they needed me to come back in and update paperwork because they finally noticed that it was incorrect (I contacted them on March 26th, March 30th, April 1st, and April 3rd but apparently no one took care of anything). During the meeting on 5/14, I filled out the corrected paperwork and was assured that my registration would be complete that week and that someone would contact me...guess what...no one has contacted me, and when I called this morning to check again they still do not have the plates or the registration. The sales experience with Edgar was great, but based on the past 2 months after the sale and the way I have been treated / ignored, there is no way I will bring my car to this dealership for service, nor recommend it to anyone else. ***

I worked with Edgar Cruz. I found the vehicle I wanted online, emailed him directly to see if it was still available.

After test driving and then also appraising my vehicle for a trade in, he brought some numbers to me and they were way off from the price I saw online.

I was ok with it and had asked all the same things I did earlier. I also asked does it have Sirius radio and Edgar said yes. We go back inside and I wait some more while they are looking at my old car to trade in and the loan person, Chris came and asked me what car I was trading in. Come to find out later when I was talking with him he had the wrong car for my trade in, assuming that Edgar gave him the wrong information or another client file.

After finalizing the deal, I’m putting my thing in my new Jeep and Edgar is showing me basic things like radio, etc and I asked where is the Sirius and he said oh actually I guess it doesn’t have it. Again, frustrating that he didn’t know about the Jeep and take time to listen what I was saying and asking instead of trying to hurry my sale. I was at the dealership for 3 hours.

161,"April 14, 2019","I came in looking for a WRX after test driving a hatchback version that I ended up not liking at a used car lot. From the start Dylan was extremely helpful and honest, and genuinely wanted us to have all the information available to us in case I decided to make a purchase. The WRX I came in for unfortunately had sold the day before, but there was a newer one in pearl white available for a test drive, and I fell in love with the car - it wasn't the color I initially thought I wanted, but it was a beauty, and really easy and fun to drive! I was almost sold on the car then, but the only problem was that it was just out of my price range. After talking numbers for a little while, Dylan asked me what I would like to pay out the door, which is what I was concerned about, rather than the monthly payment. I gave him a number, and he came back with an out the door price of exactly that number, including the trade-in. We went home after that to think it over, and I ended up deciding to purchase the car because I really liked it, and the price was right. 

At no point in the process did I feel pressured at all by Dylan - he was very respectful and genuinely wanted the best for me, whether I bought a car or not. I am very grateful that my first car buying experience went so smoothly, and without any of the negative things you typically hear about car salesmen. I would fully recommend Dylan Scott and Covert Dodge to anyone who is looking to buy a car!",5.0

All online because my time with family and work leave me very little time to be wasted at dealerships. Will Harrell reached out to me to make sure his team was doing what they were supposed to be doing like a good leader/manager should do. In my error of email chaos, I had dropped the ball replying to his dealership during my shopping process. I was set to drive the next day to just South of Dallas because no other dealers seemed to want my business or hold true to their marketing ads of “no dealer will be us”. I was pre-approved at my bank and knew what I wanted (special order) thinking I made someone an easy sell...all the work was done apples to apples yet none seemed to respond or want to work a deal when it came down to business. Will rolled up his sleeves and worked with me directly to earn my business before handing me over to one of his amazing team members Edgar Cruz. I only set foot in the dealership to submit my order and do paperwork in/out hassle free in about an hour! Edgar Cruz was very attentive and proactive keeping me up to date just about daily for about a month until delivery of my Jeep. Edgar’s attention to detail and professionalism is top notch.

Edgar impressed me most after the sell. I need it add-ons he was knowledgeable on where to get the items I needed for my vehicle. again he was very patient and made sure I was satisfied.

Buck was the first person to truly educate us on the vehicle (I’ve never owned a Jeep before) and I feel very comfortable taking full advantage of all of the features it’s packed with.

Buck’s sense of humor and genuine personality made the process stress-free. Will supported his actions to go the extra mile for my unique situation. I’ve double checked with friends and car enthusiasts and they’ve assured me the deal I got is pretty unheard of.

This dude has gone through the craziest things though. He had me on the edge of my seat as if I were watching a Quantin Tarantino movie.

Great car, great guy, couldn't have asked for better.

274,"November 29, 2018","I saw that Covert Chrysler was selling a used 2017 Toyota Sienna for a reasonable price so I called to book an appointment to test drive.  Adam picked up the phone and scheduled an appointment at my convenient.  I already know what I wanted and what to look for so we had a test drive, negotiated the price, and pay for the van in what seems like an hour.  The van's windshield has a crack and there's some small scratches on the body due to normal wear and Adam agrees to have the service center fixes that for me.

What stands out:
* Adam was nice, courteous, efficient, and did not pressure us into anything.
* Some of the used car prize here is good.
* We were not giving the typical ""run around"" xxxxxxxx like at Fred Haas Toyota in Houston.
* Sales manager did not pressure us into getting a loan or lease like some other places around Austin.

What needs to be work on:
* Our bill has a ""Finance Charge/Title Insurance"" of 400 dollars tagged on that we didn't asked for.  I had to tell Adam to have this line item removed from the bill.  I feel like these kind of charges need to be make optional and defaults to not be included.

337,"September 16, 2018","After doing some research on Jeep Grand Cherokees, I was interested in test driving and buying.  First, I went to South Point Dodge.  My experience there was terrible.  Sales person at SouthPoint didn't really know the various lines or features, furniture was torn and then of course, there was the ""let me get my manager"" bit.  They never really seemed to tell the truth as to what vehicles they had on the lot and which they didn't.  After several hours, I was literally in the office chair at SP, when I texted Covert via the cars.com app.  Within minutes Buck responded and told me they had the vehicle I was interested in and gave me the price. 

I drove to Covert.  Nice showroom and clean surroundings.  Buck was great. He showed my wife and me all the features of the GC.  Within a few minutes we were at ease and sharing a laugh.  It had been a long day up to that point, so it was definitely refreshing.  

NO pressure.  Just the facts.  It was an easy decision at that point.  I couldn't be happier with my experience and it opened my mind to purchasing a Jeep...which I'd never done before.  All in all, if you're going to by a new car, I would definitely check out Covert and ask for Buck.   No question.  Best car buying experience we've ever had.

339,"September 15, 2018","Thinking of buying a Jeep (or any Chrysler/Dodge)? I highly recommend you go to Covert and ask for Albert. Albert is one of the most knowledgeable sales people I have every worked with. I buy cars on a regular basis so I get to experience a large range of sales people.  First off, he knows his product inside and out - and this is important. Let's be honest, car sales is a high turnover business and sales guys don't spend a long time in one place to learn enough. Not Albert - he takes his job and product seriously. He knows the ins and outs of the car and the various models and features. Second, Albert is a no-pressure sales guy. His primary objective was to make sure I got what I wanted. I started talking to Albert in January of 2018 about the new JL after I saw it at CES. I finally bought one last week (September). So Albert stuck with me for 9 months - we spoke on a regular basis and he was patient and never pressured me into buying anything I didn't want. 

Kudos to Albert and Covert for First class car sales. This is the way it should be. This is my second car from Covert and first one with Albert. I'm 100% sure that I will go back there for my next car and will want to work with Albert. ",5.0

343,"September 11, 2018","This is the second Jeep I have purchased in 6 months.  I purchased the first in April and they helped me decide what features/trim I wanted then found the exact car.  It was a Sterling edition with the luxury and safety packages.  I am so thankful I got the safety packages because in August I was rear ended while going 60 mph - the car was totalled but no one was injured.  All because of Jeep's safety features!!!

In September I was back in the market for a new car.  Just what I wanted - haggle over a car twice in 6 months - haha!  Seriously I went straight to Buck and he helped me find another car.  I loved the Sterling edition - it had more features than I needed - now I have a high altitude and it has even more bells and whistles (and of course the safety features).  

Both times I worked with Buck for sales and Chris in finance.  They are both great guys - entertaining, nice and professional!  I just hope I don't need them again in 6 more months!!  

This is actually our 3rd purchase with this Covert dealership - I recommend this dealership and Buck and Chris to anyone!

Hopefully this kind, yet honest review will get me that cargo net I have always dreamed of (hint hint Buck).

He just so happened upon a listing on TrueCar for one at your dealership that had not been officially listed yet. Even though it was the Labor Day holiday, Edgar was responsive to all my husbands questions. Edgar answered all of his questions, and even took the time to send photos.  

By Wednesday we had a deposit down, and working out to pick up the car this Friday, or Saturday. Things got a little crunched with both of our occupations, and a toddler. So we asked for delivery last minute to meet here in Katy, TX tomorrow. Which was absolutely no issue. Big thumbs up! 

Absolutely the best experience buying a car, sight unseen. We are avid Land Rover owners. We currently have a 2004 Discover II SE, a 2013 LR2, and now an addition of a 2008 LR3. If we ever have a need for another vehicle I hope Edgar is still there to assist, cause we will have no thoughts to contact him.

I was very impressed with his eagerness to go above and beyond to make sure I was happy with my purchase. When we were leaving the dealership that day he said, “My service doesn’t stop here, please do not hesitate to reach out if there is anything I can do.” He followed up multiple times just thank me for my purchase and making sure I was still happy with my Jeep.

His ability to connect with clients and add personal touches to the car buying experience is remarkable. I was super nervous about buying my first car, especially since my dad is 1,200 miles away and couldn't physically be here to help me through the process. Buck talked with my dad on the phone when it came down to final decision-making and was so patient and knowledgeable as my dad had a lot of questions. My dad has bought a lot of cars in his life and he too says that Buck is the best he's ever worked with. I traded in my old car and bought my new one at an AWESOME price, and paid much less than I expected to. Buck made the whole experience easy, fun and hassle-free for me and I now have the cutest compact SUV that matches my personality and lifestyle perfectly. I feel like I can reach out to him any time about anything car-related, which is a huge stress reliever! I am so thankful for Buck's patience, knowledge, and honesty throughout the process... it truly made a world of difference.

As for the entire Covert CDJR staff, they couldn't be friendlier or more hospitable. I was greeted enthusiastically every time I went in there and each staff person I interacted with seemed to genuinely care about the quality of my experience there.

469,"March 18, 2018","Four months ago, I began my relationship with Covert and its been nothing short of incredible. I've had many cars from many dealers in my life, from Ford and Honda as a teenager to Mercedes-Benz and Porsche as an adult. Some of those dealer experiences were the average experience that you would expect from average dealerships. And some of them were deeply disappointing. None of them were in a class that you could call ""Covert"". 

I had come to the end of my lease term on my latest Porsche. I was being chased by a few dealerships trying to get me into another Porsche, but their lazy and arrogant approach really started to turn me off to the brand, even after so many years of driving their cars. I decided I wanted something different. I began looking for a sports car that would really get my adrenaline going whenever I walked into my garage. I thought about the dream cars of my youth that I hadn't already experienced and started looking around. I had been to a few of the luxury sports car dealers here in Austin and San Antonio and been shocked at the terrible customer service I had received. I've been in sales for 25 years...the high-pressure/low-knowledge sales pitches I was being given were embarrassing. What was going on? Didn't ANYONE understand the art of sales? Eventually, I found my way to Covert. And that's when everything changed.

I walked into the dealership one afternoon and started looking at the Dodge Challenger in the showroom. I was approached by the Sales Manager who was very friendly and chatted with me about what I might be looking for. I told him I was looking for a ""mid-life crisis car"" and we both laughed. I said that although I knew nothing about them, I was interested in a Hellcat. He smiled and introduced me to one of his salespeople, J Breidor, who began to show me around and talk to me about all the unique details of the Hellcat engine. J never pushed me in a particular direction or asked what I could afford or tried to find out how soon I was looking to close a deal...he didn't do any of the typical things you find with most salespeople. He focused simply on helping me with my decision. Was the Hellcat the mid-life crisis car I was looking for? He came from the place I was coming from...excitement, adventure, adrenaline. And he made the experience of considering a Hellcat exactly what it should be. Fun.

And so I ordered one. 

I can tell you this, I would have walked out of there just as fast as I had walked out of the other dealerships if J had been the kind of salesperson who was focused only on making money and not on establishing a relationship with a client. All through the process, J spent as much time as I wanted to take me on test drives, talk me through all of the questions I had, and anticipate questions I didn't even know how to ask because I knew so little about the car. Being with J was like taking a masterclass in how to have the ultimate driving experience. He didn't tell me about a car...he revealed the secrets of the amazing machine known as The Hellcat.

The thing about J that sets him apart is that he innately understands what true client relationship management really is. To most salespeople, the sale is the only thing that matters...the goal to be reached and the end of the process. To a professional like J, the sale is only the beginning. When my car was being built, J sent me updates at every point in the car's assembly and texted me a photo of it when it arrived. Since then, J calls me up just to talk about the Hellcat and make sure everything is going Hellishly. He often invites me by the dealership to show me options for the car and to let me see any new Hellcat that has come in. He also contacts me just to ask how my week is going. He is an expert at client relationship management. 

If Covert is ever unlucky enough to lose this guy, then I hope it's because he decides to start selling for my company. 

If you're looking for a car, go to Covert and ask for J Breidor. And if you're having a mid-life crisis, make sure you tell J you need a Hellcat.

Buck literally bent over backward to see that I was pleased and excited about the purchase of my car.  His interest was pleasing his customer and making me happy.  I just can't say enough positive things about Buck.  He is in a different league than any new or used car salesman I have ever dealt with.

During the trade-in process, the used car manager offered me an insultingly low offer and then lied to my face about what he would resell my vehicle for. He listed the vehicle for $4,000 more then he told me he would.

You are suppose to replace all 8 so they can all wear at the same time. Amateurs Fr 💯  wouldnt recommend anyone. I know the game they are trying to play and im not with it i know my car has other problems they just want to fix it so it can break again and again till my warranty goes out so i will have to come out of pocket but they got me twisted im goin somewhere else.,1.0
537,"July 07, 2017","Updated Review: J is great and so different than any other car salesman I have experienced during my long hstory buying cars. After making a simple inquiry with John Hawthorne in the service department about my interest in upgrading from a 2012 300 to a newer model.  I received a call from J within 20 min. After all was said and done, in less than 24hrs I was driving home in my new Chrysler 300.  He along with Conrad made the process smooth and we were literally in and out of the dealership in less than an hour.  He took the time to show me features of my new car; never rushed and making sure I was satisfied. After the sale I did come across some issues (which I am still awaiting full resolution), but so far J has been responsive, patient, friendly, knowledgable and truly understands what it means to deliver a good customer experience. If you need a car ask for J.  This is my sixth purchase from the Covert family.  While I am giving J well deserved 5-stars and am only giving Covert 4 (actually 3+) overall given their managers terrible lack of/no response to emails or phone calls. But thank you J (and John)!",3.8
538,"June 10, 2017","I visited a number of dealers in my search for a new truck, and J at Covert was by far the best sales rep I encountered.  By the time we met, I had already decided on a 2017 Ram 2500, and I had very specific requirements regarding how I wanted it configured.  J worked to find the closest match available in Texas, had it brought in so I could see it, and once I confirmed it was the right one for me he worked with Covert's service department to arrange a change that made it perfect. The entire process was easy-going, with no pressure whatsoever, and we quickly arrived at a deal I could be happy with.  After the sale, J followed up to ensure I was still pleased with the truck and the transaction. I am. My experience with J and Covert went well beyond my expectations, and I love the new Ram.  I can confidently recommend to anyone looking for a new vehicle to pay Covert a visit and ask for J, you won't be disappointed.",5.0

557,"February 24, 2017","This review is not about the folks in the service department - my experience, when I am actually able to get an appointment, is that they are good people and strive to provide decent service. Nor is this a review of their ""Express Lane"" service for oil changes and such - that seems to be working. Rather, I'm writing about service needs for other than ""Express Lane"" items. Note, if you don't have specifics for them for what you need looked at or serviced - you will likely end up frustrated. They simply don't have time to a provide a more consultative experience. But lately, the real problem has been in actually getting ahold of anyone to schedule a  service appointment. I left several messages for a callback to schedule my last appointment. All calls ALWAYS rolled to voicemail. Over a period of two weeks, and after several messages, I never got a call back so finally I drive down to the dealership to make an appointment in person! That seems to be the only way to get an appointment now - and they seem to be scheduling at minimum two weeks out or more now. They are clearly overwhelmed - and it's disappointing that this issue has been neglected and left to get worse and worse. At present,  I again need to take my vehicle in for a non ""Express Lane"" issue. I've given up leaving voicemails - no callback yet again. And I don't have time, nor desire, to drive down and schedule in person. I’m taking my business elsewhere. Further, I won’t be purchasing vehicles from Covert going forward. The fact that the continuing and worsening service issues I've referenced are clearly not being addressed is a glaring a red flag. The presales service was excellent but these post sales experiences have more than negated. To the Coverts, if you care about your customers, please fix this issue.

568,"December 21, 2016","We researched extensively for this purchase. Cowboy was patient and did not try to sell us on stuff we didn't want. Our requirements for a truck were not the usual ones (4x4, all the bells and whisles, etc.), and Cowboy sought to identify with our reasoning and see the purchase through our eyes. Kept up good communication and was upbeat throughout. When a complication with sourcing the vehicle arose Cowboy remained objective and exerted himself within his management structure to champion our position. It looked like he pushed when needed, yet also exercised good timing and tact. Would absolutely recommend Cowboy to any friend. He observes your knowledge and does not take advantage; rather, he seeks to inform and seems to draw energy from helping others create their own knowledge of matters of which he is an expert. Thanks Cowboy! Just one thing: thank the Lord for Tennessee or else there'd be no Texas! 

I don't want to leave out Ms. Porras, who presented financing and associated options in an efficient, patient manner. She was very knowledgeable and clearly anticipated our questions.

591,"September 29, 2016","My wife and I just purchased a 2016 Grand Cherokee from Covert Jeep Dodge Chrysler and Cowboy Goodman was our sales person.  Don’t know what I can add to the great reviews about Covert and Cowboy except to tell you that they are all true.  We have never had such an enjoyable vehicle purchase before, and we have bought many cars. 

This was the end of the 2016 season and 17’s were already on the lot, so we pretty much had to take what was available.  We had a wish list of features and Cowboy told us not to worry, because he would find the right vehicle, even if it was not on the Covert lot.  Amazingly he got on his computer and found our perfect match somewhere in Texas.  Cowboy was able to get the most important items on our wish list and even save us money.

In negotiations, my wife always takes the lead and I just sit back and watch her work.  Cowboy calls her “Boss Lady.”  We are going back to only owning one car and had two trade in’s for our deal. Covert appraised our cars, but when “Boss Lady” presented Cowboy with other appraisals we had brought, they were immediately considered.
“Boss Lady, I never want to play poker with you!” was Cowboy’s reply.  He marched back to Bart, the sales manager, with the figures and Bart was able to match our evaluations.  No hassle, no fuss. Our sale was finalized and we are now simply happily waiting for our new Jeep Grand Cherokee to come in.  

It’s really hard for us to imagine purchasing a vehicle in the future from anybody except Cowboy and Covert.

It was not a good experience. I told them I was going up to Covert next to check what they had. 
 
I knew as soon as I walked into the Covert dealership and was greeted by Cowboy that it was going to be a better experience.

We went before we were really ready to move on it just to get an idea of what we'd be looking at; and we even took the title with us just in case the numbers worked out.

While we weren't actually able to come to an arrangement that made sense for us to trade the Durango early, we were so impressed with Cowboy that -

A. We are going to be trading the Durango in to him whether we get the other car from their dealership or not.
B. I am desperately trying to set something up so I can only deal with Cowboy even if I have to get the car I want from a different dealership.
C. When we are ready to buy another Durango or possibly a pickup (wife saw a Ram she really liked on the lot), we are going back to him for that as well.

Although he politely asked early on if we were looking to trade the vehicle for anything else, after we told him we weren't at that time, he did not pressure us even once into making a separate purchase.

This is the sales person you want to deal with when you're making a major purchase. He is just flat out honest and straightforward. If the numbers can't be made to work they can't be made to work and he'll just tell you and never string you along.

I got steering damper, steering linkage, upper and lower ball joints both sides, both hubs, pitman arm all replaced. They kept my truck for 2 weeks, got it back thoughts it is all good. Now comes March 2016 and I am driving down the road and my steering damper falls off my truck causing it to wobble so bad I have to pull over. I got under my truck and look at the steering damper and the bolt was gone!!!.  That should never happen. I go into Covert Dodge soon after to tell them about the problem and they proceed to just put the bolt I had to buy at napa back on, mind you this isn't an OEM bolt or do I even know if it is the right bolt to use and they just went ahead and used it anyways. Then they tell me my sway bar links are bad and that is why I am getting such a bad wobble. I take their word for it and spend 210 to fix that problem. Another week goes by and my truck is wobbling really bad. So this time i take it to someone else to get a second opinion of why this is happening and the mechanic tells me both my upper and lower ball joints need to be replaced, my hubs need to be replaced and track bar. Mind you I just got all that replaced not even 5 months ago. So now I am really mad and I call the GM(Buddy Hagman) and service manager(Dustin Prien) to get this problem fixed because this is the 3rd I had to bring my truck in and take off work when this all should of been replaced the very first time. So I go in and the service manager( Dustin Prien) doens't even acknowledge that there is a problem or even bother to say anything to me along the lines of lets get this thing fixed. So after 3 hours of waiting I finally have someone talk to me and say they will look at the truck and set me up with a loaner. At this point I am thinking fine you are getting my truck looked at and I have a vehicle ok I am not too mad. That was a Friday. The following Tuesday I get a call from Paul saying that my truck does need to be worked on. He says that my upper and lower balljoints both sides need replaced which is covered by warranty. Then he procedures to tell me that i need a new track bar, pitman arm and steering linkage, steering damper and that will cost 1,000$  to fixed. HERE IS THE IMPORTANT PART-  I got pitman arm, steering linkage, steering damper all changed when they replaced my front end the first time and now they are trying to charge me again it instead of doing it under manufacturer warranty.

He knew that i was just looking at the time and he still took the time to walk me around the lot and show me trucks in my price range. We found one that fit my needs ,but i still needed to make one more stop at another dealer. Cowboy was not a pressure kind of salesman we have all encountered in our car buying experiences. kI told him that i would think about it and gave him my card incase something new came in. a couple of days later he gave me a call to tell me that they had just gotten another truck on a trade in and wanted to know if i was still in the market( no other salesman or dealership called to follow up with me).I met with Cowboy that afternoon and by chance they still had the first truck i went to look at. long story told, i ended up buying that truck.

I finally decided to call back and, similar to another posting, I was told very nicely that they will need to keep the car for 1-2 weeks and that the list for a loaner was 25 deep, so good luck if you have only that one car. It will basically sit on the lot waiting instead of blocking time with an appointment and see the car.  It is just a diagnostic at this point, not sure why they'll need to keep the car up to 2 weeks for that.

Mark has been the only person to even provide significant feedback.

674,"December 31, 2015","Our experience at Covert Dodge & Jeep was very pleasant and straight forward, especially in comparison to other dealerships in the area. We spent a lot of timing researching what the best midsized suv was for our needs, and spent our first day looking at vehicles. When we met with Cowboy, he was receptive to our requests and did not try to sell us something we did not want or need. 

A few days later we decided to trade in our old vehicle for a Jeep Grand Cherokee, and test drove a few at a few other dealerships in town. Although they had the cars that we were for, there customer experience and desire to haggle on price lead us out the door. When we went back to covert, Cowboy was able to quickly find the Grand Cherokee we were looking for and was able to give us a very fair price for our car! He even went as far as to have the car detailed and fueled up while we were filling out the paperwork. All in all, I would highly recommend working with the Covert family and Cowboy for your next vehicle. You will not be disappointed!",5.0

I try to show them the email confirmation that I have and they said they don't have anyone working there by that name.  Like I was lying about it!  I ask to speak to the manager and a clueless guy named Tim comes out and tells me I'll have to wait 2+ hours for an 'express' oil change even though I have an appointment.  I was furious after buying a 6 package oil change from Chrysler and spending $3k on a lifetime warranty and figured if I was going to have to deal with rude idiots like this then I was going to contact Chrysler and get a refund on both.

I told him ok, and hopefully they could diagnose the problem the day I drop it off.   The rep said it would take another 2 - 3 days for them to even look at my Jeep once it is dropped of.   Seems to me that if you make an appointment, you should be able to have your Jeep looked at that same day.

If you can buy from anyone else, I would highly recommend you do so.  This is a terrible company and has terrible respect for its prior customers.
Even delivered the new jeep without an inspection sticker.....they said they forgot to service the vehicle and I could bring it back in and get it done.  I live over 250 miles away, so we took care of it at a local dealership.

First off any idiot knows you never get a title until the loan is paid in full.  After getting the run around and being lied to about the 2000 the finance lady blamed it on the salesman saying he didn't give the right amount... And then started back tracking on the fact that they hold 2000 until they receive the title.   I work for a bank and personally know that is not how things should be handled with an auto loan.  Secondly a month goes by still have not received my license plates  I called covert and they told me ohh yeah they are here just come by and get them hahaha I live four hours away after asking the lady to mail them to me she then rudely hung up on me without verifying where they were to be mailed...

Yesterday my preferred sales guy, Sam Childs at Covert called me to tell me I can buy my car as its finally in the system. i went there and the process was quick and efficient, the financial manager got me a good APR deal, and they done the trade in estimation in 5 minutes. On top of that as my car is not delivered before the 17, Sam arranged a loaner for me, a nice Challenger R/T. I went to many dealers when I was searching for a small car to buy, and Covert is the dealership that really doesn't pressure you into buying a car NOW.

He communicates so professionally, he was always so polite, he makes the experience personal and I felt like my customer was in good hands. Mike kept me apprised of the Customer's purchase more frequently than any other dealer representative has. I have been in finance and lending for many years and I know good quality service. Mike does not come short of providing such service. Mike truly shows that the customer is his top priority and that was very impressive!

694,"May 19, 2014","Well let's start off by saying that once I figured out the exact truck I was looking for, then I started getting prices from 25 different dealers around the state of Texas. I called Covert and spoke with Jeff Thomas and explained the truck I was looking for and he gave me a drive out price that was way cheaper than any of the other 25 dealerships. I even tried to see if some of the dealerships close to my house could beat Coverts price. They told me there was no way they could beat the price I received from Covert. So I decided to buy the truck and I already had financing with a really good interest rate. After talking with Jeff about the final numbers he felt pretty confidant that they could beat the interest rate I had.  I thought to myself there was no way but I would let them try. Irene Porras called me a couple hrs later and verified all the paperwork with me and informed me that I qualified for a lower interest rate with one of there lenders. So they just made a great deal even better!!! The truck was delivered to my house and everything was just like Jeff and I had discussed. 

Thank You Covert Dodge and especially Jeff Thomas and Irene Porras for not only getting me the best deal on my truck but for exceptional customer service!!!! I will  highly recommend Covert Dodge !!
