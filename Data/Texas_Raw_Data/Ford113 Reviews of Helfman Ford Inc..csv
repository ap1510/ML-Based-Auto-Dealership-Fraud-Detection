19,"November 03, 2019","Well, where to start. Been a return multiple vehicle buyer here for years and had a terrible service experience last  week, after towing it to helfman from across town. Took 3 days just to look at it and 4 to repair. Then talked  to sales about trading it in for a new expedition max listed at 76k and got a whpping 2500 off. I have gotten three offers from other dealers for the exact same vehicle with over 12k off and 35k trade in opposed to the 25k you offered on a 2 year old vehicle that i purchased from you the same time i purchased an f150. After purchasing 6 vehicles from you, Say good bye to my business. Insulting and complete disregard from my historic loyalty.  ",1.0

21,"September 22, 2019","Every person I interacted with at Helfman, from entering their lot for the first time to driving out with my new vehicle, was helpful and professional. At so many other dealers, it feels like your value relies solely on your decision to purchase or not, but at Helfman I felt like they really cared if I felt I was making the right decision. This is how it should feel everywhere. More dealers could learn from the example set by Helfman. ",5.0
22,"September 10, 2019","Brock is my salesman,  he handled everything by phone for me, sent pictures, and numbers. He made the dealerships here in Corpus Christi scratch their heads and say no way he can make that kind of deal, the dealership in San Antonio said can't match that , go buy from him.

38,"January 08, 2019","Kenny provided an awesome buying experience!  He is such a pleasure to work with that I sent a colleague that was looking for a vehicle over to see him.  Kenny is very knowledgeable about the vehicles he sells and took time to go over all of the features of the vehicle before I left the dealership.  I must say that at the age of 58 I have purchased a lot of vehicles in my life.  Buying from Kenny was by far the best buying experience that I have ever had. 
 I will continue to refer friends to him and will definitely return to buy from him the next time I need a vehicle. ",5.0
39,"January 08, 2019","Helfman Ford makes the buying experience pleasant and painless. John Williamson, was very responsive and prompt. Unlike other sales people he never tried to push us into buying. He took his time to demonstrate all the features of the truck. ",4.6
40,"January 04, 2019","I initially contacted your dealership as I was interested in the Ranger (So much so that I drove one at a demo in N. Houston).   As I had a Tundra I also wanted to look at the F150.  Ryan was my contact and I have emailed him over 10 times with various queries and called multiple times. I looked at Joe Myers Ford (To compare the deal presented - they are horrible, btw.  More info available upon request). Ryan pointed out that the F150 while larger, had many of the features of the Ranger, and that the 2018's were discounted besides.  This occured in early December.  I looked at Cheverolet's, Ram's (Which ride better, although the F150 is very good.  Ram's are also more expensive), and Toyota.  I had nearly decided on a Ranger (I like the size pretty well, but at 6'3"" they are more constricted in feel - and I would prefer the seat to go back a bit more.  The rear seats would be usable for storage for the most part, but are not comfortable for people.  Rangers do have prettier body work, but are also mostly steel). I took my wife by to drive the F150, and she liked the way it drove better than any other brand/model.  (So did I - the Ram is a close 2nd but the size is huge). The deal Ryan presented was the best with the greatest possible savings for me, he invariably was polite and helpful even when I kept going back with more questions, with no sales gimmicks of quoting one price and when you get there to obtain said price you had to finance for long term and high interest rate (See Joe Meyers Ford for this).  When we finally determined we wanted a sport model F150, he showed us the colour choices you had (These were all 2018 - I looked briefly at 2019's if your wondering) and had the additional accessories desired dealer installed - bed liner and tie down hardpoints).  Very pleased with the truck - the seats are better than I thought and the amount of space is much greater than my old Tundra, even though the overall size is nearly identical.  When we did the financing (Forgive me, but I don't remember his whole name) he too was exceptional.  When I bought the Tundra it was a special order but even so it took several hours of waiting for the paperwork to be completed and they tried hard to sell the various extended warranty items. He presented it as a good idea but there was no heavy pressure to buy them, which we appreciated. The next time I need a car I will contact Ryan Tijerina at Helfman Ford.",5.0
41,"November 29, 2018","What I like about Helfman, I regularly recieved updates pertaining completion date. Joe Lopez would regularly send e-mail with what phase was completed with the target completion date.",5.0
42,"November 15, 2018",Marcus Warren was extremely helpful and made the whole experience painless and speedy.  He went above and beyond my expectations while maintaining a courteous and friendly demeanor.  He even offered an after-sale tutorial to make sure that I understood how to operate the high-tech aspects of my new vehicle.  A+,5.0
43,"November 13, 2018",I had the greatest experience in purchasing two vehicles on the same day at Helfman. Mr. Enoch Murphy is the most knowledgable and experienced sales agent that i have ever met in my years of buying automobiles. He had the patience throughout the entire three month process of waiting on me. But at the end he was still a person i would deal with at any time. He was never pushy or tried to sell us something we did not want. Mr. Murphy did such a wonderful job in taking care of both my wife and I on our new purchase. He served us with the utmost high standards you could ask for. All parts of the purchasing process went seamless without any headaches. He is our hero.,5.0
44,"November 06, 2018",My service advisor Cory L. took my call and learned more about the issue I was having with my car. He seamlessly worked with my extended warranty to get the repair done. He communicated when work was done and let me know if my truck needed anything further (he’s never recommended anything that wasn’t needed) I like his integrity. I come to this dealership for service b/c of him. ,4.2
45,"November 05, 2018","Ryan Tijerina is excellent - very knowledgeable and very patient!  I started out by requesting information about models and pricing via the internet.  When I went to the dealership I was very pleased to find the information was spot on - no hidden agendas.    Ryan listened carefully and was sure to match my needs to the right vehicle.  I highly recommend Ryan and Helfman.

49,"August 26, 2018","We have purchased new and used vehicles from Helfman Ford over more than 15 years.  Though rarely needed he service department has performed excellent service on our vehicles.  The parts department is also courteous and helpful.  Our most recent new vehicle purchase was especially noteworthy.  Kenny Baker was an absolute pleasure to work with at Helfman Ford.  We didn't know exactly what we wanted other than an F150.  Kenny was extremely knowledgeable about the F150 and took the time to educate us on the different trim levels and optional features.  My wife uses a wheelchair and we explained our plan for her to be driving the F150 with special handicapped modifications.  Kenny took the time to understand how that would affect our vehicle purchase.  Kenny was considerate of my wife’s disability and brought several F150 examples to the front lot.  We got inside them, and Kenny explained the differences between each example, so my wife could see them and compare.  This helped us to make the best purchase decision for us.  Once we settled on the F150 we wanted Kenny offered an excellent sale price that we immediately accepted.  After the financing was finished Kenny introduced us to our new F150 and again demonstrated our trucks specific features and optional settings.  We can't say enough about how happy we are with Kenny’s professionalism and the sales experience.  My wife and I are in our 50s and we have bought quite a few vehicles through the years.  By far this was the best sales experience we have ever had.  We would never hesitate to recommend Kenny and Helfman Ford to our family and friends.  Thank you Kenny Baker and Helfman Ford!",5.0

53,"July 10, 2018","I was hoping to get a survey just because I want to say what a great service advisor Corey is. He’s been our service advisor for a long time and he is always extremely helpful and keeps me advised of the status of our car.   My son moved to San Antonio after college and a few times when he’s been home we’ve noticed issues with his car. He needed it to be checked out or repaired quickly while he’s home. Corey has always helped in every way he can to get the car looked at and fixed under time restraints. He is very knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful!  ",5.0
54,"June 24, 2018","Jack Lowe was very helpful, easy going, and down to earth.  Jack profesionally took care of things throughout the whole process... Even down to wiping off minor smuges before I received the f150 I purchased from Helfman Ford.  Thanks Jack for being friendly and providing such a nice experience. ",4.8
55,"June 01, 2018","I highly recommend Hellman Ford!  Jack Lowe and Scott Easley were wonderful to work with and provided great service.  I purchased a 2018 Explorer the same day I test drove it.  The price was better than other dealerships and there was no funny business with the negotiated price. 

Jack has been in the car business 30 years and Scott for over 23.  The professionalism was spot on and reminded me of working with my father-in-law when he sold cars before he retired.  Gus in finance was quick and not pushy about any of the extras.  He was very efficient and nice. 

Thank you Jack & Scott for a pleasant experience! ",5.0
56,"May 24, 2018","Ken Baker was outstanding! He really worked hard at making my experience great. He was really responsive and informational with my needs. I did not feel pressured and he made sure that I was comfortable with my decision. I'm sure there are other sale people that offer the same, but I will continue to deal with Ken every chance I get.

62,"April 03, 2018","I bought a Ford Fiesta from these guys earlier this month. My ability to buy a car from Helfman Ford was a miracle, facilitated by Brock Davenport and approved by the business owners. Only miracle can describe my experience with these guys. Before I went to them, many dealerships have rejected me and my $1500 down-payment because I had a repossession and my credit was bad. I just decided to give these guys a try and then give up on the prospect of owning a car anytime soon. And there comes Brock. This guy worked HARD for me. Literally. No one has ever taken ownership of my problem the way Brock did. And even when the finance guys couldn't find a bank to finance the car for me, he took my case to the owners and got them into my situation. I had to go home on my first day after he took my case to the owners and they couldn't give him something concrete. I left and thought it was over for me. Imagine my surprise when Brock called me the next day telling me to come get my car because I have been approved. Before then I had to rent a car to go to work. Some days I could afford it some other days I could not. And my lack of car put enormous pressure on my relationship with my teammates at work and I was at risk of losing my job. Then came Brock. This may sound like a fairytale story. But it is not. My name is Chinedu Ezeocha and I am a proud owner of a 2018 Ford Fiesta. That would not be possible if not for the hard work Brock Davenport put in for me and if not for the goodwill of the owners of Helfman Ford. I can refer anyone to these guys any day. They are simply humane, kind, and the best. Please go buy from them.",5.0
63,"March 18, 2018","I dealt with Marc Price (sales), after identifying a few vehicles online that I wanted to see.  He had the vehicle I was most interested in ready to go, and everything was smooth and easy.  No high pressure.

70,"January 06, 2018","After my car was a total loss due to Harvey, I purchased a 2014 Lincoln MKZ (18,000 miles) on October 7. The day I signed the papers & did another inspection of the car the trunk wouldn't open. David(Salesman) told me to bring it back  & they would fix it, but this took almost 2weeks. Then i noticed the top where the panoramic roof starts was fading & the panels on the back window were fading as well. I first text David  & he told me when i come in to get my license plate he would bring it to the managers attention. I sent the manager(Scott Adams) an email, but after not getting a response for several days, i called him & he told me to bring it in.  I took it in & he had the audacity to tell me if they had known about the fading before they would have knocked the price down. Now, i'm getting an oil change & i need 2 tires in the front....I've purchased several used cars before & this is the worst one yet, i will not recommend or would i ever purchase a car from Helfman Ford again!

Both of these men treated me more as a 'friend' than as a 'customer' which was very much appreciated. Had the pleasure of meeting Eric Helfman and was thanked for the opportunity to win my business!! How impressive is that! While I am sure there will be some bad reviews for this dealership I can assure you, while it may be another few years, the next time I am in the market for another vehicle, my first and more than likely my only stop will be Helfman Ford..........",5.0
86,"February 15, 2017",I went into the dealership to get a state inspection and oil change and asked about to recall notices I had received.  I was told that the one would take 4 hours.  They were very good and able to get it done in about 2.5 - 3 hours.  My service writer was very good to help arrange the completion of my service visit as I was waiting on my vehicle.  Thank you for a job well done.,5.0
87,"January 31, 2017","Earl Mcfarlane sold me my first F-150 three years ago and because of the great experience I had then I bought my second F-150 from Earl and Helfman Ford. Helfman did not have the model in the color and interior package I wanted and he located a truck locally which was to be delivered on Monday. After the add-ons I ordered were completed I was able to pick up my truck on Tuesday. Earl is very knowledgeable with all aspects of the truck as well as no-nonsense when it came to what the best sales price he was able to secure. Also, because we were repeat customers and loyal Ford customers (have purchased 5 Ford vehicles) Eric Helfman further reduced the sales price and came by to meet us personally to thank us for the business. Very nice touch.  ",5.0

We bought a 2016 Focus and a 2017 Escape and we loved our experience and we love our new cars. I haven't had to buy a car in 7 years and everyone of these guys made us feel like we were their only customers. I felt like they handled us with white gloves. I'm a BMW guy and Helfman gives even the best BMW dealers a run for their customer service. Special thanks to Mr. Helfman himself for taking a picture of us and our cars, with John handing over the keys. We will refer everyone we know to Helfman for their next vehicle purchase. ",5.0

102,"July 21, 2015","I purchased a 2006 f150.  At the point of sale i noticed the back sliding window did not worked properly, I asked for it to be replaced or repaired for the sale to happen or the price to be discounted, they replied by saying they would replace the window.  I asked if i could have the work done when i picked up the metal license plates, they said it would be perfect.  I call the dealership after almost two months of purchase to find out if the plates were in.  Nothing.  Two days later I called Willian my sales person, he said they had tried to call us for the past two weeks, because the truck needed to be inspectes for plates to be obtained, I checked our records no calls.  I brougth the truck on 7/14/15 in for inspection, window replacement and oil change ( which i paid for, as it should be).  On 7/14/15 at 2:45 pm I was told the window will not be replaced and the truck was ready.  I called back to talk to William and he respondend with, ""his used car sales manager Bob Slush will not replace the window"".  After many attempts, I finally got a hold of Bob and it took me explaining the situation and him checking the story for himself to authorize the service to be done.  After not getting any information all morning on my truck on 7/16/15, i decided to call and find out the status of the truck.  I received a call back from William, asking me if i had pick up the truck and if i new where my keys were?  A dealership loosing someone's keys and not knowing if a vehicle is still at their dealership?  Well i received the call saying they had found the truck and would start working on fixing the back window and would be ready on 7/17/15.  Today 7/17/15, I started the calls about 10:00AM.  No word on the truck, then later received a call from William, the truck will not be ready today and he told me, ""I am only a sales person, I have no control or information on what is going on with your truck"", so I aske for Bob to call me back, he did, two hours later, telling me ""the service department did not know when the truck would be ready, the part they ordered was not the correct for the shortcut they tried to take, tell had order the correct part now, but no one arround them has the part and they do not know when they would get it"".  I lost it and i told him how can a back window take this long to repair, and if he spected me to go a week without a car, he responded "" I do not know what to tell you, you just have to wait, because I do not know"".  I hung up the phone, because the next thing out of my mouth would not have been nice at all.  I called back and ask to speak with the service manager, and explained the whole situation.  He told me the same story Bob had, first ordered the wrong part, now correct part was ordered, did not know when the part would come in, did not know what to tell me.  I asked to be transfered back to Bob, asked him if i could get a loanner, he replied he need it to check if they could get me one.  It took me to called them back once more to find they had a loanner ready for me.  I got to the dealership and they had a truck similar to mime.  Checked the truck, engine light on, at 50mph weels shake and it pulls to right.  I at least could go to work without asking for a ride. Friday 7/18/15 no phone call all day.  I called and asked for thw service team to check on my truck ( 4:30pm ).  They are finishing with thr truck and i can pick up.  Get to the dealership at about 5:30pm, no one new where the keys had been placed or that i had a loaner, no apology for the delay at any time.  This is why, I will make every effort possible, not to take my vehicle to this dealership (helfman ford , or any helfman dealerships) .",1.0

Section they slap inspection stickers on and will tell you how it's gone through a serious point graded inspection before they will allow it on there lot which is untrue they disable security on there vehicles as well and offer to re-enable it for a fee

104,"September 27, 2013","Simply put this service department makes repair recommends based on assumptions.  Just wanted our vehicle to be checked out completely before recommending a $600 part when all that was needed was a $90 part.  Just because other vehicles have had similar issues doesn't mean mine has the same one .  Check it out before you ask me fork over $600.00.  Remember service advisors get paid commission on your repairs .  Biggest customer service failure is when Service Manager, Charles Taylor, told me that they had a great customer rating and that he had plenty of cars waiting to be repaired.  He said we were welcome to take my vehicle elsewhere for a second opinion.  We have bought 3 ford vehicles from Helfman (SUVs/truck)  and with all the visits to service department none of them have been up to par on  customer service or service quality. ",1.0
105,"July 09, 2013","I was very disappointed in the body work done to my car here. I probably could have gone to some no-named shop and had better work done. My insurance does work through them though, so I had no choice. First off, they took WAY longer than expected. The had the date set for 2 weeks after I brought my car in and when that 2 weeks after came, the date was changed to the next week. I assume this happened because they are lazy and since it was through insurance they didn't even try getting it done sooner. They also put a crack in my windshield, which they claim was there before and a ""rock"" had started it. There is no rock mark. I now have to go through my insurance again to get this taken care of, which takes up even more of my time. I really did expect more from Ford, but maybe it was just this location that has horrible body shop workers.",2.3
106,"April 15, 2013","I couldn't be happier with the new car that Larry Krichmar sold me! 

I had been emailing different dealers for prices on the car that I wanted, and no one even came close to Larry's offer. I went to the dealership thinking that I would have to order the exact car that I wanted, but when I got there, they had a nearly identical car. Larry made me an offer that I absolutely could not refuse, and I drove off as one completely satisfied customer!",5.0
107,"August 10, 2012","I wasn't to happy with the service I received at the body shop. I was refereed by my insurance company as them being the preferred body shop in my area. It took way longer than quoted. There is a small ding right in the middle of their repair, and part of the repair was to send one wheel out to get refinished. After waiting an extra three days to get the wheel back, it came unbalanced. I had to take my car somewhere else to get the tire balanced.

The person I dealt with did not keep me apprised of the progress of my repairs, I always had to cal and either be put on hold while he checked on it, or call him back in a few minutes.",2.8
108,"July 30, 2012","I have a 1997 F-350 with a manifold exhaust leak.I took it to Helfman for and estimate.Elaine was the service rep. Patrick was the mechanic.
This is a serious leak, requiring serious work. Patrick tightened the manifold bolts and said take it home and see how that is. When I got on the the highway one of the cylinders started missing. I've had this truck for 8 years and it's never missed. No miss, took it to them, miss - they did something. And, the gas leak was as bad as ever, no change. I went in expecting a serious approach to the problem. My wife and I are getting sick from the fumes in the cab and Ford's response is to tighten some bolts. They charged me $103 for that bit of insult.
I brought it back the next morning. After an hour and a half Dennis, I had fired Elaine/Patrick for gross incompetence, bring me in and shows me the spark plug cable for the offending cylinder. The boot is all destroyed and torn up.It's arcing directly to the manifold.Anybody who has clue 1 about automotive knows you can't put on a boot that exposes the electrics - it's going to arc.That's why Patrick was fired. During his feeble attempt to fix a serious exhaust problem by tightening a few bolts he had seriously damaged the wire and boot causing the arcing. That's no big deal. Leaving me to drive away like that is.
Dennis came at me with an FU estimate to fix the manifold, north of $2500, probably closer to $3000. His biggest pitch was to line me up with a salesman for new trucks. If you don't want to fix my truck, don't waste my time. I'm cool with that.
Dennis was ready to fix the wire. I stopped him when he said the wires came as a set of 8 for $140, plus labor to install. FYI Pep Boys has wires for $19, $27, $39. My total cost at PepBoys including tax was less that what Ford wanted for the parts.

Incompetent, slimy are the two words I would choose to best describe this dealership. Rip off's not bad either, I received nothing of value for my $104. ",1.6

112,"July 14, 2008","This is one of the worst dealerships to deal with.  The service rep that I dealt with for service was rude to me and other customers in the room.  The car was there for five days, and the day it was done, she neglected to call us and tell us the car was done.  She stated that she told us when it was done and she didn't have to call us again.  Well seeing that she told us that it would be done Thursday, then Friday, it wasn't completed until Monday at around 4pm, but was completed hours before hand.  I will never do business with this dealership ever again.  I will continue doing business with Legacy Ford.",2.4
