0,"July 17, 2018","I have to say that this was the least stressful car buying experience I have ever had! I inquired about a New Corolla and was offered exactly what I wanted. No pressure, Jim even made sure I had the exact options I wanted. The price was great, no bait and switch or surprises at all when I went to do paperwork. This was the most pleasant experience I have ever had at any dealership. It truly felt as if I was doing business with someone I have known for ages. I highly recommend Jim Clifton to everyone! ",5.0
1,"April 28, 2010","worked with joann.  she was very rude.  refused to negotiate price of vehicle at all.  basically said pay sticker price(msrp) or go elsewhere.  also wouldn't return emails.  when we were trying to do some negotiating, she tried to change the price previously quoted for trade-in.  used a lot of old school tactics to try and confuse me.  will never do business with her.
