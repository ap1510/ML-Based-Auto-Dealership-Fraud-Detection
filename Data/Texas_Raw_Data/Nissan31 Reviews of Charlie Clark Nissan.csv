0,"May 25, 2020",My daughter is looking on trading in her car for a new 2020 Nissan Sentra spoke to Kim Rodriguez and agreed on trying to go on Saturday May 23 which we ended up going on in the evening she had left for the day and another salesperson said he could help us out we agreed since we live on the east of town and had a long drive I specifically told him what we were looking at and agreed to see the breakdown in paper to see where we at.  The salesperson didnt even bother in breaking it down with discounts offered thru Nissan was asking for 30 to 40 percent down asked him about Memorial Day specials in which make me think his lack of training and knowledge didnt go in helping instead was asking for down payment which the payment was gonna come out to 535 monthly when daughter has a credit score of 717 I was highly dissatisfied on his customer service in trying to help out didnt even get no manager or supervisor explain either which training is all all around needed.  Now this morning Kim is aware of email in which I did reply for the service going back and forth in messages it was going good conversation apologizing and I was even considering on trying to give her a chance and then I told her I am very aware how salesperson work so for any car purchasing that you make the down payment given is what the salesperson makes so she replied back  that the reason he was asking down payment was that there was negative equity at this point I said why try to deal with RIP offs and what ever happen to customer service so buyers do your homework first I know salesperson need to make money but they still get there commission on the sale manager was gonna call me I told her to avoid the call I'm not driving all the way over to be upset all over again I dont recommend buying just go somewhere else where theres true customer service I hope Charly goes and I even went cause Charly was in town,1.0
1,"September 12, 2019",I purchased a 2019 titan and traded in my 2017 Murano. I told the finance person to please cancel my gap insurance so I could get my refund back. well to find out that it was never canceled after I went in person to sign papers to cancel it. I was so disappointed to find out that my gap insurance money was used to lower the purchase on my new vehicle without my consent. they never told me that they could just take my refund and use it towards the vehicle. ,3.4
2,"September 10, 2019","I took in my Juke Nismo , Jose Hernandez, the Service Lane Manager ,got the car in for service, Matthew  Farias in the Service Department took care of dealing with the insurance warranty, kept me and my husband informed  of the progress. Matthew's dedication to customer service was indeed  a reason for us to take all our car needs to Charlie Clark Service Department in the future. Great management and service Team under the supervision of Ram Garcia, Executive Manager.",5.0

4,"May 31, 2019","I purchased a vehicle back in October 2018, and till this day i have not received my contract or agreements. 2018 Nissan Murano, I am having to pay 38K for this type of vehicle. ",1.0
5,"December 21, 2018","On December 20, 2018 my wife and I headed to Charlie Clark Nissan Used Car Sales on Ed Carey. We tried to see if we would qualify for a new or used vehicle. We spoke to Michelle Vargas when we got there but she was on her way out, when she introduced us to Rene Ramirez. I must first say that both of them were professional with us but it was the sales manager (Eileen Garcia) that ruined the deal for any potential sale. With time still available, we decided to head out to Charlie Clarks New Car Sales lot off of the expressway. There we met a kind sales rep by the name of Castrorena, (with 40 min to spare before closing) we managed to look into a Nissan Kick. They informed us they'd like us to provide a $5,500 down pymt, which we told them that was not going to happen. They then agreed to $1,000 down. Just when we thought we would actually drive away that evening, some guy who wasn't even part of our conversation states that I will need award letters from the VA (Disabled Vet), Social Security and CRSC. I told him I didn't have award letters but I could retrieve the letters off the internet. His name was Frank Sanchez and he goes onto say that he was in the ""Army"" as well and he knew how these things worked. He obviously doesn't know how being Medically Retired from the military works or how Social Security gets involved. Needless to say that Frank Sanchez was very aggressive in the sale of the vehicle and was condescending in his language towards my wife and I. For that reason, we walked away from the sale that cost Castrorena his commission. It is with this that we will never walk into a Charlie Clark dealership to purchase any vehicle. 

You've been warned people...STAY AWAY! ",1.0
6,"May 27, 2017","I was trying to trade my truck for a new car when the manager came and asked me how much would I like for my truck I said 28,000 he said that's fine  and then we agreed on a price for the new car. They had me waiting there until they were closing to sign the paperwork apparently they were busy I waited about 5 hours there waiting once they were closing they had the paperwork ready and wanted me to sign in a hurry since they were closing but the payment didn't make sense so I started going over the paperwork and saw I was not getting what I asked for my vehicle and they were selling me a stock new car no modifications 4000 above the MSRP. They ruined my credit with Nissan couldn't finance through Nissan when I got the car at another dealership because of them. Stay away from these place.",1.0

I called them to find out the status of my application was told they would call me or text me.  I have not revived a response from them today would be the 3rd day. They don't even have the courtesy to call... all they interested is in your money!!,1.0
20,"November 24, 2016",Worst experience from any dealership In the RGV.  Was attempting to buy a car and was withheld from seeing the contract they wanted me to sign simply because they did not want to disclose the price being financed.  Will never step foot on their property ever again.  ,1.0

22,"November 09, 2016","I bought a 2 year old truck from  this dealer.  Less than 30 days later the  Air Conditioner stopped working.  When you buy used from this dealer you buy ""As Is"" and they mean it.  They will not assist with repairs.  Service department is abhorrent.  Made an appointment to have the AC fixed and accepted an appointment for following week.  Even after this wait, they still have had the truck 2 additional days and have not diagnosed the problem.  Not able to reach service rep by phone and will not return calls.  Experience with this dealer has been dismal and I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere for your needs both in Sales and Service.",1.4
23,"October 25, 2016","Bought a car here out of necessity and time constraint. Anyway, I have a 800 credit score but they sold me a car 1/3 over the MSRP with over 2% APR. I even showed the dealer their website where it had an automated monthly payment calculator and asked him why he was trying to get me to sign for a higher price but he wouldn't budge and wouldn't give you a straight answer. If I weren't in a hurry, I would never have bought from them.",1.0
24,"October 22, 2016","Very disappointed with the service, why in the heck set up appointment if they get to u  4 hours later and tell u "" I don't have the part u have to come back"" ridiculous...

27,"February 11, 2015","Since DealerRater has no option for zero stars, these guys get one star.

THE BOTTOM LINE HERE AT THE TOP IS DO NOT PATRONIZE THIS CORRUPT AND/OR INEPT DEALERSHIP.

I will try to make this as short as possible, even though my distasteful experience with this company lasted about 6 months.

One day while visiting South Padre Island on a trip from California, my Xterra would not start easily and/or not remain running if it did start.  Eventually it died altogether and I had it towed to Charlie Clark Nissan in Harlingen, Texas.

Pascual F. in the service department claimed to be unable to diagnose what they ultimately claimed was a failed component somewhere in the chain of computers/sensors.  He claimed to be in internet contact with some Nissan brain trust that interprets diagnostic reports, although they claimed the system kept going down, delaying the process more than a full day.

Eventually they narrowed it down to some sort of ECU component with a replacement cost of over $400, coupled with $450 in labor costs (NOTE - the invoice does not detail how many of the 4 or 5 hours of labor for which I was charged was for their dysfunctional diagnostic process, but the amount of labor it takes to unplug, remove, replace and re-plug a readily accessible computer component under the hood should certainly not be more than one hour!)

$850 on my credit card and I was on the road again.  HOWEVER....

...NOW FOR THE KICKER: I learned from my local Nissan dealer back home that the part they replaced had been under recall from NIssan, so charging me to replace it means...

1) They are completely incompetent.

2) They are completely dishonest.  (To quote my local Nissan service advisor: ""Dude, EVERY Nissan service department knew about this problem.  They knew you were from out of town and got greedy.  Simple as that."")

3) Probably both 1 and 2.

Regardless of the reason, any and all are unacceptable, and you would be wise to take your business elsewhere, so consider yourself warned.

HAPPY ENDING: Although it took me the better part of 6 months going back and forth with Nissan North America's consumer affairs, I eventually received a full refund.

28,"July 02, 2013","The purchase of the vehicle went smoothly with no undue pressure. Found a few minor details with the vehicle after the sale. The first payment is due next week and these issues have still not been resolved after 5 trips back to the dealership. First car dealer I've ever seen that you have to get the sales man to approve service/warranty work. They actually damaged the paint on the vehicle while they were ""fixing"" a problem. They talk a great story during the ""sale"", but afterwards, they backpedal at every turn. Getting them to return phone calls is a joke, and they set up appointments and ""forget"" the appoint, them being no-shows at the appointment time. I would never ever recommend anyone buy from them.",2.2
29,"May 21, 2012","IM A VERTEN AND NO RESPECT WAS GIVEN OR A HELPING HAND. ALL I WANTED TO DO WAS TRADE VEHILCLE IN TO HELP WITH MY PAYMENT. THEY SAID THEY WOULD HELP OVER THE PHONE AND WHEN I GOT THERE THEY TREATED ME LIKE I WAS NO ONE. THE STORY CHANGED OVER AND OVER. I TOLD THEM I WAS COMMING FROM MCALLEN AND THEY STILL DIDNT CARE. DONT EVER BUY A CAR FROM THESE LOSERS, THEY DONT RESPRECT VERTERNS...",1.0
30,"May 23, 2011","I purchased a pretty red 2007 Toyota Camry from Charlie Clark Nissan in San Antonio, TX.  I paid $95 for a detailed inspection before purchasing it.  The MX shop said it was a keeper as there was only $500/change worth of gen preventive MX required. I'd already checked the price of the car on Kelly Blue book and negotiated the price based on the body cosmetics & the what the MX shop found.  Barely two weeks pass, we wash the car and began to notice specks all over the car.  At first we thought it was just calcium/water spots, but as we looked closer, they were nicks all over the car, mostly on the hood and it looked like rock damage. I took it to MAACO to get an expert opinion of how this could've been covered up for the passed two weeks.  The rep mentioned he believed it was a shoddy temp cover job used to make cars look pristine temporarily for a sale.  

I understand dealerships do touchup work to sell cars which is understandable, but I went to two different paint shops for quotes to fix the paint on these vehicles, one was $1100 and the other was $1000.  Mind you, I barely had the car 2 weeks and as soon as water hit it, all the scratches, nicks, were unvielled.  I went back to Mike and told him I think they owe me a paint job because the car was pristine until we washed it and the cover up was just wrong.  I told him had this been known, I would have negotiated a lower price or not purchased the car altogether.  My husband also spoke with him and stressed to him all the problems didn't show up till we washed it, stressing that it was an obvious cover up.  Mike, the salesperson, denies it all and tells him in addition to taking it to a regular mechanic to be checked out, we ""should've"" taken it to a paint specialist before purchasing it. We felt screwed big time because we traded in a car and told them exactly what was wrong with it and made know attempts to cover anything up with the body, yet we were treated this way. And seriously, no one should have to take their car to a paint specialist before purchasing it - that's just not right.  We feel we did due diligence by paying $95 by taking it to a reknown maintenance shop here in San Antonio who like us, saw no problem w/ the cosmetics until the water hit it. On top of that, we paid cash for the vehicle.  Instead of them fessing up to fix the problem, we were told we should've taken it to a paint specialist and then were offered to trade it in and purchase one of the 2010 vehicles they had on the lot, paying the difference in price of course, after we'd already paid on the preventive maintenance on the Camry.  Very disappointed.",2.2
