0,"October 05, 2019","There service on sales side sucks, the fake your app to get the sale & lie to finance companies. If they ask you to trade in your car ask them about a paper trade. It’s a fake trade that allows you to keep your vehicle while they use it to get the finance company to approve you. Shade shady. Then they sell you a xxx and don’t want to help with buy back or anything just forget you exists. ",1.0

101,"September 14, 2018", This is a work van dropped it off on a Tuesday morning. No call back. Checked on it Wed Morning service writer told us it would be done by Friday. Friday no call from service writer. We called and was told it would be sometime the following week but couldn't give us a time frame. I finally called the service manager Wed afternoon. His name was Donnie. He was great. Called me back I told him what was going on and the lack of communication that we received from the service writer explain that this van was needed as it was a work van. He called got parts the next morning and I had my van by lunch on Thur. With all this being said I will like we were given the parking lot treatment by the service writer or he just didn't care that it was a work van. The service manager was rt on top of it and got my truck within 24 hrs of contacting him. I have purchased work trucks from them in the past year.

I also want to give a thanks to greg adams in service for earlier in the day on Saturday he did a great job on getting that dodge worked on when the service department was already stretched thin.even though in the long run I ended up trading in the dodge he did a tremendous job on helping us out.Great job by everyone I dealt with there Saturday.",5.0

217,"April 19, 2018","I took my Durango in for a routine oil change at 11:30 am. I told the tech I was shopping so no big rush. The tech called me at 1:30 pm and told me the alignment was out on the truck. I told him to go ahead with adjustment since I was going out of town the next day. I told him I had errands to run and to call me when my truck was ready. After not hearing from the dealership by around 4:30  pm I called and a guy in service said it was nearly ready. I had a friend drop me off around 4:45 pm and waited in the waiting room until nearly 6:00 pm . One of the guys apologized for the wait said they had 6 in front of me and had to wait on the wash. I just thought that was an extremely long time to have my truck. I was also surprised at the price of the oil change and the alignment. I questioned the guy in service about why a vehicle with right at 15,000 miles should need an alignment so soon. I have owned cars for over 40 years and do not remember having this issue so early on with a new vehicle. I ask him if the alignment was an issue with new Durango's and he indicated not. I realize road conditions can play a part in alignment but still surprising for a new vehicle. ",3.6

223,"April 06, 2018","I took my Jeep in to Classic for some minor repairs. We needed to pair our new phones, I thought there was something wrong with the driver seat (there wasn't - I just didn't know how to use it!), and the engine light had come on. Turns out I had mice living in my engine and they had made a very comfy home - cutting wires everywhere shorting out a few things.  The best part of my experience....the repairs were all taken care of the same day - NO WAITING!!!!  YAY!!!

 Everyone was very helpful & friendly.

Thank you Classic for a job well done!
