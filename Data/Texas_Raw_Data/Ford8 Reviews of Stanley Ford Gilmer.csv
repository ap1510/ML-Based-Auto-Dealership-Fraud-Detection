0,"March 14, 2020","Some time in the first week of March I received a call from Brenda at Stanley Ford in Gilmer. She said “she had a customer looking for a truck like mine” and wanted to know if I would be willing to sell my truck to them. I politely declined and told her I was not really interested in selling my truck. A few days later I ended up purchasing a small car some where else and it got me to thinking that I might as well sell the truck since it would be sitting around the house a lot. I called the dealership and spoke we Brenda. We began texting and I told her that I have no intention of buying a vehicle from them only that I would consider selling them mine if we could come to an agreement. I tried to get her to give me a range of what they might pay for the truck. I advised her that I was very busy and did not want to drive an hour to them to only be given a low ball offer. I had sent pictures of the truck showing outside, inside, the VIN and the mileage. She assured me they were serious so I decided to go over there and give them a shot. Within 10 minutes they advised that they could not buy the truck. I politely reminded her of our conversation about wasting my time and we parted ways. No harm no foul. This past Friday I received a text message from Mike Terry asking me if I wanted to sell them my truck. I informed him of my previous experience and advised him I would not make the hour drive unless they were serious about buying the truck. He assured me that they wanted to buy it and gave me an offer of 13-13.5k. I told him I would consider selling the truck for that and we planned to meet up Saturday morning. I arrived at the dealership around 1030 and within a few minutes was told they couldn't by the truck. I understandably was very upset because they had now wasted my time twice. Mike was unable to explain why they were calling people offering to buy their vehicles and then telling them they couldn't once they arrived at the dealership. I asked to speak to whoever was making this decision to understand why this was happening again. At first Mario, the general sales manager, would not come out to speak with me. When he finally did he had no answers to my questions. I have been a part of the automotive industry for nearly 20 years and have would for many dealerships. I know the game but for them to do this twice was absolutely unacceptable. Mario was very matter of fact about the situation and basically said that's that and pound sand. I confronted him with the fact that they had given me a price range and that I would not have driven the hour without that. His answer was that no one said that. I confronted him with the text messages on my phone and he seemed not to care. I was finally asked to leave the dealership but because at this point I was pretty upset. This is not a situation of buying my truck or not. This is about wasting my time twice. I have no real reason to sell my vehicle. It is still very much in good shape mechanically and cosmetically. If anyone with the Stanley Auto Group corporate office is interested in speaking to me about this situation I have all the text messages saved on my phone.

1,"March 09, 2020","My experience here was good, not perfect but not all dealership experiences are perfect. 
Driving from Dallas, I had the pleasure of working with Antonio, who was very detail oriented, transparent , and approachable. 
This visit could have gone better,
If only I knew his name.
One gentlemen, After making a “Mistake/ misprint” on a signed agreement/Deal 
Approached me moments later, after the deal was signed, claiming that he had made an error on my initial trade-in agreement $ on his behalf..
 After signing and agreeing,Not a good look for small town professionalism.
The same gentlemen moments later, felt the need to accuse me and my wife of a drivers license “Mis-print” which would have initially cost me $60, had he not “Waved” it off. 
This essentially delayed the whole process a couple of hours
The license was fine.
Thanks to me really wanting this particular vehicle and the awesome recovery job by Antonio and the financial Lady in the back, I would have walked out.
Shout out to those 2, thank you. ",4.0

4,"May 21, 2018","My 20 year old daughter brought her van into the dealership for an electrical problem.  They charged her a $100 diagnostic fee that she was happy to pay.  After several days they call and tell her that her warranty will not cover the work because she installed a trailer harness and that had caused a short.  It would be several hundred dollars and they could not give a price up front but they would charge her by the hour.  My daughter studied engineering and runs her own business so she knowledgeable about cars and electrical currents, and what they were saying sounded suspicious so she drove down.  They were surprised to see her.  She asked to see her van and where the short had occurred.  They told her to take a seat and they would bring the van around.  After quite some time, the service adviser came out and told her that it was not a short after all but the central control unit that had been overloaded.  She asked how did they figure that out?  They said that they ran a diagnostic.  Then she asked what were the limits and capacity of the central control unit and what was the draw?  They did not know.  So she asked what diagnostic did they run and what were the results, they wouldn't answer the question.  She called me and I placed a call to the general manager.  He said that he would go down and speak with her and the service department.  Well he never came down to meet her, instead he called down and told the service department to refund her diagnostic fee and they promptly asked her to please leave with her vehicle.  It is disappointing when a dealership tries to prey on people that appear vulnerable.   ",1.5
5,"January 05, 2018",I bought a car in Nov 2017 I been having problems every since. They service department has a bad attitude and act like they fixing your car and don't. I've been running down there almost every week for them to fix something! First it was the key switch!Then it was the battery today i had to take my car to the ford house in Kilgore and pay 251.00 to get my car fixed right !! Then they claim that their warranty only covers the one on Gilmer!! If I was you I wouldn't ever deal with this dealership !!!!,1.0
6,"March 07, 2016","My wife and I talked with the salesperson over the phone thru conversations and text.  Justin Nall was very accurate in detailing the condition of the vehicle to me and prompt and courteous with getting back to us.  When we made the drive to the dealership, Justin had asked another salesperson to help us as he was off that day.  Jason had the same professionalism about himself as well and put us into the vehicle we loved.  The only issue I really had was the timeframe.  It took a little longer to get in and out but it was a small price to pay for the help we received.  All in all, it was very enjoyable as far as a car purchase goes.  Thank you to Justin, Jason and Nick.  And anyone else who worked with them to get my new truck ready for me to take home.  The sales service, the detailer and the shop who helped me get all the information for my truck.  I will definitely be back for future car purchases!!!   ",4.8
7,"March 04, 2011","I purchased a vehicle from Mike Craig Ford in April 2010 and the salesman advised that there was still several thousand miles left on the manufacturers warranty, I later found out that I had been mislead and that in fact there was no coverage for the clutch. I advised the salesman Loy DeMoss of the problems I was having with the vehicle and he said he would get with the owner Mike Craig and get back with me. I will say that I have to this date received no call back from the salesman.

Please do yourself a favor and stay away from Mike Craig Ford. I have filed a report with the BBB and since the dealer will not make the necessary repairs there is nothing they can do. The dealer could have repaired this for less than $500.00 but instead chose not to be honorable and stand behind the vehicle. I have had the vehicle checked by other reputable mechanics and have been told that the clutch plate is bad and evidently has been for quite some time.It is my belief that the salesman knew of the faulty clutch when he sold it to me. If someone from Mike Craig Ford wants to sell you one of their vehicles run and don't walk to another dealer who will stand behind what they sell.

I learned my lesson the hard way and hope to help others avoid what I have been put through. I am an honorably discharged, disabled veteran and a senior citizen who should not at this stage in my life have to deal with people who will not be fair and honest. ",1.0
