0,"March 09, 2020","My story starts about 6.5 weeks ago when we brought my wife’s Chrysler 300c in for repair. we have had issues with the electronics in this car essentially for the duration of owning it. We have been told in the past by this service department that the car’s BCM could be defective or the problem but tried less expensive issues before committing to a $400 part. 

I would call in to request an update. I would be told that they didn’t know anything at this point. I would be told I would receive a call on Monday and never receive it. Being a generally patient person I would give it a few days and call on Wednesday only to have the cycle repeated. 

I was told the service techs were testing different modules in the car and checking wiring harnesses for chafing and wear. 

Finally have two and a half weeks of them checking these modules, and having to contact them to find out what was being done. I was told $750 worth of a dash tear out would be needed to continue checking modules. Okay, not the best news but okay. The frustrating part was the service rep did a large deal of double speak but we were able to come to an understanding. I was able to broker a deal, if they were unable to find the problem I would only be responsible for $400. 

After another week of not hearing anything I decided to contact the service manager, Teresa. I vented my concerns about my service rep not returning my phone calls and requested an update on my car. Tersa was very helpful for two or three days and then it was back to the normal guy. *sigh*

While speaking with Tersa, she told me that the car has about a page and a half worth of failed communication codes on my car

A few days later, I was advised they were unable to recreate a problem and wanted to return it to me. Keep in mind, nothing had been fixed at this point. The codes were cleared before the 60 miles were put on the car and asked whether it was still popping codes. Initially he told me that it was not but later stated it was. They were trying to send my car back to me without it being repaired. 

Finally another week and a half later, I was told the BCM of the car may be the problem but it was not a sure deal. With them telling me the BCM could be bad in the past and all the different areas there was a failure to communicate it sounded like the best guess that could be made.

When I have messed with BCMs in the past, they have been behind the glove box or under the passenger seat of the car. My rep told me the BCM is up in the dash but did also say he hasn’t changed one in a long time and was 100% sure but that’s where he thought it was. I was okay with lying the $750 if it in fact was in the dash. However, it was on the passenger side, sidewall of the car. A few pieces of trim needed to be removed along with the glove box. After that you had full access to the part.... I tried to argue with him about how I should not be responsible for the $750 dash tear out when the repair does not need that work to be done. That got me absolutely no where.  My rep now told me that he would cut me a deal. The dash tear out would be discounted to $400 and I would be billed for 2.2 hours of labor @$180/h. This was more than the $750. I tried to explain that to my rep but he wasn’t hearing it and wanted to argue about how I was wrong. Low and behold. That total cost was $796... really.... okay. He changed the price to $750 to shut me up. 

I didn’t want to bring it back a few weeks later with the exact same issue and be billed another $750 for a dash tear out. The only thing I was offered was a comp on the diagnostic fee of $125. They comp this for anyone who gets repairs done at this dealership so nothing at all. I told him this was the same deal they cut for everyone he said I didn’t have to get the repair done there if that happened. I asked him to get with someone who could make a better deal and never heard anything back. 
 
The Part was changed without a hitch

I was billed to fill up the gas tank. Which I get but they billed 3.10 a gallon for fuel at a total of $67. That’s a tank and a half if I fill it up. Eventually he changed it to $35 after a long argument. Also, of course, I was still billed for the oil change. Oil changes are comped all the time to smooth over problems at the dealership..
I asked for him to check the car for any problem codes before I left the shop with it. He checked it and of course it was still showing a code. Twice now... they tried to send the car back with codes still on it. How embarrassing. I’m done. I’m done with this line of products and certainly done with this dealership. ",1.0
1,"April 03, 2019","I purchased a new 2015 3500 Dually from DeMontrond Dodge and gave them my business because of a past experience.  After the deal was done, I found out several items about the way the contract was developed and how things, I was not told about, were added.  I was not very happy but at least I had a new truck.  In a very short time I starting having problems with the truck and I did not get any support from the dealership.  First thing was abnormal wear on the right front tire which is an issue with the design of the ball joints.  The tires ware was uneven within the first 5 thousand miles and the tire became unsafe.  I also had two other tires with tread separation and almost had an accident because of them.  I received no support from Chrysler nor the dealership to remedy the situation and had to buy two new tires and get refunded from the tire manufacturer.  There have been a number of recalls on my truck and most of the time the dealership did not have the parts to conduct replacements.  I have tried to contact the service rep many times and many times he does not answer my calls and I have to go to the dealership to get things done right.  The truck has been in the shop at least 10 times since I purchased it and after repairs some of the issues still exist.  The A/C blower motor went out and had to be replaced of which I was charged 100 dollars for installation.  It took them almost 3 months to replace the exhaust system because of recalls.  There are so many other issues it would take much more time to show them all here.  Enough to say that I am very unhappy with the way the dealership is so disinterested in dealing with the customer after the initial sale.  It seems their attitude is you bought the truck, get out of here.!!!",2.0
2,"May 09, 2018",Romel helped my husband and I find the exact van I loved and the next few days we found a great truck for my husband as well. The process was quick and easy. We love our new Chrysler Pacifica and Ford truck. Thanks to Romel we are driving safe and protected with a lifetime warranty in vehicles we love! ,5.0
3,"April 17, 2018","Romel Erazo Found the exact truck that I asked for, in the price range that I requested. Very honest and trustworthy. I also received top dollar for my trade. I will definitely purchase from this dealership again.",5.0
4,"November 06, 2017",This is not a dealership I would recommend  black folks to visit. So I wouldn't  get a refund/overpayment the dealership sat on my approved deal for 32days.if I was blond haired and blue eyes I would have receive 1st class treatment. The dealership could use a make over (diversity in all areas of the dealership).I am waiting to see if I will receive my $378.20 refund i will give another review when i receive my refund.,2.0
5,"December 23, 2016",Two things a dealership must do right: sales and service. These guys lied during and after the sale and then refuse to service under warranty issues. I was tricked into purchasing a vehicle I did not want via deceptive claims to get a non-refundable deposit. Lied to about work to correct the issues with the vehicle before taking it home. Have since returned numerous times for warranty repairs they now refuse to fix.,1.6
6,"October 09, 2016","Ordered a 2017 Durango from Jeff and Don Size, 4 weeks later the vehicle came in and the purchase was quick and easy from start to finish. Fair price and had me in and out of finance in under 30 minutes. Great people I would buy from again. ",4.8
7,"June 08, 2016","Buying a vehicle can be a daunting experience. For me however purchasing my vehicle from this dealership was one of the best decisions made. I spent some time walking around the sales floor then I was approached by Wade. 
The following day I returned to the floor and this time I chose a vehicle for a test drive.  The process for financing the vehicle was very efficient. Option for Auto Insurance was offered, but in the end we chose to use our own insurance.  The purchase was completed within 2-4 hours.
We were able to leave DeMontrond and continue with other business we had on that day with ease.

8,"June 01, 2016","I took my 2006 Dodge 1500 truck in after receiving a notice in the mail that the air bag system was defective.  I was told it would take approximately 2 hours when I made the appt.  When I went back by to pick it up, 3.5 hours later I was told by the service writer it would take "" several hours' more to repair.  It took 2.5 hours more.

Number one, I don't understand why it took Dodge 10 years to discover this problem.  Number two why do dealership lie to the customer.",2.4
9,"November 04, 2015","I bought a new truck from DeMontrond.  The dealership took all day to process my purchase.  They tried to get me to switch my auto insurance to their brand, (allstate, lol).  I bought an extended warranty, but got no paperwork on it.  (save your purchase paperwork)  I went to the dealership for my first (free) oil change.  When I drove in, my tires were equally inflated.  When I left, I discovered my tires on drivers side were low inflated, the tires on passenger side were almost maxed out.  Very rough ride home.  I purchased the maintenance contract, yet every time I have to use it, the service dept. says I don't have it and I have to show my sales receipt.  The warranty forever is a joke.  (read the rules for it carefully and you will quickly see what I mean)  Thankfully my mfg warranty and my extended warranty are being honored by a competitor.  I will NEVER buy from this family of dealerships again as long as I live.  I cannot recommend this company.  I wish I had gone to a competitor, but hindsight is 20/20!",1.8
10,"June 10, 2015","I purchased Jeep 2015. One things is bad service from one staff,  finance staff there is so rude to me. He plus extra to my sales price  so I tried to calculate after I paid tax , interest loan but I still don't understand I went there a few times  to ask the same question because I don't understand what I paid until now I understand but the way this guy acting to me and the way he talked is shock me. I never see the bad service like this in my life , this is the first time. He is not helpful, rude and don't tried to help customer to understand. I told my friends next time we purchased another car we will not go back to Demontrond Conroe again, it was so scare me with big money that we had paid that is not value if we compare with service, other staffs are ok but only one guy make their face look bad in my eyes.",1.0
11,"May 01, 2015","They didn't have what I wanted, but said they located it in Austin (refused to tell where at first). Had me do all paperwork and pay down payment before they would go get it. They drove it back and called me to come pick it up. It was dirty, had two areas of scratched paint and two stains on leather inside and the interior was the wrong colors from what they said it was. Told me I was stuck with it as I had already done all paperwork and payment previously. Took it for a drive and found mechanical issues. Not sure why they didn't discover the issues since they drove it from Austin to Conroe and put 200 miles on it. Took it back next day and was yelled at (yes, yelled at in the lobby) by salesman and treated poorly in service department. Out my money but still don't have the vehicle. No resolution in sight. Run as fast and as far away from them as you can.",1.2
12,"January 01, 2015","New 2014 Dodge Durango delivered in August with 3 major quality issues (loud clunk in rear suspension, two poorly fitted body panels, crooked rear hatch handle) took 4 months and many visits to fix. They don't return phone calls, fail to keep the customer informed, and do not back their vehicles. I resorted to using Chrysler Care for help but it still took unreasonable effort on my part to keep after them to fix the problems.

Additionally, the purchasing experience was a disaster with the Financial Guy telling ME what warranty and financial terms I wanted. There were few options provided. ",1.2
13,"November 27, 2014","I spoke with Amanda Dueschle through email and on phone about the 2014 laramie longhorn I was looking for. She was a true professional and went above and beyond to make sure she did everything she could to make me happy. 
Once I arrived at Demontrond, she introduced herself and referred me to a salesman. Mr. Doyle was fantastic and to the point with the price of the truck I was looking for which Amanda had confirmed through email( unlike clear lake dodge). The staff was very friendly and approachable. 
I would HIGHLY, recommend Demontrond to anyone who's looking for a dodge. The best car buying experience ever,..hands down!!!!",4.8

15,"June 13, 2014",Around november of 2013 I received a recall notice for the tie rod on my dodge truck being faulty and carried the notice to DeMontrond Dodge and the part was ordered and I was put on a list.  When I had not heard back by Decamber 2013 I went back up to check the status and I was told their was a recall on the recall.  Every two months I would stop in and confirm the part still was not in.  This month I got a letter from AutoNation Dodge down in Spring about the same recall so I called them.  Parts are plentiful and my truck was made safe in 3 hours.  DeMontrond parts needs to do whatever AutoNation down in spring is doing because they got it together.  My name is Steve L and you can confirm I was on the list.  Will probably do future business down in spring.,2.3
16,"March 27, 2014","First we test drove a Jeep. Checked the vehicle over and it had a spare tire(full size) and a jack but after buying and delivery we get home and notice the 2 items no longer in the vehicle. Then we ended up refinancing the Jeep 5 days later with a local bank for half the interest rate of what we received. The Finance guy thought he was slick sneaking overpriced credit life into the contract along with the crappy 40k mile extended warranty costing $2K , which we did want an extended warranty. I ended up canceling the extended warranty and the credit life insurance immediately which seemed to piss the finance guy off. Guess he was going to lose his commission on this but oh well!! we ended up finding an extended warranty for a few hundred dollars more by Mopar and backed by Chrysler that has unlimited time and mileage due to the vehicle being Certified Used. Then about 3 weeks later just in case they never changed the oil we took it to a more reputable dealer to have its oil changed. They did their usual multipoint inspection, which we still have in writing, the tires did not have enough tread left  to pass state inspection and had tire rot and needed to be replaced asap. So i purchased 4 new tires online and requested the selling dealer put them on at no charge and they would not do so. I spent over $500 for tires the least they could do is put them on for free and write off the $69. We also had to buy a new key for the vehicle as they only gave us one key even though there were 2 keys when we test drove it. At least they cut the key and programmed it for no  charge, thats about the only thing we have received to right the many wrongs of the deal. The salesperson was good but dealing with all the others has been about as pleasant as going through an IRS audit or getting a root canal. The customer should always come first in any business and should be treated as if they are right because it is the customer who actually pays their salaries but that doesn't seem to bother them. A reputable dealer doesn't sell a vehicle with unsafe tires and make parts of the vehicle before delivery disappear. A reputable dealer also takes responsibility by returning phone calls and try to make things right. So far this has not been the case and at least we have found a much better dealership that takes care of us and understands that our satisfaction keeps us coming back with our money to pay their salaries.

17,"February 16, 2014","I brought my husband's truck in to get an oil change and I asked for them to wash and vacuum the truck (a $30 service charge for wash and vacuum). Being a Saturday, I waited patiently for the 2 hours until they came and said my truck was ready. The truck was NOT ready. The carpet in the truck was not vacuumed (not being picky, I mean to tell you there was dirt loose grass and rocks on the driver's side floor -the whole reason I wanted the truck vacuumed!) They didn't bother cleaning the rubber floor matts, the step sides still had mud in all 4 step areas, the wheels were obviously not wiped (hard to hide on chrome wheels), the tail gate was not washed, it had black spots from the road dirt and grime after driving through the rain.. To make the matter more aggrivating, when I showed the truck to the service guy who wrote my ticket up he kinda looked at it and said ""it's probably my fault I told him to hurry up because you've been here 2 hours already, you didn't want to be here longer did you?"" I said no but I paid yall 30$ to wash and vacuum the truck I don't want to wait 2 hours, pay you $30 and leave with a dirty truck! His reply "" well I can either give you half credit for it or we can give you a rain check for next time"" I asked him if the car wash guy had already gone home and he said no, but we close in 15 minutes.  I pretty much just stared at him because I didn't have anything polite to say at the moment, and he finally said he'd take it back there and have him do it again. So I waited 30 minutes and when they brought it back it had at least been poorly vacuumed, floor matts, step sides and tailgate were still dirty and the wheels had been poorly wiped over. So the service guy and the car wash guy sat there in front of me and wiped it all down. Overall I would say don't waste your money here. The attitude they have that I'm pulling their teeth out by making them do their job, which I'm paying them to do, is horrible. Go to a better dealership that gives you real dealer service. Buying the car/truck is the easy part, it's the service that you SHOULD get for the life of your vehicle.  We won't be buying our next truck (or any other vehicle) from this dealer. We'll be buying from a dealer with better service and customer service. ",1.4
18,"January 16, 2014",I would not tell my worst enemy to shop here. I was here 3 times in the last couple of weeks. The sales people could careless about selling cars. They were rude and acted as if they were better than me. They treated my wife like she was not even there. I will not shop here again even if it meant i would have to walk every where for the rest of my life. SHOP AT YOUR OWN RISK!!,2.2
19,"January 05, 2013","Walked into service and was never acknowledge by anybody, (example we will be with you in a minute). When another service rep walked in I was told she will take care of you. I walked over and told her the finger was pointed to her and that she could help me. She looked at my hand and said what is that, I replied it looks like a recall. She replied I do not do recalls giving me the expression, your S O L . So I walked out her office and never will return to your dealership….

I strongly believe that the best advertisement one can get it by word of mouth, I will not stop talking bad about your service department…

20,"January 03, 2013","The ease of buying from Demontrond -Conroe was far superior to any I have had in 40 years of car buying.  Craig is a class act and you won't get a bit of pressure to ""buy now"".",5.0
21,"June 13, 2011","I hate shopping for new cars. But thanks to Craig Clark, my last car buying experience was absolutely wonderful.  He was knowledgeable about the car I was buying, had ALL the paperwork handy so all i had to do was sign when I got to the dealership and then delivered my car to my job! Even after my purchase, he called to check to see that everything was going well with the car and offered a ""free"" detail! The customer service was exceptional.  I know where I'll buy my next vehicle and will certainly recommend him and the dealership to ALL my friends and relatives. Thanx Demontrond!",5.0
22,"September 14, 2010","December of 2007 I purchase a used GT mustang from Craig. This was my first purchase using financing and he took very good care of me. I got a fair price on my trade in which I was prepared for since it was PT Crusier. He gave me an excellent price on the Mustang and even helped me with my insurance.

I know this review is a little late but I did not realize how good I had it until I went to trade in the Mustang. After dealing with a poor dealership I wish I would have gone back to Demontrond in Conroe. They took care of me from start to finish and did in a timely manner. 

They even put me in a loaner car when there when I discovered the sway bar was broken. It was fixed within a day so I did not have to be without my car long. Two years later I still recieve a birthday note from craig! This is a wonderful afterthought and shows they want to take care of their customers after the sell too.

I LOVE DEMONTROND IN CONROE!",5.0
