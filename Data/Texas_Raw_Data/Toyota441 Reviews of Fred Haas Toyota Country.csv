5,"May 22, 2020",Answered all my questions and worked towards common ground. I bought several vehicles from this dealership and have always met with good results.  Definitely service oriented.,5.0
6,"May 10, 2020","I called about a used Tacoma on my way to work today. Jodi answered my call and she was great. Told me the truck was sold, then redirected me to a similar truck that I was interested in. A tan crew cab V6. She asked where I was--I was only a few blocks away--and she got me to swing by the dealership to look at the truck.

My experience started great. Fresh coffee. Clean dealership. Jodi met me at the front. Explained that she was more of a phone liaison, then handed me off to her salesperson Vince Minuta. I was prepared to take a quick look at the outside, test drive it around the parking lot, then let them work on my credit so I could pick the truck up after work.

My credit score is low-600's, but I have a great relationship with my credit union. I've paid off a few cars with them, so they like me. They approved me and gave me a great rate.

I wanted to get out and take a quick look at the Tacoma, then possibly get it buttoned up before I had to leave. I was leading us outside because I was excited. Vince stopped me before we got to the door, then wanted to find out some more. I told him what I was looking at, told him my financial goals, and told him about my credit. He immediately asked if ""I had $2000 down, because you're not getting financed without money down.""

First off, that's absolutely not true. Even in today's tightening world (today is Saturday, May 9, 2020), a mid-500's can get approved if they have the right vehicle and a good car history. Even if you don't have a good relationship with a credit union, Capital One has zero down offers to subprime borrowers.

Second, and most important, Vince started assuming.

Vince didn't know which vehicle I was looking at, my car credit history, my income (six figures), my monthly bills (only about $1900 per month), or my total debt (which is only about $80k including student loans, mortgage, one car note and two credit cards). He was judging it off one number. ""619."" And what he didn't know was that my preapproval was given a couple of weeks ago--when my score was in the 640's before the car I bought my wife showed up on my credit report.

After he stopped me and I told him my credit score, he took me back to his office. The conversation went something like this.

Me ""I'm looking at trucks. Tacomas, Tundras, something reliable and affordable. My FICO score is a 619 and...""
Vince (cutting me off) ""Do you have $2k down payment?""
Me ""No money down.""
Vince ""Nobody's going to approve you.""
Me ""My credit union already approved me.""
Vince ""I've never heard of that."" (At this point, I'm feeling insulted.)
Vince ""We don't need to go out to the lot yet. Let's head to my office first.""
Me ""OK."" (I'm pretty irritated at this point.)
Vince ""You can't just go out on our lot. I've got to know what you want to do."" (This is where he starts cutting me off more.)
Me ""I'm looking at a Tacoma that...""
Vince ""Which Tacoma?""
Me ""There was a red 4x4 that...""
Vince ""Well that one sold and you didn't want that one anyway. What else?""
Me ""Jodi told me you have another Tacoma...""
Vince ""OK! A Tacoma! We have this Tacoma and this Tacoma..."" (pointing at his computer)
Me ""I talked with Jodi about a Tacoma that was on the lot.""
Vince ""Well I don't know anything about that. But I've never sold a car in 15 minutes, and if you only have 15 minutes then we need to reschedule.""
Me ""I can't. I work a lot. My time is valuable...""
Vince ""I work a lot too. I have two jobs, I work as much as anyone.""

This is the gist of the conversation. Cutting me off and trying to one-up how much he works instead of letting me give him my money. We even veered off to a used Chevy pickup at one point. 

I ended the conversation by asking him why he was so confrontational from the beginning. He offers to put me with another salesperson. I decline. I've had enough.

I've only had one day off during the pandemic. I need a car. My wife and I have been sharing one car since November (though I have a company car). As valuable as my time is, I can't afford to spend hours at a dealership.

Vince shot himself in the foot today. Mistake after mistake. He didn't listen. He didn't to try to understand. And it was important to understand. He didn't hear that Jodi found something I really wanted. In my dream world, I was going to buy a tan V6 4x4 Tacoma crew cab. Jodi got me tan, V6, Tacoma, and crew cab. It was 2WD, but it was in my price range. And I'll take that.

Great job, Jodi.

I was going to look at the truck, take it for a 2-minute drive, then leave. I could fill out a credit app on my lunch break, then pick up the truck on my way home.

Instead, I called Tegeler Toyota in Brenham. Spoke with JoAnne, asked her if I could buy a truck. It wasn't tan. It wasn't 4x4. It wasn't a V6. It was a silver 4 cylinder crew cab base model. I gave her all my info on the phone then I picked it up this evening.

At the end of the day, convenience, necessity and professionalism won out. Fred Haas had the truck I wanted, but was confrontational and ""broomed"" me out. They could've had the sale.

I still rated Fred Haas 5 stars. They're not a bad place. One bad experience doesn't change my opinion and my past experiences with their sales and service departments have been fantastic. That said, today was a bad day.",5.0
7,"May 09, 2020",A straw purchasing attempt was just tried on us by Nick Rogers and one of his guys. Super illegal. Will report. This is not ok,1.0
8,"May 05, 2020","We had one of the #WORSE customer services experience at Fred Haas on Spring Cypress. Never had such a terrible experience specially with a company who claims customer satisfaction is their ‚Äúpriority‚Äù. I encourage anyone that is looking for a Toyota vehicle to really
 pay attention on what this dealer advertises and check often here if they if they really delivery what they promised. They made an internet campaign through #facebook we signed in, I had to answer few questions via messenger and provide them with my name,
 phone number and email. We agreed on an appointment and I was supposed to ask for someone called Markdown Mike while at the store. Same day of the appointment, I got two calls from two different people from this dealer informing me wrong appointment times
 etc. Got there, store was visually empty, but the level of disorganization was easy to identify. I checked in with the front desk, nobody knew about the appointment nor about the person I have been asked to look for. They assigned me to somebody else who didn‚Äôt
 have a clue of the internet ad, voucher etc. This person called Michael went on working with somebody else left us waiting. After a long time of sitting waiting for Michael someone called Steve came in to the desk we were waiting. Steve was very polite, but
 didn‚Äôt have a clue of what was going on and I had to explain myself to him for a second time at this time! Once paperwork got started the first Mike came back out of no where and said Steve was gone and I had to start the conversation all over again (3rd time).
 Again no awareness about the internet campaign, the person I was supposed to be dealing with first place, voucher etc. While they were checking my paperwork, Michael took another customer in a different desk. it was not a surprise we left the store without
 the internet promised deal. Micheal came up with a very unprofessional approach that made me terribly regret of driving 40 minutes with my family and waste my time with such terrible business model. Michael standing in front of us started to give his ‚Äúgo home
 speech‚Äù (that took less than 10 second) and rushed to the second customer he was working simultaneously with us. They took my trade in car and parked it at another corner of the store where we couldn‚Äôt find it. I had to get back in the store to hand Michael
 my keys and ask him to bring my car to the front door so I could leave. It took an eternity to happen. It surprises me they have got some 5 starts reviews here - in fact most of them are either related to the car reliability and in few cases praising few sales
 representatives people they dealt with. These names were quite repetitive, so I guess positive experience maybe is related with the interactions with few associates. I was super unlucky to experience the worse they had available. I can‚Äôt tell
if
 this is the way they do business. To finish there are signs on all desks asking customers to leave a good review here. I wish I had one, but Fred Hass Toyota ar 249 effortlessly worked so well to make me having a trashy experience and disrespectful manners
 of treating a customer.

9,"May 03, 2020",Great dealership and even better people! I was in and out in less than two hours and got everything I wanted in a vehicle and then some! Thanks guys!,5.0
10,"March 18, 2020",I wouldn't buy another car here. They seem to dishonest business! I was excited about my purchase at first. Until I realized they threw in a $3000 extended warranty without telling me about it!! It was never even mentioned in our talks. I'm a single mom and the salesperson knew I was looking for low payments. Instead of giving me a better car he financed a $3000 warranty. I'm really disappointed.,1.6
11,"March 18, 2020","Great Service Dept. Jan Martin is a superb Service Consultant. Nice clean facility, with a helpful friendly staff. I can‚Äôt say enough good things about my experiences there. ",5.0
12,"March 17, 2020","We initially went in to look at a Certified PreOwned 2016 White Highlander.  My wife didn't like the condition of the interior so we then test drove a 2019 Highlander which was more expensive than we were looking for, but my wife liked it as the car is for her so we were interested.  Our experience at Fred Haas Toyota Country started off OK then significantly dropped off the moment we said we wanted to go home and think about this purchase overnight.    Our sales rep, Vince Minuta, immediately said, ""Ok sure.  Let me walk you out.""  But as soon as we entered the hallway with him, he began peppering us with questions with the tone of we were idiots for walking out and not purchasing this car right here, right now.  We explained this was at the top of our budget so we needed some time to weigh our options before making this purchase.  Then, Vince started in with comments about how if we couldn't afford this car, it would have been nice for him to know that so we could be looking at other models because apparently any Highlander was out of our price range according to him.  He also said we should've been looking at 4-cylinders to insinuate we could not afford a V6 after all.  After I told him we could afford this car but wanted some time to figure out if it's what we really wanted, he was not happy and wanted to know what else we were going to look at.  When I told him what and where, he wanted us to come back into his office and sit down while he pulled it up on his computer.  At this point we were fed up with his rudeness and said we were leaving.  He threw his hands up in the air with his back to us while on his computer and said, ""Fine!""  And that was it.  We ended up finding a better car and a better deal with a better salesman at Fred Haas Toyota World the very next day.

Also, oddly, Vince kept telling us about his own Lexus SUV that he had purchased preowned and kept comparing it to the Toyota Highlander.  He even made sure to point it out to us in the staff lot for some reason.  My wife kept wondering, if your Lexus is so great because it's essentially the same as this Highlander we're driving, then why didn't you buy a Toyota yourself?  

Oh and one more thing...Vince knew we had a trade-in and we had it there ready to go.  He never asked if they could take it to appraise it.  However, the very next day at Fred Haas Toyota World, our salesman gave us the keys to test drive the car we were interested in and asked if they could appraise our trade-in.  We gladly obliged, got the exact appraisal value we were expecting, and sat down and purchased the car we test drove with ease.  ",1.0

29,"February 08, 2019","Sales person Isaac sold us our car and was very difficult to work with. We had to come back not even a month and a half later because the battery was dying. We were sold a used car with a bad battery and then had to pay for a new one. On top of that when we spoke with Isaac about the problem he talked over us and said the service center at Toyota is bad and they don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing. He said they were wrong and that the battery is probably fine and to bring our car back the next day to have someone in the preowned area look at it. We said we couldn‚Äôt because the car probably would be completely dead by then and won‚Äôt make the drive back and also said the service center wasn‚Äôt wrong or bad at their jobs because the battery is actually bad, no one is lying about that. Isaac then raised his voice even more and yelled at us saying it is our problem and he can‚Äôt help. He then walked away just leaving us there. Luckily someone in the service center helped us out but we still ended up paying half the original price for a new battery. But I‚Äôm more appalled at Isaacs behavior and how he handled Toyota‚Äôs customers while also bad mouthing Toyota‚Äôs service center and it‚Äôs employees. We will never be back and I regret working with him ",2.0

33,"December 20, 2018",I sold my car here and Jack Muha was the only kind and caring individual I encountered. Clint and accounting department were unbothered by the inconvenience they forced upon my son and I when I received a check that could not be cashed the same day because there was no record of it. I will not be purchasing or selling another vehicle here ever. I would not recommend.,1.0
34,"November 25, 2018","We went to Fred Haas Country Toyota to look at a used Tacoma.  We found the truck we wanted but were more than disappointed with the service.  After our salesperson said that there would be no help in lowering the asking price we were shuffled off to the finance department.  This was the only comfortable part of the experience.  The finance department was respectful and very helpful. If I could rate just the finance department, I would give them a higher rating.  The salesperson was the negative experience.

Due to the fact that the payments were going to be a bit higher than we expected, we asked to put down a deposit and seek alternate financing through our bank.  Our bank informed us that the truck we were looking at had a NADA value of 3,000 less than the selling price.  The next morning, we called VInce, our salesman, and informed him of this and asked if they would consider lowering the price to closer to the value of the truck.  He was rude and disrespectful. He told us that we didn't know what we were talking about and that we could take it or leave it.  He wasn't willing to negotiate even though we were more than willing to buy the car.  Additionally, while he was selling us the car, he kept trying to bait us with some product he also sold on the side.  It was some sort of protein powder for working out.  Very unprofessional.  Needless to say, we had to walk away.

Flash forward one week.  We found a tacoma that was the same year, same trim package and lower miles than the one at Fred Haas.  Guess what?  It was priced $3,000 cheaper and they came down $1500.  This was the same car in every way but the color.  

So.  The moral of the story....VInce's comment that ""We treat people like family"" wasn't quite the reality. 
 And, the ""lowest internet price in the area"" isn't quite as true as you would think.",1.4

38,"October 19, 2018","Toyota dealer is easy to see from I-45 north of Houston. It's a clean large parking lot. It's easy to pull in but you need to go slow so you don't miss it. Sometimes they get busy but if you call ahead you can make a reservation for service. That's the best way to do it. they're very clean and they put a mat in your car to keep it clean while they're working on it. They do the work as performed and will accept coupons. That's why I go in because of the coupons. I have used them before and we'll use them again.

Incredibly unethical Dealer- Sales staff & General Manager Both lied and horrible communication!

Now I understand why this Dealer has a 1.5 star yelp review. 

I bought a $51k Range Rover CASH from Fred haas Toyoto country in Houston in Oct 2017. I sent both my Assistant and 2 diff local mechanics to inspect car. All was great at time of inspection. Car looked perfect! 

Upon delivery I noticed there was scratches on car.  The delivery pick up guy documented the scratches in writing at time of pick up in Houston. It was obvious that the scratches had occurred after my 3 individuals viewed it and prior to shipping company picking up (it took a week or so to pick up) 

The salesman who I worked with (named Clint Barton) assured me on the phone they would mail me a $600 check to assist getting scratches off. After few weeks he went MIA and just stopped replying to my texts. So I spoke to general manager Bob gage who told me he would take care of the situation and get back to me within few days. It's now been over a month and I have left several messages with no reply. (This all started in October almost 5 months now) 

I sincerely was hoping they would simply take care of the customer especially after both the salesman Clint and GM Bob both  said it would get done. Last thing I want to do is post a horrible review as I know as a biz owner one bad review cost companies many future lost clients but it's mind blowing a $51k client could be treated so poorly. 

While price is important it's equally  important to deal with an ethical party in case issues arise! I'm extremely disappointed I did biz with Fred haas Totoyo country in Houston as putting aside the fact they promise me $600 and stiffed me the experience with all staff was an horrible experience.

From the first phone call I made to schedule my appointment to when I drove off with my vehicle was fast, easy, and stress free. 

I've been to many dealerships and have had bad experiences. But FRED HAAS was far from that. The Staff had absolutely wonderful customer service. 

The person who helped me at Fred Haas was Jack Muha. He was very professional, very personal, and overall AMAZING. I didn't feel rushed nor did I feel pressured. He answered every question I had. Most dealerships I have gone to had salesman or other employees that were agressive and shady. He was far from it which made me feel very comfortable on leasing my vehicle. I actually had an appointment at Sterling Mcall Toyota, but I'm so glad I called Fred Haas.

He told us to speak with William Hallgren. When we first met William, he was a very confident, yet soft spoken salesman. In other words, he was not an overpowering force, but could handle everything we needed. He was straight forward with us and he worked with us until we were able to come to a deal. He went out of his way to help us get a car that met our financial picture! He also brought in Ronnie, who again, very confident, but not overpowering. We then went to finance with Craig.

WILLIAM HALLGREN was very disappointing to work with and obviously doesn't know that an XSP package can go onto a 2017 XSE model.  POOR CAR KNOWLEDGE AND VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!  DON'T SHOP HERE...IT WILL JUST GIVE YOU A HEADACHE!  

GO BACK TO TRAINING WILLIAM...then maybe during your next 12 years of selling cars, you might know what you are talking about.",1.4

154,"May 29, 2016","We bought our Avalon Hybrid yesterday here.  We loved the car, but they were the first dealership we visited, and wanted to try one more dealership before purchasing.  We were annoyed they would not hold the car for us, even for 3 hours with a deposit, and warned us that it might be sold.  We still felt we needed to look one more place, so took our chances.  In 2 hours, we called and said we wanted the car and would give them our credit card over the phone.  They said someone else had gone for a test ride in the car we wanted and they would not accept our full price offer until the other couple completed their decision on buying.  Then, we were really annoyed since we would have been the first ones to come up with the money!  We complained to Clint, the manager.  Eventually, the other couple could not agree upon a price with the dealership, and we got the car!  However, upon reflection, we had to admit that the manager was trying to be fair to all.  There was not a perfect solution, but he risked alienating us to do what he felt was right, and we have to admire that.  We always want to work with businesses who do what is right, even if we have a different opinion!  So, we would highly recommend Vince & Clint!  We very much liked our finance person also!",5.0

The first time there was a middle aged lady from sales who was for somereasons very irritated and unpleasent, i guess, i should say rude and impolite , i had to say ""thanks, we' ll come some other time"" due to her behavior, she did not have the courtesy even to say ""bye"" .  We left the showroom with a bad experience. We were interested in buying a corolla and were searching deals, so , thought of going to this showroom again thinking that we may get a better sales person this time on May 10 2016 . It was even worse experience , the sales rep and his manager very so impolite, rude, arrogant and on top of that we were left with an impression that those guys were being racist . My wife who is pretty new to this county and can't very well understand the accent had the same impression about those guys and made us extremely upset. On top of that they behaved as if we had done a blunder by expressing our opinion on the deal or offer which they wanted us to go for anyhow. The two experiences from the same showroom upset me and my wife so much especially due to the feeling that we have been treated badly due to not being like them or racially different than them .

They came back and said first off I needed a new gas tank and fuel pump @ approx 1600 plus another grand for dropping the tank and cleaning out the system.  I told them to just clean the old tank (seems obvious, right???) and not to do the fuel pump, just clean the old one.  Whew saved 1600 bucks, right?  Nope, they then comeback and say I need all new injectors the the tune of 1700 bucks.  I told them no way and took my truck to the local shop in front of my subdivision.  That shop simply reset the codes and the truck is now fine.  Just to summarize, everything they said I needed was proven to not be true.  Gas Tank, Fuel Pump and Injectors NOT NEEDED.  They tried to swindle 3K grand out of me.  I still paid 1000 bucks to drop the tank and clean the lines, but better than 4000K.  They don't call it the Stealership for nothing.

We spoke with a service writer and he elected to grab the service manager...i've regretfully forgotten his first name, but I know that the Service Manager's last name is Doest. Mr. Doest would not even take a look at our tire, he refused to even walk outside to inspect the tire that we had in our trunk. His only response was ""you didn't buy tire coverage I can't help you"" I proceded to tell him that we were never offered tired coverage from our sales person or the individual in the finance office. We were not told about the service or we would have surely purchased it with our brand new vehicle as money and down payment was not an issue for us. I asked the service manager why we were not offered the tire protection and he told me that I needed to take that up with my sales person. My whole thing is; customer service, I gave you guys $10,000 less than a month ago and I walk in less than two weeks after the purchase and was treated like garbage. Mr. Doest was rude and unprofessional and could not produce answers to the questions we had. There was clearly a faulty tire put on our vehicle and Mr. Doest would not take the time out of his Saturday morning to walk out on to the service drive to LOOK at our tire. This tire should have been replaced by the dealership FOR FREE and without question. consequently, we had to go to firestone and spend almost $200.00 to replace ONE tire on a car that is not even two weeks old. I have spent the last five years working in a Harley-Davidson dealer service department and I have never treated anyone as poorly as we were treated this past Saturday. I have always treated all of my customers with the upmost respect, and I am always willing to go the extra mile to make them happy. If a customer has a question, and I do not know the answer, I find someone who can help. Mr. Doest was not at all concerned about keeping a new customer happy nor was he interested in finding answers for us. I also asked to speak to the general manager and Mr. Doest told me that ""the GM doesn't come out of his office for service issues"" This is absolutely unacceptable behavior...the ONLY reason we will return to the dealership is for routine maintenance.  The only reason Fred Haas is getting one star is because i can't give them a negative 5!

UPDATE 4/8/2014: i recieved a voice mail from the ""customer relations"" manager Donna Vau only for her to blame me and my husband.  her reasoning behind us not being offered the tire coverage was because we financed the vehicle and the warranty is not something you can finance.  WE DID NOT FINANCE THE VEHICLE BECAUSE WE HAD TO. WE FINANCED TO HELP OUR CREDIT SCORE. we could have paid cash for the entire thing. money was not an issue and we would have paid out of pocket for it.  She also said that the tire was my fault and that they couldn't help me and then offered to sell me tire coverage.  How would they know if it was OUR fault, if the service manager would not even come outside to look at it?!   I have never experienced such incompetence in my life.  If we are forced to contact Toyota directly, that's what we will have to do!  ",1.5

218,"February 17, 2014","Linda Harrell, worked with me via text messages, e-mails and cell phone conversations to locate and have delivered to the dealership the truck I wanted in 4 days from 2/11/2014 to 2/15/2014 Linda went the extra mile, (if you will) for complete customer satisfaction of the of Toyota's 4x4 Limited Crewcab Tundra 2014 truck that I purchased from Fred Haas Toyota Country in Tomball Tx. Just a note that I went to Gulf Coast Toyota and Ron Carter in Alvin to discuss a truck purchase and no one in sales approached me during the 30 minutes that I spent at each lot looking at the trucks that were available.

With that being said, sales personnel must have been awful busy during that time frame. 

Mike West in finance, was a pleasure to work with, although I had a preapproved auto loan and 1.9% financing is very inviting to the Toyota Corporation!

Linda Harrell and Keith Schneider, made arrangements for me to leave my personal vehicle at the dealership locked behind the gate, until I drove back Sunday to pick it up as Keith met there on his off day. 

Once again Linda was a real sweetheart on Valentines day to try to close the deal but the truck I pruchsed was delivered after closing that day at the dealership.

I had a good time last Saturday purchasing a vehicle when normally some people have a very stressful times in doing so. I will recommend Fred Haas to anyone for complete customer satisfaction and I'm thinking about keeping in touch for future vehicle purchases.

219,"February 17, 2014","I have been a loyal customer of Fred Haas Toyota Country since 2009 when I bought my first Toyota Camry and I will NEVER change from driving a Toyota much less changing dealerships.  I have had two Toyota Camry's and now drive a Venza.  In fact the Venza literally saved my life on how well it was constructed when I was hit by a man texting on his cell phone in 2011. God and Toyota were with me that day!  The service center has not once ever disappointed me or made me feel that I was not important. On the contrary, when I bring my SUV in for routine maintenance I always deal with Mr. Michael Hodge. His professionalism, patience and courtesy is of the highest quality. I have personally watched him wait on several customers, get every detail correct and still managed to make them feel as they are the only customer at the dealership.  This I can tell by the smiles on their faces.  Overall I cannot praise Fred Haas Toyota Country enough and promise to ALWAYS be a loyal customer.     (Brian Cook R.N.)",5.0

He was very professional and made sure we were happy in every way with our purchase. We had an unfortunate experience purchasing a previous vehicle and were not enthusiastic about buying another vehicle or repeating that experience. Mr. Skarzenski was very helpful in seeing that our experience with Fred Haas was exceptional - and it was. He listened to all our requests about what we wanted on our vehicle and fulfilled every one. He introduced us to the Service Mgr. Jan Martin so we would know who to see when we bring our Tundra in for maintenance. We were introduced to Farzan Naqvi in finance who helped us in choosing the best extended warranty for our vehicle. We were treated very well by a professional, friendly staff. We felt the price on our trade in was fair and we got a great price for a high quality vehicle. Our overall experience was far better than we expected making this an interesting as well as pleasing event. We would definitely recommend Mr. Skarzenski and Fred Haas dealership to family and friends.    ",5.0

224,"February 07, 2014",It was great dealing with the sales Lady and the service manager. I likes the way they worked with me on pricing over all and was very nice to work with. I would buy another Toyota there next time. Also the financial advisor was great to work with also.,5.0
225,"February 06, 2014","Extremely disappointed.  I requested a quote for a 2014 4Runner only because I had been contacted by another dealership willing to purchase my current 2011 4Runner.  I received a quote via the Fred Haas website that I was happy with but purchasing the new vehicle would depend on getting a trade that would make the purchase sensible.  I was contacted via telephone by Linda Harrell within an hour of submitting my online request.  I advised her at that time that I didn't NEED a new vehicle but would be interested in knowing, again, what I could get for my mint condition, sub 20K mile 2011 4Runner.  I also mentioned that I WOULD NOT be purchasing the vehicle today as I would need to discuss it with my wife.  

Upon arriving at the dealership, Linda took my car to get it evaluated.  Even her comments were ""Wow, why would you want to trade this vehicle in?"", referring to it's perfect condition.  We then began searching for the vehicle that I was interested in.  After looking around the lot for no less than 15 minutes, we finally went back to where the vehicle was located; WITH ALL THE OTHER 4RUNNERS!  The remote was not working so I tried unlocking the door with the key manually and found that the battery was dead.  Even with all of that, I was still interested in the vehicle.  But, that's were things started going down hill.

We returned to the show room to see if the inspection of my vehicle was complete.  The offer was at best OK, but it wasn't enough for me to jump into a new vehicle.  I felt I could do better.  That's when the typical dealership games began.  Even though I INSISTED that I would like to shop my vehicle around to see if I could get a better price, it was obvious that they didn't want me to walk out of that dealership without purchasing a new vehicle REGARDLESS of the stipulations that I made clear prior to coming to the dealership.  After approximately 4 trips back and forth to the sales managers office, I began to get frustrated.  This included their price sheet having the price of the vehicle set at MSRP.  I advised Linda that the price I was quoted was $2,900+ less than MSRP.  She asked where I received that price and I had to explain to her that it came from their online quote form, which I had with me!  

Eventually, Mitch Saulsberry made it a point to come speak with me, as if that would change my mind.  At this point, nothing they could have said would have made me purchase a vehicle because they had already lost my respect.  I'm soon to be 50 years old and don't need someone at a car dealership to give me advise and counseling, and basically, talk down to me.  I am well aware of the car buying process and generally know more about the products that salesmen are trying to sell than they do.  I'm also married to an individual that has been in the car financing business for over 25 years and know several other people in the auto financing/dealership industry.  BUT, I never walk into a dealership and drop the names of people that I know because I feel I should be treated fairly and respectfully regardless of who I know.

Once I was allowed to leave the dealership with the understanding, FINALLY, that I would need to discuss the purchase with my wife, I went outside only to find that my vehicle was nowhere to be found.  I had to search the lot and found that it had been taken to the back of the dealership and left with other trade in vehicles.  The dealership didn't even have the decency to return my vehicle to the front where they had picked it up.  

I have purchased two vehicles from this dealership in recent years, but those will be the last.  Up until yesterday, I had nothing but high regards for the service received from Fred Haas Toyota Country.  I've spent a lot of money at this dealership, whether it be purchasing new cars or using their service department.  Even with all of the issues I experienced on this day, I was still considering purchasing the new vehicle simply because I wanted it.  But after thinking more about what took place, unfortunately, they have seen the last of my business.

We stuck to our stand of finding a used car with low mileage at a low price. Well we knew that we would have eventually compromise on the price.
My first interaction with Fred Haas was over the phone when I called them asking for the options available with them. I found them very friendly. After discussing a few options which were either outside my budget or outside my acceptable mileage range I told them to keep me informed if something shows up. In a few days time I received a mail from them regarding a car which they thought I might like.

I checked the details provided in mail and immediately paid them a visit to have a look at the car. The car was perfect for us. It was a little over our budget still. However, we were willing shell out that little extra because it was still the best price we had received so far.

Overall, I was happy that they treated us very well and at the same time understood what we were looking for. I would definitely recommend them to a friend.",4.6

280,"September 19, 2013","First, let me say that over the past few years, I have purchased four new vehicles from Fred Haas Toyota World.  I have always been very happy with the sales and service received there.  In fact, I travelled past several other Toyota dealerships just to get to them.  In July, I was looking for a used vehicle for my college-bound child.  After much searching, we found an Acura at Fred Haas Toyota Country.  The sale went very smooth but that's the only good thing that I can say about this whole experience.  I had made it clear that we were sending this car off to another city in short order with our daughter.  We paid with a check...in hindsight, should have just brought cash.  They have a company policy to not process the car registration for at least 10 working days if you write a check.  The check cleared our bank five calendar days after writing the check.  Advised their clerk that it had cleared but they needed PROOF.  Not sure why they couldn't confirm that the money was in their account, but OK.  So I sent a copy of the cancelled check from my bank.  Not good enough.  I just gave up trying to expedite the registration process.  Was told they would have the plates on the 12th working day (16th calendar day) after the purchase.  In the meantime, we found out that the oil had been overfilled at FHTC.  Took the car to an Acura dealership who had to do an oil change.  We explained about just purchasing the car and they advised to check about a maintenance item that should have been taken care of 16 months prior to us buying the vehicle.  When I returned to FHTC to pick up the plates, I asked to speak to the salesman.  I waited and waited and waited.  He never showed up so I left a message with the receptionist to have the salesman call me.  He never did.  I called again 6 days later, he answered but said he was with a customer and he would call back within two hours.  Three days later, I sent him a text.  He replied saying he was ""overwhelmed"" when I had called previously.  He asked what my issue was.  I requested his email so that I could have a trail of this craziness.  He gave me a personal email....STRANGE!  Anyway, I requested that he find out if this maintenance issue had been handled by the previous owner or FHTC.  Prior to the purchase, he had glowingly reported that the car had had only one previous owner who had traded it in for a new Toyota van.  So, he knows who the previous owner is, right?  He replies to my email and tells me to check with John Eagle Acura.  We did check with them and they could not tell us.  The car had never been serviced by them.  And why did he tell us to ask them?  Anyway, I told him that they could not tell us.  On Aug. 26, he replied in an email that he called the previous owner and left him a message and he would let me know.  Well, I'm still waiting to hear back.  I did hear from FHTC on Sept 3.  It was a lady with the sales dept wanting to know if I was still considering buying a used car.  I informed her I had bought one over a month ago.  She asked which car I purchased since we were considering two vehicles in July.  UNBELIEVABLE!!  Over a month after the purchase and they don't even know that we bought a car.  I relayed my frustration with the lack of communication with the salesman and the lack of communication within FHTC.  She offered to relay my story to her manager.  I did clarify that I NEVER asked for anything to be done...I just need to know if this critical maintenance issue has been taken care of.  The only way to confirm, if not from the previous owner, is to pull the engine.  It is a SAFETY issue and I have my daughter driving this car.  I doubted that I would ever hear from anyone at FHTC and I was correct.  
A side note:  KARMA does exist.  On 31 AUG, my Toyota Highlander was totaled by a red light runner.  Guess who won't be writing ""FRED HAAS"" on my check's ""Pay to the order of"" line?",1.0

I was told I had a leaking oil pan gasket when I took my car to another place of business. I have always been treated more that fair at Baker, especially by Larry Patterson and James Powell over the years, so I brought my car to Baker to find out the true story. Sure enough, I was leaking from the oil pan gasket, and we agreed to the repair. When I spoke with James on the estimate we discussed the brakes needing some attention, which was also agreed to be taken care of. I noticed on the report that was sent to me that some filters showed up needing to be replaced. When I asked James about the true ""necessity"" of the replacement, he was honest and told me I could wait until my next oil change, which I will and THEN have them replaced. His integrity and honesty are traits that will keep me coming back....of course, he learned ALL of this from Larry. The consummate customer oriented service professional. Doing all he can to make sure I feel that I am treated properly, and keeping the interests of the dealership in mind as well.

We purchased my wife a 2012 Camry last year from Linda, and while we did have to do a healthy amount of negotiating, it was obvious that once we settled on a deal, Linda was just as excited as we were.  What we didn't expect was Linda to be waiting for us to drive off, smiling ear-to-ear, and waving us goodbye.

When it came time for me to get a car, we went right back to Linda and Fred Haas Toyota - and we received the same level of service.  We got a very similar deal on my Camry, and the same excellent service from Linda.  She talked with us for a bit as we were waiting for financing, and also showed us (again) that she wasn't in the business just for money - she actually enjoys it.  What blew me away this time was when we noticed some minor surface scratches on my new car, she immediately took it to the ""make-ready"" shop, got it all cleaned up and buffed out, and even took some fingerprints off the dash that we didn't comment about.  I was suitably impressed.  When it came time for us to drive off (right when the dealership closed), Linda was waiting for us, smiling again, just to wave us goodbye.

I was very straight forward with the sales person, and said, if you can beat this, then lets make a deal...if you can't, no worries, I will buy the truck from the other dealer.  After waiting over 45 minutes (with a toddler, mind you), the salesman came back with an offer that was about $6,500 higher.  I was angry and told them that they weren't listening.  Long story short, I finally got the deal that I wanted, and am VERY happy with my truck.  The finance manager was a huge help, and got us an incredible financing deal.  All of my experiences with the service department have been top notch.

The repair should have taken 3-4 hours so I should have been able to get my car back by 1:00PM, maybe... Well to my dismay the service department did call me at 4:30PM to pick up my vehicle. Now I know how important the service departments time is doing soo much work, but I think that scheduling my vehicle and taking my time is more important since I am or did pay for this service. Without people like us customers Fred Haas Toyota can close the ""new STATE_OF_ART"" service center, there will be no business for them. I have explained this to Jackie and others at the dealership but with people getting little pay to perform at high expectations.. this could take a long time for them to make happen. (02-21-13 WLM)

This morning I received a response from Jackie regarding my review of the Fred Haas service. My response to her is to have the proper answer to a customers need and expectation. I am still awaiting the response from Donna Vau. (02-12-13 WLM)

As of this morning, I submitted my request for answers and a resolution to what seems to be the service departments never ending issue of ""NOT"" meeting scheduled times. I will see what Donna Vau is going to say about me having a 10:00AM appointment for service and being told that they cannot see my vehicle for 3 hours, what is the appointment for? 
On 02/02/13 I purchase a certified used vehicle and just found out that the SRS computer board was supposed to be replaced, but it was not, it is on back order and they ordered the part 4 days ofter I accepted the vehicle. Also, I found out that the service department will take 3 hours to replace a tire that is under warranty; why does it take discount tire 1 hour to replace all four? On another note, I had a flat tire being replaced and my tire indicator light was still on. I checked the other 3 tires and found a nail in one of the front tires, had it repaired at Wal-Mart, why did the three techs working on my tire not check the other 3 tires??
When I receive my response from Donna Vau, I will re initiate this review. They are on the fence with me at this time!

2> Tires looked low.  Had them checked and all four tires were at 15 lbs pressure.

3> Service report said tires were all balanced.  Rear tire had balance weights stacked on the inside of the rim.  After a couple of miles this came loose an was hitting the rear caliper.  Sound was incredibly scary.  Found out from NTB that wheel weights should NEVER be stacked.

Sales: Good

380,"November 02, 2012","Just to start with, I do not recommend this dealer but by putting &amp;amp;amp;quot;yes&amp;amp;amp;quot; it was the only way to get my review posted. Only person I would recommend is the sales gentlemen. 

This individual called &amp;amp;amp;quot;manager&amp;amp;amp;quot; is very very unrespectful and will easily tell you to go someplace else to buy a car if you don't like his terms; and easily compare a TOYOTA DEALER with WALMART'S customer service, with that said I can tell you that WALMART offers way way better customer service than what this individual has given us.

So the web page states &amp;amp;amp;quot;The biggest difference you will discover at Fred Haas Toyota Country is a friendly staff of dedicated, well-trained, and experienced employees who understand and deliver the Fred Haas commitment to customers.&amp;amp;amp;quot; NOT TRUE! Also states &amp;amp;amp;quot;Whether you‚Äôre buying a new vehicle or you are servicing or repairing an existing one, you will discover why the Fred Haas reputation for integrity, honesty, and customer service has been a hallmark of this community for over 35 years.&amp;amp;amp;quot; Well this is NOT TRUE either this &amp;amp;amp;quot;manager&amp;amp;amp;quot; does not honor the deals proposed to the customer, treats customers like their cars or interest on buying is not Worth, and does not have a problem telling you to go some place else if you do not go with what he's saying, pressuring to close a deal on the same day and WITHOUT saying the trade car worth will change with in 2 days or even less. Changing the trade in value for $2,000 difference and sure enough leaving the car to buy at the same price, so the customer's car can &amp;amp;amp;quot;depreciate&amp;amp;amp;quot; $2,000 in 2 business days?? but sure enough the dealer's car still at the same price. This is not really a way to do business and NOT to treat people about to close a deal for more than $26,000. Hopefully, I can talk to his manager soon and will at least take the proper measurements.

As of now Toyota dealership on 249 has lost a entire family that had been clients for the past 10 years, with employees or &quot;managers&quot; like this one we would NOT WANT/LIKE to do business ever again, even though My parents just purchased a brand new vehicle with in the same week I was trying to purchase mine. 

It is totally clear to me and my family that who needs to be the manager is the sales rep a very decent, respectful gentlemen, and NOT individuals like this Clint Barton

To provide your services to a client or potential client because the client or potential client does not provide a social security account number or a taxpayer identification number. 

You personally, and the Institution you represent, may be liable for damages and attorney's fees. 

In accordance with Section 1 of Pub. L. 93-579, also known as the ""Privacy Act of 1974,"" and Title 5 of United States Code Annotated 552 (a), also known as the ""Privacy Act,"" you are being informed of the following: 

""The right to privacy is a personal and fundamental right protected by the Constitution of the United States. You may maintain in your records only such information about an individual as is relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose required by statute or by executive order of the President of the United States.""

Section 7 of the Privacy Act of 1974 specifically provides that it shall be unlawful for any Federal State or local government agency to deny to any individual any right, benefit, or privilege provided by law because of such individual's refusal to disclose his social security account number. 

""Right of privacy is a personal right designed to protect persons from unwanted disclosure of personal information..."" CNA Financial Corp. v. Local 743 515 F. Supp. 942.

For tax matters;

Should the court determine that the agency acted in a manner which was intentional or willful, the agency shall be liable to the wronged party in an amount equal to the sum of: 

Actual damages sustained, but in no case less than $1,000; and
