6,"May 12, 2020","Working with prior dealerships, we had spent a full day (literally) trying to get a deal done.  Going into the dealership, there was a lot of uncertainty because of our credit issues and we were mentally preparing ourselves for the long day ahead.  We met with Scott and he immediately put our minds at ease.  Initially, we were looking to get into a used car (2008 Ford Ranger) but with our credit issues, this would have required us to make a substantial down payment.  Rather than go this route, and at Scott’s advice, he said that he could possibly get us into a new car with a much lower deposit.  In hearing this news, we decided to take a test drive with the 2020 Mirage ES.  

We went around the block and to our amazement, Scott had advised us that they had found a lender!  Rather than going home, either empty handed or with a used car, we were able to head home with a brand new vehicle.

Based on this experience, we would HIGHLY RECOMMEND the Don Herring dealership and especially Scott Fickert to our friends and family.

Thanks again Scott, for making this one of the best buying experiences that we have ever had!

Best regards, 

Randy and Erica Cremar

7,"May 10, 2020",Scott was great to work with and was a great help with all the phone setup and Sirius setup on the Outlander.  I enjoyed my buying experience and everyone at the dealership I met was really great. They made everything as easy as possible and probably the best car buying process I have ever done. Scott answered all my questions and was very professional. Both my mom and sister are repeat customers looks like I will be also. Shane was also really great to help with the financing and paperwork . Thank you Shane and Scott both.,5.0

12,"April 02, 2020",I experienced amazing Customer Service with the employees at the Plano Mitsubishi!! We kept hearing advertisements about the deals going on and decided to go check them out. We haven't always had the best of luck with dealerships but this place changed our luck. Scott was very friendly and we all made jokes during our visit which made it more comfortable chatting with. He takes everything one step at a time so no one gets rushed or over thinks everything. Shane was the one who ran all of our information to see what deals he could get us. He checked everything he possibly could to get an amazing deal for us. During all the financial process Shane explained what he was doing and answered any questions we had with great detail. Shane even helped us understand our credit more and what Lenders looked for. When it came time to sign the papers William was very friendly and walked us through every paper that we were signing. This was a great experience for buying a car. I will definitely go back for future cars. Other than the warranty they offer for the vehicle there are other amazing features that they include with buying from them. I am very grateful for all of their knowledge and help that they provided to us. They all helped us get in a vehicle that I have been searching for with third row seating that fits in my budget. ,5.0
13,"April 02, 2020","Scott was awesome! He was laid back, honest and not pushy! He was so kind and funny!

15,"March 26, 2020",Great dealership. Scott is the best!  That is who you need to talk to. He did a great job!  Thank you Scott.  This is my second one from you.,5.0
16,"March 25, 2020","The Plano location is so much more professional, knowledgeable and honest than the Irving location, which I have done business with in the past. People have asked me why I go ""all the way"" to the Plano location for sales and service. I tell them that the staff members that I've met at Plano are sincerely friendly and honest ... and so far above the staff at any other dealership that I've ever visited or done business with. The Irving location did NOT do the promised follow up on my application, the salesman that I met with was very difficult to reach by phone and the sales staff there do not seem anywhere near as honest and caring as the associates in Plano.

Another HUGE reason to go to the Plano location, no matter where one lives, is because Scott Fickert works there! He is unlike any other ""car salesman"" that I've ever met: Straightforward, honest, great personality and TRUSTWORTHY. This is the second vehicle that I've purchased from Scott. The very first time I talked to Scott on the phone, I knew that I'd never purchase a vehicle from anyone or anywhere else. Scott makes buying a car so easy, uncomplicated and explains everything in great detail.

My boyfriend also wondered somewhat why I drive to the Plano dealership when I live in Irving. I told him that there is absolutely no comparison between the two locations and what a pleasure it is to work with Scott. He still wasn't totally convinced until he talked to Scott himself via speakerphone while I was waiting on the paperwork. Even over the phone, Scott comes across as completely different from most car salespeople. His honesty and respect for his clients are extremely obvious in person as well as over the phone. Scott gained a new future customer -- my boyfriend -- who lives even further away from Plano than I do! He now agrees that the opportunity to do business with Scott is well worth the drive.

Scott's communication with his clients doesn't end at the close of the sale. He texted me the next day to see how things were going and if I had any questions. I did have one question and Scott answered it completely and in easy-to-understand terms. He is a brilliant communicator and an enormous asset to both Don Herring Plano and the Mitsubishi brand overall. Until I met Scott in early 2018, I was not necessarily going to purchase another Mitsubishi because I was WAY less than thrilled with my treatment at the Irving location ... although I had purchased two vehicles from them previously.

I cannot remember exactly how I found out about the Plano location, but I am extremely grateful that I did. Having a resource such as Scott is invaluable!",5.0
17,"February 23, 2020","All I can say is Scott Fickert is AH-mazing!! I had the please of spending the ENTIRE day with him at the dealership. 5 car walk-throughs, two tests, and a bunch of paperwork later I drove off the lot in my dream SUV. He was more than wonderful through every car he pulled or we went over before pulling he seemed just as excited as I was to take a look. He went above and beyond to make the entire process fun, yes it was actually fun!! Definitely would refer him an go back. He was very knowledgeable and helpful and PATIENT, and just wanted to make sure when I left I was happy. He accomplished just that!!",5.0

We were desperately in need of a dependable vehicle and had a deadline of two weeks to find one.
We had purchased our previous vehicles from the ""buy here, pay here"" lots and fell victim to the vehicle breakdown horrors that are associated with the ""as is"" purchases. We were blessed by family and friends who were able to lend a hand and vehicle to make it through since our last vehicle broke down. My husband and I are blessed with being the caregivers of his mother. I drive her to dialysis 3 days a week and really needed my own, dependable vehicle to do so. We were desperate and needed a blessing. We were listening to the radio as we lay in bed Sunday evening and heard the ad on 98.7 FM about Don Herring Mitsubishi and the credit amnesty program. We decided we would drive out to Plano and ""give it a try"".
Monday morning we were shopping for a vehicle with little to no down payment and a prayer.
My husband and I were greeted by Scott Fickert immediately upon arriving in the dealership parking lot. Not just a ""hello, how may I help you?"" greeting but a genuinely sincere, inviting and warm welcome. At that moment I knew we made the right decision. Throughout the entire purchase process Scott was more than accommodating not just with information but making sure we were comfortable. We didn't feel intimidated or pressured in any way. Scott embraced us like we were family or long lost friends.
Long story short, Scott was able to get us into a brand new vehicle, something we haven't been able to do since 1989. We had a minor snag near the end of the process in which Scott came to the rescue. We needed insurance to drive off the lot and had no choice but to drive back to our bank, make a cash deposit and make an insurance premium payment. Scott offered to make the transaction using his personal credit card and we reimbursed Scott the cash.
So many blessings in one day!
At the end of the day we thanked God for blessing us with Scott and all the staff at Don Herring Mitsubishi!

33,"December 26, 2019","When I arrived to the dealership I was greeted by Scott. I was having a really rough day from crying and being turned down from dealership after dealership. I had a very complicated situation from a divorce.Me and my ex husband had 2 cars together (Still open on my credit) and I also had a repossession in April 2019 after I couldn't find another job. I knew it would be hard but I tried my luck again because I heard about the Credit Amnesty program. Scott was very caring and went straight to work on finding me a lender. Him and Will worked extremely hard and got me a 2016 Mitsubishi Out lander sport. My new ride only had 26,000 miles on it so it was practically brand new to me. Scott made sure my truck was detailed and he even jumped in and put in some elbow work himself! So long story short, When this dealership say they can get you into a new car with bad credit or not, I can attest to that!! Christmas eve 2019 will never be forgotten thanks to the 2 angels God sent down from heaven for me. Special thanks to Scott (and Will ) who went wayyy above and beyond their position and made sure I was taken care of. Now me and my son are happy and rolling again!! Thanks guys!!",5.0

38,"December 01, 2019"," In the past I have bought several vehicles from other dealerships, but this was the best car buying experience thanks to Scott Fickert. Very knowledgeable in his profession and he is extremely patient in answering all your questions and concerns. Simply stated he is Excellent.
  Always helpful and considerate it is a pleasure to deal with him.
His well meaning tips during the purchase process reflect his benign concern for the customer.
What impressed me most was - his willingness to be helpful even after the car sale is completed.Many reviews have reflected this aspect of Scott going out of his way to resolve problems of his prior customers.

39,"December 01, 2019","After reading about the excellent reputation of  Don Herring Mitsubishi Plano - I called them to check about the  Outlander PHEV. Fortuitous circumstances resulted in getting in touch with Scott Fickert. What impressed me the most was his willingness to go the extra mile and call me back with all info that I wanted.
Scott is in the business of selling - imbued with a great sense of integrity,transparency and moored in the solid foundation of ethical values. His empathy to the customers and willingness to always be helpful naturally draws  car buyers to him. I benefited by reading the several hundreds of positive reviews about him and after interacting with him, I can confirm that I am extremely impressed and pleased too.
Mr Alex Armenta and Mr William Flores were very helpful  and considerate all along the way.
They made the transactions easy!
In this dealership there are no unnecessary pressures put to buy extra services or adding of any junk fees surreptitiously sneaked in.
Very many thanks to Scott and I would recommend Scott to all my acquaintances.

41,"November 30, 2019","Scott in Sales made the process of buying my first new car hassle free! I came into Don Herring a little nervous and with my guard up but left feeling like a part of their family. Scott made sure I was up to date in the process of buying every step of the way. 

William and Alex in Financing are true hero’s. I have never had a credit card and truly had zero credit. They were able to work magic, find a good bank for financing and my APR just kept dropping! These guys truly care and listen to details. My best friend passed away in a car accident and ever since then I have been very nervous about driving. I wanted to be in a safe car. William reassured me with statistics, facts, and percentages so that I knew I would be safe and secure in an Outlander.  

After buying my white 2019 Outlander SEL my dream was to black out my rims and other features of the vehicle. Benny in Service/Parts made ALL of my dreams come true and MORE! This dude is awesome. Very down to earth, honest, and is great about communicating vehicle updates. Go to Benny for all your body shop needs!!! 

These guys are honest and upfront! I have been into Don Herring multiple times since buying and I am always treated with the same respect and positive attitudes each and every time. Thank you Don Herring Mitsubishi!😊",5.0

Scott had a genuine concern to make sure we were not just buying a car but that we were satisfied every step of the way. We never got the run around like other dealerships had previously given us. Everything was black and white and clear with each step. For my husband and I, that meant a lot because other dealerships had “dangled the carrot” before, only for us to be disappointed. Because of these experiences, we went in with a high level of skepticism. Scott quickly changed any doubts we had, and worked with us to get us what we wanted, and in the price range we wanted. But it wasn’t just Scott, because the finance manager Will had the same type of genuine attitude. I’ve never had a car buying experience be so quick, and effortless, and over all so pleasant.",5.0

71,"September 12, 2019"," Aubrey Gutierrez at Don Herring Mitsubishi in Plano comes night recommended. He is family friendly and interacted with my family make sure our needs were met. We came in to look and ended up leaving with a car that was in our budget, and met our safety needs. We talked about what we were looking for in a family SUV and were in no way talked into anything beyond our means. 
 Aubrey made sure to talk to our girls (aged 2 and 4) about what cartoons they liked to watch, and made sure to make them a part of the buying process. When the girls started to get antsy he showed us the Lego room, and the hot chocolate machine. 
 After the girls and I built the ""tallest tower ever,"" my husband came to show us our 2019 Outlander Sport. I was excited that we were able to get something newer with warranties and up to date safety features. My husband is happy that we have a reliable vehicle for the family. The girls fit nicley in the backseat with their car seats, there is enough room to wiggle. They are very excited that their windows go down and that we can have a ""picnic"" on the back storage area.

170,"March 22, 2019","First, I have got to say that this dealership will not scam you, or try to hide anything from you. They were up front about everything from the beginning to end. I had been given the run around from several other dealerships. I had almost given up. I even didn't want to go here for the fear of just being screwed over again. My credit had been shotguned so many times that it could have been going season. All i needed was a truck for my family and work. It was my wife who said to try one more time. She had prayed on it, and felt that this time was different. If I'd only known how right she was. We finally got to the dealership. I was hardened towards the thought of dealing with another salesman. Then there was Scott. We weren't bum rushed when we got there. He greeted us when we got to the door. Asked us what we wanted, and what we were looking for. I already had the truck in mind. He didnt run off wanting my credit, or to talk payments. He grabbed the keys, and off for the test drive we went. They treated my family with the respect and kindness. Mind you i have two small boys 1 and 3. While on the drive i explained how i knew about the truck. That i was just checking major engine wear. Scott never once tried pushing a sales pitch on me. About how perfect the truck was, or how he had something better. I actually got to focus on the truck and the sale. He never once tried ""pulling the wool over my eyes."" We got back, and as i was showing my wife the truck Scott asked if i wanted to get my trade-in appraised. We said to go ahead. I talked with my wife outside. No one cramming a sales pitch down our throats. It was comfortable, and i dare say the best experience i have ever had at a dealership. We finally agreed, and told Scott we were ready to go ahead. It wasnt until at this point that anything about money or credit had been mentioned. I dont have the best of credit mind you. Scott did amazing. Can i tell you. If it had changed on paper we knew about it. They didnt hide anything from us. They got my wife a drink, and my sons a coloring paper. They were doing thier best to make this as comfortable as possible. Finally the numbers went through. Alex came over to talk to us. I was surprised at the fact that when i said i didnt want something. That it wasnt like i had to get a divorce from that item. He just said ok, and marked it off. Then, because i was so blown away i forgot to mention that i wanted to keep my old plates. They are military and expensive. I was scared to bring it up. I asked expecting to be told to get to stepping. Actually they turned and looked as caring as they had in the beginning. Told me they understood and would jump on it when they could. Let me tell you. I hate doing Finance. Its like you get the dealership mask, and the ugly truth when you get dropped of to the Finance Man, the Repo mans nicer looking brother. Not this time. It wasnt until Alex said he had some papers for me to sign that i realized we were already doing finances. It was so smooth and enjoyable i never had the sinking gut feeling or the uncontrollable doubt. I could never know a dealership i would recommend so highly. Here i know if i send someone to buy a car or truck. It wont be like sending them to war. I will definitely go here again. The staff here and the environment was just beyond words. If your worried at all, trust me i was there. 5 times. This place on the other hand was worlds different. I cant express enough how much i recommend Scott and Alex. Those guys are literal models of what buying a car should be. Yes price is a four star, but lets be realistic here. We always want prices to be better. Thats the whole point of shopping. Dont take it wrong though. They did thier absolute best, and i knew about it. ",4.8
171,"March 22, 2019","First off I was a little skeptical about going, not just to this dealership but yet another one. We had been denied at least four times already. We walked in and we were greeted by Scott who was awesome from the get go. He found out what truck my husband was looking at and we sat down, not once did he try to scam us into a deal we couldn't afford. He was up front about every aspect and detail. After the test drive he went and got numbers, he came back with a sheet that had payment amounts and we were happy with what we decided, and Scott went above and beyond to get us an even better deal than what was originally decided. Needless to say, I will come back for any future car purchases as I have never encountered a more caring, kind, and awesome sales individual. So thank you Scott for all of your help with getting us into a truck finally. For any individual looking to buy a truck, or any other vehicle, go see Scott, I promise you wont be dissapointed.",5.0

178,"March 09, 2019","Hello,
I'm leaving this review because of the great experience that I had at Don Herring Mitsubishi  in Plano,TX
I own a 2017 Mitsubishi Mirage, that I didn't purchase there but had been getting my car serviced there for almost 3 years. So as usual I was getting my car serviced on 3/07/2019, didn't want to sit in the waiting  area decided to walk around outside and look at the new cars..so saw this 2019 Outlander Sport (Metallic Red) beautiful inside and out. I was approached by a salesman named Bijan he asked me was I interested in that vehicle I said no I was just killing time while my car was being serviced, but I kept looking at it and Bijan said  while you are waiting would you like to drive it? I was like really? It was a like night and day driving the Outlander Sport compared to my Mirage. I really liked it. So to make a long story short...I ended up purchasing the Outlander sport and when I say I was treated  WELL from Bijan, to the finance manager, they were so kind I have had some bad experiences with dealerships but this one..at Don Herring Mitsubishi in plano,tx they don't  see you as a black, white, Mexican,  Chinese. .. they see you as a CUSTOMER and you are treated with kindness like you are the only person there. If you don't believe me, then stop by for yourself I went from a 2017 to a 2019 and it didn't take hours and hours probably because they know what they are doing. ",5.0

I found the one he really wanted on Edmunds and it was considered “Great Deal.” I inquired on it and Scott Fickert was my salesman. Don Herring Mitsubishi in Plano has a “no haggle” policy and they stick to it. Great! The car was below NADA book! Scott was very friendly and personable. I showed up two hours before my appt so the car wasn’t ready yet, but he went over everything they did for the car to ensure it was mechanically sound (I have to drive it to Arizona to deliver it in a few days.) Once the deal was done, he helped me load it on my car dolly and get it all cinched down for my 2 hour drive back home. He even went out of his way to research safe loading and proper tire pressure for my hauling dolly while I was in with the finance manager. 
I would highly recommend seeing Scott for your next car purchase! There’s no BS, he’s friendly, knowledgeable and is a point of contact throughout the process. ",5.0

The injuries I sustained are so much less than they would have been in a less safe car. As soon as I was able, I headed back to Don Herring in Plano and Scott was great to work with.

I thought that buying a used car would be my only option because I didn’t have excellent credit and did not have a high cash down payment. I was introduced to Scott Fickert, who immediately put my daughter and I at ease. I explained my circumstances and what I was looking for and Scott gave me several options, all better than my original inquiries. It was my daughters first car buying experience and she was stunned on how simple, easy and most of all pressure free our experience was. She thought it would be a pushy, pressure situation She even opened up and started asking Scott questions herself. He patiently answered all her questions, showed her all the “gadgets” she would be interested in such as hands free calling, Bluetooth connect and the back up camera. He was friendly, intelligent and most of all funny and pleasant to be around and have a conversation with.  I ended up buying a new car for the same monthly payment I was expecting on a used car. Scott was amazing. Scott has an fantastic sense of humor and the entire time it was like visiting with an old friend.  He never pushed, talked to my teenage daughter and treated her like she was the one buying the car.

237,"November 22, 2018","Recently I purchased a car (used) from Scott.  It is the 4th my wife Nancy and I have gotten from your dealership.  His service to me this time went beyond the norm.  I had the unfortunate experience of totaling my last car.  There was a 3-week delay because my insurance company was deciding what to do about my coverage and how to write off the car.  My wife had decided that we would volunteer to help at the polls this year, an assignment that was 11 days in duration. 
 Immediately the next day, she had booked us a flight out to visit her granddaughter.  I was totally out of pocket a long time.  Before I flew out,, I told him the insurance settlement came in and I was ready to go forward.  Gave him my specs for the car and would come in to see what he'd found  after returning.  Scott had picked 3 vehicles that should meet my needs, had a writeup on each at his desk and then walked me out to view them.  The first car he showed me qualified but I would not decide until after all 3  were inspected.  Then, the first one was my choice.  Before I told him, I asked ""if you were buying, which one would you pick"" ?  Unblinking he said the first one.  It was the cheapest.  I have complete trust in Scott.  How many other sales reps across this business would have done that ? Because I know he always does what is best for me, not for him.  He is more than your salesman.  He is an ambassador of your business.

My wife will be replacing her Endeavor fairly soon.   She has taken on the responsibility for her granddaughter's college tuition.  Once this semester is over, she can compute what will be needed for next year and put that amount in her bank account.  Then she'll be calling on Scott again.  

I also interface with a dozen men (all retired) at least 3 days a week.  The next time the conversation is about autos, I will be talking up your dealership to them as a place to get a great deal.  

I am just glad Scott is in my life.  Friends like him are rare.

He had us drive a vehicle he thought represented our current needs and wishes. Had a different color vehicle brought up for us to see a different choice. Then upon further discussion he had another brought up to fulfill a second thought. As we questioned another option that fulfilled a want, Scott had yet another vehicle brought up and we took anther test drive. They lived up to what they had claimed they could pay for my car upon inspection, too. Most dealers in my past has made claims, but then came up terribly short.

Shane heard me out and said he was going to do whatever he had to to get me in a car i loved. Well he did just that. I am still in shock that i have this GORGEOUS Outlander. They did a lot to get me approved and they have no idea how much i appreciate it. I was completely without a car and not only did they get me a car when i had lost all hope but they got me into a car, i never thought i could have. it's more than i could have imagined and i am so thankful for everything they did to make it happen!",5.0

321,"July 02, 2018","I am submitting my experience as a loyal customer of Don Herring for 15 plus years, having owned 4 Mitsubishi vehicles – 

On Sunday, June 24th my 2018 Eclipse Cross sunroof glass blew out while I was driving the vehicle.  I pulled off the highway to inspect what happened and found no trace of debris that would have hit the sunroof glass causing it to explode.  I had to drive home on side streets due to the air/wind from the open sunroof, with broken glass I sent a text to the sales rep, Mr. Flores, that sold me the car and he responded that he believed the issue would be covered under warranty.  I text him back I would bring the car in tomorrow morning.  

On Monday, June 25th I took my car in for service regarding the issue and spoke to Mr. Hernandez.  I asked for a loaner car, but not an option, however, was offered a complimentary rental car through Enterprise.  The challenge with Enterprise is I must provide personal insurance or pay additional for daily insurance coverage through Enterprise.  The service associate  showed concern for the issue and checked my car in for service.  I was advised the issue would need to be investigated to determine plausible cause and next steps.  I called sales rep who advised he needed to speak with the service team and he would call back me back within 20 minutes.  That was a week ago and Mr. Flores did not call me back.  

On Tuesday, June 26th (or Wednesday, June 27th) the service associate advised pictures and details had been sent to Mitsubishi.  The final determination after investigation was the sunroof glass had indeed cracked and exploded from the INSIDE OUT – this could have been due to the glass manufacture had faulty glass that was not properly tempered for hot and cold climates – there have been no other reports of this concern as of last week.  I was reassured the sunroof glass and components would be replaced new and covered under warranty.  As well, the parts would arrive by Friday, June 29th and my car would be ready by Monday, July 2nd.  At this time I am awaiting a call to confirm I can pick up my car.

I would have thought with the chain of events and investigation by Mitsubishi the Don Herring sales manager, service manager or someone in a management role would have taken the time to make a courtesy call to me regarding this issue as a longtime customer.  Unfortunately, that has not happened and I have been without my new vehicle for 7 days as of yesterday (July 1st) and it has been in the care and service of Don Herring.

369,"April 02, 2018","I drove up to the dealership on March 31st on my way to my job to finish up some online training. When I stopped out front Scott walked up to my car and asked me how he could help me out. After I explained my interest in getting a loan and my curiousity in the process of getting approved Scott invited me inside to chat about the way that Don Herring does their financing. In no time at all he explained that even people with barely used credit and some knocks on my credit history have a chance at getting approved. 
I was skeptical of this claim since I had been denied a loan from Kia, Mazda, and Honda within the last two years in my search for my first new car. Scott walked me through the process of getting a loan and how I could avoid taking hits to my credit score by running a soft inquiry instead of them automatically assuming I wanted to run a hard inquiry. Since he asked my permission and the outlook for getting a loan was good I proceeded with a hard inquiry to the bank. I was approved for the first time ever since my search began five years ago. 
I had stipulations in order to get the loan I was approved for which included my current car, 1998 Mazda Protege ES 1.5L w/205,000 miles, and getting full coverage insurance before I could drive off. After the deal went through and Scott showed me my new 2017 Mitsubishi Mirage (hatchback) in depth I was able to drive away the same day I showed up with my simple questions about their loan process. I am definitely recommending Don Herring Mitsubishi in Plano, Texas to my friends and family. They took care of someone like me who has a lot of credit hits and it's the first time I've ever felt trusted by a dealership enough to make it all the way through the process. I'm now driving my new car and getting compliments from my family on the quality of the model and it's nifty ""trick"" that the CVT transmission can do by switching into Drive-S to use as an engine brake when coming to sudden stops.

We sat down and spoke with  Scott who took the time to find exactly what we were looking for within our price range. Scott is honest and straight forward. No tricks or gimmicks.  My son had special requirements i.e sound system. We ended up leaving with a 2018 Outlander Sport. The price was right, my son got wht he wanted and everyone was happy.

Scott was great about seeing that we got the best deal and everything that we could want and then a few extras that we didn't anticipate.  Alex was great hammering out the financing and got us a great rate and we were able to drive it off the lot that evening. Both stayed late to ensure that we were able to walk out feeling good with our purchase.  Car buying isn't always fun, especially when you are in the position of having to buy one and have limited time, but Scott was fun to talk with, knowledgeable about the cars on the lot, and ensured that we walked away confident that we made the right choice.

He started telling me what it has compared to my 2014, We went to his desk,  He went over the car and got one that we could drive, got the baby seat out of the old car and went on an adventurous test drive.
I told him about how my 60000 mile warranty was about to expire. He told me what if I could could get me in a 2016 Outlander SEL for what I was paying for the 2014 SE, He brought up 4 Outlanders and I said No to all of them, He brought a Quartz pearlescent  metal flake paint , I did not like it at first but I grew to fall in love with it. I said I have to talk to my husband and that was that he was not pushy, I liked that.

I asked him to hold the car for me until I arrived which he did (don't know if there was a lot of interest in the car but he had it ready when I arrived). We went for a drive, I told him my price range, and they met it. I had a pre-approved loan which he said was a great rate but felt they could do better...and they did. That is when we met Ralph Knight. He asked me if I wanted any coverage on the vehicle and I told him no because my budget was tight. He said no problem, had me sign about 3 documents, and we were on our way. I have never experienced such a quick way to purchase a vehicle and Ralph didn't force me to buy something I didn't want to. My wife even commented that she expected to be there 3 hours, just in financing . From the time I arrived to the time I left, the whole process took about 2 hours...and they threw in a car wash. They forgot to fill the gas tank but if I would have caught it earlier, I am sure they would have rushed over to do it! Thanks for putting my faith back into dealerships guys! Both of you were awesome and I will be telling people to see Mike and Ralph at Don Herring Mitsubishi!

I am currently awaiting a part (belt) for a recall, but my service engine soon light came on so I took my vehicle in for analysis.  To my surprise there was a charge of $100 to determine the ""issue"", but then I was told it was faulty (misreading) error code for the catalytic converter and there was no issue - no damaged parts that would normally cause that light to come on.  They just needed to reset the ""mainboard"" and that would turn off the service engine soon light.  This was a cost of $125.00 total.  Thank goodness Larry helped me find a coupon on the website for 10% off (every little bit helps!).  I realize the service team does not set the prices.  I just really thought that price was extremely high.  It took less than 30 minutes to complete.  I am a long term customer, my service history will show ALL work is completed at Don Herring (even oil changes) - the only exception is tires.

JAY who is a ""master"" tech was very professional in explaining the work he has done and was very accommodating on some other questions I had.

So far, I didn't have that ""feeling"" of doubt over their honesty and integrity. I was appreciative of the fact that they even cleaned my car which is an experience I've always had with my previous BMWs.  The best part of my experience was my drive home!  The alignment and wheel balancing made a significant difference with the way my car drove.

Trying to decide if I should drive the extra distance and wanted to do some of the homework from the comfort of my own home. Don Herring was slow to call back initially. Ok, dealerships are busy, no biggie. I would not think so during an ice storm, but maybe. I don't know, I wasn't there. Had slow response time to email. Felt like I was pulling teeth when trying to get an answer.  Maybe they only want to deal with you face to face to make sure I'm serious. Ok, but if I'm going to drive the extra distance to their dealership, I want to make sure it's worth my time - - and theirs. Asked for pricing information and got the run around. When asked if the quoted price included the loyalty incentive, it took 3 days to get the answer. Really? It takes 3 days to figure that out? Humm. Started feeling like when I got there I was going to be playing games and feeling trapped and like they wanted to avoid answering hoping that I would just give up and come on in where they could lower the bomb. Not my scene.

616,"June 20, 2013","When I was doing my research (6-months of research) to purchase a new vehicle that would fit all my needs,  I first went to the GMC Dealership to purchase a GMC Terrain, only to find out the Terrain only had a full bench back seat rather than a split seat, which was a total deal-breaker for me due to my needs. I didn't even test drive the Terrain. I was upset that I was going to have to start my research all over again since I didn't have a 2nd choice!!

While I was driving to work one day, I saw an Outlander in front of me and I managed to see the entire vehicle and thought ""wow"" what a great looking vehicle. So I started my research with the Outlander and based on the information I found, I decided it was the vehicle for me.  When I arrived at the dealership, I was even more impressed with how well they treat their customers and how hard they worked to get me out of there in as short amount of time as possible while making sure that I was getting and understood all the correct information on my purchase and finance.

I decided that I will continue to drive Mitsubishi vehicles throughout the rest of my life and the Plano site will be my dealership of preference.

My new Outlander has a 4-cyl engine with ECO Boost and gets great gas mileage, a split back seat as well as a third row seat for all my grandkids. I have 5-grandchildren who range in age from 14yrs to 3 yrs and can't wait to get them all in my new Outlander at the same time.

I talked old cars with the owner, the sales manager fed me lunch, the price I recieved for my trade actually was higher than talked about on the phone, I was able to test drive the evo the way your supposed to test drive an evo and they wer extemely educated with modds I had on my trade in. I even got to watch drag racing videos on youtube while they put together the paperwork. The numbers were exactly as discussed. The finance and paperwork part of the experience was pleasant.

I do not have any connections with this dealership nor do I have any incentive to write this review other than how pleased I was with my recent purchase and trade-in of my former vehicle.  Dwight greeted me immediately upon parking at the dealership.  Super nice guy, very friendly, not too aggressive as a salesman (just wanted to find something I would be interested in).  I already knew by doing research for hours prior to stepping foot in a dealership what to expect as far as prices both for my car and the car I was interested in purchasing.  Without going into details, I got very good to excellent value for my car at least by KBB's standard.  I also got the guys at Don Herring to match their internet deal that had included rebates (specific rebates the manufacturer gives that I didn't qualify for).  I originally was planning on purchasing another type or brand of vehicle, but the service and deal Don Herring made me blew the other dealerships away.  This only confirmed my approval of the purchase when I had leather seats installed later the next week.  I dropped it off with a near-empty tank of gas and an already somewhat dirty vehicle.  They gave me a brand-new rental (nearly identical to the car I purchased) for the 2 days I was waiting on leather seats to be installed.  When I picked up my vehicle, they had filled my tank with gas and washed/cleaned my car again for me!  These little things stood out to me and I was impressed by their customer service.  Aaron Overton was the general manager there and he personally made sure the leather seats were up to Don Herring's quality standards.  I definitely recommend this dealership and am a very satisfied customer that will be a repeat customer someday down the road I'm sure.

645,"February 01, 2013","I gave this dealership such a high score because of one reason, My sales rep. Mr Scott Flickert, I've been coming to the Don Herring Dealership in Plano for several years now. Thru the fantastic customer service Scott gave the very 1st time my self and my (at the time) wife recieved. Over the course of 5yrs now there has been 4 cars 3 new and one used cars purchased thru Scott. I've worked in Retail, Banking and several other customer service fields and Scott is by far the best Rep I have come across. 

Scott made me feel important, my opinion was valued and he wanted to know what it was I wanted in a car. Everytime without question Scott displayed fantastic service and a overall great car buying experience. The 1st time I met scott my wife was in the dealership looking to trade in her Outlander. I was only there for support when I ran across a brand new (still on the showroom floor) 2009 Galant rally art. I told Scott I wasnt there for myself but for my wife, he simply replied with ""ok let me know when you want to sit in it"". As the deal with my wife came to a close and I took his advise to sit in it I feel in love with my 1st Mitsubishi, Scott NEVER made me feel pressured nor did he double talk in any way but what he did was create a new and loyal customer.  That day my wife and myself drove away in our new cars, and then 2yrs later I returned to Scott and he helped me get into another car. (2010 ford focus) 

And now recently I returned to Scott looking to trade in that Focus for something a little more me, and like many times before Scott and the great team at the Plano location helped me get into my brand new Mitsubishi Lancer 2012.. I am a loyal customer not just to Don Herring but to the Plano location..I can honestly say that I have NEVER cared about where I went to get a car, but ever since meeting Scott and listening to his passion of making sure that I was in the right car has made me a customer as long has he has a seat in that lobby.

646,"October 06, 2011","I am very pleased to know that I can recommend Don Herring's National Auto Repair to my family and friends.  My 2011 Mitsubishi Outlander was approx 3 months old - brand new - when i was hit in a parking lot by another car - the owner of the other car had insurance which recommended working with Service King for repairs.  The initial estimate for repairs was required through Service King.  Nonetheless, I went directly to the Plano Mitsubishi dealership for a free estimate.  The NAR representative, TJ, greeted me, inspected my car, asked me to wait a moment, and returned with an estimate.  The entire process took approximately 10 minutes.  After that, I went to Service King (as required)...after presenting for the estimate, being told i would be called days later/provided with the estimate at that time, and then after one week of my many unreturned phone-calls...I gave up and tried a second SK location. I spoke with the designated inspection person to confirm the appointment, and when I showed up, I was informed the SK representative had left for the day...apparently he forgotten he had confirmed our appointment only 2 hours earlier when we spoke on the phone.  Subsequently, I was fed up and there was no way I would hand my car over to SK for repairs.  Ultimately, the SK estimate was less that what NAR quoted, but I was assured by TJ that NAR would work with my insurance and fix my car.  My intention was to have my car returned to it's original, perfect, pre-accident condition...and TJ assured me that's what NAR would do.  As it turned out, the repair had to be corrected, and the SK estimate did not take into account the extent of the repairs necessary...and I became concerned the additional repairs would not be covered by insurance.  Meanwhile, Daryll (with NAR) kept me posted every step of the way and spoke directly with the insurance company.  Daryll resolved the matter with the insurance company and he returned my car to it's original perfect condition.  All I had to do was pick up my car.  Daryll and TJ with NAR simply provided exemplary customer service. Again, I can honestly recommend NAR to all my family and friends.

As for the Mitsubishi Dealership...we have been so pleased with our new vehicle and the service we have received.  We actually purchased our car from the South Dallas Mitsubishi - and I was not familiar with the plano location.  From our experience - both locations offer outstanding customer service and the highest quality of work...as well as solid, dependable, great vehicles.

I have been chasing a problem with hesitation and lack of performance for years. The MITSUBISHI dealer not only fixed my truck (they said the fuel pump was underperforming), they also tuned it up. 
THANKS MY TRUCK RUNS BETTER THAN IT HAS IN YEARS! Thanks to the techs Roger and Ken.",5.0

I was so surprised that there were so few reviews on don herring north at plano texas, perhaps one reason is because few people would go for a mits nowadays, and I thought I'd better stand up and warn the potential customers looking for a mits against the traps at this dealership. Before you go there, read my review and become informed. 

My review would come in two parts. Firstly, I will let you know that, which has been learned from my experience, don herring offered me (a used cars buyer) an extended warranties that covered nothing. Secondly, based on the experiences of me and my friends, I will complain about the huge amount of money charged for services on its returning customers, which were originally more or less loyal to the dealership as I was. 

Let's begin with the first one. Four years agao, I went to this dealership and bought an eclipse with low miles. I also paid around $1000 for the so called ""4 years/50k miles bumper to bumper"" extended warranty. My car broke down last summer, which was caused by a failed electric solenoid mounted on the engine. I went to don herring north and they told me it was not covered by the warranty. I took out my warranty contract and showed it to the service guy, on the paper, it says IN PURE ENGLISH that any electric parts including the ""SOLENOID"" on the engine are covered by the warranty that they sold to me. I requested an explanation for the contract terms. The guy then went on the line with the warranty company for about 10 minutes and came back telling me that he didn't know how to explain, but my solenoid was not covered by the warranty! Enraged, I insisted that he explains the differences between the ""solenoid mounted on the engine"" as specified in the warranty contract and ""the actual solenoid mounted on my car's engine""! Then another guy came in and began beating around the bush and told me it was a maintenance issue and should not be regarded as a failure of the solenoid, so literally it shouldn't be covered. Did he think I was stupid? If the broken solenoid was not ""a failure"", why did my car break down in the first place?? My conclusion could only be: the dealership refused to take the responsibilities when the ""things"" they alleged to protect went wrong. They just didn't respect the contract, and chances are you will not sue them for $1000, because you probably end up paying more to your attorney. They even treated me as an idiot without giving plausible explanations. I doubt the service guy understood the ""DIFFERENCES"" himself.

Now let's talk about their general car service. In short, I THINK the service stuff at don herring north try to up-sell service with up-scaled price to the returning and loyal customers. I have two friends who also own a mits bought from don herring north. We all liked this dealership in the beginning, but we all had been conned as well by it, e.g. paying $300 for a battery change, $199 for wheel alignment (just one time!), etc. I tell you now they SEEM TO prey on the returning customers without mercy, as if they were afraid that they would not be in this business for long, so they try to take as much money as possible. And it works! Why? let me tell you why. I have to say, frankly, their sales persons are patient enough, polite and not pushy at all. You would probably enjoy your shopping time there and may start to like the dealership. Besides, their building is big and beautiful, their front door people are polished and welcoming, all of these establish some kinds of authority, and finally you begin to trust them. It is only at the back door that the dealership's true nature is exposed. Now you had their car, and you came for ""professional mitsubishi service"". that is when they stop treating you like a friend and it is exactly when you become a game. you won't sort out this trap until a lot of time later, seriously. You just need time to reflect on everything before finally realizing what was really happening. 

This is my review, and only my personal opinions about this dealership. I tried to be as objective as possible. I did not give the dealership 0s for everything. Their sale-persons are simply great: polite and not pushy. But keep in mind, they will try to survive doing anything, especially for now, as the mits motors is going way up down the hill, its dealers will have to rob you more and more to make enough money to stay in the market. PERHAPS, don herring north is such a dealer. Be aware of don herring north! correct me if anything is wrong. In fact, I wish I was!
