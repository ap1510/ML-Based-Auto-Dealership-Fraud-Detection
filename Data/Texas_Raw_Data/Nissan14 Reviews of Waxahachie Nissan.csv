1,"July 06, 2019","I went in looking to buy. Being pre approved from my credit union was not a issue with them. Mr. Radford Pannell was an excellent salesman. Upfront and honest. Helped me to buy what was beneficial to me and not just making a sale. His vast knowledge and friendliness of the entire dealership is over the top!

4,"May 04, 2019","I have to say this Nissan dealership in waxahachie tx is the best. I dont have good credit but, I got a car in 2 days ONLY BECAUSE THEY WAS LOOKING 4 THE BEST DEAL 4 ME. 
I called them on Wednesday morning at 8:50am spoke to Rosey. Rosey let me vent about my mess up car I got from Clay Cooley in 2015 and I still owe $12,000 on... Rosey sent me application through my email. Rosey told Rubel (salesman) will call me back. Well b4 I could finish it. RUBEL called and pick me up. NEXT DAY I GOT A 2019 NISSAN ALTIMA. ROSEY, RUBEL, AND FINANCE Manager ROBERT G. WAS THE BEST. MY NEXT CAR WILL COME FROM THEM. I THANK GOD 4 EVERYTHING THEY DONE FOR ME. 

PLEASE GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO HELP U. 

REMEMBER: MY CREDIT IS (OKAY) I STILL OWE $12,000 ON A CAR, I COULD NOT TRADE IT IN. YES, I DID PUT MONEY DOWN BUT I GOT A NEW CAR NOT USED.

7,"September 09, 2018",This is my 1st positive experience with an auto dealership of any brand since moving to Texas 5 years ago. I purchased my 2017 Titan at another Nissan dealership and visited another for service and I would walk before I would return to either of those dealerships for purchase or service. Waxahachie Nissan diagnosed the issue with my AC over the phone and scheduled me an appointment right away. They repaired the AC but after I picked up my truck I noticed a different issue unrelated to the AC issue. I returned for what I though was a minor issue and they explained how this could result in a major issue down the road of not repaired. While they had my truck in for the 2nd repair they noticed another issue with my emergency brakes and they repaired that as well. They covered everything under warranty and provided me with a loaner car. They also followed up after the repair to ensure that I was happy with the repair and the quality of their work. I would highly recommend this dealership’s service department. ,5.0

9,"July 31, 2017","Passing through Waxahachie from Colorado on our way home our Frontier broke down.  Waxahachie Nissan was so accommodating.  Ordering parts, keeping us updated and helping with a rental. They even beat their quote of the repair.   Professionalism and friendliness at its finest!",5.0

11,"January 11, 2017","My wife and I have purchased  numerous vehices in our lifetime, and this by far was the best experience.  Very pleasant on the phone, was honest about price, and when you got to the dealership they kept their word on the price.  There is no deception at this dealership.  Tyler Preston was a great sales rep and the finance guy was really nice also.  They were not pushy at all.  They offered something, but if you did not want it...that was the end of the discussion.  I had been looking for the new 2017 Armada Platinum, so it on their website, called, negotiated the walk out the door price.  Went down their to test drive, and walked out the door in a little over an hour after I arrived.  They were so good I will be having my sister come from over 500 miles to buy a vehicle from them.  Kudos for running an honest dealership with friendly people.",5.0
