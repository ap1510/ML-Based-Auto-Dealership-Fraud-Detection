2,"June 12, 2019",I called the service department because I had a oil leak on my truck. I have very limited days off so they scheduled me for 7am on my only day off so they could have it for the day. When I got there the service tech walked up and without even looking at my truck informed me that I would have to leave the truck for at least 6 days before they could even look at it. They did not offer me a loaner or any help at all ,1.0
3,"February 26, 2019",Last spring went to test drive a vehicle. Sales men were at the front as we walked to view the 4runners. I kept waiting for some to approach us but ignored my presence. A couple parked a few distance where I was standing. The salesmen immediately rushed as they were getting off their vehicle to attend them. I immediately left in my car and called customer service and I was promised that I would get a courtesy call but never did. I was hoping that this time around it would be different when I was inquiring about a vehicle and was not surprised with their customer results. Junior tried his best and I would recommend you seek his assistance in purchasing a vehicle. I honestly can say he tried his best  but the persons in charge are money hungry. ,1.0
4,"May 23, 2018",Let me begin by saying that Johnny Palmer is a class act and a pleasure to work with. We've bought from Gene Messer before and we were happy to give them our business again. We took our time and Johnny was very patient and honest about what he could and couldn't do. They will always be the first place we go when considering buying a new car.,5.0

17,"March 26, 2018","I've always had great service at Gene Messer Chevrolet. You can tell the entire service department's focus is on customer satisfaction. Be it Fabian, or Jeremy B., as service advisors, they represent the ""face"" of Gene Messer Chevrolet. Their ""can do"" attitude is one that is embedded in the company culture. Not to mention the ""unsung"" service techs in the garage. I've never had a problem or mix-up of any kind, and they have done exactly as I have asked. Like I said, I find that ""can do"" and a highly motivated sense of customer service are deeply embedded in the entire culture of Gene Messer Chevrolet. ",5.0

23,"January 31, 2018",I feel as if I were manipulated into buying the extended warranty on a brand new vehicle . After pressuring me to buy the extended warranty I finally just gave in and paid for it because I was annoyed with his persistence . The person doing the paper work on that told me the warranty would cover my wheels if they were to be cracked . After reading more on the warranty none of that was true .. Another bad experience was when I told them I wanted a five year loan and after all of the paper Work was rushed by me without explaining anything I figured out they suckered me with a six year loan instead of five . Worst experience of my life and I’m full of regret for buying from Gene Messer and would never consider this particular car lot again.,1.0

60,"July 10, 2015","Thanks to Michael Wims and Jeremy Bell and they terrible attitudes when trying to negotiate the purchase price of a 2015 Silverado 1500, I chose to take my business to Bill Wells Chevrolet up the road in Plainview.  Mr. Wims' demeanor when presented with proof of a better deal at a competitor was like a spoiled child who takes his ball and leaves when the going gets tough. The salesman, Jeremy Bell would promise a return call and not follow through. He wouldn't return texts as well.  Save your hard earned dollars and much frustration and look elsewhere for your Chevy needs because Mr. Wims' claims of then ""not being undersold in the past two years"" is simply BS! ",1.3
