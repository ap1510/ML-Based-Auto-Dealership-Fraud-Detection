1,"February 05, 2020","I purchased a vehicle from them and paid it off in cash at the time the salesman promised me that all the services had been done on the vehicle but about a month after having it the service light came on and I took it to Mercedes of el paso where they told me that the service had not been done and that it was only rest and that the service it needed was $1,200 which needs to be done after a so many miles.  Then the salesman lied to me several times  and told me they were working on getting me my title and plate but almost 3 months later they still don't have it and today I left work early to drive from from Las Cruces NM to el paso to pick them up because they were supposedly there but they there was the excuse that the business office was closed so they could not give them to me. This was the third time driving over there to get them and nothing this is very disappointing I will never buy from Mission Chevrolet again. ",1.0

Visit started a bit rocky, but the staff was more than happy to get My husband and I in to the car that I really wanted, and I left very happy and satisfied, Andre was very patient with me, Omar was nice. Both  Martin and Andre worked with what I wanted. Mr. Carlos Gonzalez is a very nice man and I enjoyed talking to him and he has a nice smile.

5,"October 16, 2019","If you are ever in the market for a great experience and awesome customer service please go to Mission Chevrolet and ask for Tony Olivas. 
My husband and I recently stopped by to look at trucks hoping to bring one home and with his help, patience and understanding of our situation he helped make it happen for us. 
Very professional, knew and understood what we were looking for, listened to every detail my husband wanted on the truck and found the perfect one for us. 
We are very pleased with our experience there with Mr Olivas and would recommend him to all our family and friends and whoever is in the market for a Chevy.

6,"July 16, 2019","My husband and I visited Mission Chevy to purchase a preowned vehicle. We worked close with our salesman, Anthony, and his team manager, Charlie. We found, what we thought, was a good fit for our family. However, the vehicle started to have major issues a few days in. It came down to the car no longer reliable and it hadn’t been a month of owning the vehicle. 

My husband and I returned to the dealership where the new car manager , Adrian, along with Anthony and Charlie, went ABOVE AND BEYOND to help us find a solution for the situation. They truly cared about every step in the process and genuinely wanted to help us. 

In the end, we found a cpo vehicle that was perfect for us and they helped us through the process of purchasing it. I felt like my emotions were on a roller coaster thanks to the ups and downs of the previous vehicle. I couldn’t have asked for a better team to help us through all of it. I am so grateful and will always remember how well we were treated! 

I know not everyone has had or will have an experience like ours. What I can say is that the team we worked with were amazing and continue to be amazing! Hiccups happen when dealing with used vehicles, it’s all about how those hiccups are handled. These guys handle it perfectly! ",4.8

8,"November 30, 2018","Their ""Mission"" is ""ALL ABOUT YOU"" is not true. I went in to look at the new 2019 trucks. Right away got approached by a salesman and I clearly explained what I was there for. I explained my credit score was 814 and I got approved for 0% interest at Rudolph Chevrolet and I am looking to take home a 2019 truck today. So the salesman knew my wants. We took about two hours looking at the 2019 Silverado's and even test drove one. I fell in love with one and wanted to take it that day. I am glad I didn't! We walked in to do the application process and they ran my credit. After I got approved, and spending two hours looking at the 2019 models, the salesman and the sales manager Israel Melendez proceeded to tell us that they can't offer 0% interest on 2019 models. Then why did they waste our time and show us the 2019 models after I told them what I WANTED from the very beginning! Then the sales manager, the one that comes out in the commercial, was arguing with my dad and gave us false information!! He told us that they are trying to ""get rid"" of the 2018 models but then ends up trying to downgrade us to a 2018 model?? Who tells a customer they are trying to get rid of trucks cause they aren't selling and then turns around and tries to sugar coat them and say they are the best? Not only that, but the sales manager told us they have an exact truck with all the amenities that the 2019 model we wanted had. We told him to show us. Then we look at it and he lied, it was nothing comparable. No sunroof, no senors, no extra space in the cab and none of the amenities that the other truck we wanted had. They dangled a ""diamond"" in our face, then snatched it away. They let an excellent credit score, and someone looking to buy that day, walk out the door. I am so glad for that experience because I ended up purchasing a 2019 GMC Sierra Texas Edition for $10,000 less than what Mission was selling their Silverado for. WITH 0% interest and way lower payments. My GMC has so many more amenities (leather seats, dashboard, sunroof, way more space in our cab, classy display and entertainment system with BOSE speakers!) My payments are lower than what they offered and our dealership gave us exceptional service. Mission Chevrolet wasted our time, lied to us, and the unprofessional manager was inexperienced and argued with my father. They didn't try to earn our business so don't waste your time here. Make sure they disclose their incentives before you even look at a vehicle so you don't end up being conned. We will never return here in the future and will make sure to share this with everyone! Thanks Mission Chevrolet!",1.0
9,"April 16, 2018",This review is about there service  I took my vehicle there for a check engine also my windows would go up and down when trying to close them. I was told lies from the service advisor. So i asked to speak to manager. He was no better in addressing my issues. Her went as far as to call me a liar. I am a disabled veteran and was with my service dog. He seemed to be sympathetic at first and asked questions about my dog. But that all changed when i asked for help fixings my car. I went home feeling worse and humilated that people can be so rude and use peoples weakness to take advantage of them. I hope it doesn't happen to any one else. Especially someone with a disability.,1.0

Thank you from the Casas family. ",5.0
11,"January 21, 2016","Mr. Anthony Arnwtte greeted me promptly and courteously upon arrival. Anthony asked me appropriate questions in helping me choose the correct vehicle to fit my needs. I was shown several vehicles that Anthony thought might meet those needs. He was very patient. I was permitted to drive the car he to show my wife.
Upon return all the paperwork was completed in an efficient and timely manner.
Anthony provides an excellent buying experience ",5.0
