0,"February 12, 2020",Been trying to call Grahm in Finance several times a day. For the past week. he never returned our calls or anybody in finance either.. we have issues again for the second time on the contract and it needs to get resolved immediately before my first payment is due February 15th. Horrible customer service! Everyone if you're looking to getting good service do not by here because all we are is Commission in their pockets and I wished I'd known all these reviews before we bought our car I would have gone somewhere else! I did want to give any stars at all due to the horrible customer service .,1.0
1,"October 31, 2019","South Austin Pre-Owned Nissan tried to steal my daughter's car!  Avoid these thieves!!  She went to the Pre-Owned location on Saturday, 10/26/19, and found a 2018 Nissan Maxima she was interested in but told them up front she was shopping / comparing prices.  They encouraged her to take the Maxima for the weekend and bring it back to them on Monday, so she left her little car at the dealership and drove their car.  She went to a couple of other dealerships to compare prices and found another Maxima she preferred that was priced better and had 20K fewer miles, so she ended up purchasing from another dealership.  The other Nissan dealership took the borrowed car back to South Austin Pre-Owned Nissan Monday morning 10/28/19 and planned to drive my daughter's little car back to their dealership for pick up.  When “John” got there Monday morning, my daughter's car was not there!!!  Turns out, South Austin Pre-Owned sent her car off to auction earlier that morning!!!  They had NO title, NO signed documentation saying she was trading it in!  They flat out LIED to “John” who was to pick up my daughter’s car, saying that they “lost the key” to her little car to buy themselves some time.  “John” called his manager, who then called and spoke to the South Austin manager who LIED and told “John’s” manager that it had gone to auction because my daughter had agreed to purchase their car, which she had not.  “John” walked the entire property of South Austin Nissan and her car was not on the property.  South Austin Nissan contacted the auction driver & had him bring my daughter’s car back to the South Austin Nissan Pre-Owned lot.  “John” had to get an Uber to get back to his own dealership!  I went after work on Monday to pick up some documents that were accidentally left in the borrowed car’s glove box & to pick up my daughter’s car.  The car was there, but with white markings on the windshield and driver’s side window, which were markings to the auction folks showing them which vehicles to TAKE to auction.  The documents were not in the glove box & the South Austin Nissan Pre-Owned Manager Carlos Barrera lied to my face saying they just parked it and didn’t take anything out of the car.  “John” was on the phone with one of my daughters saying it is Nissan policy to clean out / detail the cars when returned, so I repeated the statement to Carlos Barrera that it is policy & to find out who detailed the car now.  He made a phone call or 2 and miraculously found someone who had the docs in his desk drawer!  South Austin Pre-Owned manager Carlos Barrera LIED to me again saying he didn’t know WHO told me that the car had been sent to auction but that “simply was not true”.  I asked to pick up the car and was LIED to again, saying they have “torn the office up” looking for her key & he wasn’t able to get a Locksmith here today to re-key it, that I’d have to come back tomorrow.   I drove an hour to pick it up and wasn’t coming back the next day, so they need to pay to have it re-keyed and need to deliver the car to Round Rock where I can pick it up; he agreed that was fair.  Fortunately, I did get the car back, but of course all of my phone & chat box messages asking GM Jimmy Stallings since Tuesday have gone un-returned.  I’ve already written a review & filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau today as well as filed a complaint on the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles website.  Filing a report with the District Attorney’s office next.  Will be putting up poor reviews in Yelp & FB & any other place I can find.  Ready to call the media in & put it all on the news next!   Avoid these thieves!!",1.0
2,"October 08, 2019","I want to start by saying I love my new car, I just wish I had purchased it literally ANYWHERE else.In all fairness, we were closing on the car as the dealership was closing, so their were some open ended financing details I was told I would have to come back and sign on. No one ever called me to come back, so I reached out and was instructed to come in. When I came back the following day, a lot of my paper work had changed (for transparency, it was in my favor, so I wasn't annoyed with that, I just wish I would have seen that first red flag) I signed all the paperwork and left the dealership. About 4 weeks after purchasing my car and trading in my previous car, I got a call from the loan company on the car I traded in. They had charged me my car payment because the dealership hadn't paid the loan. I called South Austin Nissan and spoke to the General Sales Manager Rene Hernandez, and he was not very friendly about the matter and acted like this happens often and I should know that this is common. (For the record, we've bought 6 cars in the last 8 or so years and I've never paid a car payment on a car I no longer owned) He did apologize (for me not knowing that I might* have to pay a car payment on a car I traded in over 4 weeks ago) he did offer to detail my car when the plates came in for my troubles. My temporary plates expired on 10/02/19. I went to the tax office on 09/27/19 to get my Disabled Veterans plates registered and was informed that the dealership never registered my vehicle. I would need them to register this before I can do this. I have now owned the vehicle for more than 2 months and called South Austin Nissan 6 times and left voicemails for 3 days in an attempt to find out what was going on with my plates (also a step I have never had to take with any other dealership).  I inquired about the detail service and was told to ask for Stephanie or Marcus upon arrival. I asked the front desk person (the only helpful individual in that building). She went and got Marcus. Marcus came out and seemed confused and asked me if I was buying a new car, when I said ""No, I've already purchased one, I just need my plates on and a detail"" he seemed shocked and in front of me argued with the front desk agent about how he was busy and not washing my car. The front desk agent then went to get Stephanie who was the rep who set up the detail. Stephanie got into it with the front desk agent as well because she was with a customer and more busy and the agent could tell Marcus' boss. The entire time mind you, I'm sitting there awkwardly aznd can hear every conversation being had. The front desk agent then went into a glass walled office with Marcus, where they continued to argue about how he wasn't helping me and refused to do it. The poor front desk agent then went into Rene Hernandez's office to explain to him what was going on. After speaking with him for a moment, she came out to tell me she was going to find someone named Alexis to take care of it. At this point I felt so awkward and couldn't imagine sitting there waiting for my car to be detailed. I asked the front desk agent to just hand me my plates and my husband and I would put them on ourselves. She asked if she could go back and get Rene, he would want to know about this. I explained to her that he did already know about it because he gave me the detail for my previous customer service issue and I watched her go talk to Rene personally, so if he genuinely wanted to talk to me, he would have come the 6 feet to speak with me. I then walked out of the dealership and gave them a couple days to call me. Rene never called me and he knew full well how upset I left. I dread getting my car serviced there and am so sad that I'm now connected to this dealership. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else. It's not worth the headache of going to this location! You can get the same car elsewhere and have a MUCH better experience. I've never been treated this way by a dealership and I will never buy another vehicle from South Austin Nissan.",1.4
3,"September 23, 2019","DO NOT use this dealership to purchase a vehicle. They did not disclose something that was wrong with the truck and are using the excuse that I test drove it so I ""signed off"" on it. Very unprofessional and would not even allow me to return the truck instead of fixing it.",1.0
4,"July 26, 2019","My car needed an oil change, so I took it to the dealer.  Patricia was absolutely wonderful.  She greeted me like she was happy I was there.  She explained the details completely.  She checked on me in the beautiful waiting room a couple of times.  It was suppose to take up to one and a half hours, but it was done in less than 1 hour.  I actually look forward to going back for my next service visit.  ",5.0
5,"July 13, 2019","All went well, so we thought! Our car salesman was very nice and did what he could to help us. Financially speaking, the guy spoke so fast and they decided to slip in about $6,500 between three different warranties and not even ask if we WANTED these extras(definitely didn’t). Now, we have been trying to get in contact with them for over a week and they never seem to try and make it a priority to help a customer since they’ve already gotten their money. So, here I am hoping to warn someone else from making our mistake. ",1.4
6,"March 19, 2019","Stay away of getting any service here, they filled my radiator with wiper fluid for more than 2 times and had to replace it.
Awful service and poor knowledge of their service people. 
Still waiting to hear from the manager about it.",1.6
7,"March 14, 2019",If you want to wait 5plus months for a tag. Here’s the perfect place to buy a car from. I called continually over a period of 5 months and still haven’t received a tag and no one seem to know what’s going on. ,1.0
8,"March 02, 2019","We came in to get a truck after getting not so great service and the usual run around at Covert Ford while checking out the F150. So glad we did, we ended up liking the Titan better than the F150 and the service we received from the salesman Chris Vantrease was fantastic. They gave us more for our trades than Ford and showed the utmost respect for our time and budget. No run around and no BS. Refreshing experience! We absolutely recommend Chris and South Austin Nissan. Additionally, the business manager Chris Robinson was very friendly and knowledgeable during signing. These guys know their stuff.",5.0
9,"February 15, 2019","I was nervous about purchasing a new car because I thought my choices would be limited. I found the car of my dreams and my experience at South Austin Nissan was AMAZING!!!

11,"November 28, 2018",Brought a 2012 Nissan Frontier for a diagnostic check and inspection. Next day at pickup I waited 30 min before being told they lost my key. Another 45 since they said a new one is being made and will only be 10 min. At no time did anyone proactively tell me what was happening. xxxxshow.,1.0

14,"January 04, 2018","I brought my vehicle in for a repair and Daniel was my service advisor. He walked me through the entire process and was extremely helpful. The best service that I have ever received anywhere! He called me, I didn’t have to call for a follow up. He was accurate in the amount of time it took for repair. He was honest. They dropped me off at work at a last minute request. He even provided a refetral for a service they didn’t provide for a discounted rate. This service department is a no hassle, 100% upfront kind of place that you want to go to if you need repair. ",5.0
15,"November 10, 2017","So on November 3rd I went to Clay Cooley Nissan used dealership. I had a pre-approval through Capital One. Marc was a good sales agent my problem is I was never told they were going to run my credit and try to get me a better deal vs them just submitting my application to capital one like I was advised. They checked my credit a total of four times. That was strike 1. Strike 2 came I advised I would be at the dealership that following morning to pick up the car at 9 am when they opened. I was advised the car would be washed, gassed up, and air in the tire. It took a while and while they were doing everything I was meeting with finance. After signing my papers the tire light was still on was told to drive 15 miles the light will go off. I wasn't sure about it so he advised I could bring it back to service at anytime. So I left sure enough light went off only to turn right back on. I put air in the tire drove 15 miles but this time it didn't go off. I advised my sales rep the tire light and vehicle warning light was on but I got no response. Every morning I been having to stop to put air in the tire and I seriously just got pissed because I literally haven't had the vehicle a week and already the dealership lack of communication and concern was showing early. So 11/9/17 I text my sales guy that I was returning the car and going to get a new one. Low and behold he text me back and was like you can take it to service at this point I'm over it because it should've been right before I drove off the lot. I also sent an inquiry online letting them know how dissatisfied I was and how I wanted a new vehicle. I got absolutely nothing. So I called on my break as my sales guy sent another text for me to speak with Rodney or Justin. I chose Rodney advised him of the situation and how I wanted to get into a new Nissan Pathfinder. He told me he could see what he could do took my info and would call me later. I didn't hear from it at all yesterday. So this morning I called was told he was in a meeting but at 9 am today and no call yet. I even sent my boyfriend to get the tire looked at by services but was told he needed an appointment he booked 1 for tomorrow, they put air in it and sent him on his way. I'm so over this dealership honestly. I just want to drop their car off and go elsewhere. Capital One approved me with a higher approval amount then my pre-approval offer so I have options. Capital One had the vehicle priced for 21,000 for going through them but since I was financed through Nissan the vehicle was 24,000. ",1.0

It never takes less than one and half hours and last time I waited two and half hours.  Then the car computer was not reset.

The reason we went here in the first place was because on the internet they were advertising 0% financing and low priced vehicles. We tell the first sales guy we talk to (goes by Z) what we're looking for and how much we want to spend monthly. He says he knows exactly what we want and goes off to find the keys. Took him about 15 minutes to find those keys. We go out to look at the car and decide we want something different. Z goes to find more keys and comes back quicker. We take a test drive, and like it. We want numbers now. We go in and meet another guy (Mario). As we're talking we decide we want a few more add ons, and Mario goes off to find another cars keys. He takes another 20 minutes, while Z is trying to make small talk, very awkwardly. My hubby just wants to talk about the price, but that's not happening yet. Finally Mario comes back and we go look at another car, but surprise! He didn't get the right keys.... Are they really this unorganized with their keys? You'd think a dealership would have a more efficient method of keeping keys.
Finally we get inside to talk numbers. They know what payments and interest percentage we want. The first offer was way high and we say no. The second time Z comes back he's very excited and keeps saying congrats and wants to shake our hand. Mario and Z make a big to-do about someone else looking at ""our"" car at that very moment, they should go take it off the lot right away, we had better sign and shake hands NOW! (Does this really work on people!?!?) 
For another 2 hours we keep saying no we don't like the numbers. My husband tells them he just wants to think about it, we'll come back if we want to buy. But they keep making us wait and running more numbers. Being a first time new car buyer and needing a car I probably would have said yes sooner. I'm the type of person they look for to take advantage of. Finally they take off the 'destination' price and one other price of the car we want. The rate is ok, not 0%, but not bad for my credit rate. 
My hubby goes home and I stay another hour waiting for finance. They finance guy messes up the first time. I almost call my hubby to come get me, but a manager comes in and explains what happened. I sign.
I should have trusted my intuition to just walk out. Looking back I feel like we were pressured and bullied. Buying a car is a big deal and creates a lot of stress. At the end of it when I was signing I felt brain dead, after all the hours and waiting. I feel like Z (mostly) and the others took advantage of this. It's sad cars salesmen do this to people. 
I regret buying the car and I know there is nothing I can do but learn a lesson. I will defiantly review dealerships next time. 
I won't go back to Clay Cooley.

Even before I left my house to drive down there, I called and confirmed that I had an approved loan and all I had to do is pick out a vehicle. I walked in the dealership and was greeted by a salesman who took my drivers license, made a copy, and then told me someone would be with me in a few minutes. I sat for over 30 minutes waiting and no one said a word to me. Finally a salesman did come to me with my ""file"" and he again confirmed that I had been approved for up to $25000 no money down.

We called the dealership to ensure they still had the said car and at that price and they said yes. So we drove down there. As soon as they found out we were military their tactics changed, as though they were trying to take advantage of us. 

Similarly we talked about that used car at the advertised price and no one said there was a problem with the advertised price  and then the sales associate said with incentives he could get us a brand new car at that used car price. Then when they put the sell together they gave us a total that was more than $3,000 than the price the associate said it would be, then when we said no and that we wanted the used one we came for, the one that was advertised on their own website and they said it was an error, even though 4 different websites told us that price, the phone call to the dealership confirmed that price, and that quoted proce wasn't an issue until we said no to buying a brand new model. They tried to increase the cost of the used car by $2,000 from what was posted on their website. 
That is two bate and switches in one visit. One by saying the original car we came for was more and the person on the Phone and online told us the wrong price, and the second was when the sales rep said he could get a brand new model for the price of the used one quoted online and then turned around and told us it would cost $3,000 more.

After we agreed on a price we waited over an hour for our paperwork and finance officer. Once everything was ready for signatures I began to read the  finance paperwork and noticed that Israel hadrraised the agreed price by $1000, After being threatening to walk and being confronted he was very rude and asked the finance officer to take  $1000 off. Finished paperwork after dark and was taken to detailed vehicle, which after further inspection was full of scratches and 2 door dents (on a new Vehicle). 4 days later I returned to have the scratches repaired and was given a filthy loaner full of dog hair.

110,"January 05, 2015","Don't EVER buy a car here !! My boyfriend bought a car a couple weeks ago from them & it's the worst buying experience both of us have ever experienced. Don't get me wrong we love the car itself it's awesome, but the people working there are rude, shady & unprofessional . Basically what started it all was my boyfriend owed money on his old car but it was low enough they could take it & just put it towards his new car. Well Anthony the salesman working with my boyfriend, quoted it $500 short (we were NOT aware of this & it's nowhere in his paperwork. And from what I can gather they weren't either at the time). Well we were told he'd get the two months no payment & $0 down, so of course we were excited still could use his old car as a down payment plus save up towards the payments as well. Well fast forward a WEEK later (this all happened in the beg-mid of December) we get a call from Anthony saying he owes $500 as a down payment, um what? You told us $0 down 2 months no payment. He then tells us they quoted his car wrong and he owes $500 as a down payment the proceeds to THREATEN him that they'll come take the car away if we don't. Then my boyfriend speaks to Moses the financial manager & he tells us a different story & gets extremely rude & unprofessional & says ""I lost money because of YOU, you owe us $500 because we quoted your car wrong"". So why do we owe $500? Because you screwed up on your end or because he actually does owe $500 downpayment? So my boyfriend ends up making a deal paying $250 when he gets paid & another $250 his next check. So a couple days later he goes up there to pay $250 in cash & Moses tells him to come back with the other half his next paycheck. Fast forward another week, my boyfriend goes up there to ask a question about his actual car payment & then asks about the $500, the financial guy (I won't mention his name because he was simply amazing & don't want him getting into trouble) doesn't know what the xxxx he's talking about, that his account other than his payment coming up is $0 balance. There's not $250 that's owed no $500 that was EVER owed to them! He asked what happened & my boyfriend explained this long story, he gets Moses & Moses tries to play it off like he doesn't remember until my boyfriend says he has the recipt of it (which we still do) & says oh yeah just come back with that other $250. Well once he leaves the financial guy explains what happened, since Anthony quoted his car $500 short the bank technically still owed it so Nissan had to pay that $500 themselves to get the car title ect. He told us do NOT pay the remaining $250 because we technically never owed it & to call head quarters to open an investigation into all of this because he can't get our $250 back but maybe they can. So now we have an investigation open by Nissan & they told us not to pay anything else except the actual payment.

116,"December 15, 2014","TL;DR this was a terrible experience, and if they take your keys to check your VIN for a trade-in, ask for them back IMMEDIATELY.

My husband and I are looking for a new car. We'd test driven a Nissan Rogue, but the dealership in North Austin didn't have the particular model we'd wanted. I called up the Clay Cooley Nissan dealership down South on 35 to see if they had one in stock. We did, so I gave them my name and they said they'd have one ready for us to test drive. 

Keith jumps on us as soon as we get out of our car, we tell him we called ahead, etc. etc. and he goes to get the car for us. 30 minutes pass in the freezing, air-conditioned show room from xxxx before he comes back over and says that he's finally found one, but it's in the back lot so it'll take a few more minutes. 15 more minutes pass and we're about to head out the door, and he comes back. He takes us to the back lot where the car we want to test drive is completely blocked in. 

We'd test driven a similar one at the north location, so it wasn't too big a deal for us to not get to actually drive this one since we got to look around inside (although we were already pretty irritated at this point). We go back inside to talk about pricing.

Keith takes our car keys to get our car's VIN number since we want to do a trade-in. He comes back and gives us a price for the car that was significantly over both the Blue Book Value AND the price the North dealership had quoted as a starting point. My husband tells him so, and Keith disappears and brings back Jose, one of the managers. We explain again that the price is significantly higher than the Kelly Blue Book says it should be for MSRP. Jose leaves, and comes back with a pricing sheet. ""I don't normally show this to people,"" he says, and proceeds to explain that the car was at the KBB value, but points to the add-ons (cargo net, chrome something and floor matts were on the list) that add about $3000 to the price. He shows us 60 month financing options that were over $200 per month than our credit union offered.

At this point, we've had enough. My husband tells Jose that we don't care about the add-ons, the financing is outrageous, and asks for our keys back... and Jose's still trying to bully us into this price. After we reiterate for the fourth or fifth time and point out that we have asked for our keys back three times now. Jose finally goes to get them, raising his voice at us and saying that ""we're just not working with him"" because apparently shaming us is totally going to get us to buy his car.

127,"April 04, 2013","Took my 2013 Nissan in for a repair, oil change and tire rotation. The repair was sort of completed. Enough to get me by until the part needed comes in. I have yet to hear back from them over a month and half later on the part. I have no idea if they actually changed the oil and filter. I know they did not do the tire rotation as I had one scratched rim and it was still in the same place when I took my car in. This was it's first tire rotation. I noticed when I arrived home (35 miles away) and they told me to bring it back and they would rotate the tires for me. No offer to reimburse me for the extra gas or time, not even a future complimentary oil change. xxxx even a car wash would have been fine with me. The icing on the cake is the oil change sticker on the windshield is set to have you change the oil way before you actually need to. It doesn't follow Nissan Motors recommended oil change intervals. Bottom line, don't trust South Point Nissan with your maintenance or repairs. ",2.6

After 3 visits to Nissan over a 30 day period and a nearly $2,000 bill – I was given an apology for my inconvenience and told the truck “should be safe”.  The two most important safety jobs, brake lights and tires, were given the least attention and done ineptly, had to be repeated, and were not completed to safety satisfaction.   Yet, they had no hesitation in strongly recommending miscellaneous jobs that were costly and did not directly impact safety.  No restitution was offered except to say they would pay the bill when we had their oversight corrected, which was no help or comfort to us on our son’s 3 day treacherous drive ahead.

It was a problem with the repair at the outside company on work I was suppose to have done there, to their credit that company also made good the problem.

But Southpoint employees were all very patient and kind and went above and beyond to help my understand.  They even printed out a diagram and drew me a picture which helped me document the problem so I was well prepared to go back to the other company and make a good and clear case of the problem with their problem.

158,"May 03, 2012","I came in to South Point Nissan and was greeted by Matthew and a guy that was shadowing who's name has slipped my mind. The guy shadowing was actually someone I wanted to work with more than Matthew. Matthew was extremely condescending and a little bit of a smart ass. I asked to see a new or used Nissan Frontier and Matthew insisted on telling me over and over that I should just by new (which would obviously cost more), because even if I bought used (which would cost less) my monthly payments would be the same as a new one. How in the world does that make any sense? He never did show me a used one though I asked several times. Next, I did not like some of the features on the truck that I looked at like the chrome on the mirrors or that it was an automatic. Matthew then started pushing the sell and saying, ""so, is this the vehicle for you?"" I said, ""no"" just because I had a set criteria in mind that he said they could find. I was curious to just look at some other trims, but Matthew kept trying to then just go back to the office. He then asked again if I wanted the truck and I said, ""no"" and after that he seemed to not even want to listen, much less help, with anything I was looking for. I asked if they could locate one and I told him what I wanted, he went to check it out and gave me a paper to sign that he said was ""just to locate the vehicle we need to make sure you are serious about it."" I had no problem with that until I read at the bottom where it said that ""the person signing would be taking the vehicle listed above home within one hour."" Once I saw that, I decided not to sign it, because I have had my share of experiences and know of others who have had some where signing things and ignoring the fine print comes back to haunt you. Some people may not see it as anything, but I am just overly cautious with things like that. Anyway, Matthew laughed and shook his head and walked off and said, ""O.K."" and went to talk to his boss. While he was doing that, I was talking to the guy shadowing him and he basically told me, ""Look, if you have a set truck in mind, do not settle. You should get what you want and if I could do more, I would."" If that guy would have been my salesman, I would have gladly done business there. Matthew then brought his boss over to talk to me which I honestly did not listen to since I had already made up my mind to not do business there. I then told Matthew to not bother with the truck. With all of his condescending laughs anytime I did not agree with him or do something, I would not go to him at all or even want my worst enemy to go to him. I would expect someone who makes a living selling cars to at least pretend to give a damn, but you will not get that with Matthew Ochoa. He wants to sell you what he thinks you should have and if you do not like it, he does not seem to want to help. Matthew should really watch himself if he wants to keep doing what he does.",1.2

When i first got there, i was approached by a salesman andI told him who I was there to see. He showed me two raggedy,high mileaged cars and i told him i didnt want either and he went and got his manager. The manager tried to tell me because of mu credit these were the only cars i could have and i told them i wanted neither and left. Loab, who i was originally working with, asked me to come back and he would try to recify the situation since neither of these guys had any reason to interfere with his sale. he showed me a car i was happy with and we waited for the financing on Monday.... Skip to Monday...I was approved for my loan and told them I would come Tuesday to finalize the paperwork. Got here on Tuesday and signed all the paper work.vWaited hours for them to deliver my car.I asked what wa the problem. I receieved the answer the service dept is slow. Wited some more until i was almost late for work. By then I was livid. I gave them an extra day to have the car ready. That's why i didnt come Monday. Then they asked me when was my next off day. I told them Saturday. They asked could i come back then and pick it up. Really?!!? Finally they gave me a loaner car and delivered my car at 730 that night after I called them several more times. One month later... the brakes are squealing and the front end is shaking. talked to Loab and explained the situation.Was told to take it to the service dept. The cost was almost 300. I was told they would split the cost. I refused. Why should pay for a brake job after a month? Talked to Mike Fanta something over used cars. Very rude was hollering at me like he birthed me.

163,"September 02, 2011","I went in for an oil change and tire rotation... not complicated. My back left tire didn't have a cap (not the whole stem, just the little cap) and had been slowly going flat so I thought they would figure out what was wrong when they rotated my tires... Next day... my tire pressure light comes on... check my tires... still missing the cap on my back left tire. 
I was sure charged for the rotation, but everything in me says they didn't touch my tires.

Immediately checked my oil (in case they lied about that too) and it looks good... Needless to say there was a nail in my tire. Which they would have found if they had done what they were supposed to do. 

They didn't even say sorry. 

When they found the nail the guy was like, &quot;thats not part of the tire rotation so I'll have to charge you&quot;... seriously. NEVER going there again. 

Scammed me (because they sure did charge me for the tire rotation) 

Horrible customer service, the lobby sucks, and you can't even 1)admit you messed up and 2) apologize 3) you can't fix something thats  less than 50 and should have been found when you supposedly rotated my tires... REALLY.  I had to go back to Austin and you couldn't fix a tire you messed up as an apology for being a shady service department.
