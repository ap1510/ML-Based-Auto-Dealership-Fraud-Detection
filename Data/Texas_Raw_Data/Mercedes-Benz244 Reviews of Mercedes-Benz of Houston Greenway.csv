0,"November 20, 2019","saw on carguru as well as on their website they had a 07 sl550 it had high miles but showed was loaded and had been fully serviced.  I was looking for a good car that I could pay cash for just for a Sunday cruiser.  I called on Saturday was told it was in stock.  On Monday I drove from Louisiana a day earlier than I needed to be in Houston arrived entered was greeted.  I told the salesman what I was there for he stated o that car isn’t on our lot we won’t keep it because of the miles.  I stated well it’s listed on both carguru and on your website and I was told on Saturday it was in fact here and ready to go.   After looking he found the keys and walked me to the car at that time he stated NOTHING was done car had not even been looked at but stated that service would check it out and fix any mechanical issues.  First I noticed on their ad it stated it had gps it did not the car was fitted with a cheap aftermarket radio, we took the car out which started smoking at the red light, again I was told service would fix the car, he said that the rims would be resurfaced and the driver seat would be resurfaced as well as some other minor cosmetic things I stated cosmetic things were minor and I would deal with those  as long as the valve covers and mechanical systems were checked and fixed.   We spoke abaout price and Due to the fact that the car was not what was advertised cosmetically and with aftermarket stuff I asked if it were negotiable that the cosmetic stuff as well as the gps and such were not listed, I said if they fix the motor and check mechanicals I’d buy as is, at that point the salesman pretty much shewed me out as you would a dog, I realize I wasn’t buying a 50k car but I was looking to pay cash for it and was simply a Sunday driver, so that’s my experience, if you see a car priced low stay away I guess if your wanting to spend 50k your greater well, what they don’t realize I do buy new cars at this point was simply looking to replace a Sunday, funday car for cash. The odd part I was called after doing a survey and the guy said well the car didn’t pass our inspection so that’s why, I said no the car hasn’t been looked at yet so how can you say that he said o let me see and I will call you back, thank God I haven’t waited around the phone.
Just beware their website is never correct this car said
Was fully serviced ready to go with the factory gps it was not even washed and never went thru service.  These people talk from both sides of their mouths BEWARE ",1.0
1,"July 26, 2019","Recently I brought my sisters 2005 SClass in for a Service Review relating to the vehicle not holding the battery charge. The Service Advisor Jim S was very helpful , efficient and plain honest .

Joseph Boone was a living saint on the whole as is acquisition via AutoNation scenario. He was extremely patient with our family’s long deliberation. 

Young Ryan in the Valet Department was excellent on the drop off, pick up and the man iteration. He will go far in college and beyond ",5.0
2,"June 03, 2019","Low-caliber, apathetic people across the board. Sales (New) department sends you quotes for the under 20K used cars. No-one answers to your emails. As for Parts department, they ask 3 times the price for the same part that you can order it online.Current owner after-sales service gives explanations that defies any logic. I hold doctoral degree in science with zero sales experience and I think I can do better job than 10 managers in that whole place! 

I am driving 35 miles to another dealership just to avoid this messed up place! ",1.0
3,"April 23, 2019","DO NOT GO HERE. MISSING PARTS. MISSING SERVICE THAT I HAD PURCHASED WHEN I WAS PURCHASING THE VEHICLE. I purchased my new vehicle last year from here then moved to a different city. When I went in for my first service (Service A) in my local mercedes dealership, all of the maintenance packages that I had purchased when the I bought the vehicle was not put on my file. I had to call them 4 times just to get a hold of someone and the service manager at my local one had to call just to get the certificate of purchase. Then, when he went in to add it himself, apparently my account was deactivated and he couldn't even put it on my file. I had to schedule this service 2 weeks ahead to get a loaner car, and i couldn't even get it done on the day even after a 3 hour hassle with greenway. the week after, finally they put my service on file to get it done. I asked them if my other services were put on file too but my local mercedes couldn't find it and never got a phone call back from Greenway. Then, I went in to a tire store that i had been going for years to get my tire rotated while i was back in town, and they could not find the keys to my wheel lock to unlock my tires. I did not remove anything from the glove box (I don't use the glove box) nor knew where the spare tires were even at so I called mercedes to ask where they would be. ""a little black box"" where spare tires should be isn't there or anywhere in the vehicle. When the agent at the tire shop was trying to find the keys with me, he also noticed that there were some spaces empty where the tools were supposed to be when I needed to blow up run flat tires. I called here and asked for joseph washington, whom i purchased from, he was not in the office, so I asked to speak to the manager, whom also apparently isn't in the office either. I am still waiting for them to call back. VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH MERCEDES BENZ. literally the worst luxury car brand I have every had. ",1.0

They were able to cover the check engine light but they said it did not cover the fixture needed for thr MALFUNCTION light.

7,"March 30, 2018","Unfortunately,  out of all of the used/as is cars I have bought and dealerships I have dealt with ( Russell & Smith Honda, CarMax,  and Beck & Masten)...Mercedez Benz Houston Greenway is the first (hopefully the last) dealership where I have bought a used car/as is that has turned out to be a NIGHTMARE of an experience due to mechanical issues that have made the car UNDRIVEABLE !!!! I purchased/paid cash for a used Infiniti (paid about $8,000) at Mercedes Benz Houston Greenway  (my salesman  was Steven Pichardos) on February 28th... I have barely had this car a month and have barely driven it due to constant mechanical issues that have rendered the car un-driveable and it being in service more than once at Mercedez Benz Houston Greenway.  For the past month since I purchased this car I have been driving a rental longer than I have driven the Infiniti.  Since picking up my car after purchasing it from Mercedez Benz Houston Greenway , it has been a nightmare ever since due to having to return the car to the dealership several times for repairs because it was not driveable plus my service engine light came on and has stayed on throughout the service visits to Mercedez Benz Houston Greenway. One time I had to return the car the same day I picked it up after being in the Mercedez Benz Houston Greenway service shop (the car ran hot on me on the freeway and stopped on me while I was on the freeway !!!... Luckily I was able to get over in a safe place in time...I had to get my insurance to tow the car back to the dealership the same day !!!...) ...My most recent service situation with Mercedez Benz Houston Greenway concluded last Thursday, March 22nd only to have the car malfunctioning again rendering it undriveable that following Tuesday, March 27th on my way to work...I had to have the car towed and ended up having to miss work that day.  After enduring this nightmare, barely having this car a month I reached out to Mercedez Benz Houston Greenway only to be told "" It has been fixed 3 times already here,  it has been inspected, you bought it ""as is""... Basically they now refuse to fix the car. Ultimately, I have found out the driver's side catalytic converter needs to be replaced !!!!  This has truly been a nightmare for me.  ""As is"" or not, for $8,000 I  did not purchase a junk car,  ""as is"" or not, for $8,000 a car should at least be driveable and functional for longer than a week... Of all dealerships and used cars I have dealt with, this experience with Mercedez Benz Houston Greenway has been the absolute worst !!! I have read other negative reviews on the dealership and I can't help but wonder how is it this dealership gets away with these things ???  My advice, don't believe the Mercedes Benz Houston Greenway hype, especially when it comes to their used cars...Beware of their used car and service department. They care more about the bottom line, getting your money.  Even after reading the negative reviews on the dealership I would have never believed the negative reviews until I found out from experience myself. Used Car Buyers BEWARE of Mercedez Benz Houston Greenway. ",1.8
8,"January 25, 2018","I have been a customer for 5+ years. This week I took my car for maintenance service. I left an unopened pack of cigarettes on the driver's door pocket and it just disappeared.  No need to say that it is not the value of the cigarettes, but the lack of lose of trust. When I got home and noticed the problem, called my service assistant right away. He denied any wrongdoing and ""apologized"" for my ""perception"" of the problem. He said that there is nothing they could do about it. So I asked for his supervisor. He said that the supervisor would call me in a few minutes. She didn't. So I called again. She said that that was not possible, but offered me $20 as a courtesy compensation. I nicely explained her that is was not about the money. I wanted an answer and expect, at least, her to go around and investigate what might had happened. She said that she would do that and would call me by the end of the day. She never did. They didn't care, obviously. My last time at this dealership. Just be careful. ",2.4
9,"January 21, 2018","My truck was towed into the Mercedes-Benz dealership on Monday January 15th I was told that I would be able to get a loaner on the next day which would have been January 16th I understand due to all the bad weather that they may have not been open on the 16th of January so I didn't worry about it on the 17th when I called to see what was going on then turn tell me they were trying to see if they could get the warranty company to pay for the part which I was told was $1,400 by Frankie at this time I asked him what about a loner car well he in turn told me that it wouldn't take but a day to put the part on because they already had I was already been inconvenience because my truck is there I have no transportation and I work for the hospital so I have to get back and forth to work so after Saturday morning of my mom's passing I called the dealership and spoke with the young lady and she told me all the time cars had been taken for people that had appointments for them now at that point I'm thinking to myself while I'm a customer as well why wasn't I call to pick up a rental car so she in turn told me that she wouldn't have the manager call me back and indeed he did call me back but when he call me back he let me know that they did have a loaner cars and that they would be closing in 30 minutes well I live in Pearland and they're over by Greenway Plaza so that was no way I would have made it to get a car and he let me know that they're trying to wait to see what the warranty company it's going to do don't steal mind you I don't have a loaner car due to the fact they were closing in 30 minutes and I needed to get a ride back all in the same token my mom has passed so he went on to say that he had spoke with Brian from AutoNation Chrysler Jeep and he had told him that he would give him the family discount which was $1,200 if they were going to fix the car now mind you if the warranty company is going to fix the car they're going to charge them $1,200 but I was told by Frankie that I had to pay $1,400 to have this car fixed that I've only had two months that I had a 90 day warranty on but it doesn't cover the port so once he told me he was charging AutoNation Chrysler Jeep the 1200 I told him I didn't think that was fair to me that I would have to pay 1400 at that point when he noticed he had told me the price he would on to say that oh well it may be 1200 or it may be a little lower than 1200 and I informed him once again had to prepare things for my mother's funeral and then have to come up with $1,200 on repairs for a car I've only had two months I really don't think it's fair and if I have to pay the 1200 I'll have to I'll just have to come out of pocket with it but I will take it as high as I have to because if you have a 90 day warranty the car came from Mercedes-Benz Greenway Plaza someone should make it right. And I got this car right after the flood so there's no telling if they checked it or not because it was only on their page one day before they transferred over to AutoNation Chrysler Jeep on the Southwest Freeway and not to say when I tried to contact the general manager over that Brian Gretchen I left him several voicemail he has never called me back and I think that's very poor customer service at this point I just want my truck back so I can move on with my mom and her final resting place and just pray nothing else happens since the warranties don't work out that they put on that paper work like they cover everything they need to let people know that warranty only cover certain things and I portray that it covers everything on the truck.

10,"December 07, 2017","Purchased a maintenance service plan for my GL350 when my car had 28,000 miles with the expectation this dealership would spoil my car. On November 25th while driving, car literally died with only 58,000 miles. On November 14th car had been serviced and invoice service receipt showed fuel filter had been replaced. I tool car to Sugarland Mercedes and lead technician said that fuel filter had so much residue it had to have anywhere between 12,000 to 20,000 miles. Dirty fuel filter has damaged gas pump and now bills are over $2500. I went to pay a visit service manager at Greenway and while everyone I showed fuel filter confessed it was hard to believe that filter could be one week old as it claimed last service receipt, service manager with evidence in hands still denied filter having over 10,000 miles. If your car you love and expect good care sooner or later these people will destroy your car.   ",1.0

13,"September 25, 2017","I own a 2017 Mercedes Gle. The car is great but my alert light came on telling me  to replace key battery. My first question is why is the key battery dying before the cars a year old. Then when I call they want me to come all the way over there wait on them, and then pay them five dollars. Now five dollars is nothing but why am I having to go to this inconvenience.??? Shouldn't there be a better plan?? If the battery died this quickly why don't you just mail me another key that has a good battery and provide a return envelope for the other key? It's not the end of the world to drive over there but really??? why?? Very bad service in my opinion",1.0

16,"February 23, 2017","Due to ignorance of the service agent (which is not a big issue) I was forced to use my tire protection plan despite that I told them that the tier manufacturer provides full warranty and would offer free replacement.  My protection policy offers four claims per year and due to the ignorance of Mercedes Benz Greenway, I lost one! I demanded cancelation of the claim but this was denied. I demanded that they offer me a free-of-charge coverage for a fourth claim but this was also denied. All what I got was sorry this was new to us and now we know. Sorry for the inconvenience caused.  I tried to get help from Mercedes Benz USA, but they simply redirected my complaint to the dealer and said this is all what we can do! ",2.0

18,"January 10, 2017","People are not customer friendly and the service was very unprofessional.  My husband and I wanted 3 things to be fixed and instead of telling us right away that they were not under the warranty, they took our car for 3 days and basically did nothing.  After the third day, I had to call several times to find out what was the status.  First impression always last. When we got there, we waited awhile before anyone even acknowledged us.  Completely, waste of time.  We went to the location at Sugarland and they are more customer-friendly, so we decided to service our car there.

21,"November 01, 2016","I bought my certified pre owned Mercedes S class in 2014 from Mercedes Greenway in Houston, I also bought an extended warranty on the vehicle .
Recently a week ago I called the Mercedes greenway to enquire about my warranty that how much time or miles I have left on my car , so that I can add more warranty, that's where I encountered the worse customer experience of my life , I called and tried talking to  Christne an operator to give me someone who can help me with a simple question on how much time I have left on the warranty , just wanted to be proactive . First she would toss me around to a voice mail , I called back again and explain that I really need to talk to someone who can answer a simple question for me on the warranty, but somehow the phone will disconnect mysteriously, 
I called back again and she said there is no one available in the finance department, to me that was kind of odd, NO one available in finance dept!
Anyway she took my number and she said she will have someone concerned call me back soon, I gave her my cell number, name and the vehicle details.
I also told her that I have another quote from outside on the warranty that iam working on , and wanted to see the rates for a new warranty from Mercedes .  But against her words I recieved no call from Mercedes of greenway for a full 24 hours. I was shocked , I called back again after 24 hours and raised my concern with another operater Cynthia , same thing first she will make me wait for minutes and the phone will disconnect , then when I called back maybe the 3 Rd or 4 th time , I got a tired of this attitude of the greenway people. I told her today no matter what happens or how many times I call , I am going to get an answer to my very simple question .
Then she finally transferred me to this one gentleman Kevin in the finance department, this guy turns out to be another character, as soon I told him my concern that I have trying to ask a simple question and some new quote on my vehicle warranty, he responded with an attitude , saying , Sir I am with some customers, and the only reason I picked up the phone was because I had to., and it's rude for him to talk to me while the customer in front of him
I told him Mr Kevin first of all I don't that you were with a customer and surely I don't want to cut in the line , but I have been leaving my number and no one has the curtosey to call me back, I told him my question and gave him my name and number and vehicle details , he said and promised to call me back as soon as he is done with the customers Infront of him.
BUT NO CALL!!!!
It's been 4 days and I have not recieved any call from anyone from Mercedes of greenway , such level of poor customer service is shocking , it been almost a week and I have not gotten the answer to my query.
I wish I had not bought a car from them, they are all so nice when you are buying a car from them but are truly non proffetional when it comes to after sales service. I will never , never recommend any of my friends to go to this dealership, and I have a tons of those. . Today I will personally go to Mercedes of Sugarland to ask the details that I need. 
I don't want to deal with Mercedes of Greenway , ever again.

22,"October 27, 2016","Had to replace my car pretty quick due to being in an accident and was looking at CPO inventory in and around Houston and Dallas. Really wanted a 2014 0r 2015 E350 with lighting package, white exterior and leather and Lauren Leal in their internet sales division was very prompt in getting back to my questions. The car must have just been added to the inventory, Lauren confirmed its features and availability and I reserved it online for 48 hrs with a refundable $250 deposit. Joseph Garcia called me an hour later, introduced himself as the salesman who is going to be helping me and gave me additional info on the vehicle. 
He sent me the auto packet as requested which had all the info on the vehicle including carfax, service records, CPO inspection and maintenance work done on the vehicle. Kept me updated on the CPO certification process, detailing, cosmetic work and met him Friday morning to look at the car and hopefully pick it up. Car was still being worked on for cosmetic reasons and when it was ready, both Joseph and I were not satisfied with the final results and instead of making me wait another 2-3 hours, he arranged for a E class for me to use for the day and promised me he will call me when it is done right and then I can come by to pick it up. As promised, he called me the next day, said it looked perfect now and so drove down, exchanged keys and was out the door in 5 min. 
Things do go not as planned and I always look at how the seller responds to those situations and Joseph Garcia and MB of Greenway came thru with flying colors. They even honored the 0.9% interest rate that I mistakenly stated as being offered by MB- I was wrong.
Would not hesitate to recommend them or use them again.",5.0

25,"July 17, 2016",I am in the market for a sports car they had in stock so I contacted them via email. My inquiry about the car was to see the carfax and physical photos of the vehicle as all they had on their website was a generic stock photo. Carfax was sent however I was told on he 11th of july They would get photos to me. 3 days went by and no photos but the GM sends me an email to find out about my experience. I stated my concern about the pictures and he assured me I would be sent them that night. 3 more days go by and nothing still. Do not waste your time with Greenway.

28,"January 25, 2016","You would think that being a high end Mercedes dealership there would be some honest professionalism here and I quickly found out there wasnt ANY to be found except shady sales tactics, terrible upper management, and a car with a sketchy background. 

I purchased a 2004 S500 Mercedes off the lot. My sales guy was Brent Hathorn and he was anxious to sell this car quickly and that should have been the first red flag. Keep in mind this was an older car which normally goes to auction so it was unusual to have it out on the lot. He explained it had low miles and this is why an exception was made. It was a ""trade in"" that had recently come in. He assured me that it was a clean vehicle with nothing unusual in its history. His boss, Dennis Fredricks also chimed in that afternoon that all these cars go through an extensive service and inspection. 

I closed the deal and bought the vehicle at full asking price. Make a long story short, I started having issues with the car from the first week. Turns out this car has bad valve blocks which control the air shocks so the car started drooping. I was very annoyed but decided to put money into the car since from the exterior and interior it was in good shape. In the subsequent months I had to put more money to different issues to the point I decided to just sell it back to another dealer. 

Come to find out that the car that supposedly had a CLEAN history had been auctioned off in 2008 with C pillar unibody damage. This essentially made the car worth HALF as much as I had paid for it. So after 400 miles and 4 months there was no way I was going to let this stand. I went back to the dealership to try to work something out and have them buy the car back as I NEVER would have purchased this car knowing its history. I am sure they never would have tried to sell it either so it was rather shady how they tried to sell it quick instead of sending it to auction.  Long story short, my sales guy Brent passed the buck along to management. I could never get a return call back in two weeks. Finally, the supposed guy in charge Mac Albukhari called me up and told me that the car was worth $6K to him if I wanted to sell it back and if not they could work something out on a trade for another car on their dealership!!!  He was hiding behind the paperwork and the ""as is"" typical defense instead of working out something out with the customer. He was not interested in good business practices and instead of admitting that the dealership had erred in doing their due diligence in accepting their trade in he threw it back on my lap. UNACCEPTABLE behavior from him and the dealerships part. When I saw that our conversation was going nowhere I asked for the regional directors contact info (Autonation) or a legal address to escalate it and he just hung up. 

I am currently considering legal action against the dealership for this transaction as well as notifying all three TV news stations so they can assist. If you want a clean deal and to be treated like a valued customer and deal with professional people that know what they are doing stay away from Greenway Mercedes. The only difference between them and a shady car lot that finances everyone with lemons automobiles is the physical address because they are one and the same!!!!",1.0

No hassle, no pressure. Lee walked me through all the things I needed to know about how the dealership solidly backs its preowned vehicles to make a customer feel confident, even vehicles like the one I purchased, that aren't Mercedes. Harshad was there for me every step of the way. The financing and extended warranty were easily done with the finance manager, and everything was explained clearly.

38,"August 26, 2015","Exceeding expectations and building relationships is just a message on their keychains, not something they believe in. My wife bought a used 2012 C250 with Hector and he was great (though he no longer works there). When came the time where the Finance Manager Will tried to sell the extended warranty, my wife politely declined.

A month later, we received paperwork stating that we have signed up for an extended warranty. So we sent him an email to rectify and adjust our account. He attempted to make another sales pitch, while ignoring that he tricked my wife into signing the papers. We asked him to simply cancel the warranty. One month goes by without a reply from him. We sent him another email and finally replied and said he will escalate the issue and have it canceled asap. We have now waited ANOTHER month and still no answer, no follow-up, nothing. 

During that time, we called Client Care several times and they too have tried to contact Will at the dealership.

42,"May 04, 2015","A success company is leads by great management.  When a manager tried to cover for his staff mistake, then it’s unethical business.  The dealer didn’t take responsible for their staff action and blamed it on the customer.  You should avoid this dealership.  Upper Management is a joke and unreasonable.  Bring your business somewhere else.
I bought my car brand new at the Mercedes Benz (MB) of Houston Greenway Dealer.  I brought my car to Mercedes Benz of Houston Greenway Dealer for the Glove box compartment door repair.   When I got the car back almost a week later, my wife called me at work and told me that Mercedes Benz Technician at the dealer broke off the air freshener on the vent and some sense oil drifting down on the radio unit.  My wife told me to complaint with the dealer because she loves that air freshener and they aren’t cheap either.  I told her to clean the sense oil up and get a new freshener because I don’t want to bring to the dealer for the small thing.  Unfortunately the sense oil caused one of the buttons (#3 button) on the radio stuck (cannot press down).  The radio is working fine.  My wife doesn’t use the radio that much and if she needs to change the radio station, she uses the button control on the steering wheel.  With that said we didn’t realized one of the buttons on the radio was stuck until later on. 
Keep in mind that the radio system is working fine; it just that number 3 on the radio was stuck due to the sense oil.  So when I found out the button is stuck, I brought the car to the dealer to get the button UN-Stuck.  I told the MB Service Manager (I think his name is Eriek) about the incident and let him know that one of the MB Technicians broke the air freshener when he repaired the glove compartment and caused the oil to leak onto the button.  The manager told me that there is no way that the Tech fixing the glove compartment would knock off the air freshener.   I told him that the air freshener is right near by about 3 inches (3”) away from the glove compartment door.  So the manager told me that he wants to discuss the incidents with his team.  A few hours later the manager told me that in the MB Owner Manual stated that I should not put any Sense Oil in the vehicle and it was my fault to put the sense oil in the car, therefore, it’s not cover by warranty to get it fix.  I was so mad, because MB employee broke the air freshener that caused the oil to leak.  If I broke the freshener I don’t mind to pay for the fix.  The Manager still insisted that because I put the freshener there in the first place and the manual said you should not use any sense oil.  I asked the manager that the manual also said don’t drive the car through high water, so if MB Technician drives the car through high water is it stills my fault?  After all, it was his staff that broke the air freshener which caused the sense oil to leak in the first place.  The Dealer should step up and responsible for their actions instead of blaming on their customers.  So now I’m stuck with a stuck button radio.  I will continue to fight and hope the dealer is doing the right thing.

Even worse, one call was while I was at the dealership discussing the car.  

The total lack of respect for my request not to cal my cell, led to my blocking their number and I did not further consider the Mercedes.

Jay told me most of the hydraulic cylinders were bad, the hydraulic pump motor was shorted, and a switch was bad.  he felt replacing the ruined headliner could be thrown in for that price.

i took it to my regular mechanic, he kept it two days, and returned it to me repaired.

the cost was $7000, but for that i got:

two of the five hydraulic cylinders replaced (retractable top now working)
supercharger for the engine replaced
serpentine belt replaced
all idler pulleys replaced
headliner replaced
overflow tank for the radiator replaced

I do not believe that the service rep I was dealing with ever had his mechanic even examine my car.  I think he was just trying to give me a high enough cost to drive me away from the dealership, and for that effort, he got to keep $119 of my money.

Not sure the contract has a clause stating that seller retains the right to change terms at any time, thus requiring the buyer to come in and sign new paperwork with different terms.  Sounds like they're itching for bad publicity from reading their other reviews, too.  I do not blame my salesperson for this - therefore I will not mention his name.  The management botched this and they need to do the right thing, which is to fix it and ""IF"" for some reason they needed to have a different contract signed stating the EXACT SAME bottom line, then they might want to handle the situation with a little more class as far as their customer facing lingo is concerned.

When I last took my car in for service the following occurred:
 1. The appointment I had made over the phone was NO where to be found
 2. I was told the service would take 2-3 hours - I was called that it was complete after 7 hours! However, they recommended an additional bulb change. I approved it and was told to be on my way as this was a quick fix and the car would be ready upon my arrival.
 3. Once I arrive I had to wait for 1.5 HOURS before my car was ready - this is now 8.5 hours for a regular service!!!!!! While waiting I approached the service desk 3 times to inquire and each time I was told it would be another 10 minutes or so.
 4. After paying my bill I discovered that the $50.00 discount I had turned in for the service had NOT been applied
 5. After the service I was emailed by Tammy Jackson saying I would receive a customer service feedback from Mercedes Benz AND that she would contact me the day it was sent. I replied to her email with the above notes requesting a conversation. I sent 1 reminder that I wanted to speak with her as well as left 2 voice mail messages.
 6. After over 45 days of NOT receiving the survey NOR hearing from Ms Jackson I called and asked to speak to the GM. I had to leave a message. The message was returned after a few hours by a Mr. Jose who asked to look into the matter and get back to me - which may take as much as 7 days. That is close to 14 days ago at this point.
 7. Today I called and again asked to speak to the GM to ensure he is aware that the staff DO NOT return phone calls NOR Emails within a timely manner nor when they say they will. I was low and behold connected to Ms. Tammy Jackson who explained to me that the reason she had not called back is that Mr. Jose had said he would and was now inquiring if he never called me.

I cannot understand why most (it seems) salesman use the same old tired and abusive tactics to part you from your money.,  From the start, my dealings with Mike Watkins and his sales manager couldn't have been more professional and cordial.  He treated us with respect and was very knowledgeable of his products.  The car came with a 60 day limited warranty.  The day after we drove 125 miles home with it, we discovered that the six CD changer did not work.  I read the warranty word for word and I don't believe that they were responsible for my problem.  But I was told to bring it in the next day and they would take care of it.  Long story short, they kept it for the better part of two weeks, having to order a very expensive part to make it work.  While they were poking and prodding the innards a ""small oil leak"" was found.  Mike said that I would probably never notice it but they were going to make it right.  It turned out to be a very simple solution.

To sum it up, if you are in the market for a higher end vehicle and want to deal with someone that is really good at his job, and who it became evident to me, has the backing of management, Mike Watkins is your guy.

84,"March 27, 2013","Jim Frazier is an amazing employee of Mercedes-Benz of Houston-Greenway.  His communication excels expectations.  He kept me informed from day 1 through closing.  Jim is more than a salesman.  He cares about the customer and it shows.  When I first inquired via the internet I never throught I would receive a reply based on prior experiences from dealerships.  Not only did he communicate (internet and phone) and respond, he was ready to order the car of my choice. . .he was ready and excited to get the process started.  His excitement and engergy is contagious and it was a pleasure working with him.  Mercedes has always been my favorite vehicle.

Jim Frazier and Mercedes Benz is my car of choice.  Between my husband and myself, we have owned 5 or 6 Mercedes and Mercedes-Benz Greenway has the best salesman of any dealership we have purchased a car from.

86,"March 26, 2013","Mike Walsh, my service advisor at MB Greenway is the main reason I trust that dealership.  I have worked with him for over 2 decades; he previously was the service manager who took care of my Mazda RX7 before he joined Mercedes Benz.  He has taken very good care of my cars including my SL550 and my CLK500.  I trust him to provide the best and cost-effective service for the cars I love.  These cars are built to last and they run like new after 7 and 9 years of respective service.  In the long-run, these cars are so reliable and solid that they are not that much more expensive to own than cars that are initially less expensive to buy.  They are very comfortable, very safe and very fast.  With new, cost effective models like the CLA class, MB is a brand that should become even more popular.  Swithcing my loyalty from Mazda, Acura and Honda to MB was one of the best purchase decisions I ever made.  The technology and build quality of these cars is worth the extra cost.  MB Greenway has been a great dealership from purchase through several years of maintenance and they even set up European delivery for my 2007 SL550, one of the most thrilling purchase and driving experiences of my life!  These cars keep me very happy because of their excellent design, build quality and, most importantly, because of Mike Walsh and his crew, who keep these cars running like new.  Thanks, Mike!",5.0

The sales person that I had the pleasure of meeting was Mr. Ali Akhavan. He is the guy you want to have on your side when buying a used car. With his past experience as a service manager in the same dealership , he knows about cars, their weaknesses so his hints were something that helped us in choosing what is best for our way of life.
After choosing a certified used 2011 E350 Bluetec( Diesel) , with help of Mr. Akhavan we were able to get the same quote for our old trade in car as we had from Carmax and also on the other hand we did get some special price on our purchase.
The finance department is just an easy 1-2-3. With help of Mr. Richardson as the finance manager we did get a perfect %1.99 finance that saved us more that what we were thinking of.The rest of the process was quick and fun signing on a cool monitor instead of papers.
The whole trade in and purchase didn't take more than 2 hours and we enjoyed waiting time by checking all different cars in the showroom , shopping the small boutique of Mercedes gift products and also sitting on a comfortable chair drinking a freshly brewed cafe chino!
At end our car war ready with a full tank of diesel, all detailed and clean, with fresh smell.
Even tough I have another Mercedes dealer much closer to my house but I always return to this one without any hesitation. ",5.0

I bought a brand new Mercedes from here and it was damaged when we went to pick it up. MACK ALBUKHARI promised to fix the issue like new with no problems. BIG MISTAKE!! After several trips back to the dealership it wasn’t fixed ""like new"". He was the most unprofessional and arrogant person I have ever interacted with in my life. Each time we returned to have it fixed he was ruder than the first time i.e., said ""all the Mercedes are damaged somewhere, plastic is supposed to be bubbled and messed up, and then simply said we are ANAL"". The GM Jeff Quiesenberry wouldn’t return any calls or emails after numerous attempts. We never mentioned that we were unhappy when attempting to contact him, just stated we wanted to share our new car experience at his dealership. As far as MACK AND THE GM JEFF they treat you as if they have no interest that you made a purchase from them and you are just another sale. We have never been treated so poorly when purchasing a car.

139,"November 21, 2012","Jay Gomez, Internet Sales Manager and New Car Sales is the MAN!  The level of consideration, service and patience that Jay had during the purchase of my new car is world-class, and I highly recommend dealing with him. 

I negotiated the entire deal via email and phone, as I live in Dallas Texas, and things went as smoothly as any bargaining session could go.  At no point was I made to feel like a second-class buyer because I didn't come in person during the negotiating phase. Jay was very attentive, and always went the extra mile to get the information I needed.  As with any negotiation, there were hiccups and tough spots, but Jay stuck with it and tried his very hardest to keep the discussion going.

The day I came to pick up the GLK350 and drive back home, I was well taken care of, and every little question I had was answered courteously and thoroughly. Jay was very knowledgeable. The finance department, Melissa Sanchez helped me complete the transaction with a minimum of pressure and fuss, and I was in and out of there in much less than an hour.

I even got a call from Jay the next day to see if I had any questions that came up on the drive home. That shows dedication to establishing a long-term relationship with customers, and more dealerships should be this way.

226,"August 22, 2011","This was the second vehicle we purchased in the last month from this dealership and both experiences were brilliant.  Mike Maidenberg really went the distance to get the deals we wanted.  The first experience was so good that we returned to purchase a second car from him.  His attitude was always positive and friendly.  Will, the Finance rep, was easy to work with and had a friendly, no-pressure attitude.  The only conmplaint I have concerned the dealership facility itself which was undergoing a major expansion and the construction noise and dust was at times annoying.  However, this was out of the dealership personnels' control and was forgiveable.  I still can't believe how pleasurable the whole experience was.  Kudos to Mike, Will, and all those who made our car buying experiences wonderful.",5.0
227,"August 03, 2011","Went to the Greenway to purchase a 2012 E350 on 7/28. Paid the dealer a cashier's check with full amount in the afternoon after having all document signed near noon. Two hours later or so, got a call and was told the car was not available. Greenway asked us to go back on 7/29 and will give our money back if we did not like other cars available. Went back on 07/29. After being shown another car with less option, we decided to take our money back but only to find out the check has been cashed and will not be returned to us in another 5 business days. How is this possible? Had to hire a lawyer to start all necessary legal actions to make sure we will not be surprised by more lame actions from them again. ",1.0
228,"June 03, 2011","This dealership has horrible customer service. Their phone system is a nightmare to navigate and trying to get ahold of an actual person is nearly impossible.  I had several issues with my car that I bought from them and they always made me feel like it was my fault that the car was a lemon.  It took them driving the vehicle for a week to figure out the problem and they were not apologetic at all.  I finally sold the car and tried to get a rebate on my extended warranty - left 5 messages for people in finance to call me back and no one ever did. It took me getting upset with the operator to finally get someone to help me.  Overall, this dealership is awful and I will never buy another car from them. ",1.8

230,"March 05, 2011","I took my car in while in warranty to repair the transmission which sometimes when cold stays stuck in 1st gear for a considerable distance before upshifting. They called me back and said they could not replicate the problem and suggested a transmission oil change as a remedy. They charged me an exorbitant amount (over $400) for the oil change. When I got it back it still had the same problem. I sent them a letter of  complaint but never got a response.  To add insult to injury, after driving the car for less than 2000 miles, the transmission started to leak. I took it to another Mercedes dealer and they said that whoever changed my trans. oil did not put the transmission gasket on correctly. I will never buy a car from them ever again, and may never buy a Mercedes again either because of this bad experience.

231,"September 28, 2010","I dropped my 1997 Benz E420 at the dealership because the transmission seemed to be stuck in 2nd gear.  The dealership took it, gave me a rental, and looked at it for the next day or two.  They called me and told me multiple things needed replacing on my transmission, and quoted me $2800.  Then, they said they found some other problems (shocks, etc), and quoted me an additional $2100.  I told them I would think about it...I was thinking about getting a new car, and wasn't too excited about spending this much money on a Benz this old - it had been a money pit so far.  I called them the next day and told them that was too much.  My advisor, Derek Hightower, then tells me that he ""misread"" a number, and that the actual transmission cost was $2400, bringing the full total to $4500.  I told him this was still too much, and he told me the lowest he could do was $4100.  I told him not to do anything, and had the car brought back to my place.  The car sat in my garage for a little while, and I ended up buying a brand new Lexus, which I have been tremendously happy with.

I finally was told about a shop in Houston that worked on Benz's.  I called the owner, and within 30 seconds of describing the problem, he told me I had a bad conductor plate, and that the transmission of this car shouldn't give out at this mileage (100,000).  He quoted me $700 over the phone, if that was the problem.

I took it in, and he examined it, and confirmed his suspicion.  He fixed it within one day.  Upon test-driving it, he told me the transmission works perfectly, but that he found some other ones - shocks, struts, etc - the same that Benz Greenway had found.  He quoted me at $800 to fix the rest.

Total cost = $1500.  Runs like new.
Greenway's estimated cost = $4100 (before negotiating, $4900).  STAY AWAY,GREENWAY IS SHADY!!!

PS - I don't like advertising for anyone, which is why I didn't put the shop's name in public.  If you are interested in knowing the name of the shop, please email me at mbenz1997@gmail.com.

The last time I had my car serviced I had to bring it back in because they never repaired my tire, and I ended up with a flat tire on the side of the freeway.

Not being familiar with the dealerships here, I looked them up online and was shocked by the reviews that were posted. After readig about the Greenway dealership, I was hesitant to take my car to them for service. But I was delightfully surprised.

My service advisor, Tracy D was extremely nice and even before she had a chance to great me, 2 other advisers had welcomed me.  So far so good.  Tracey took my information and I waited in their nice lounge area complete with 3 flatscreens, 3 workstations and FREE wi-fi.  So I worked while I waited.  

In a reasonable amount of time (I'm not the most patient), Tracey was able to tell me what the problem was, how much it would cost and how long it would take to repair.  The cost was reasonable and in a little more than a hour, I was on my way.

236,"July 18, 2009","This is an arrogant dealership who did not care about customers once they got the sale. Examples:

1) I purchased an extended warranty from Mercedes-Benz. The extended warranty was promised to be mailed to me. Nothing happened in a month. Nothing after a phone reminder. A personal visit to the dealership resulted in the explanation that everything would be on MB computer system so no documentation would be needed ! The dealership financial representative refused to secure any documentation. i went out to complain to the new car manager. He promised to take care of the matter. nothing happened. Only on the fourth visit and after some threat of taking them to court that they said that they would pursue the matter. After a month, the official extended warranty from MB arrived in the mail. Follow-up letter to GM of Greenway dealership was unanswerred.

2) At 1st service check up, I was told by service advisor that the rear brakes were worn out and would not be covered under warranty. I was told that itw as the way I drove that caused the problem. Very strange indeed as I am 60 eyars old and have driven so many new cars in my lifetime and no brand has ever worn out in first service. I told them to replace the brakes. Subsequently, I asked my new car saleman whether this was unusual. He recommended that I should not replace brakes unless the car computer told me that would be necessary and I should talk to the Service Manager. Waited 45 mins for Service Manager, who were busy with other matters. I just left.

Mercedes Benz of Houston Greenway Auto Purchase Disaster 

BEWARE if you go to purchase autos from Mercedes Benz of Houston Greenway location. They have the same owners as the Houston North location. We purchased a 2007 Lexus from the Greenway location. The salesman pulled the books and keys one afternoon and was told my wife would be there the next morning to sign papers. 


She arrived the next morning, SIGNED the papers, and went to financing. While in financing, a disturbance broke out in the dealership. My wife found out a few minutes later the reason for the commotion. The dealership informed us they had sold the vehicle to someone else the night before. This was AFTER the keys had already been pulled for us BEFORE that alleged buy. Here is one of the important points. Per the dealership personnel, they were paying $4,100 more than we were. So it became a ""violate people's legal rights to turn a buck."" The dealership manager called me and admitted they had a LEGAL problem. He stated, ""I am going to make it right for you."" He went on to say that the buyer had until 4 PM to show up to complete the purchase. He said he would call me if they were not there by 4 to allow me to make the purchase. Dealership personnel (including this manager) have admitted this buyer did NOT show up by 4 PM. Yet he didn't call me. He EVENTUALLY completed the deal for all the extra money. The manager then said he would sell me a car at cost (or 2, as we wanted to buy 2) to ""...make it right, because we don't do business this way."" To make a long story short, they NEVER did. They have continued to try to sell autos to us for more than TRUE COST...even reneging on a verbal $ deal we made to remedy this nightmare waste of time. By the way, the supposed ""make it right deal"" reveals the nature of the dealership.  We agreed on a vehicle to test drive. When they finally had it available to test drive, it was 3 days later. Yet it had a SPARE TIRE, A 2ND GASHED TIRE, A PAINT PROBLEM ON THE TRUNK, AND WAS FILTHY. BEWARE, BEWARE!!!! They clearly have no intention of making this right, and the attitude reflects such. 

Please warn your e-mail address book, so your friends and co-workers do not experience the lack of respect and tactics that I witnessed at MERCEDES BENZ OF HOUSTON GREENWAY location.

240,"September 16, 2007","Several weeks ago, my 2003 Mercedes Benz was flooded after I tried driving home in the heavy rain. Almost immediately, I called Greenway Plaza to tow my car and access the damages. While this preliminary stage was done efficiently and my service advisor kept in contact with me on a regular basis, the service and customer relationship went downhill quickly thereafter. After I paid several hundred to have my car looked at in a five hour diagnostic test, it was concluded that it would cost nearly four thousand to have my car fixed. Within 24 hours, the service advisor reassured me that everything had been taken care of, the car parts would be ordered and replaced, and my passenger and I would be able to drive back to California (about 1500 miles) home the next day safely and without engine problems. I was satisfied with the work done at Greenway Plaza, especially since they fixed my car so quickly and I hadn't even purchased the vehicle there. I called my service advisor repeatedly during my drive home to California, with his continual reassurance that my car was safe to drive.

However, within 24 hours of driving home, it appeared that Mercedes Benz of Greenway had not completely flushed the water out of my vehicle or correctly fixed the problemed incurred by the floord damages. My vehicle once again stalled on the freeway, with oil spilling everywhere and completely damaging my engine. I then towed it to a southern California dealership to access the damages. Neither I nor my new service advisor could reach anyone at Greenway. For 2 weeks. I left countless messages for my Houston advisor and his manager, to almost no reply, except to contact my insurance. When my insurance contacted Greenway Plaza, they faxed an invoice that was less $1200 of the actual amount I originally paid. I have no complaints about the work that was done on my vehicle by Greenway Plaza; in fact I commend them for covering the damages so quickly that by the time my car broke down again, I was too faraway to come back to their dealership. They even sent me a customer service survey online, which was later removed 24 hours later when my car broke down. 

I am giving Greenway Plaza a low rating not because they could not fix my car, as it was flooded and later deemed a total loss by the House of Imports Mercedes Benz and AAA insurance, but because of the poor customer service quality thereafter. My family currently owns five Mercedes Benz, a Porsche Carrera and a Lexus, and we are quite aware of the caliber of customer service these dealerships offer. I am quite surprised that Greenway Plaza cut contact with not only a valuable customer, but also with another Mercedes Benz dealership and a renowned insurance company. The amount I paid for in damages at Greenway Plaza is now insignificant, compared now to the respect and trust I had for the dealership and customer service. ",2.0

243,"May 08, 2006","This is the worst dealership I have ever experienced.  I had our car serviced there for several years because they are the closest one to us. First we do our routine maintenance there for 3 years until one day I realized the front tires worn a lot. It turned out, they never did tire rotation even they charge me for it. Who knows what else they did not do but charged me for? Secondly, after my car is out off warranty, I bought an extended warranty from an online dealer and they said they are happy to accept the warranty. But every time I used it, they will find some excuses to charge me more. They even try to cheat me by saying that the rear view mirror is not electronic so my warranty will not cover it. The parts there are also way more expensive than other dealers. They charge over $12 for a light bulb, but you can buy it from aother dealer for $4.  I now go to Star Motor for service and repair. They are much better. Mercedes Greenway is worse than a Junk car dealer when coming to cheating your money.",1.0
