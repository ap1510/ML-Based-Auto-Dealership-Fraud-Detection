0,"June 22, 2020","I have been calling to speak to the service department all morning. Every time I call to speak to them, the secretary asked me what my specific problem is. I don‚Äôt call the service department to talk to the secretary, I called to talk to service manager. I get asks if my car is in there or getting set up for service, but all I have is a question. The last time I called the woman said something that sounded like,‚Äùenjoy holding,‚Äù and then put me on hold. Your service department people suck.",1.0
1,"December 11, 2019",I saw a vehicle online and Mo was so helpful to my needs. He waited for me to arrive and let me do a test rive. He was open to other options as well. I highly recommend anybody looking for a new SUV.,5.0
2,"December 11, 2019","I was gifted a Certified Preowned, 2015 Mazda 5.  The Service Department have been wonderful professionals!  They send maintenance reminders email and text.  When my car is there being serviced they send me an video/audio text update on what they are doing to my car and what their assessments  are that I might not know about.  My certified preowned vehicle warranty was worth every penny.  They gave me quality service the entire time.  When my warranty finally expired this year they continued to treat me life a valued customer and offer me affordable prices on repairs.   As a retiree on a fixed income I really appreciate that.  They have taken such good maintenance repair carevon my M5 that it continues to drive like a brand new car! You should buy a Mazda from them and see that I am telling the truth.  Honest, prompt, reliable, affordable  maintenance done by experienced professionals!",5.0

5,"December 03, 2019","Juan Bernal was our salesman, and he was great! I'd recommend this dealership and the Mazda South location to anyone interested in vehicles in Mazda's price range.",5.0
6,"December 02, 2019","An oxymoron, I know. 

Originally from Houston, I drove from Houston to buy from the same salesman. Obviously, I am a repeat customer. I bought a car with Carlos 2 years ago after a wreck that totaled my car. He helped me walk through the process without being pushy and really worked to help me meet my goals. 

I recently came back 2 years later to lease a newer version of my CX-5. Again, he worked to meet my goals in a friendly and kind way. 

Everyone there cares about customer service and really works for you, not just to get your business but to help you make the best possible choice! 

5 stars. Highly recommend.

7,"November 25, 2019","As usual, it was all smooth as silk.  I was in and out quickly, and the wait was pleasant with coffee and snacks provided, as well as television.",5.0
8,"November 15, 2019",I took my car to the dealership for its first regular scheduled maintenance.  The dealership makes appointments so a time slot is waiting for you.  The service folks were very courteous.  The dealership has a nice waiting area (not spectacular) but clean with a large choice of coffee and snacks.  Wifi is free and without a password so working while you wait is easy.  ,4.8
9,"November 13, 2019","We looked online first to read model reviews and compare amenities.  Then we visited a few dealers to look at cars in this particular class.  I test-drove the vehicle with the sales specialist at your dealership and liked the car - particularly the interior.  We then talked money, and ultimately I purchased the car.  I wanted more for my BMW trade-in than offered, but overall I suppose the deal we reached is competitive.  Vince was helpful and informative, as was the closing and financing staff at the dealership.  I do not live in Austin, but may have occasional service performed there when visiting my son.",4.8
10,"November 13, 2019","With my less than desirable credit I was hoping the friendly staff at Roger Beasly Mazda could get me into a less expensive used car... unsuccessful. However, Moe & Alfredo got me approved for a 2019 CX3! With no money down- just my trade-in! (which, by the way, they offered me $1000.00 more for than Carmax)! The staff @Roger Beasly are patient and courteous. Never pushing you to buy what they want to sell. They recognize their job is to sell you what you want to buy. The ONLY thing Moe tried to push on me was a glass of water.... which I finally took him up on. lolüòÇ Thanks for the new ride Moe!

12,"October 27, 2019","This is the first time I have bought a new car. My last car was a used Mercury (Ford) and I hated how pushy they were. The folks at Mazda were a refreshing experience. There weren't any pushy salesman, and every decision there was to make they let me make on my own terms. Everything was explained in detail. They also worked around my schedule. I thoroughly enjoyed working with the people at Mazda and I can see why three of my closest friends recommended them. I'm so, so very happy with my new car! Best decision I've ever made. I was incredibly nervous going into this because ""you know how car shopping can be"" but this was a painless, enjoyable experience that made me feel good about my decision. I'll be recommending Mazda to anyone shopping for a new car!",5.0
13,"October 22, 2019","From the moment we walked into the dealership door until I drove off the lot the staff was professional, friendly and responsive to our every need. Our salesman, Alfredo greeted us immediately and listened carefully to every thing my husband and I had to say about buying a new car. I am so very happy with my new CX-5 and thankful we decided to stop in yesterday. This is my second Mazda. I was so happy with my first Mazda I knew I wanted another one. All of the staff at Mazda South made it an easy and enjoyable experience. ",5.0
14,"October 03, 2019",This is my 2nd CX5 lease back to back that there was no doubt I wanted another one!  Thankfully my sales guy Rick Robison was still there.  He was so great the first go round that I reached out to him again.  He made this next deal so easy & convenient for me.  Never had a car buying experience be this stress free!!!   There is no doubt that I will be back again!!,5.0

17,"August 08, 2019","I worked with Kevin Piper, new vehicle sales, who did an outstanding job in structuring my trade-in and purchase of a new Mazda CX 9. His followup in getting the front windows tinted and answering my many questions in getting acclaiming to the electronics was always pleasant and courteous. I would recommend Kevin to my friends who may interested in acquiring a vehicle.",5.0
18,"July 30, 2019","The maintenance and customer service provided at this location has been Excellent every time!  On several occasions I've called for same day oil change and although they are booked they have always found a way to squeeze me in.  Waiting time considering I call last minute is minimal.

They also provide you with a short recording of mechanic inspecting your car prior to performing service.  Most recently my Svc rep was Nathan Mendiola, I've been with Isaiah in the past.  They're all great.

Highly recommend this place!",5.0

21,"July 17, 2019","Exemplary experience, start to finish.  After months and hours of research, I today purchased a new Mazda CX-9 Touring from RBMS and could not be happier with the quality? and value of my purchase, allotted trade-in value, APR financing, and stellar customer service.  From Daisy in Internet Sales? to Rick in Store Sales and Kendall in Financing, I was treated with professionalism and courtesy at all times.  The compassion and transparency demonstrated by this business have? become, unfortunately, a rare thing.  If you are in the market for any vehicle the Roger Beasley? Group represents, you won't be disappointed? by the South Austin location.  PSA: Stay FAR away from the World Car Auto Group!",5.0

25,"July 04, 2019","This is our 6th Mazda since 1976- we love Mazdas and are always grateful for the great service performed on our vehicles.  So sad when Mazda stopped building their trucks :(   This dealership is our fav - competent friendly technicians.  Clean well stocked waiting area!  Never feel like we are waiting forever for a progress update or finished vehicle.

26,"July 03, 2019","I looked at lots of other dealerships before finding Roger Beasley Mazda.  At the other dealerships they tried to put me in a car I couldn't afford, didn't offer what KBB showed as a range for a trade in and all the other usual complaints you hear associated with most car dealerships. I wasn't prepared for what awaited me at Roger Beasley.  They didn't try to upsell me or take advantage of me on my trade in.  There was absolutely no pressure.  They found me a car I said I was looking for.  We took a test drive, they told me what they would give me for my trade in (which made me very happy) and I drove the car home that evening.  It was a wonderful conclusion to what had previously been a frustrating experience.  They were the BEST!",5.0
27,"June 21, 2019",My husband applied online and by the end of the day they were on the phone with me doing an appraisal over the phone with me for my trade in. We went in the next day and the car we applied for was ready to go for a drive and it was perfect. Josh and Kendall were amazing and made me feel welcome and kept my husband and I in the loop the entire time. ,4.8
28,"June 11, 2019","Good service experience, i want to point out that they should add free car wash when you take a vehicle for service for the price that you paid, on my visit to Florida a family member took her Mazda to the dealership and the car was serviced and wash for free for a real low price compare wtih the price that we pay in Texas. I think that if you add free car wash you are going to make your customer REAL happy plus you are going to get more customer IN, do not need to be a detail car wash just a drive thru car wash.",4.8
29,"June 10, 2019","We went in late on a Saturday as life circumstances came up and resulted in us needing to buy a car asap. Alfredo met us at the door and we explained that we had been looking online and knew which vehicle we wanted to see. He immediately brought it to the front and we took it for a test drive. We ended up getting a different vehicle in the end that suited our needs much better. During the whole process, he and his colleagues never ""wheeled and dealed"" with us, just tried to help us get what we needed for a price we could afford. They gave us space and time to make our decision and even stayed past closing to get it all taken care of. Everyone was genuinely pleasant. We enjoyed the experience and left with a car we were super happy with. Who walks away from a car dealer thinking wow, I'm actually pleased to have met that person?? That's what we got with Alfredo. Super helpful, knowledgeable, and just a sincerely nice and kind person. ",5.0
30,"June 10, 2019",I came in for a state inspection and to have a nail removed from a tire and the resulting leak repaired. Both services were completed quickly and professionally. I was in and about one hour. Nice.,4.5
31,"June 08, 2019","Excellent customer service, in particular from Product Specialist Rick Robison and Finance Manager Lauren Walker.

I know nothing about cars so I came with a lot of questions and often repeated them.  I knew so little that many of my questions didn't make a lot of sense the way I worded them. Rick was very patient with me throughout the whole process.  Thanks to him I went from being very nervous to feeling comfortable and confident in the decisions I was making.  The Finance Manager, Lauren, was equally patient.  She took the time to thoroughly walked me through all of the different options that I had requested to see. Not once during the process did I feel pressured, and I feel like I learned a lot by the end of it.",5.0
32,"June 07, 2019",The dealership is easily accessible. It has a convenient showroom and generous amenities for sales and service customers.  Our salesperson was Carlos.  He is very knowledgeable and has a great attitude.  Easy to communicate with.  We found the vehicle we wanted and he worked hard to make it easy for us to buy.  Everyone we worked with was very understanding and accommodating.,5.0

39,"May 17, 2019","These folks have maintained my Mazda 3 since June of 2016, when it was brand new. They are prompt, efficient, and they know what they are doing. They have done a couple small recall services without prompting from me. The show room, (waiting area) is always clean, and well supplied with snacks, some of which are actually healthful. Great place.",5.0
40,"May 16, 2019","This dealership has been fantastic from jump street. They kindly set-up our new car's first inspection/evaluation and politely reminded us of that appointment. The waiting area was comfortable with amenities and TV. While waiting, we received an email giving us a real-time walk through--talk-through video explaining  the state of every inspected area.  Soon thereafter the Service Manager brought, and explained. to us his detailed written report   I will not hesitate to return to thiis organization. I highly recommend finding out for yourself how pleasant a car service visit can be. ",5.0
41,"May 14, 2019","Car and Driver gave great review on this car.  Crash test ratings were great . I opted for Mazda 3 over others makes due to engine, quiet ride, Apple Play , front seat leg / head room  and safety sensing technology.  David Cuto was a very helpful salesperson and he has been great at answering follow up questions regarding all the technology settings  on this car. I love not having to mount my phone to my car. I have Waze app , Pandora  and other apps at my fingertips along with Siri.  They seemed to genuinely appreciate our business. My auto insurance company gave credit for the safety features that the car has on it. ",5.0
42,"May 13, 2019","After doing my research and deciding on a Mazda, I found Roger Beasley Mazda had a great web site and great inventory. Scott Harms was recommended to me by multiple friends as a great salesman to work with and I wasn't disappointed. Scott was very approachable and charming plus he knows his stuff! He pulled the vehicle I was interested in very quickly, took me for a test drive and showed me all the features. The incentives were great and the price was right so I pulled the trigger. It was the most hassle free car buying experience ever! I didn't get any of the usual car dealership run around. Kendall Blythe in the financing department was super nice and very easy to work with. All in all, everyone took care of me there and I would definitely buy another vehicle from this dealership!",5.0

Happened to notice Southpoint Mazda located right next door to the other manufacturer's dealership.
Gave them a call, asked for a salesman and promised to stop by the following day, on the way to purchase from the other brand.

Was transferred to Devon (sales) and explained my situation about the other brand.
But was open to accepting a price.
Within 2 hours, I was calling the orig brand/manufacturer to inform them, that I would not be coming in to purchase their car. 

All in all, I was very impressed with Devon's sales approach, no hard sales techniques, but genuinely interested in simply wanting an opportunity to earn my business.  Understood that I was on my way next door, but wanted to ""try""

Totally satisfied about my new car purchase and hopefully a long term dealership customer.

I was thoroughly disappointed by the poor customer service and cheapness of this location. I went into the service parts department (10/25) because the battery in my key fob had died, and I wanted get a replacement. I was told AFTER it was put on that it would be $8 dollars for the small 3V battery (normally not more than $4 at any store). When I told the man working there I was an Advantage member (which comes with free oil changes, inspections, etc) and that I hadn't had to pay the ONE other time my key battery wasn't working, he said it would still be $8. I then spoke to the manager who told me 'it usually just depends on whose working if they feel like charging you or not,' and he offered to walk me over to speak with the parts clerk I had spoken to. Once the parts guy confirmed that it would still be $8, the manager turned and said ' you will have to pay for the battery, sorry.' At that point, I didn't argue (as clearly the manager had no spine and was fine with inconsistent messaging) and just asked them to remove the battery and left. If this is how they act over an (overpriced) $8 disc battery, I would rather drive the extra 20 minutes to go to ANY other location to get my car serviced. It's not about the $8, it's about ensuring your customers want to return by offering consistent service, which is something neither the manager or service parts technician seemed to care about.",1.0

177,"August 18, 2018","After our car was declared a total loss by our insurance company we started looking into buying a new car.  My husband and I went to 3 different car dealers on August 16 and when we got to Mazda   we were greeted with a warm and friendly smile.  Once we explained our dilemma to Steve (sales rep) and told him what we were looking for he took us to the lot and showed us the cars available.  Sean (manager) explained how the cost of the car was calculated.  James (finance rep) explained to us the different options available with the purchase of the car.  We had  been having a bad week but once we talked with Steve, Sean and James at Mazda South we were able to relax.  We purchased a 2018 Mazda CX-5 and are very pleased with the vehicle. Our experience at Mazda South was very pleasant. I highly recommend Mazda South.

179,"August 15, 2018","I met with Vincent Saporita and worked with him to purchase a new auto from Mazda South. Throughout the process, I felt very comfortable asking all my questions (first time new car buyer, so had many!) and never felt pushed or ""sold"" on cars / options. Vincent was laser focused on helping me figure out what I valued in a car and what worked for my lifestyle and budget. There were no gotchas or surprises, and by the end, I felt confident I was making a well-informed decision. Would highly recommend.",5.0

192,"July 30, 2018","A couple weeks ago I made my first ""adult purchase"" and got a CX-5 Touring edition.  Before deciding on this vehicle, I went to many dealerships and test drove many cars, but my experience at Mazda South was by far one of the best.  My salesman Steve was very informative and not pushy at all.  After making the decision that this was the car for me, the buying experience was so easy!  Between Steve and the finance department, I was given a lot of information on financing options and extended warrantees that were available.  
Since my purchase, I have returned to have my windows tinted and fix a chip in my windshield (thanks to construction on I35!) and was helped by Kevin because Steve was out of town.  Kevin was very understanding and accommodating despite my difficult work schedule.  And I absolutely LOVE that Mazda will provide you with a vehicle for the day when you are having yours serviced, without any additional fees! 
Even though it has only been about two weeks in my new car, I can honestly say I love it even more now than when I made the decision to buy it!  It is very comfortable to drive, comfortable for passengers, has a sporty feel/look to it, and best of all, I know that Mazda will help me out with any problem that I have down the road.  Definitly plan on driving this one for many years to come! 

Thank you Mazda for this wonderful experienece, I will continue to highly recommend you to others!

195,"October 09, 2013","I recenty bought a Mazda 2013 back in February.  It is now October and has roughly 14k miles on it.  On 10/8/2013 I dropped my car off at 12:30 pm letting the technician know that I heard belt noise under my hood when I was in idle.  He explained to me that he is familiar with what it is since other Mazda's have had the same issue.  Went on to say that it would need the Exhaust cap to be replaced and it could be taken care of in 3 hours.  We left, had lunch and even watched a movie.  It was around 3:45 when we decided to head back to the dealership even though I hadn't received a call because he did give us a time frame.  When we arrived, my car was pulled out to the right side lined up.  Last time I've gotten my oil changed, this is where they put cars that are done.  We approach the service desks, which is a disaster.  When I arrived at 12:30 none of the employees seem like they are interested in helping you.  I had to wait before being approached and waited again when I arrived later to check the status of my car.  After asking several advisors the status of my car, I was told that they were currently on the phone with Techline because they wanted to get approval to get this part for my car.  I asked, well what has been done to my car this whole time?  The advisor said that they are trying to diagnose it right now.  I do not understand how my car was barely being diagnosed when I dropped it off at 12:30 and it was already close to 4pm.  In my opinion, they looked at my car, thought that they didn't want to go to the trouble to go to techline and set it outside.  It wasn't only until I arrived later in the day that they decided to call techline.  I didn't leave dealership until about 5:15 and was stuck in traffic for another hour.  I understand that sometimes shops are busy and the time frames are not always met.  But in this case, I feel like they only got to the root of the problem because I arrived again.  I have been servicing my car here even before I bought my Mazda6.  I was really disappointed with the Mazda Service staff yesterday.  ",2.0

He wasn't pushy like some car salesmen and was genuinely interested in making sure I got the car I wanted at the price I was looking for with the best financing possible.

198,"May 26, 2007","These people lied to me numerous times. The extended warranty is a scam. DO NOT BUY IT. The finance people lied to me when they told me i couldn't get a refund for the extended warranty just 9 days after i purchased it. On the back of the contract it clearly states you have 60 days to cancel. Not only were these people extremely rude, but they had no problem lying to me. I can't imagine how many people they have ripped off. Also, ladies beware; these guys have a problem treating women as equals.",1.0
199,"September 26, 2006","Buyer beware.  
  
1) The financing is tricky, bordering on illegal (such as: beter interest rate if you buy the extended warranty).  By the way, if you are tricked into the extended warranty you have 60 days to get your money back in most states - read the terms.
2) IOUs (in writting) are not honored.  I am still bugging them to do a simple task.

Do not use this dealer - you can do a lot better.",1.0
