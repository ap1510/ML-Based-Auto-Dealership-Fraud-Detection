1,"November 28, 2018","DO NOT have your vehicle repaired here unless you don't need your vehicle back anytime soon.  
My vehicle was put into their shop on the 11/2/18, Today is 11/28/18 and they have just started to work on my vehicle.   I don't know anything about the dealership, but the collision Ctr is slow as molasses, very frustrating.   ",1.0
2,"May 01, 2016","My wife leased an Altima from Jim Bass Nissan and that process was fine. I was looking at buying an armada, but we couldn't ever come to terms that I agreed upon, no big deal. 
However, several days later my wife begins to get credit denial letters in the mail from several banks saying she was not approved for a $56,000 loan. (For the aramada!! She had nothing to do with the aramada and her credit should have never been ran for that deal) 
I called the dealership and the finance manager just acts like it was no big deal. A simple mistake. Of course the salesman stopped replying to my message when I sent him the letters I've received. I told him the dealership was blaming it on him. 
It's amazing that they think running her credit without her approval is no big deal. 
We won't shop there again, nor will we recommend them to anyone. ",1.4
3,"June 05, 2015","Well, from the time I pulled into the parking lot to the time I left with our new 2015 Nissan Versa SDN, I was comfortable and in control.  Cody Eisenbach was our dealer.  He asked what I was looking for and what my wants and needs were, wasn't trying to push some of the more high dollar vehicles just for a sale,  but showed me what I was looking for.  The ""Bass Bunch"" were all very pleasant and the king of people you walk away from after a lengthily conversation and say under your breath, ""now there's some good people"".  I didn't feel like a prize, but rather someone that mattered. I highly recommend Jim Bass Nissan and look forward to my next purchase, ""my new truck"",,,,lol... Thanks again Bass Bunch.",5.0
4,"November 12, 2013","The sales representative I worked with was friendly, respectful, personable and a please to work with. The selection of Certified Pre-owned vehicles at the dealership was okay. The sales rep listened to my requirements and didn't try to sell me something more expensive.  The service department was excellent, the got my car ready to go and it looked even better than it did on the lot. I would do business with them again.",4.6
5,"May 16, 2013",Jorge Carmona was very friendly and helpful. He was full of knowledge about the 2013 Nissan Altima we were viewing to purchase. He answered all our questions. He seemed to want to help us make the right choice for our daughter's new car. ,4.8

7,"October 10, 2012","Working with Larry Knowles is what changed my experience around with Jim Bass Ford. He was truly interested to sell a vehicale and was willing to do whatever it took to accomplish the goal. Before dealing with him, I was not too impressed with the dealership. He totally turned around the experience. He was very courteous and willing to teach me everything about my new vehicle. I could not be happier dealing with him. The financing staff was also quite professional and very knowledgeable. They made the experience go much easier. The only negative is the ""optional"" professional package being added to each vehicle whether you want it or not. I understand most dealerships do this sort of thing, I will just never like it when profits are being padded at the customer's expense from any dealership. Overall though, if you would like a Ford or Nissan or used vehicle, I would highly recommend Larry Knowles. Great individual.",5.0
