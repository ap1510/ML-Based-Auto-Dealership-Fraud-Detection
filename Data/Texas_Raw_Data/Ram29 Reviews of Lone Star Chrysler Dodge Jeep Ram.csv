Not only will their finance team try to push you into a deal, but after you say no, their manager will come out and try and convince you that you should stay.  When told no, they will start talking xxxx about you under their breath as they walk away. When confronted, the manager will walk up to you like he's going to beat your xxx and have to be calmed down by his lackeys by telling you to leave the lot.

Avoid this place at all cost.  I gave them my price range and they kept pushing it more and more expecting me to say yes. I fully admit that I have poor credit, but I was the one willing to accept that and carry on with my current vehicle. Don't waste a single minute of your time with these fear mongers. 

Chris was great in sales!",1.0
1,"September 23, 2019","Drove 2 hours to buy a car. I've worked with hundreds of dealerships, and this is among the worst I've ever seen, on many levels.  SEVERAL issues:
1) The car (a 2017 Infiniti) was well-priced, but they wouldn't honor the price I agreed on with the Internet Mgr (they said ""Well that's the internet dept. We don't talk to them).  When I finally got it down, they tried to add on $1400+ in add-ons.  ""We can't remove them. All of our cars have them already installed). They are thiefs.
2) First of all, the car was not ready to be purchased: there were mulitple mechanical issues that would cost $500+ to fix. They acted like this was no big deal, and I should just buy it and drive a loaner home while they fixed the car. Wow. And they wouldn't even lower the price to make up for it.
4) The salesperson didn't know that the car had 2 accidents. The sales manager straight up lied to my face, telling me that they were extremely minor (they weren't) and that the CarFax was wrong when it said there were 2 previous owners.  I think they like to prey on stupid, uninformed car-buyers.
3) The salesperson said the car would be detailed and ready for our arrival. The car was filthy, inside and out (fast food garbage in the door sides and in the back) and it was completely out of gas. Extremely unprofessional.
4) The dealership is filthy. Old dirty stained chairs that felt gross to sit on.  No waiting area (in sales or service) for my kids to wait while I tried to buy the car.

I don't know how Chrsyler lets them stay open. DO NOT BUY HERE!!!",2.0

6,"August 06, 2019","I left the dealership in tears due to a salesman who promised a free oil change then acted like he never said that and was arguing with me, that is very rude. I would not tolerate that type of behavior from anyone. I am a single parent who is preparing her daughter for back to school so my money matters. Ms. Susana Herrera.",1.0

13,"April 15, 2019",Needed to bring my car in for recall maintenance. Other Dodge dealerships wanted  me to leave my vehicle for the day. Lone Star had  me  in and out in  under 90 minutes.  Excellent service.,5.0
14,"January 14, 2019","Do not trust the salemen here especially Demetrius and xavier. Demetrius in particular made a deal with me on a 2015 toyota 4 runner and knew i was driving over 200 miles to buy the car and did not disclose that the car had an aftermarket kenwood radio, a missing fender, and a dead battery. This is after multiple assurances that the car is DETAILED AND READY TO GO! I wasted my entire day and a good amount of money due to Demetrius and this dealership's dishonest and inconsiderate actions. After all that Demetrius had the audacity to tell me that he worked really hard to make this deal happen when i didnt negotiate a single penny on the car",1.0

If you are looking for a genuine person who will be there for you in every way possible ask for Benito Ramos! He is amazing at what he does. You will not be disappointed!,5.0
19,"July 28, 2017","Against other online reviews about them, I still chose LoneStar!  I knew what I wanted and they had it.  2017 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited with a few additional features I was looking for.  This dealership topped my buying expectations!  ""100%"", I recommend working with their salesperson Jonathan Hamilton.  During my test ride, he thoroughly explained Jeep features and other capabilities.  Plus asked more questions about why I wanted a jeep.  It showed me he cared more about making sure I selected the right jeep trim.  He confirmed I was on the right track and didn't try to push in to the more expensive Rubicon.  My inside truth, I knew I was upside down in my trade-in.  But prepared to negotiate it in.  Surprisingly I didn't have to.  They were right where we needed to be.  Crazy part is we were already approved through 2 diff credit unions.  But chose to with them, got us at the right rate, payment and we no longer have our mazda.  The manger came out to introduced himself and said if we had any questions he was there to help.  His name was Charlie Ramirez.  Finance manager Lee Franco was also very straight forward. 
 
I recommend Lonestar DodgeJeepChryslerRam store.    These guys are top notch...  oh yeah... I bought my jeep Monday.  Both, Jonathan and Charlie have both reached out at different times this past week to ask how we are enjoying our new jeep and again if there's any questions just give them a call.  Today I received an email to expect the service manager to call me.  I'm in ""WOW"" how they treated us and their continued service after the sale!!!! 
 
btw... at one time, I owned a 1984 CJ7 years ago.  I love my 2017 jeep.  Not the nostalgic CJ7 jeep but I'm older now and prefer a smoother ride.

20,"May 31, 2016","These people are liars they will bait and switch, make promises they don't intend to keep, lie to your face, are rude, and waste your     time.  DO NOT GO HERE even as a last resort.  I'd rather take the bus than try to buy a vehicle from these people.  They try to keep you in the dealership as long as they can so you get frustrated and buy from them.  The manager Rudy will lie to you with a straight face then get rude if you call him on his B.S.  TRUST THE REVIEWS ON HERE AND STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!! Worst experience ever!! ",1.0
21,"March 30, 2016","Staff pulled together to provide excellent and smooth experience! Salesperson, Iva Smith, worked with me to get me exactly what I wanted and Steve Rodriguez, Sales Manager, got me just the right payments to fit my budget! Kudos to all team members involved! They made car buying so much less painless than in the past! LOVE LOVE LOVE my new Jeep Renegade Nighthawk!!",5.0
22,"March 17, 2016",Don't know what I would do without Superman Steve W. He jumped through hoops over mountains and under valleys and got er done ( I give you 100 stars) This was my 3rd purchase W Lonestar Dodge in Cleburne and I would recommend anyone to go there and give it a try. Keep up the amazing work and a special thank you David in Finance also. I love my new Jeep Patriot,5.0
23,"February 26, 2016","I live about 3 hours south of Cleburne and decided to work with Lone Star because of how professional  I was treated and how willing my salesman was to helping me. He was very flexible with my schedule and needs and there was nothing he couldn't resolve. When I went up to do the paperwork, everything was very pleasant and the entire dealership from sales floor to parts went above and beyond. I got a great deal on a Ram 1500 Sport and felt very confident with the sale after I left. Well done. ",5.0
24,"February 25, 2016","Walked into the dealership with low expectations. Every place we had been prior, was a very horrible experience. Not only was Josh very helpful, he got us into a brand new Dodge Journey. They worked with me, and did not pressure me. Almost 3 weeks later, I'm still loving my Journey, and tell everyone they need to start their vehicle search at Lone Star!",5.0
