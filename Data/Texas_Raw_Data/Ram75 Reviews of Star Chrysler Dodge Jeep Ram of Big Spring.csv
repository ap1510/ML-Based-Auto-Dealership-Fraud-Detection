.     Towed to Star ""can check this wk"" ruptured Y pipe""$1,200"" OK'd   ""All Done, Head Gasket fine""""Come get"", SO I drive 1 hr to Star from Midland, antifreeze smell under hood, ? white smoke exhaust, ran TERRIBLE. Different  STAR mech ""You can't drive that.""  My home Mech. ""Y is collateral damage"" ? warranty, ""Blown H. Gasket""
       NEXT:""needs heater core"" 1,800-2000. Again 1hr to Star. My Home Mech. instructed me check for, wet carpets,smell in car, cloudy windows, heater temp..ALL NORMAL. Car still runs like Sh*t.  Next:""will pressure test core"" NEXT:, ""CLAMP ON HEATER CORE BAD/Leaking""(*REMEMBER *). 
      Star:""NO blown head gasket"".  Why does it run like SH*T?  Days later:""you have a blown head gasket"" 
     Next 3 months ""waiting for new heads""  BUT, when I get  car back heads are overhauled/not new. (no complaints about heads being OH'd, But OH'd heads can be delivered in 24 hrs or my heads OH'ed in 1-2 weeks)   So why months delay, NO ANSWER. 
     My mech.says mechanics are paid per book ""hrs"" and with small jobs, they can get paid up to 1.3 hrs/hr, But on big jobs, mechanics only make 1 hr pay/hr work... ""USING YOU AS FILL IN""...You're 1000 miles away, what are you going to do?
   Call from service manager,  Warranty ok'd  repair, BUT there is Rust on some of  the parts and it will take longer to clean and recondition than the Warranty will allow   SO "" WORK STOPS""  ""until you agree to an additional 500 bucks over and above what warranty pays"" ?  I OK'd
        Call 2-3 times/wk  multiple  promises ""almost"", ""TOMORROW""  Star did finally get Chrysler to pay for a rental  for the last few weeks.  COUNTLESS promised delivery dates. ""I need car end of January as family reunion in Dallas 1/25th.""         
       PLEASE, get us the car back with a week to test drive it prior to  5hr drive to Dallas,"" reunion"". ""It will be perfect"" and you'll have it with 1-2 wks to check it out.  Tomorrow, Tomorrow, Tomorrow.  Night prior to leaving for Dallas, My daughter gets a call at aprox 3pm ""You have to return rental by five and pick up the car TONIGHT, Or you will get stuck with rental bill.
    Happy to get this behind  me and wanted to ""stay friends"" my daughter needed a new jeep. 10 Pizza's ordered from  Big Springs, Papa John's to be delivered to the dealership.  Next day I cancelled the order, see below, (easy to check)
     Car makes it to Dallas, leaking antifreeze, added 1gal.""Wet "" under hood, squealing noise.  To Metroplex Chrysler Dallas the next a.m., a Sat.  No mech's ,""leave car not safe"".  Called Star, talked  to Service manager. ""get rental Hertz"" Star will reimburse.  Turns out It's the SAME LEAK/CLAMP on heater core SEE ABOVE.(They forgot) . Aprox. $120 to diagnose, $400 for rental car.. Daughter has to drive 10 hrs round trip to pick up . Dallas:""leak fixed"" BUT, 2 yr old alternator squealing ? antifreeze on belt, or  bearings going bad"".""Could last YEARS or HOURS"" per the Dallas Mech... ""throw another $600 bucks at it"".   Can't chance daughter breaking down again  (never asked for reimbursement for alternator, MY CHOICE to not take the chance.)   . Dallas mechanic  write up  ClAMP BROKEN leaking""   Trashed Star.
      Months later:  Star says "" No supervisor works on Sat.""  "" Dallas should have billed Chrysler"".""Rene no longer works here""  ""Send bills"", NO RESPONSE.
       ""Warrantied"" Blown Head Gasket cost me Aprox.
         $400  change thermostat,/antifreeze to check overheat, $200 tow to Star
         $1400 for""cleaning parts""replacing the Y pipe ""Collateral damage"" $600 to replace a 2 yr old alternator soaked in antifreeze 400 car rental, $120 Diagnose a broken clamp,  $1 FOR CLAMP 
       $ 3,220  and  3 months of my life  for a  ""Warranty"" repair. Numbers are aprox. 
    Cheaper if I  had towed  car to Chicago and paid cash.. 
             Car returned seat belt warning light on.
All that it would have taken  to make me happy was not forget clamp or stand behind promise or  fix mistake.

3,"May 12, 2020",Very helpful this time. Had a car in there a few years ago for about 6 months and they couldn't fix it.  Every time I went to check on it they would hide in the back.  People working service now is 100 percent better helped me right away and even called me to pick up my vehicle cause they had to special order radio for it so they didn't keep me out of my vehicle for a month.  Would recommend using their service department now.,5.0
4,"May 12, 2020",I have purchased 3 vehicles with Big Spring dealership. Sales team were helpful and nice. On the other hand their service side needs help. This is the second time I’ve needed service and both times have not been pleasant. The first time I needed trailer brake put in my truck. They gave us the run around I took it to Lamesa dodge they took it right in and got it done. I have a turbo problem it looks like I will be getting a run around again. With no way to get to work. I guess I should have took truck to Lamesa dodge to get it done. Maybe next time I decide to buy again I will be going to Lamesa or some other dealership.,1.0

34,"October 21, 2019",Went in for oil change and tire rotation. They changed oil but was confused by order and didn't do tires. Manager viewed film and verified that work wasn't done. Credited me for one free tire rotation in the future.,4.4
35,"October 18, 2019","The service manager and all who I interacted with where very pleasant and responsive.   The quality is what I have a problem with. 30 min after I left the dealer and stopped, my truck began to leak fluid beneath the engine. It appeared to be antifreeze and apparently the cap to the antifreeze container wasn’t properly secured.  The previous visit, after driving the truck off the lot, there was no power with acceleration and there was a loud whining noise coming from the engine compartment.  I returned and apparently some air flow I take was not properly secured to the turbo which resulted in the symptoms. Both times I had spent 2K plus for servicing. I also paid for windshield wiper replacements that never got done.  I ended up doing them on my own and paying for them at an auto parts store. Never got refunded. It’s not about the money, my wife and I are both ER physicians but it is a huge hassle to be dealing with these issues right after service. Life’s busy for everyone and we just take it for granted that the truck will be without issue after coming out of service.  I’ve got lots of we’re sorry and thanks for letting us know and we’ll let the managers know but that’s it.   Thank you for yiur time. ",2.8
36,"January 21, 2019",Took my car to get it fixed was only supposed to be there a week &in that week they never called me .I was the one making the phone calls to them. LUNETTA is the service manage. The most unprofessional person I have ever met very rude & a liar. After car had been there a month finally get the call that the car was ready after numerous calls pressuring them that I needed the car back. An hour after driving the car the car is doing the same thing that it was doing when we put it in the shop. Lunetta try to rip me off and also called me a liar I had to call her boss let him know the situation and got the car back in the shop.He knew she did wrong because  they offered me my money back. I asked that I did not talk to Loretta anymore so I dealt with somebody else he apologized for Loretta behavior and for calling me a liar.The only liar in this situation was Loretta and I don't know how she's the service manager.😠😵😳SO NO NEVER AGAIN,1.0
37,"April 14, 2018","I purchased a 2018 Charger from the Big Spring location, in September 2017. Of course the salesman and financial officer were very helpful UNTIL they didn't fulfill their obligation to payoff my lease on my trade in! I was assured by both the salesman, Mark, and the financial officer, that they would pay our lease in full but they only paid 4 payments. I was assured that all I was only responsible for turning my previous car back to the dealership but I found out 7 months later that the lease was not paid in full! Now I am stuck with the remaining balance of a lease they were supposed to pay for me and my credit has been ruined!! We called the dealership for help and have just been given the run around. They have offered no solution!! As a resident of Big Spring for 40 years,  I will continue to tell all of Howard County about the terrible experience I had at Big Spring Star Chrysler!",1.0
