1,"December 16, 2017",Cody Gomez is one hell of a salesman. The people at Victory Nissan went above and beyond to get me financed. Other places didn't even give me a chance after telling them my situation and why my credit was low. I know where I'll be going when I need a vehicle. VICTORY NISSAN!,5.0
2,"August 19, 2017",My husband and I drive in from Corpus Christi.  My husband had been texting with a salesman and was given a promise of tradein and purchasingbof new car. Once we got there we were asked what our payoff was  we would them. BIG Mistake. Suddenly the trafein on our current car was within only $200 of our payoff. My husband told the salesman what we wanted and had agreeed upon. He went back to finance manager and he came back and said he could give $1000 more and brought out keys back to us. We got up and walked out and they let us.  They lost a sale and good recommendation over $5000.  The finance manager never came and spoke with us nor tried to stop us from leaving. Radio ad says under new ownership Sept 1. I can see why! ,1.0

5,"February 01, 2017","Bryan made my car buying experience great! I went to almost every dealership in victoria and was very frustrated until i got to nissan. The salesmen were funny,relaxed,and created a great environment. Even though i was tough to work with, they stayed professional and i left with a great car! Thanks for making my first car buying experience great",4.6

7,"January 10, 2017","I went into the dealership with a car in mind that my fiancé had picked out. She and I looked at a Nissan Murano 2016, which they had sticker prices and base model for $33,900. The vehicle was then test drove, and of course we liked it. The one we were purchasing was an AWD (told to me by the sales person). I looked up pricing online and found different markets with thousands of dollars difference for the same vehicle. Upon the day of purchasing I took my evidence to the dealership and told them if they wanted my business to honor the pricing online. They said they would consider the offer, which was $6,000 difference than their price. At the end of day, they accepted our offer and we were on our way. I asked one last time to verify it was the same vehicle, and they assured my fiancé it was. Low and behold, I was sold a front wheel drive vehicle, because their sales person (AND I QUOTE VERBATIM FROM THEIR MANAGER), ""didn't really know the difference between all wheel drive and front wheel drive."" Well, there's a few thousand dollars difference between the AWD and the FWD on the Murano. So I called the GM... and they acted as though they didn't remember the sales person who sold us the car. They acted as though they didn't even know who he was and said he was a traveling salesman from Florida. However, he called my fiancé afterwards? What kind of business doesn't even remember their staff? And does business under false pretenses? And it's not like we can just return the vehicle after all is said and done without effecting our credit which we will not do. After 5 phone calls we were left paying for a vehicle that is not what was promised. Overall, this was my worst buying experience and I will not purchase again from South Texas Nissan. Beware: some of these guys don't even know what they're selling.",1.8

10,"October 13, 2016","Shopping for a new Nissan Altima was becoming a terrible experience UNTIL I met Tony at South Texas Nissan of Victoria.  He and his team made my purchase so quick and the pricing was so fair that I thought it was too good to be true!  After shopping their website and talking to them over the phone I was certain that it would all change once I got to the dealership.  NOPE, the experience was AWESOME!  So great that I sent my brother, who drove all the way from Austin, to purchase his new Maxima.  Now they have TWO customers for LIFE!",5.0
11,"October 03, 2016","Did application, was told I was approved. Car was delivered to me. Sign contract. . Paid down payment. . Week in half later salesmen calls he needs better copy of paystubs. But he took copies when he delivered the car, ok. Sent that. I asked thought deal was done. Salesmen yes it is lenders just needed this. 2 weeks goes by I'm enjoin my car. Added to my auto insurance. Get msg from manager need bank statement for 3 months. I don't have. Just open account. Was told if not can't close deal. Wait what.i thought I was already financed when yall delivered the car. I told just give me my downpayment  back. Manager Toni says . He has deduct for miles I have used. No. I said . I was told infinanced, . By law can't do they. Came with tow took vehicle, wouldn't return my downpayment.  So I open case against them with consumer credit commision.  Because the regulated by state. That's against the law. Some of denial letters started coming in. Wrong name, not my legal name, wrong vehicle that I was financing. This company has changed its name 3 times this year already.  Beware of this company.. so glad I kept emails, paper trail...",1.2
12,"February 18, 2016","I left work on my lunch break and drove an hour and a half from my home to Victory Nissan Victoria, Texas on Monday February 15, 2016 due to interest I had in one of their vehicles. I came with a preapproval from my bank, and ready to purchase the vehicle had the customer service and experience been honorable. Upon arriving at the dealership I test drove the car, and everything was in perfectly working condition and checked out. I then sat with the salesman who called to see the payoff on my current vehicle before even discussing purchasing the vehicle I came seeking. After the payoff amount was disclosed and we discussed trading my car in the salesman went to speak with the manager who then offered me $4200 for my car. A car that in the worst condition on Kelley Blue Book is worth $6900. I however have images to prove that it was in good condition. This only leads up to the major issue I have. I came with an internet ad from both the dealerships website, and cargurus.com that advertised the car for $23,698 in which they confirmed. Because the dealership was not willing to offer fair price for my car I went to sell my car privately. I then sold my car two days later for $7650 to a dealership in the exact same town in the exact same condition. Upon discussing the price of the vehicle with the dealership again, although advertised at $23,698 the dealership said that was an ""accident"" and decided to up the price to $26,298 with no changes to the car and the salesman said (in which I have a printed out text message to prove) ""We have an internet dept. that screwed up. Since then they have corrected the error and the corrected price is now put on the vehicle."" The sales person and manager told me they would not honor the sales advertisement, or our original discussion. After spending a lot of time to get approved for the loan, sell my car, and drive all the way to purchase the vehicle and receive deplorable service and sales I am disgusted with the business and their ability to not stick to what they have advertised and the word of their sales people. I never once received an apology for the transaction, or feedback on what they would do for me - except that they would do nothing for me. My father in law went to discuss the matter with the manager and while he was sitting there another family came in with an ad that the dealership did not want to honor with a specific vehicle and amount offered. This family left the dealership. I refuse to allow bait and switch sales tactics, and ""oh it was an accident"". Consumers need to be protected from big business that feels they can deny their word, and fairness. Especially when there is proof to show that they are falsely advertising sales on vehicles. Business, just like people do, should be made to own up to their faults. If I bought a car from the dealership and then said, ""Oh, I cant pay it back"" they aren't going to say ""Oh, Okay. I gotcha. It was a ""mistake."" They would take the car back. ",1.0
13,"September 18, 2014",first of all they have a 2013 pathfinder platinum listed on line with 6000 miles for less than 28k i called the dealership and talked to jessaka and was told that indeed the car was in stock and was available (wrong) it was actually a 2013 base pathfinder and nothing more this was on 9-16-14 well we said honest mistake and proceeded to purchase a new pathfinder with salesman roland at the very start i asked them to not run the credit but once and to nissan credit only well they led us to believe that nissan was financing the purchase and i then left for work and my wife stayed to finish and take delivery now not only did they change financing to tdecu they slipped in an extra thousand dollars for etching which my wife did not catch i will never buy from them again and the the 2013 platinum is still on their web site  simple fact they lie,2.0
14,"February 02, 2011","We were very impressed after we dealt with Hutch Pine(General Manager), Greg Gonzalez(Internet Sales), and Toby Williams(Finance).  They were very professional, honest, and knowledgeable.  This was by far the best and most pleasant car buying experience we have ever had.  Victoria Nissan did not only give us the best deal but they also treated us with respect and gave us excellent customer service.  Greg went out his way to make sure we were satisfied with our purchase.  We drove there from Houston and it was worth the drive.  I highly recommend this dealership.",5.0
15,"January 21, 2011","I highly recommend this dealer and salesman Greg G.  Initial contact was made via email by myself through their website because I found the car I wanted and at the price I was willing to pay.  I drove all the way there from San Antonio (San Antonio dealers are not the best (e.g. IPAC and Ancira)).  Seems in San Antonio, if you don't drive an expensive car, you most likely can't afford a Nissan 370Z convertible.  That is what some of these chump salesmen at these dealerships think.  Lets let them keep thinking that and give Victoria Nissan another sale.",5.0
16,"July 01, 2010","I am awestruck and amazed with this ENTIRE service department.  I have an infiniti and part of the reason I chose infiniti is because of their excellent service department.  Well, Victoria Nissan blew away all of the Infiniti service departments that I have ever dealt with (Austin, San Antonio, Phoenix, Scottsdale).  They treated me like they were the concierge at a four star hotel.  Everyone was knowledgeable and kept me in the loop during every phase of servicing my car.  Not to mention, that the price was a fraction of what I was expecting.  I will be loyal to this service department from here on out.  And truthfully, I have never looked closely at purchasing a Nissan but now I am seriously considering it.  Wow.",5.0
17,"October 10, 2009","This is the first time we have bought other than Ford, GMC or Chevrolet, and Dodge.  We wanted something smaller than an SUV but bigger than my 2-Door Mustang.  Vinnie was impressed with the Rogue from Nissan.  The Victoria dealership was closest so we tried them first.  The entire experience, as stressful as it can be, was awesome there!  Greg was very friendly, Hutch was very experienced and Toby was pleasant and fast.  I will recommend them to anyone and everyone.  As far as loving my new vehicle, I do so far, but only time will tell.  We got exactly what we wanted at the price we wanted and, even though, we did not finance thru Nissan, we could have.  The entire ordeal was exciting and left me confident that buying a new vehicle does not have to be traumatic.  I love our Nissan, the Rogue and the dealership!!!!  We will definitely buy there again.
