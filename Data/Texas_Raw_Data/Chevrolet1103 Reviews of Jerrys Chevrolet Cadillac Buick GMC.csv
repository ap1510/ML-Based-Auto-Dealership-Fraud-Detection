0,"March 31, 2020",Been trying to deal for 2 days and no response other than come in. It’s a easy deal that I have a trade with all the info you needed to get it appraised and I knew exactly what truck i wanted. Just wanted to get the ball rolling and they were not interested in doing business. They wanted me to come in and and that’s not working with what’s going on unless we are good to go. I am not going to come in and waste time unless I know we are ready for a deal. ,1.0

2,"August 14, 2019","All of the employee's that my wife and I met were most accommodating and friendly. The buying experience at Jerry's GMC was completed as quickly as possible with the pickup we wanted. I will return to Jerry's GMC if I need to purchase another vehicle and will refer anyone there to purchase a vehicle. Thank you, Jerry's",5.0

4,"August 27, 2018","I found the truck I wanted at Jerry's Chevrolet while I was searching the internet.  From the time I called the dealership and talked to Don the sales experience was based on what I wanted and needed in a truck.  When Don realized I needed special equipment he suggested the perfect item.  

The orientation was also very good.  Sarah was very helpful and interested that I knew and was comfortable with the dealer layout and that I know how to successfully set all the options the way I wanted them set.


This was a very pleasant buying experience.  Don and Sarah were a great help with this process.  I will certainly return here again.",5.0

6,"May 19, 2018","I found a new truck online I wanted. Emailed them and was contacted by Deanna Smelser back through email. Was given the rpo codes to make sure the truck had everything I wanted. I let them know I had a trade in. Drove up there on a Friday morning, and was out the door a couple hours later. That's how car buying should be. Thanks again !!!",5.0
7,"April 16, 2018","Found a truck online that I was interested in. Called up the dealership and spoke to a salesman that immediately went and took more pictures of the truck I was interested in. I wanted other wheels from another truck and they did the wheel swap for free. I flew out the next day and was in and out of the dealership way quicker than other car buying experiences. This is a car dealership that I am glad I spent my money at. Also, they have a HUGE selection to choose from which also adds to the benefit of choosing this dealership to do business with. ",5.0

9,"February 08, 2018","A few years ago, we changed from general automotive repair facilities in Weatherford to Jerry's.  At first, we found the experience a welcomed change.  We appreciated our initial service writer, Brad Minot, with whom we developed a long-standing relationship, the overall customer service, loaner vehicles, etc.  However, this is now the second time recently I've had maintenance done at Jerry's only to bring the car home to immediately encounter car trouble.  A few months ago, we brought our suburban in for some work and an oil change.  During the oil change, allegedly all fluids were checked and topped-off.  However, shortly thereafter, the transmission would not shift appropriately.  I pulled the transmission fluid dipstick only to find there was no fluid on the dipstick.  I'm not exactly sure how ""all fluids were checked and filled"" yet there was no fluid on the dipstick.  Now, we just picked up our suburban again yesterday after having some more repair work done, which included having Jerry's perform a state inspection.  Somehow, it passed inspection but suddenly has a ""check engine"" light being displayed, and the engine is running roughly and missing.  This wasn't happening prior to bringing it to Jerry's.  The appearance is, at best, that poor service and lack of QA is becoming rampant at Jerry's; worse, is that malicious acts are being done to incur more maintenance in order to generate additional revenue.  I hope these are isolated and unfortunate coincidences, but the experience has been extremely frustrating.  My family has purchased vehicles from Jerry's dating back to my grandparents.  Regrettably, I think we're being forced to begin doing business elsewhere.

Very respectfully,
Former Customer",2.8
10,"December 20, 2017"," Michael Baird was the man who helped me purchase my New GMC Sierra. He was extremely professional, very knowledgeable and made me feel right at home. He is an exceptional ambassador for Gerri Chevrolet and GMC.

12,"May 09, 2017",I have purchased many vehicles from this dealership because of their honesty and integrity before and after the sale.  Their service department is one of the best I've ever used.  I refer everyone I know to this dealer because of their positive and honest business practices.,5.0
13,"March 03, 2017","I contacted this dealership through their website back around early-mid February. I found a truck that would eat a lot of the negative I had going in, and granted I knew it wasn't ""free"" money, but I wanted out of my deal and this was a way to accomplish that. Michael contacted me through email fairly quickly (pretty sure it was an automated email), but I was contacted. I told him what I had going on, and I know my particular situation is a car salesman's nightmare, but he said he would take a look at it. I then didn't hear from him for a little over a week, and he said apologized for the miscommunication and that he had to find the right truck. Which, confused me because I thought we already had, either way, no big deal, moving along. So, he sends me a link to one via email that I would go check out the next day. That particular truck sold the night we spoke, so the next day when I got out there, he only had two with a particular bonus tag attached. Michael was nice, straight forward about it, and that we'd need to find a different truck. He located one, which I had pulled up on my phone, but couldn't seem to find it in his system. After some digging, he located the keys, but then it was on to actually find it. We drove around for probably about 20 or so minutes before he actually found it. I'll be honest, I'm not sure how many salesmen that see my kind of deal, would drive around for 20 minutes to find a vehicle, so this was nice. Anyways, found the truck, I wasn't crazy about the color, so we spoke for a bit and I told him I'd think about it. That night, I wrote him an email telling him I had thought about it and would like to go ahead. He contacted me around 10am the next day and we spoke for a little, and had asked me to do a credit app, I agreed that was a way to move forward. After finishing the credit app, he called to tell me the payment and that he had an approval. I was first a little confused, because it was $40 more a month then what we had spoken about the night before, and not only $40 more a month, it also went from a 75 to an 84 month term. I asked him the details around it, why did it change, what was the interest rate they were basing those numbers on, etc. He stated that the dealership doesn't give him that information (if this is true, what the xxxx guys? How can a customer make an informative decision with his salesman if you can't even provide him the pertinent details). So, I said that doesn't make any sense, but sure, if you could have them call me, that would be great. Four or so hours passed, no call, so I called him. He stated he had gotten busy, and that I would hear from him that night, or early the next day. I didn't hear from him that night, and the next morning by 11am (could have been 10:30ish, not sure) still no word. So I texted him, it took a while, but then I got a text back; ""Well, the truck sold this morning."" Now, I'm a little annoyed at this point. It was a simple request, I didn't ask for anything remotely complex. I use Credit Karma to review my information each week/month and wouldn't ya know it, they reflect that the dealership hit my credit with 8 different banks. Yes, that's the number that comes after 7. I call him to figure it out, he's busy. So, I called the dealership and asked for the manager. Spoke with the manager (I think it was Jeff, I can't remember, he also said he would call me back, never did), and Michael had stated to him that he didn't have a ""commitment"" from me. Commitment, by definition, is being ""dedicated to a activity"". I don't know guys, I think a lot of people would agree that having you run my information for a particular truck to be a ""dedication"" to an activity. Here's what I think. I think Michael screwed up. I think he either sold it to a customer who he had face to face, because that was easier to do, or he took his eye off the ball and screwed up. I spoke to him later that day, and he admitted he was at fault, but stated that he couldn't do much because that was a truck with the most rebates. He did say, which made me chuckle, that he can't do much when there are ""64 employee's at the dealership"". Yeah, but you can, you could have ensured that finance called me sooner, rather than never. You could have placed the vehicle in an area and tagged it ""pending"". You could have done, what other dealerships do all of the time. It's just not a good look to run the credit (8 times, remember, that's the one that comes after 7) of a customer on a particular vehicle, and then sell said vehicle without ever informing the customer how they could ensure that wouldn't happen (e.g., deposit). 

Was Michael nice? Sure. But nice won't make the inquiries on my credit fall off. Michael did call and leave a VM two days ago, after March rebates had hit, and gave me details on a truck he found stating ""the payment is higher, but if you can swing it, it's a nice truck"".  I have filed a complaint with the BBB, for the simple fact that you cannot, nor should you, run someones credit in such a irresponsible manner. I have not (as of yet) filed a complaint with the Texas AG's office (still contemplating that). Maybe the employees need better training, maybe a different career path. Either way, this was a different experience than what I'm used to and for someone with over 14 years experience in the industry AND a dealership with such a high rating, unacceptable. ",2.6
14,"January 20, 2017","Let me preface by saying this is not a review of me buying a car at Jerrys Cadillac, rather I am writing this to highlight how Jerry's Cadillac went above and beyond to make my grandfather's 80th birthday special.  My grandfather.....his name is also Jerry.... is a huge Cadillac enthusiast and has owned a number of Cadillacs over the past 20-30 years, so for his big 8-0 I wanted to get him something that appeals to his love of Cadillacs.  I called up Jerry's Cadillac and explained that I was trying to put together a present for my grandfather with anything dealer branded (i.e. license plate frames, keychains etc.) to the receptionist Laura and she was so helpful putting together an awesome assortment of Jerrys branded merchandise which I was able to present to my grandfather.  When I showed up to pick up the gift for my grandfather I was surprised to find out they did this for me free of charge even after I insisted I had all intention to pay for this over the phone.

This dealership is a class act in my opinion and went out of their way to make someones day special who they have never even met.  Laura and team thank you for making my grandfathers 80th birthday special.  I really would give this place 10 stars if I could and I can definitively say when I am ready for my next car I am coming here.",5.0
15,"January 11, 2017","Spent over $80,000 on a pre owned vehicle at Jerry's in Weatherford and CANNOT get a sales manager, general sales manager or anyone with authority to return my calls or emails regarding a minor dent repair that they agreed to cover. Worst dealership I've ever dealt with and absolutely no after sale customer service. Everyone is great until you take delivery.  After that, good luck getting anyone to respond to you.  I'll find out how to get to the Owner or top guy in their Corporate Office.  Do yourself a favor, buy elsewhere!!!",1.0
16,"January 05, 2017","After setting an appointment for service, I asked about the availability of a courtesy car.  Was told they were available and they should have one for me.  Different story when I arrived there. Was told it was only a 30 min.  repair, and didn't qualify for a loaner.  After wandering around the showroom for an hour and a half looking at new cars, I could not believe i was never approached by any of the six salespeople in the showroom. Mt cadi was originally bought here new 11 years ago, I was a prime customer for a new  car.   Now I will be a prime customer at some other Dealership that appreciates their customers and shows it.",2.3
17,"December 30, 2016","I have grown up in a family of car sales parents (my father sold cars for 30 years), and this was the first time that I have bought a car, from someone other than my father.  The experience was better than I expected.  I have met several car salesmen during my venture, but none as good as Clay.  Clay Estes, from the Buick, GMC Sales Floor, was the second salesman that I met at Jerry's (the first one, in the Used Car Sales Department, did not show much of an interest in showing me what was available).  Clay stuck with me, regardless of the numerous no's that I had on several available vehicles that he showed me.  I was concerned that I was wasting his time, and expected that I was going to go and purchase a Nissan Altima.  When I was about ready to head over to the Nissan Dealership, Clay had me look at the 2017 Hyundai Sonata.  The car was a perfect match for what I was needing.  Clay listened and heard what I was needing and went above and beyond to find the right car.  I bought the car just hours after he brought it around for me view.  I have had great experiences with Jerry's from the past, when taking my Buick to the shop.  I am very happy to be able to continue to have the great service that I have known with Jerry's of Weatherford.  Even, the guys at Jerry's Hyundai have been incredible.  Bubba Smith and the gentleman that helped me set my phone up for the car, have been very helpful.  I highly recommend Jerry's of Weatherford, and Salesman, Clay Estes, to anyone who is searching for a car and/or service for their car.   ",5.0
18,"November 28, 2016","I purchased my 2017 Equinox almost completely all by phone.  I worked with Lee Merrill and he was honest with my throughout the entire process.  Anytime that I had a question or concern, he was quick to respond to my request as well as honest with what he thought my next move should be.  I had been researching places to trade in my car for over 3 months and Lee helped me get the best deal possible for it, even though I was upside down on my trade.  

Lee was very personable and was a joy to work with.  If you are looking to buy a new or used vehicle, I suggest Jerry's and I recommend that you ask for Lee Merrill.

21,"August 15, 2016","I was treated so good at the deal ship. Mr. Kincaid was such a well mannered sales man. Not pushy, very understanding. The other gentlemen that help me were so friendly and  willing to work with a female and treating me as an equal. I would recommend Jerry's for all of my friends who are looking for a new or used car or truck. Thank you for all of the help in getting me into my New Terrain. We love it. Have been on a road trip all ready and it was great.

Once again Thank You, I call this my retirement car!

22,"August 10, 2016","The reason I went back to Jerry's dealerships to purchase my wife a new car was all because of Rocco. Last year he helped me in purchasing a new truck, and made it so easy and painless. Rocco is honest with his customers and will exhaust all options to make them happy.

23,"August 03, 2016",I promised my daughter a car for graduation.  I was hoping to find a clean used car for her.  She had her heart set on a Camaro.  We looked at 100s of these cars until I was exhausted with the whole mess.  Everyone we looked at had issues. Nit wanting to purchase a problem car with my daughter away at college we stopped and looked at a new on.  Rocco was our sales guy.  He was helpful but not pushy.  We drove a new car and looked at options.  He did not have a yellow one on the lot.  He did some computer searches and found us one.  It was delivered a day later.  This was one of the best new car purchases I have made.  Rocco was a pleasure to deal with and to say he was helpful would be an understatement.  ,5.0

27,"July 15, 2016","PLEASE READ & BEWARE: “Come Out Our Way & Trade YOUR Way”, more like “Come Out Our Way & Trade OUR Way”.    I came in for a routine service at Jerry’s and while watching TV in the waiting area, a salesman came in to announce GMC had had some good offers on their vehicles.  After discussing the specifics a little more, I started and looking at different pricing options with the salesman.  Long story short, I decided to pursue getting into a new 2016 GMC Truck that was advertised as having a 20% discount. I was told this was “real” and that there were no gimmicks, just a whopping 20% off.  I was even introduced to Mr. Zanette, the sales manager, who corroborated what I was told.  So we started the whole process since I had a trade.  I was able to calculate my monthly payment based on the trade value I negotiated for, my trade lien, a 6.25% sales tax, and an assumed APR rate for the term I was considering.  When I got to the dealership to sign contract later that day (I took kids to waterpark), the finance guy, Paul Lewis, said “congratulations on you new purchase” and proceeded to go over the terms of the contract.  He stated he had written up the contract under a unique plan that would last for 39 months, after which I could return truck or keep paying on it.  In amazement, I told him that this sounded like a lease and that is not what I had come in for. He then said the other option was to do 78 months as opposed to the 72 month term I wanted and always buy my vehicles under.  When I did a quick back calculation to determine vehicle price based on the interest rate and term he was proposing, it resulted in approximately $5,000 more that the SUPPOSED discounted price. I realized they were trying to pull a quick
one on me and told them I didn’t want the truck anymore.  At this point the vehicle was already semi-delivered to me, I had switch out all my personal belongings, and even had the vehicle added to my OnStar account.  So I had to switch everything back to my vehicle.  The manager then asked for an explanation to why I wasn’t purchasing.  I explained that the 78 month loan would amount to a more expensive vehicle and that is not what we agreed to. I also explained that a lease, which is what they attempted to get me into first WITHOUT MY CONSENT, was not a good option to me since I drive long distances everyday.  At that point the finance manager interrupted and said there was no way to put me in the vehicle since the 20% deal was no longer valid and if he still wanted to sell the truck to me at the price agreed to, the manager would have to reduce vehicle price by approximately $5,000 (which is what I calculated). At this point I was infuriated and expressed that they had wasted my time and that of my family’s (my little girls sat at dealership for about 2 hours waiting on DUMB finance guy and Sales Manger who tried to screw me over). They were trying to sell me the truck for a higher price by hiding it behind a payment that looked correct and under the pretense that I was getting the 20% discount.  To do this, they were changing was the loan term to a longer one that amounted to an extra 6 months of payments.  The finance guy even said “it’s only 6 more months”.  In my 10 years of buy vehicles, I have never seen this type of dishonesty or corruption.  These have to be people without a conscience to be able to do what they tried to do with me. I would like to think that Jerry Durant is a respected person and that is why his dealership gets a lot of business, but I am not sure anymore.  Therefore, I suggest you start dealing with Jerry’s by working them to the best number you can.  Then call another dealership and ask them to beat Jerry’s offer.  I did this and got $1,000 more for my trade and $1,000 less on the new vehicle resulting in a lower payment for a fully loaded 2016 GMC SLT with Premium Plus Package vs. the 2015 GMC All Terrain I traded in. Just to make things clear, the truck I wanted at Jerry’s was only $800 more but would have resulted in $5,800 more if I had signed the ridiculous contract that was set up in a way to make them a huge profit and screw me out of another 6 months worth of payments.  The other dealership did hold true to the 20% discount without any hassle and I got my 72 month loan with an even lower interest rate.  No gimmicks on their part.   FYI, the other dealer I used was Classic in Granbury, Tx.  They even delivered the truck to my house.  There is only one word for Jerry’s dealership at this point: SCAMMERS!

153,"November 05, 2015"," I purchased a new Silverado Crew Cab pickup on 11-3-2015. I had searched the inventory on-line. Thus I had an idea which trucks to look at when I got to the dealership. I called in advance and talked to David Antwiler. I told him what I was looking for in a truck. Also described my truck. He was working on the deal and was to email me a quote. In the mean time I drove to the dealership to see whom I was dealing with in person. When I got to the dealership he already had a truck pulled up for me to test drive. It was basically everything I was looking for. David then started working with the manager and finance person to try and get to what I wanted in a deal. They met my wants and exceeded them.

Working with David was great. Very knowledgeable and made my experience great. I will be back to trade at Jerry's the next time I want a new Truck. David had a young lady by the name of Jessica ( I think that was her name), She was a techie and showed me all the features of my truck and helped me set every thing up. Very nice young lady. I never felt hurried while dealing with her. She took all the time I needed to learn all the new features.

I struck gold the day I called and was passed to David Antwiler on the sales floor back in 2007. Since then I won't purchase a car from anyone or at anywhere else.  David's a rarity in the car business.  He takes a very pragmatic and low pressure approach to car sales. He helps you understand the information you need to make a good decision, and then supports the decision that you make. I would recommend him as a sales person to anyone looking to buy a car. 

The Jerry's team in Weatherford is fantastic. They greet you warmly upon arrival, and do their best to make you feel welcome and at home in their dealership. The Chevy story has a nice area for the kids to eat some popcorn, and play which is a nice touch. Their finance team is top notch. They are there to help you get the best deal on your terms. They were very helpful in allowing me to select the leasing company for financing, avoiding a company I had not wanted to use. It was all handed quickly and easily. 

I live in the Denton area, and still make the trip to Jerry's in Weatherford. It's worth it. They have all the cars you could want right next door to each other so you don't need to anywhere else to look at a full line of cars. The sales teams are encouraged to cross sell to other platforms. That means you could buy a Toyota or  Hyundai there if you wanted. I couldn't recommend Jerry's any more highly. It's fantastic.

I came out to the dealership the next day (Saturday) to look at the Escalade and was very impressed with the appearance of the vehicle, the beautiful dealership showroom and the friendliness of all the employees.
Matt saw me drive up and came out to greet me immediately. He was very detailed and wanted to make sure I got everything I wanted on the new vehicle, including price. 
Matt was also competitive on the trade-in allowance and helped me secure financing better than what my credit union was offering.

We had purchased 2 other vehicles from Jerry's and were and have been  very impressed with the service over the years. We were looking to replace my 2003 Tahoe (213,000 + miles on the original engine and transmission) and we were very impressed with the new models, especially with all the new safety features.  True to his word, Robert respected us and never pressured us. As we drove away, I told my wife that Robert made me want to come back to let him sell us our vehicle. 

We test drove other brands of SUVs in the class, but nothing impressed us like the Chevrolet/GMC models. A little over a week later we returned and bought our 2015 Tahoe LTZ. Robert, his manager,  and the entire staff were extremely helpful and explained all options thoroughly.

343,"March 28, 2015","My Car Guy Rocco...ROCCS!! I went to ConsumerReports.com and researched the vehicles to decide what I wanted. I then went to EECU to get pre-approved for the amount I wanted to be approved for. I went to a local dealership and test drove the vehicle I had chosen. I loved it! When it came time to talk money the games began. What they asked for the car was way more than what they should have. Needless to say I walked out unimpressed and not willing to play their games! 

Since I was pre-approved and new what I wanted, I got on the phone and started calling other dealerships. My 4th call was to Jerry's Chevrolet. It was far from where I live but I have heard good things about Jerry's. The person that picked up the phone was Rocco. Wow what a difference from the other places I called. Rocco really new his stuff! He knew what he had in stock and was able to give me the prices right then! And they were in line with what CR said they should be! 

When I got to the dealership I was taken aback by all the cars. What ever you want...I am sure Jerry's has it! I believe he has every make and model out there with the color and features you want! Rocco said that before I make my final decision, let me drive us around and look at all of your options. This man was really gaining my trust. Plus...Jerry's allows his sales people to sell any make of car! They can go from Chevy to Buick to Cadillac...and show/sell you any car you choose! That in itself is awesome! 

Long story (not so) short, I ended up purchasing a different vehicle than what I originally wanted. I LOVE my new Buick Oncore! They sold me a car but I am sold on Jerry's and Rocco! They both have a customer for Life!

If you are looking to purchase a car, new or used, I highly recommend calling and making an appointment with Rocco at Jerry's in Weatherford! If Rocco is busy, it will be worth your time to wait a few minutes for him to help you! You will not be disappointed! The words trust and honesty are not normally used when talking about a car salesman but I trust Rocco and you will too!

They listened to me and went to work showing me options and features I was not aware of. They did not try to push me into the most expensive truck, instead they where very conservative and showed me trucks that would meet my needs and let me drive several. There was never any pressure, instead there was plenty of information. In the end I chose a Denali with the big engine. It is every thing I demand in a truck (Function) and it is beautiful (Form).

He was an excellent sales person and very genuine and sincere. He wasn't like the other dealers that contacted me. I had a lot going on with grad school, work and kids but Perry was patient and worked with me. When I went to purchase the dealership was beautiful and staff was so courteous and helpful.

467,"July 16, 2014","We LOVE John Durant! We bought our 4th and 5th vehicle from him last Saturday. We went in looking for a small car with good gas mileage for my husband to drive back and forth to work and left with a Sonic AND a Camaro! John was awesome as always. He greeted us by name when we got there and asked about the family, we sat down told him what we were looking for and he did his magic on the computer and got the keys for us to test drive the Sonic within minutes. It was perfect! 40 mpg, surprisingly roomy and had way more options than we expected. We came back and eased through the paperwork and financing. As we were about to leave he asked how I liked my 2011 Silverado, the last truck we had bought from him. I told him I was tired of driving such a big vehicle and was thinking about trading it in for something smaller and sportier. He showed me the Camaro on the showroom floor and I fell in LOVE. Needless to say after the test drive we did more paperwork and got both cars! With such good deals with the special 0% financing that was going on and a good trade in on the truck we got both payments for only a little more than the truck payment was. So HAPPY! If you need a new Chevy go see John, he is awesome!",5.0

Once we arrived we were able to browse through the Encores without being attacked by a mob of salesmen which was really nice.  When we decided on the Encore we wanted to try to buy we went inside the very spotless dealership and met our sales associate, Cody Doyle.  Cody was very nice, energetic and knowledgeable.  We immediately test drove two Encores and then the purchasing phase begin. We were not able to reach an agreement on our first choice due to the price we had seen on their website did not match the price we were given once the purchasing part began.  On their website price the Encore's were $5,000 of MSRP.  But when it came down to business we couldn't get the whole $5,000 off because we didn't belong to a particular kind of insurance company, we were told this by one of the sales manager.  This was disappointing to us because we couldn't find anywhere on their website where it stated this about being apart of a particular insurance company in order to receive the full $5,000 off.  We think it was misleading not to break down the discount if everyone wasn't eligible. But we decided to stay with this dealership and go with the convenience level instead of the leather to save about $4,000. The purchasing of this Encore went better. The deal was made.  Financing was great.  Was able to get through that part real fast.  When the Encore had been detailed and brought to us, Cody gave us a tutorial on how everything worked and made sure we didn't have any questions or concerns before we left.  Cody was fantastic.  We would certainly recommend Cody to anyone looking for a great, non-pressuring sales person.  As far as the dealership, yes we would recommend driving a fair distance for the selection.  This dealership had 60 something Encore's to choose from.  Wow!",4.8

We would certainly recommend Matt and Jerry's Cadillac to friends and family.  We only had one hiccup in the buying process.....We were actually looking at a black SRX.  We had driven it and were beginning the paperwork process when a saleslady within the dealership came and asked if Matt had the keys to the vehicle.  He told her yes that we were drawing up the contract and working the numbers and she then stated that she had already sold that vehicle that morning.  She was not apologetic to us directly but actually rather rude.  In my personal opinion it was quite unprofessional.  If a vehicle is sold it should either be taken off the lot or the keys put away where this cannot happen again.  Unfortunately, there was not another black on black one in stock so we chose a white one instead.   Matt handled himself professionally during the incident and apologized to us several times.  Overall, Matt made our buying experience a happy and easy one.

We were a little disappointed that we wouldn't be able to drive our new car, however, the dealership gave us a 2014 GMC Terrain Denali to drive until our car could be fixed. We were told to use the loaner as if it were our own car.

It took one week to fix the part on our new car but we weren't able to trade the cars for another week due to a trip and living 4 hours away from the dealership. Our salesman, Cody, kept us informed on the progress of the repair and then met us at a location and time that was convenient for us. The car trade off was very simple.

520,"May 05, 2014","I originally went to the Jerry's pre-owned dealership to look at vehicles. My mother and I looked around for about 10 minutes with no one to approach us. Finally someone came up to us and asked if he could help us. After stating what I was looking for in a vehicle, the associate lead me over to the vehicles I was interested in.  We looked around for a few minutes and we eventually found something I was semi interested in.  The associate stated some facts about the vehicle but I was not completely sold on it.  While I was discussing the features with my mother, the associate walked away to speak with another associate.  My mother and I were astonished that not only had he walked away from us but he seemed to act like I was not serious about purchasing a vehicle.  The associate did not offer to open the vehicle let alone test drive it.  Which of course I wanted to do before I purchased it.  By this point, we had had enough. We thanked the gentleman for his time and left.  Obviously, we weren't ""serious about buying a car"". We left the pre-owned and decided to try our luck at the Jerry's Chevrolet.  We drove around the lot a few times before stopping in front of the Equinoxes. I had done the research on this particular vehicle and really liked what it had to offer. We got out and started looking around.  We were out there a matter of minutes before James came out to greet us. He was very respectful and asked us our budgetary questions and what exactly I was looking for.  He gave me the facts that need to know about the vehicle and went to get the keys to two different models. He let me sit in each one and discussed all the features of one and all the upgrades of the other model.  Of course I liked the more luxurious of the two. James did not hesitate in offering me to test drive the vehicle. As we drove, he explained more about the  special features on the car and the safety features.  Needless to say, he knew his stuff.  When we returned to the dealership, my mother and I decided to wait on working on the paper work until we had talked with my father (he likes to have a say in things).  We thanked James and left the dealership.  We called my father and decided to go ahead with the purchase, about 3 miles away from the dealership.  James was quite surprised to see that we had come back so fast.  He sat us down and explained everything about the vehicle purchase process.  He made the process so simple and pleasant.  We were extremely grateful for James.  He treated me like an actual buyer and not just some stupid woman that didn't know anything about buying a car.

527,"April 29, 2014","I've never been to Jerry's Cadillac in Weatherford, I used Penfed Credit Union's car buying service.  My 1st and friendliest response was from Matt James of Jerry's.  He answered all my questions and was cordial and super helpful.  I had contacts from other Dealers, but Matt made a really good impression. I'm convinced he got me the best deal possible. I live about 2 hours drive from the dealership so Matt offered to deliver the car.  Great service!  I met Matt's family then and we will remain friends, I'm sure.  An overall great experience and I got the greatest car I've ever driven.  Thank you Matt for your attention to detail and helpfulness, it made the entire experience more enjoyable.",4.8
528,"April 29, 2014",I was very pleased with the service I received and will definitely be a repeat customer. The saleswoman went above and beyond as to see that we received the best service ever. I would highly recommend and refer customers to you. She was very thorough in making sure that I knew how everything worked and was very helpful with any questions that I had. Must say it was hands down the best buying experience I have ever had.,5.0
529,"April 28, 2014","James and the whole Jerry's Staff made this a very satisfying experience. I was not prepared to buy a new Vehicle, but had no choice. James helped me find a Really nice Truck, got me a Great Deal on it, and got a Great Appraisal for my other Truck. He did all the leg work, pushed my paperwork through and I was back with a Great Chevrolet Truck in a very small matter of time. I couldn't believe how painless the Process has become. In the past, I have been there almost all day doing all the paperwork. James got it knocked out, processed and the Truck was on the way. I came in a couple of days later to pick it up and I was on my way. James and the whole Staff did an Outstanding Job!! I highly recommend Jerry's to anybody. This is the Third Truck I have Purchased at Jerry's and every Experience there has been Exceptional.",5.0

Before contacting Jerry's, I felt like other big well known dealerships in the DFW area weren't taking me seriously because of my age, but at Jerry's they were very courteous and treated me the way customers should be treated when making such a big purchase. Most importantly to me was that they immediately made the best offer, there was no need for a price war because they showed that they wanted the sale the most.",4.8

533,"April 26, 2014","The minute you drive into Jerry's you see a very immaculate business  location.  No papers or trash blowing around the inventory.  When you enter the Sales building you are greeted in a friendly manner   We have purchased several autos and have always dealt with Michael 
Baird.  We have had nothing but good dealings with him.  Coffee is available if you want it.  He takes you to his office and we discuss what we are looking for and then he brings the vehicle to the door so you don't have to walk allover the yard to see it.  He explains the features it has.  You can test drive it if you care to,  and then we return to the office and discuss the pricing.  If you have a trade-in, they test it and have a price in just a short time.  After all things are discussed Renee Stack from the Service Department  discusses what maintenance will be offered.  She is very helpful and courteous .  Then when all the paper work is complete we met with Tone Thorstenson who explained all that was available if you wanted to finance it, or get an extended warranty.  She is a very capable person and the work she does is a credit to Jerry's.  Then Michael take you to the vehicle and explains all the features and how they work. He will make some adjustments is you want to change some things.  He does this in a very professional manner and makes sure you understand the options.  I believe he will spend all the time you need to make sure you are satisfied.  There is no ""hurry-up"" to it.

Jerry has a first class operation here and has very capable employees who are courteous and helpful.  They all have time to speak to you and answer any questions you might have. I think Michael Baird is  an asset to the Sales Force.  We  like to do business with him.

534,"April 23, 2014","I met with Scotty at our prearranged appointment time of 2 pm. I provided to him some pertinent information on a quote that another dealer had provided to me on a 2014 Chevy Lone Star Edition loaner truck. Jerry's did not have a truck in stock that matched the loaner truck so Scotty searched for a truck that was as close as possible. Jerry's did have one and he printed the info so I could compare the two trucks. He provided a price and I decided to pay a little more for the new 2014 truck over the loaner truck. 
Scotty provided the info to me that showed the value of the additional features of the new truck over the loaner truck. 
I agreed to buy at Jerry's. 
I planned to finance the truck through my credit union at 1.49%. Scotty informed me that they would look for financing at the same rate. Jerry's did find Fidelity Bank in Atlanta GA. They matched the 1.49%. 
This simplified my buying experience since everything was done at Jerry's.   
My experience was top notch with everyone I met at Jerry's.  ",4.8

537,"April 08, 2014","It all started with a phone call answered by Zach Cray.  I told him what I was looking for and the budget I had to work with.  He understood right away that this was going to be a difficult situation since the vehicle was being paid for by the company I work for.  None the less, he treated me as if I was personally buying the vehicle and made me feel very comfortable right away.  I have owned over 20 vehicles and this was by far the best experience I have ever had.  Most see buying a car as a game, hassle or nightmare.  Well, I'm happy that I didn't have to deal with any of that here.  Being that Zach had some personal matters to deal with, he put me in touch with the other manager Mike Waitkus who was equally polite and easy to deal with as Zach.  When I came in, they had a sales person by the name of Perry Hoff who helped me with the truck itself.  Perry is a very knowledgeable and friendly gentleman to deal with and would recommend him to anyone.  
Long story short, I was in and out in no time with exactly the vehicle I wanted.  In fact, I got the same truck that other dealers didn't even want to work with me on.  I am now a Jerry's customer for life.

Greg Jennings

I would send any of my family members to see Rocco with confidence. Rocco has a great personality, not pushy like many sales guys are. Rocco answered every question we had with experience and knowledge. Pricing is always an issue for most people, the dealership does not give vehicles away but they will negotiate with you a little bit and that is a plus. Not all employees mesh with the public well and Rocco made up for that when we met someone we did not care for. The selection was good, we were not restricted to new vehicles in one lot and that opens lots of opportunities since the sales staff is allowed to move from new to pre-owned vehicle inventory. When we need our next vehicle, we will turn to Jerry's first through Rocco.

Thanks Rocco.

680,"May 29, 2013","I have tried to purchase a new car from this dealership at least 10 times in the past. The salesmen, (if the even bother to talk to you), will just walk away never to be seen again. When you go inside to try to get another salesman, they vanish also. I've bought several new cars across the street where the salespeople seem to want to sell you a car.
I think this dealership is only interested in fleet sales, who knows why. I do have a friend that will only drive a Chevy. He has told me stories of how hard it is to get a salesperson to talk with him, even though he has bought at least 5 new Pick-ups from Jerry's over the years. If your willing to argue, walk around their parking lot chasing down salespeople  for a couple of hours, and have sales people just walk away from you without  a word, then hide from you the rest of the time you're there, then this is your car store. If you want a General Motors vehicle without a the  rudeness, go to Fort Worth or Dallas. ",1.8

David was going on vacation part of that week, so David Meza stepped in & helped us in his absence. They were all so friendly & helpfull.  Introduced us to the manager over service, finance, etc..

",5.0
701,"April 02, 2013","The lack of customer service and communication between employees is appalling. Our first experience was with Steve Block. We had been emailing him expressing our interest in a vehicle. We had several back and forth emails with him, but when we called he still had no idea who we were. This made us feel like we were just a sale and our names were not important. We gave the benefit of the doubt and made an appointment to drive an SUV.  When we arrived he did have the car pulled out in front waiting for us and that was greatly appreciated, however our experience went downhill from there.  We were initially insulted by the amount that was quoted for our trade-in and had to immediately walk out. To Steve’s credit he said he did a little more research and contacted us back with a little bit of a higher quote. Even though I understand that this is part of the negotiation tools sales people use, I still did appreciate the follow up.  We tried to work a deal with him but were unsuccessful. We told him that if he could get the numbers to work to please contact us. We were surprised to see that the next day the price of the vehicle was lowered to $400 BELOW what we had initially offered.  Maybe he wasn’t aware of the upcoming price decrease, but this is just one of the ways the dealership needs to improve communication between its departments. 
We did really like the vehicle therefore were willing to overlook the lack of follow-through and proactively called the dealer ourselves.  We were told that Steve wouldn’t be in until later so started the process of purchasing the vehicle from Paul to avoid missing out on the car.   Paul checked the system first to ensure that the vehicle was still available and confirmed that we could make the purchase. We were told that all we needed to send was our Driver’s license and insurance card. I faxed over the information as well as provided the contact info for the credit union that was providing the financing. We told him that we would be putting down $6,000 (and if a deposit was needed to secure the vehicle I would have assumed he would have told us and taken the payment information). He put the car in shop to check on a concern we had and told us when the vehicle would be ready. We confirmed that we would be there to sign the paperwork. He also checked in with Paul an hour before to ensure the vehicle was ready, as we live 45 min away from the dealer and had to pick up my father to drive our vehicle back.  He again verified the preferred way for the down payment, inquiring if we needed a cashiers check, money order or cash. We were told that a personal check would work and headed out to the dealership. Five minutes before our appointment time, he was contacted by Paul to say that we wouldn’t be able to buy the vehicle and that apparently it had been sold online. We had already been involved in the process for 5 hours, and confirmed the vehicle would be ready.  This was a huge waste of time for me, my husband and my father.  Paul had said the final decision was made above his pay grade, by upper level management and that the car would be sold to the online bidder rather than honor the agreement with us.  No reasonable explanation could be given and we were told to just contact the manager. 
When my husband returned home he reached out the GM, Donna, who said she would look into it further and call him right back. But she never did, she just had the used car sales manager, Dick Morgan call us back. Just to clarify we now had been passed from Steve, to Paul, to Donna, to Dick; so much for owning a customer issue. The poor excuse that was given by Dick was that it had already been sold online and just nobody knew about it. Since the online buyer had already initiated a wire for a deposit then the car would go to him.  Again, I reiterate that we would have been able to put a deposit down if we had been informed of this policy, but again are left short-handed due to a lack of communication.  Then he had the audacity to say that he couldn’t just sell the vehicle to us because it would cost him $1000. I know the costs of a wire fee and if this $1000 fee is something the dealership wrote into the contract then they should own up to the mistake and pay the $1000. The only assistance the used car manager offered was if there was something else on the lot that we wanted then he would help us make that purchase.  I’m not sure about you, but I know that there is absolutely NO WAY I would give someone who has treated me without respect, and acts without integrity $50,000. You would have to be out of your mind! Maybe we were wrong to extend Jerry’s the benefit of the doubt as much as we did. Maybe it was our fault for expecting this company to conduct business professionally. Maybe we were supposed to somehow automatically know their policies and procedures. Maybe, but probably not. I understand the world of “the customer is always right” does not exist at Jerry's and I would say that the sole responsibility of this horrible experience lies within the dealership and its team. It is my impression that the customer comes last to this group; that its sole mission statement is to make sale at any cost to the consumer. 
We sent a similar outline of this experience to the owners and management of Jerry's. We were contacted by the manager who said they would love to rectify the situation and make it right with us. We were willing to give them the opportunity to correct it. We were told that they would try and locate a similar vehicle and get back to us after the weekend. Our next correspondence was 3 weeks later. We had already purchased another vehicle by this time. Clearly, making it right wasn't top priority even after our feedback. Just another example of lack of communication, ball dropping, and horrible customer service that seems to be the way of life of Jerry's. Save yourself the trouble and go somewhere else!",1.6

I called Steve Block at Jerry’s and told him what had happened, his response was it had passed state inspection and he was sorry.
If you are going to buy a used vehicle from this dealership I would strongly advise you have it inspected at a good mechanics for any problems as I was foolish enough not to.
It appears that inspections at this dealership does not include any repairs of anything that does not require to be repaired in a timely fashion and if you are buying a well rated vehicle do not expect that it would be  in the shape it would be if you bought it from that cars dealerships.

 I took my chevy back for a paint chip which was on it when I bought the truck and a tie-down was not flush with the bed and the tires needed balanced and the inclination sensor needed to be installed. I contacted Scotty and had him make the arrangments for a loaner. I was there at 8:00 in the morning Tuesday and out of there in 15 minutes in a new truck for a loaner. I waited till 4:00 and called Scotty he said they had just finished the service department work and was taking it to the body shop. He was sorry it took so long they had to put a new tire on, and it would be late the next day. I took the loaner home he called me later and said it would take a couple of days to fix the hood right and we were looking at Thursday. I figured it would take a while to fix right. He called me Thursday about 2:00 we made arangements to meet in Ft Worth so I did not have to drive so far I live on the other side of Dallas. We meet and traded out vehicles he had washed it filled it. The Body shop did one of the best jobs on my hood I have ever had done. I have caused my fare share of body work in my day. The truck drove like a Cadillac for thousands less. I may not have time to drive to Jerrys for oil changes but it would still be a tempting deal with gas so high. The service work was second to none Scotty service after the sale was stellar to say the least. Tahnk you Jerrys for being the bets dealer =ship I have been to. ",5.0

Randy met us at the vehicle we had pulled up to and gave us a run down, got us keys for a demo and had our truck apprasied while we were gone. When we returned he was waiting for us in the parking lot. We entered the building and the first thing i saw was the Bull Pen which i hate! I figured the pressure was on, I was wrong we discussed the vehile we were looking for and he had found it at another dealer in about 5 minute we discussed the price and color and when he could have it on the lot which was on Monday afternoon. I asked about the numbers and finance and with in about 15 minutes he had us a box to clean out our trade in. when we done the finance guy was waiting on us, when we finished with him Randy had a demo gased up and ready to go for us to use until Monday when ours arrived. It was actually a very pleant 2 hours spent at the dealership and my wife a new vehicle. Go figure we were done about 6:30 pm on Saturday evening.

738,"October 03, 2012","This I hope is for the Jerrys dealerships in Weatherford, TX. We have done business with them for many many years. Actually, have some family friends working there and until now, have always had pleasant experiences. We had hell trying to get in touch with anyone and its no surprise. As soon as we pulled up we were greeted by a salesman, but as we were waking around looking we told him exactly what we were interested in and the price range we would like to be in- we walked past a truck and my husband states he really likes it- the salesman walks over looks at the tag and says it out of your range. After we look at every truck out on the lot we go on and look on the Internet- the same truck that we like and that was out of our range was listed for $5,000 less than the sticker price which put it right in our range! So as we sit and wait for financing I notice another salesman on his phone arguing with another salesman wanting a certain vehicle that want there. Then there was a salesman checking out his Facebook. Not one person acknowledged we were there besides our saleman who left us sitting to go check out other vehicles we might be interested in? After sitting for hours we decide to go grab a bite to eat- we come back only to hear there's no news and our saleman is no where to be found. The finance guy told us he would call the next morning as soon as he heard from the lender- he never calls. My husband has to call to find out they found a lender and that we new to come in and sign. We go on my lunch break- sign paper work and the finance guy keeps the contracts I signed and tells me the lender has to approve my income before he will give them to me. Then tells me out salesman is off and someone else had the truck all cleaned up, the keys, and a temp tag printed.  The salesman was out of the picture from then on- it would have been common courtesy to let us know he wouldn't be in bit someone else would be taking care if us. The finance manager told us he would call the finance company and make sure they approved the income and would get back to us the following day. Again he doesn't we called him 4 times and never heard a word. I went out there late that afternoon and when I walk in his office he tells me y'all have called a bunch today ( yet we had never heard back?) then says he isn't calling the fianance company we just have to wait it  (not what he's said the day prior). As I walk outside  he comes running out the door and says you must've good luck they just called and approved it. 2 WEEKS later I call the bank where I had a loan on the car I traded in- it still hasn't been payed off. And I only had a few grace period day before it accrued late fees. I didn't want that I had always paid on or before my due date and the only reason I didn't pay that payment is because it was included in the payoff quote they had given the dealership. I called to talk to the finance man I has delt with- they said he wouldn't be back until the following week but tried transferring me to another man. I called a minimum of 4 times throughout the day left messages each time and never received a call back. I eventually had to call and ask for someone in charge and magically I didn't get transferred to a manager but to the guy I has lefts message after message for. He told me the finance company was working on verifying employment and that they weren't paying off the vehicle until the loan went through and to give him an hour and for ME to call him back. I did- no answer left message. He never called back that day or the following morning- about 3p that next day I call back he doesn't answer I then leave another message and call the front desk again- ask for a manager or someone above him and like magic again he picks up the phone doesn't even listen to me talk and tells me they sent off a payoff check 2 days ago and that the bank should get it soon. (Yet 1 day ago it hasn't been sent yet.) The biggest problem here is the many times I asked for a manager or someone above these finance guys I got them instead. The second issue is everyone i talked to couldn't tell the truth to save their lives. Never again I would almost rather get good customer service and screwed on a loan than to deal with that again.",1.6

  The finance office was just as easy to work with as the sales staff.  I was presented with straight forward line items of vehicle costs, trade in value, interest rate, and a few other optional items.  The fastest financing I've ever had, no waiting for hours or back and forth, it's just as simple as it ought to be everywhere.  The paperwork was printed, explained, and ready for me without delay.

I was amazed that instead of having to pull out all my research and do the 'bargan basement dance' with Michael and the Sales Manager, Michael Baird instead knew his trade, he had already researched the Market Place and knew his pricing was outstanding, no joke, he was below everyone else by quite a bit.

I spoke with Ines for a mere 10 minutes just before closing and without hesitation, she had the vehicle at the front ready to look at and even stayed late to give me the opportunity to test drive. Last but not least, since Ines was working with me just after closing, she took the informaiton needed, sent me directly to the page of the website to get the financing started, and handled everything until I could get there and what remained was for me to sign the paperwork.

It was not like going to that ""old time"" dealership where you were put on the defensive the moment you walked in.  They actually made efforts to help us make the best transaction possible.  We could take all the time we needed.  Our personal schedule was busy, and that was okay.  We felt no pressure to hurry into a deal.  Randy was so laid-back  It's like he missed that ""Pushy 101"" class in car-dealer school!  He really was a pleasure to work with.

Our experience was what we have come to expect from Jerry's.  We have been customers for many years and don't even consider going elsewhere.  After the purchase of our 2005 Yukon, I was showing it off and bragging about our deal to my sister in Ft. Worth.  She came out and bought a similar Yukon shortly afterwards.

He took time to answer all my questions and explain things to me more than once so that I could clearly understand what was going on at all times. He was very polite as well. He would always answer the phone when I would call and have questions, I never had to be put on hold or wait for him to call me back.

818,"May 15, 2012","My husband and I use a rating system of 1 to 10 - with 10 being the best to rate a company/service/person.  We would rate Jerry's GMC and our Sales Rep, Kevin Sebastin, at 10+++++.  Another way we rate is whether we would return or not - by saying we would return is another way of saying ""great job"".  We bought a 2011 GMC Terrain from Jerry's in January 2011 and Kevin Sebastin was our Sales Rep then.  We were extremely happy with the dealership and Kevin's professionalism - the best experience in buying a vehicle we had ever experienced.  With that being said it is no surprise that when we decided to trade the 2011 GMC Terrain in for a 2012 GMC Terrain we automatically contacted Kevin.  Again our experience in buying our new 2012 GMC Terrain was a 10++++++.  We would definitely recommend Jerry's and if you get Kevin Sebastin as your Sales Rep you will be extremely pleased with his professionalisn in handling your purchase.  When we need to get another vehicle we most definitely will contact Kevin Sebastin.

Mr. Marc Kraus was our salesman who was extremely polite, courteous, and very knowledgeable in answering any and all questions or concerns we had.  We began our research on the internet searching for the Cadillac SRX model and optional equipment we wanted.  We received internet quotes from serveral dealerships, but Jerry's Cadillac offered the best no-haggle value available.  The internet price of the Cadillac we wanted was clearly listed and Jerry's Cadillac was offering an additional $3000.00 off, which no other dealership could match.  I called Mr. Marc Kraus before going to the dealership to make sure there wasn't a ""catch"" on the special pricing and he assured me the price you see is what you will pay.  Marc was very sincere in telling me that Jerry's has the best value on the Cadillac SRX we were looking for, so we decided to visit the dealership with every intention of purchasing the vehicle that day.  We were met by Marc after arriving at the dealership and he offered to let us take it out for a test drive while they appraised our trade-in vehicle.  We loved the SRX and decided the price was great so we purchased it that day.  Marc had the car detailed and full of gas as we signed the paperwork, making the experience that much more enjoyable.  Marc is extremely knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the Cadillac products, which allowed us to feel very comfortable asking any and all questions knowing he would be able to give us the correct answers.  I personally thanked Marc for his polite, professional attitude and felt in no way that he ever pressured us into purchasing the vehicle unlike other salesmen in the past.  I would absolutely recommend Mr. Marc Kraus to my friends and family if they ever decided to purchase a new Cadillac.  In my personal and professional opinion, Mr. Marc Kraus is an exceptional salesman and Jerry's Cadillac in Weatherford Texas should honor and acknowledge his professionalism, knowledge, talents, and abilities in his goal to provide customers with the best new Cadillac buying experience.

Thanks you Jerrry's Cadillac and a special Thank You to Mr. Marc Kraus.

859,"February 21, 2012","Kevin Sebastion has sold me and my wife over the last ten years two new GMC yUKON XLS.

I am still driving the last GMC Yukon XL that I bought bfrom Kevin Sebastion, back in 2004.

Kevin knew that vehicle was obviosly getting old so he called me last fall to inquire when I was going to replace it.

I told Kevin, that I actually needed a new car for my wife and that I would continue driving the ""old car"" until I could afford to replace it.( I am self employed and 2011, had been a little slower than usual and I have three kids in private schools etc.)

But I did need to replace my wife's vehicle and as stated above I was going to buy a used car. I also wanted a car that would be gas effecient as gas prices were establishing a new ""normal high cost"" per gallon etc..

Kevin called me several months later as he had one his customers trade in their clean Honda Civic, to purchase something larger from Kevin, so they could go visit their grand kids have something larger to drive them around in.

Once Kevin finished helping them with their new GMC, suv; he called me and told me that he had the perfect car that I had to come see.

My wife Elizabeth, is also a big fan of Kevin's so she said we needed to go right then and now etc..

Kevin did not bat an eye as we pulled up with three kids ranging in ages 8 to 14, and the 11 year old is on the autistic spectrum.  He is a great kid but could drive Mother Teresa, to drinking whiskey.

Kevin very cooly took care of the paper work and let us drive it home that evening just to make sure we could handle driving a car that size.

The car was a clean used car that made the economics so good; that to my wife Elizabeth and I thought the car was huge!

As I write this overdue thank you letter to Kevin Sebastion, I have asked him to keep his eyes out for another car that may come his way that he feels my wife and will need to make that drive from west Ft.worth, to his hang out in Weatherford.

I know that if Kevin, says ""this car is exactly what you are looking for"" I know I can bank on it.

I look forward to buying a car soon from Kevin Sebastion.

I then went back to Robert, and the paperwork process was also fast and easy.

I love that he calls me when there is a good deal and at a time he thinks I might want to trade-in for a new vehicle.  And he gives me an awesome Blessings candle with every vehicle!

Another thing I enjoy and appreciate with Jerry's is that they allow their salespeople to sell any brand they offer.  That means whether I am looking at GMC, Toyota, Hyundai, or even a used car, Kevin can still take care of me even though he is in the Buick/GMC building.  I don't have to be handed off to another salesperson.

Jerry's overall is a down to earth and comfortable place.  I never feel pressured, and the service is great as well.  It is well worth the drive both in customer service and pricing whether you live in Dallas, Ft. Worth, or West of Weatherford!

I wasn't thrilled with the price of the car...I tried several times to knock the price down a bit, but no luck.  However, this doesn't mean that the price was unfair.  I don't feel it was...just would have liked to have had the price a little lower. 

The value Jerry's placed on my trade in was unsatisfactory.  Honda (Honda of Burleson)offered me $11k for trade in or outright buy when it had 79,600 miles on it.  At 84,000, Jerry's offered me $8k tops.  I didn't trade it in.

891,"December 17, 2011","From my first visit, I met with Kevin and he was very helpful without being ""pushy.""  He located vehicles that fit my desires and allowed me to leave and think it over.  After the second visit, he took some initiative and actually obtained a vehicle fitting my specification.  Dealing was fair and honest.  While I thought my trade-ins were worth more than offered, we eventually reached agreement and completed the sale.

As part of the delivery process, he demonstrated the vechicle features and answered my question.  He also introduced me to the service department and their proceedures/features.  While I have not yet required service, I plan to return for my regular service.  The service department did an excellent job of meking the vehicle ready for delivery.  I did make an error in interpretation of the fuel gage immediately after leaving the dealership but the service department pointed out my error in a friendly manner upon my return.  I apologized for my error and I went on my way.

So far, everything has met expectations with two exceptions.  First, I'm used to having a built in Garage Door Opener Transmitter integrated into the vehicle.  Upon guestioning, Kevin explained that the Terrain does not have one.  I found my old one that came with my garage door and clipped it to the Sun Visor - problem solved.  Second, I was beginning to think the vehicle did not have a low fuel warning.  It finally did give all kinds of warnings and suggestions but the Fuel Gage indication was very close to Empty by that time and only 40 miles of fuel remaing were indicated.  When I fueled the vehicle, it took 16.3 gallons and I understand it is a 18.5 gallon tank.  Now that I know this, everything is OK but I am used to having a warning at about 1/8 to 1/4 tank indication on the gauge.

All in all dealing with Jerry's has been great so far.  I hope it does not change with the new ownership that was announced in the Fort Worth Star-Telegram the day after I took delivery

Merry Christmas!

916,"October 19, 2011","Service manger answer to Buick running a little rough at idle and gas millage dropped by about 10 miles be gal is you need to buy you gas from a Shell Station. Nor did he know the idle RPM when first asked either. He also said to drive it more and if it continues then bring it in. 
I think any gas station that has somewhere around 20 plus cars per hour purchasing gas and has gas tankers at least once a day if not more, that is a national chain would be the place to purchase gas.  A call to General Motors only said they would recommend a reputable gas station to purchase your gas from.
 After car was service (oil change, filters and tire rotation) was ready he didn't even come into the waiting room to say the car was ready like the other service managers were doing or even keep me informed as to how they were doing.  I was yelled for by the cashier.  
The cashier was nice enough to give me $10 rebate card for the 27 point inspection and said just had to fill out form on line and send in.  Next impossible to do because there is no form to fill out.  You would think if the tires were rotated and fronts balanced the tire pressures would read the same.  Only after a trip to Discount Tire that afternoon were the tire pressures balanced at 35lbs.  Oh, I guess a cap on one tire fell off after the tires were rotated.

I know this was a real bad experience this time,  But if this is an example of where their service is heading then its time to find a dealer that you can trust.

The next three cars that we purchase and there Service will be with a dealer that earns my trust, because when you are driving a car in today's traffic you have to know its safe.

When I took receipt of the vehicle Scotty went over every detail of the car and explained all about service and maintenance of the vehicle.  He even set up the bluetooth for my cell phone before I left the dealership.  I am a very satisfied customer; I love my new car and I would highly recommend Jerry's in Weatherford.

959,"June 01, 2011","I was looking for an extended cab truck last year and pulled into Jerry’s just to see about price and features in there trucks.  A very nice salesman named Bob Miller came to my assistance, I had been recently separated and was in the process of a divorce though I knew I wanted a truck I had no clue of what kind.  Bob was very professional and personable; he showed me several different Chevys and pointed out the features while being not only informative but incredibly funny.  As we went for a test drive in one of the Silverado’s, he allowed me to take a longer time than usual in getting the feel of the vehicle and deciding on whether this was for me or not.  I truly appreciated his kindness.  

In May 2011, I came on a Sunday with some friends just looking around trying to see what I believed I could afford.  I had kept Bob’s business card and so the next morning I emailed him with the vehicle VIN # ‘s and asked him to get back with me on price and if there was any discounts available.  Bob called me that day talked to me about the vehicles and I went down that night to test drive a couple.  I knew what I could afford and gave Bob my limit and I was very impressed on how he did his best to work within my limit and not only was he kind he knew his vehicles and what features would be important to me.  Not only did he get me in a Chevrolet Silverado, but he worked it so I could get into the Texas Edition which is a beautiful piece of machinery.  

I would recommend Bob Miller to anyone who wants a knowledgeable, driven, fun loving guy who will work hard to get you into the vehicle you want.  I really appreciate how hard he worked and how much patience he had dealing with someone whose credit was not very good.  I truly believe he is an honest man in a business where there are lots of dishonest individuals who are just looking for a sale. 

Everyone was wonderful at Jerry’s from Bob Miller who worked magic to get me what I wanted, to Robert in financing who helped with the additional insurance and warranty packages, to Judy who so nicely answers the phone.  Everyone was great.  I highly recommend Jerry’s Chevrolet. 

Quality and Service are big things to everyone, but having a place I can feel comfortable asking questions even after the sale is BIG.  No one wants to feel like they are just a sale or a number on a salesperson’s sheet and at Jerry’s you feel like family.  

Thanks!

After shopping around for this car for over 3 weeks he was able to get us into the car we were looking for in the price range we needed to be in where the other dealers were unable to do so. We decided May 2011 we wanted to trade our Malibu for a 2011 Camaro, which I believed would be impossible since we just bought the Malibu 1 year before. However, we went back to Scotty and again he did NOT dissapoint. We got the Camaro. Scotty is, in our opinion, the most kind and courteous sales person we have ever worked with. He will do everything possible to get you what you are looking for.

Everyone we have come into contact with at Jery's has gone above and beyond the friendliness and service we belived we should receive.

While we had the Malibu, all oil changes and maintenence work was completed there as well. The service crew are wonderful to work with as well. They all have great customer service skills, which in this day and time is sometimes hard to find.

961,"May 25, 2011","I would say this has been the best experience in purchasing a vehicle. Paul Lopez was sure to get me the best deal possible and had my best interest at heart. I told him that i disliked major dealerships because of the run-around they give and this was everything but a run-around.  Although used car salesmen generally have an infamous reputation for dishonesty, Paul displayed a great deal of personal integrity unlike many of the dealers i have dealt with in the past. I believe the greatest measure of trust and confidence a customer is able to express involves his or her likely hood for repeat business. In this spirit, i intend to recommend Paul Lopez to my family and friends.  Additionally, I will bring my wife in the next time she is in the market for a new vehicle because of Paul Lopez' outstanding service and personable method of dealing with his customers.

972,"April 22, 2011",I have just purchased my THIRD Chevy Silverado truck from Jerry's. I have never been able to deal with a dealer close to me and so I drive 40 miles one way to get my vehicles now.  David Meza was the salesman and he was the most thorough salesman I have ever seen.  He explained every control in the truck and had me try it to see if I could do it.  Their slogan:  COME OUT OUR WAY AND DEAL YOUR WAY is very true.  You tell them what you are looking for and they will escort you around the lot until you see something you like.  They will give you the most for your trade-in.  Everyone is courteous and friendly who walks in the door. It was raining the day I happen to go there.,5.0

976,"April 09, 2011","Considering I hate buying a new or used car as I feel ""exposed"" and starting from a bad position, as do many of us, this was the best car buying experience of my 50 years on the planet. Rocco made us comfortable, answered all our questions and delivered both the desired price for the new Camaro and the trade-in I wanted for my old vehicle to cement the deal.  Robert had the financial part completed in minutes, and we drove away happy in our shiny, new car.  I returned the next business day to have a small dent removed as pre-arranged, and it was magically gone in 10 minutes.  You can't ask for better service or a more caring dealership.  The bottom line is that we love the car, we love Rocco's attention to detail and we love Jerry's, and they now have earned our repeat business.  Thank you, gentlemen!",5.0
977,"April 04, 2011","The purchase of my new vehicle went extremely smoothe thanks to Scotty, our sales representative. After doing a lot of research online and visits to local dealerships, we decided to make the trip to Weatherford (a two hour drive) to visit Jerry's GM. The trip was worth it! Scotty provided us with all the details we asked for ahead of time, prompty returning our calls. When we finally met Scotty in person, we found him to be just as friendly, courteous, and professional as he had been by phone. 

We test drove several vehicles and never felt any pressure while doing so. Scotty was knowledgeable of each vehicle we drove and supplied us with answers to our questions. Because of this, our shopping, decision making and purchasing process was done with more ease. 

We will definitely be doing business again with Jerry's GM in Weatherford, Tx.

This time we were interested in trading for something appropriate for our 16 year old son to drive.  Kent introduced us to Obbie Winsett, the sales representative who would assist us throughout the shopping and purchasing process. Obbie was great as he was friendly and helpful, but never pushy.  He was readily available to answer questions and provide the key to any vehicle we chose to test drive.

Joey was able to work around our schedule and proved he would go above and beyond to make this process as painless and convenient as possible! I drove an hour and half to test drive the vehicle and to make sure it was exactly what we wanted. I spent less than 2 hours in the dealership and everything else was done over the phone! Initially we went in there wanting to use our own financing but changed our mind once they offered to beat the deal! They gave us almost $3000 more for our trade than the other 4 dealerships we previously visited and came down of the top price of the new vehicle. To top it off, Joey insisted he would bring the finance paperwork to our home along with the vehicle to close the deal just so that we would not have to drive 90 miles! In my past experiences with purchasing vehicles, I had spent hours and days stressing over pricing and financing and for the first time in my life, we found a dealership and a salesman that really cared about providing the BEST customer service possible!

There were absolutely no surprises when I went and picked up the truck.  It was exactly as Joey described.  It was all cleaned up, gassed up and ready to go as well.

989,"March 23, 2011","My husband found the truck he wanted online and started talking with Joey through their live chat feature. We couldn't make it to the dealership to actually see the vehicle until about 7p.m. but Joey was happy to stay late and let us test drive it and ask a lot questions. He also offered us a great price without having to haggle, and didnt try to pressure us to buy like many other dealerships we had visited. 

After we went to see the truck we knew we wanted it, but we needed to wait a couple of days to buy it. At first I was nervous that they might sell it to someone else, because the price was so low, but Joey guaranteed that it was ours when we were ready. I was surprised that we didnt have to sign anything saying we were going to buy it for him to hold it for us.

The day we went in to buy it, we actually got a call from another dealership we had previously visited. When we told them we had decided on a truck from Jerry's of course they tried to beat the deal we were getting, but they couldn't. They actually thought the truck was used when we told them how much we were paying for it, but it was brand new!

We made contact and went out to visit the dealership.  David was a pleasure to deal with from the get-go.  I had him sit in the Versa in different seats to check out the leg room and head room (he's a fair-sized guy) and the fact that he fit comfortably was a big selling point.  David was honest, helpful, and an all-round sweetheart.  
The dealership was a pleasure to deal with - the service department was excellent and since they kept on most of the same staff, the new Southwest Nissan is still a pleasure to deal with.

Even before we went in to dealership the salesman was made aware that I recently came out of a successful bankruptcy and gave them all the specifics and was told no problem ! After an entire tire day we were told that they would have to contact the finance co. On Monday but they were abosultly positive the deal would get done Monday ! I was told this verbally and through e-mail ! Needless to say Monday came and went and no answer ; Tuesday came and they now said we wouldn't qualify for a new vehicle and gave us some to look over and gave us the perameters that the lender wanted us to stay in ; atleast that's what they said ! Every vehicle we looked at they said no except they met the perameters ? They then came back and said we would only qualify for a 4 year old explorer which they had listed at 16k and said my payments would be 505 for 72 months with 300 down and we told them no way ! Our point is , is that we stayed in the price range of 21 to 23 k on vehicles we did like and were told they were too high and then later that they were sold or at another dealer ; plus all the deception about the financing ! We went the very next day to our local chevy dealer Lynn Smith Chevrolet and they got me approved in one day on a 2010 vehicle that met our needs and only had 10k on it plus we got gap and extended warranty and everything was so smooth - we were flat lied to , deceived and beatdown by jerrys !

He recommended I give Mike Bradbury a call..I did, and Mike found the exact vehicle I was looking for on his lot. He gave me a price on the phone that beat all other GMC dealers in the local area by FAR (before I ever mentioned to him the price range I was looking in).  I drove down, and Mike already had the vehilce pulled up.  Mike was great--no hassle, no pressure, and very knowledgable about the vehicle.  I came back the following day, the paperwork was already drawn up, and I spent no more than 15 minutes and was off the lot in my new truck.

Follow-up service was fantastic as well. They installed a spray-in bedliner, and it beats aftermarket liners hands down.

Was a little hesitant to drive up 3.5 hours for a vehicle that I had not seen.  Bruce assured me things 'would be square'.  Got up early and drove 3.5 hours and every things was as described.  No games, no changes, no surprises.  Just perfect.  

They were really friendly and extremely helpful.  Very professional crew, and none of that 'car salesman' attitude.  Straight shooters--just what I like.

We were hesitant, as we live six hours away and had dealt with several shady salesman elsewhere during our search.  However, Steven assured us he wouldn't do us wrong.  He even went above and beyond, offering to stay several hours past closing to close the deal with us that night!  Throughout our drive to Weatherford, Steven patiently fielded numerous phone calls from us, reassuring us the deal was as good as he promised.  When we arrived at Jerry's (at nearly 10pm!!) Steven was there, as promised, with the exact truck we wanted, as promised.  The paperwork, too, was as promised.  Steven kept his word - no surprises.  Several days after purchasing our new (and awesome!) truck, we even received a follow-up call from Steven to ensure we were happy with our purchase - are we ever!  Thanks to Steven's outstanding commitment to making our experience a positive one, there is no doubt we will return to him for our future vehicle purchases.  A six hour drive was well worth the outstanding service we received.  Jerry's should be proud to have salesmen like Steven Spires who really do make a difference.  Thank you, Steven!",5.0
1025,"December 28, 2010","After looking at 6 different dealerships (including Toyota, Honda, Ford, and other Cadillac places), Jerry's Cadillac not only had the best selection, but also the best personnel. We personally worked with Marc Kraus, who was very respectable, and put our interests first. Other dealerships will quickly pressure you into signing information sheets or other things, but Jerry took their time and went over all of the specs before putting out the big sales pitch. That is, we made the decision on our own time without constant pestering from a salesman. Through each step of the deal, Marc ensured that the car and the deal was right. Also, the other employees were very friendly and helpful through the rest of the purchase process. Also, the waiting room is very nice, clean, and served beverages and cookies. Putting everything together, Jerry's Cadillac is the place to go for a new car or assistance/service. I would highly recommend them to others buyers.",5.0

1031,"December 12, 2010", Both myself and my wife were very impressed with this dealership. We both have bought many vehicles over the years and we believe this to be the best experience ever purchasing any vehicle. David Tomerlin went far beyond any expectations by actually going and starting to make our 2010 GMC Acadia ready for delivery when he began washing the vehicle because the regular workers were on lunch break. The finance manager Tex made the task of the paper work very easy and fast. He also went beyond our expectations when he gave me a Jerrys cap and then gave me 3 others one for each of our two Grandsons and one for ur Son. He also made sure our oldest Grandsons cap was for Texas Tech University that he has developed a interest in for some reason even if he is only 9 yoa at this time. We would not hesitate to tell anyone looking for a new or used vehicle to go and see Jerrys no matter where you have to come from.

What I asked for was a truck to haul a medium size camper. What I was sold is a truck that will only pull the smallest camper on the market. This was not just part of my goal it was my total reason for needing a truck and I made that very clear. I was sold an extra towing package as well because of that need. True I did not have exact numbers in terms of weight of campers because I was not ready. It tells me that the salesman did not know his product and only cared about making a sale and not guiding according to the expressed needs of the customer. My truck was also equipped with Onstar, which I did not need but was also told it would be usable in the desert where I camp because it is satallite. Has a phone that also does not work in the desert. What a waste of money. The tires are so cheap that driving on gravel roads left them chewed up.

Not only did Paul respond quickly, more importantly, he treated me as a normal person without all the hype that seems to be the norm in this industry.  The dealership is 75 miles from my home.

We live in a different town and were trying to accomplish as much as possible through phone and internet communication. I had been working with another dealer and had run into a wall as far as getting timely answers. I called Jerry's and fortunately got in touch with Matt Brown. He not only answered our questions quickly but made everything so easy for us. The price and trade-in were more than fair. Mark Clark made the financing portion of the transaction painless. Matt went way beyond the norm in that he delivered the car to the mobility store that installed her hand controls and later met her there in order to pick up her trade-in.

I purchased two Nissan's from Jerry's and was ready to trade in one of them.  I was referred by my previous sales person, Daryl Clay, who no longer works at Jerry's.  Daryl referred me to call Zach. Zach was ""green"" but very friendly, I could tell that he did not have much training but was very helpful in getting the information I requested.  During my time at Jerry's my wife and I test drove a new Cadillac SRX and absolutly loved it.  My wife was sold and didn't even want to go look at the Lexus.  It was at this point during the process that we met Paul Lewis.  My experience was again great at Jerry's until this point.  

Paul Lewis was rude, wasted my time and to top it off very inconsiderate.  We were ready to purchase the Cadillac and left that day with every intention to purchase a Cadillac.  The deal could have been salvaged had I not had the experience with Paul and the follow-up from Paul.  After dealing directly with him, then on the phone and then via email I am glad we did not buy our Cadillac at Jerry's.

My husband and I drove up and down all of the local dealerships in Weatherford.  I had a reccomendation to see Pat Knieper at Jerry's Chevrolet; this was our last stop.  Mr. Knieper was not in at the time but he did give us a name of someone we could work with and trust in his absence; David Antwiler.  We spoke with Mr. Antwiler and he was great!  He has a wonderful personality; knowledgable of the vehicle; straight forward and honest; and worked with us on the best deal he could get.  Mr. Antwiler assured us that Mr. Kniper was our salesman since we did go there to see him; but that if there was anything further that he could do for us to just let him know.
We later spoke with Mr. Knieper, and he was wonderful as well.  Very eager to please; and very customer oriented.  I feel that either one of these men would bend over backwards to do whatever it took to accomodate the customer.  I had a great, and relaxing experience at Jerry's Chevrolet.  And so far I LOVE MY EQUINOX!  I will have had it for two weeks this weekend.",5.0
1071,"April 06, 2010","We've bought our share of used vehicles from other dealerships in the past.  But saw Kevin Sebastian at Jerry's upon the recommendation of a family member (and long time customer of Kevin's) when we decided to shop for a new vehicle.  Kevin gave us the best deal he could from the start.  No back and forth haggling.  No pressure.  He helped us get out of the mess (high interest, negative equity) we were in with our previous truck.  Kevin is probably the friendliest, most knowledgable and sincere salesman we have ever delt with.  

Gwen Damato in financing was just as friendly and just as good at what she does.  Having her handle our paperwork made our experience at Jerry's all the better.  Very sweet lady!  

We will be visiting Kevin and Gwen for all of our future car needs.  I would recommend Jerry's to anyone in the market for a new (or used) vehicle.

1072,"April 02, 2010",I told my wife that my recent purchase of a 2010 Malibu from Jerry's GM was no doubt my most pleasant car buying team ever - and that was for a number of reasons including the outstanding way the sales and finance staff handled the transaction. My sales person's  product knowledge was excellent and he did a great job of showing me how to get the most out of the really cool features on the Malibu. I've made a number of new car purchases over the years and always had a little second-guessing/buyers remorse afterward but can truly say that there is none of that this time around. I am extremely pleased with my new car and the buying experience was excellent. All I can say is WOW!,5.0
1073,"March 31, 2010",All of the sales personnel I dealt with were very cooperative and helpful in assisting me in making a choice on my vehicle.  They provided sufficient demo time and went overboard in locating a vehicle that met my satisfaction.  I took quite a while in deciding what vehicle I wanted to purchase - their patience and assistance in helping me make my decision was very helpful.,4.8
1074,"March 24, 2010","My experience with purchasing my Buick Enclave was wonderful!  David was super friendly with NO pressure, he really just let the car sale itself.  Even after the sale David has been there for me going over and to make certain I am happy with with my purchase.  I would highly recommend Jerrys and especially David to anyone looking to purchase a new car with no pressure and complete satisfaction!  ",4.8
1075,"March 23, 2010","Great experience! Lynn is very helpful, answers questions beyond a reasonable number. Showed the many details on these vehicles and was extremely knowledgeable of the options for the car as well as the cost thereof. Lynn was also very knowledgeable of GM Programs. He always answered the phone or returned phone calls promptly. A very friendly, competent, professional salesman. ",4.8
1076,"March 22, 2010","I have been a customer at Jerry's in Weatherford since 1996 when I first went there my credit wasnt as good as it could of been but they worked with me to get a new truck I havnt bought a new car anywere else since,I have bought eight vehicles since 1996 every buying experience was always great,I have always had Kevin Sebastian as a salesman and feel blessed on account of it he has helped my family and friends with there new and used car needs from GMC,Chevy,Nissan and even Toyota.
 I would not send friends and family to Jerry's If I didnt think they cared,Kevin seems like part of the family now,I will always shop at Jerry's Kevin alway's gets me what I want and makes the experience a pleasure.
 You owe it to yourself to give Jerry's a chance at meeting your truck or car needs ask for Kevin Sebastian and you wont leave disapointed if any way possble he will make it happen.but the service doesnt stop there when you get to financing they will work to get you the best interest rates they can and make sure you have been taking care of.
I just bought a new Camero and after only a week I ripped the bumper off in my garage I called Kevin he said bring it in and lets see how bad it is he walked me thru the process of getting it fixed and had it back to me in a week just like we talked about,as you can tell I am a very satified customer.
You get the whole package at Jerry's I live 45 minutes from weatherford and it is well worth the drive.
 Give them a try you owe it to yourself. ",5.0
1077,"March 16, 2010","David Tomerlin made this used car buying experience one of the best I have had.  David was extremely helpful, no pressure, and provided us Jerry's best deal without any hassle or haggling which I really appreciated.  Tex in finance also provided excellent service and we ended up buying a 36 month/36,000 mile extended warranty, theft deterrent protection, and wheel/tire road hazard protection from Tex as he offered us very good products for a very good price.  One item requiring repair prior to delivery wound up costing much more that anyone anticipated.  David said that Jerry's would asborb the additional cost of repairs honoring our original deal and then expedited the repair so that we could still pick up the car on the original planned delivery date, Monday, March 15, 2010.  Because of the additional repair, we did not pick up the car until late in the day and both David and Tex stayed late to ensure that we were able to take delivery on the original scheduled delivery day.  Their willingness to stay late after an already long day was very much appreciated.  Jerry's is located approximately 40 miles from my home, much further than many other metroplex car dealers, however, the few extra miles are well worth the trip to Jerry's.  I will definitely recommend Jerry's, David, and Tex to my friends and will definitely check with Jerry's first when I am ready to purchase another vehicle.",5.0
1078,"March 09, 2010","This will be the second vehicle that we have bought from Jerry's.  We usually work with John but he was out sick.  Instead, we worked with David.  He was super friendly.  We told him of our goal of trying to get a cash car and our price range.  He drove around the dealership (entire) for three times trying to find something.  On the third go round is when he found our vehicle.  He was able to work with us and get the car down to the price that we needed.  He made sure that we were completely happy with the car and also made sure that there was nothing else that he needed to do.  We were once again impressed and will definitely go there in the future for any other car purchases. :0)",5.0
1079,"March 03, 2010","I bought our first car from David in 2003 when my daughter totaled her car. He was very helpful in finding a car that fit her needs and fit our budget. In 2004 when my truck was stolen I again turned to David. He found a truck that was exactly what I needed. When my youngest daughter got married in 2005 we went to David again and helped her get a new truck. My wife then needed a new car and David helped us get a commuter car for her. When diesel prices went up I needed to get out of my truck. Since it had only been a year since we bought the last one we didn't think it would be possible to get out of it. David worked very hard and found a truck that met our needs and did not break the bank. In 2007 my son needed a car but didn't want to spend a ton of  money. David looked very hard for a couple of days, and called us when a truck had been traded in that would work great for my son. Needless to say we have a very good relationship with David. We appreciate his hard work and time. We have referred friends and family to David with several of them buying cars. We will definitely turn to him again when needed. 

Thanks David for all you do!! ",5.0

I am treated like i am the most important person in the whole world. no one talks down to anyone no matter what you drive weather its the G6 to the  Cadillac they sell. and the car rental lady was so nice and made it all so easy for me and they even treated my Mom and Dad like they were something special also. when i emaied them with the question about a small problem i was gotten back quick and the time was set up fro me to bring my car in, i was given a nice car to use for the day, and work was completed quick and took care of the problem. the only thing that could make it better would be a hot tub while you are there (just kidding)",5.0

1084,"February 20, 2010","   In 2007 I moved to the Dallas/Fort Worth area (Flower Mound) from New England. Upon arriving, I needed to purchase a new vehicle for my soon to expand family. Scouring the area for a Buick, I found just what I was looking for at Jerry's GMC/Buick in Weatherford, TX. 
   The dealership had a huge selection of Buick Enclaves in all shapes colors and sizes. I am very familiar with the car business and how hard it can be to find excellent help, but to be very honest, I was AMAZED at the skill of the employees, their knowledge, and willingness to do the right thing for my family. I worked with a Salesman named David Antwiler who provided an EXCELLENT price on the very first offer. I had already lined up financing but gave David at Jerry's the opportunity to equal or better our interest rate, and the team came in with a much more competitive offer. 
   My first experience with David in 2007 was the best car buying experience I have ever had. In Febrary of 2010 I received a letter from David talking about the very high resale value of the Buick Enclave asking if there was interest in exploring getting a new Enclave. We reviewed all of the options over the phone, and he was very candid about what would and would not make this a better deal for me and my family. He didn't want me to end up with a deal that in the end would not put me in a better position than I was in currently. Working together, we found a car that had all the right upgrades, had some excellent incentives, and finally had the right price to make this deal worth upgrading from the 2008 enclave to 2010. We sealed the deal today, and I could not be happier. 
   To close this new deal, I worked with Gwen in the Jerry's finance department to set up the new financing. Let me tell you, she was just great. In these tough economic times, it can be hard to get GOOD financing, and what they provided for options was 10 times better than what I had expected. The honesty and openness of David, Gwen and Jerry's staff is second to none. They are there to do the right thing for the customer, and they deliver. 
   I would recommend that anyone in the Dallas/Fort Worth area take a nice Saturday afternoon ride out to Jerry's GMC/Buick in Weatherford and take a look at their world class facility. Ask for David Antwiler by name, and I promise you won't leave disappointed.",5.0
1085,"February 19, 2010","Kevin Williams is very personable, took great care to make sure there was nothing wrong with our car.

I love my new Impala!!

1092,"February 13, 2010","Scotty, Saleman, and Ton, Financial Service, were extremely helpful and made me feel comfortable. This is the first time I have had this pleasant of an experience when purchasing a new vehicle. Scotty went into great detail with my sister and I on how to operate our new car before leaving. He is an outstanding salesman and I would recommend anyone to see him directly as he honestly does his best to make sure that you walk away from the deal feeling good and no thought in the back of your mind as to whether or not you could of got a better deal elsewhere. Also, the financial adviser, Ton, was exceptionally welcoming and broke down costs for us and made sure that we did not purchase any additional services that were unnecessary for our circumstances. Both my sister and I have purchased several cars throughout the years through different dealerships. We have gone as far as not buying a car from the city we currently live in and will actually go to another dealership in another city and have them bring the car to their dealership so that we can turn around and drive it back to Abilene. We are very picky people and do thorough research prior to even walking onto a car dealership's lot to determine if the dealership is ""jacking"" around with us. This is the first dealership that I can honestly say has earned our business in the future. I have never said that about any previous dealerships that we have purchase vehicles from and have given them less than favorable reviews for their business practices. Scotty and Ton both are very valuable people to Jerry's and I do believe the dealership is very lucky to have such open and honest people that you can enjoy purchasing a vehicle, because it is a big purchase that people do not take lightly in buying and it helps knowing that there are people out there that are interested in more than just the dollars.
