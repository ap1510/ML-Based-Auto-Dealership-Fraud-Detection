So, my military son hit a pot hole and punctured his tire on the edge where it was irreparable. Took it to Hoy service, he had a tire and wheel policy to cover repairs. Josh in service advised him that the warranty company, Fidelity Warranty, denied the claim because the customer drove on the tire flat and abused the tire. After talking to my son, he did not know who the warranty company was or why it was declined. He called the dealership where he purchased the car and found out it was US warranty not Fidelity. The Adviser had flat out lied! I even talked to the adviser and he told me the same thing! The claim was denied due to customer abuse. Well if there is no contract with Fidelity the conversation would be ""whats the VIN number, you have no contract"" end of discussion. How do I know? I am a veteran adviser. I deal with these companies every day! So I asked for the service manager and got Willie who said he was the assistant to the service manager. (according to the web site he is the service manager) More Lies!  I informed him who the warranty company was and he said he was not set up to deal with them. (Half truth!) The warranty company said they could take the claim over the phone and pay it in minutes. During this time the tech came into the office and exclaimed ""are these idiots still arguing over the warranty?"" Not realizing he was standing next to my son! So after 3 hours from the time my son arrived, the claim was paid and the car released and my son left. Never to return. This should have been an easy warranty claim. I have no idea whats going on. I only know they tried to charge my son $226 for a repair covered by tire warranty.!",1.0
1,"September 15, 2018","It took 6 hours to buy a new car at HOY VW,  4 hours was waiting for finance man even though I already had arranged financing myself.  Car was never even washed let alone looked at in that time.  After I got home, I noticed that three of the tires were very low on air pressure at about 22lbs.  They have absolutely no respect for your time let alone checking the car out before delivery",2.0
