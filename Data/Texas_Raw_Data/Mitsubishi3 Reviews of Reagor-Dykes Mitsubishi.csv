0,"June 28, 2018",Wasn’t looking at buying a new truck but found my dream truck! Brandon Speer made the experience extremely pleasant and easy! I didn’t leave wondering if I did the right thing like I did when I bought my last truck from Gene Messer Kia. I love my new truck and I feel like I made a friend while buying it! If you’re looking for a new vehicle go see Brandon Speer at Reagor Dykes Mitsubishi! ,5.0
