0,"August 03, 2019","Took my Challenger in on 7/23/19 because headlamps would go on and off. Informed the tech upon check in that headlamps are good and to check for short somewhere. He comes back a few minutes later trying to sell me 2 headlamps at $300+ dollars each. Then when he saw I was not going for it, tried to say only one. Long story short the problem was a relay that cost $10.",1.0
1,"April 26, 2018","Purchased new ram 3500 2 days before Harvey hit in August 2017. I brought truck in April 2018 due to it having smoke coming out from under the hood resulting from an issue with the water pump at 30,000 miles. Service advisor Tim was very unhelpful and had not commmunicated any information pertaining to the issue, again I researched the problem that I was having and found that there were issues with water pump on these rams. So I ended up trading my vehicle in for a 2018 1500 and added leather upholstery, bedliner, and fender flares. Two weeks later I am still without my truck after being told that my vehicle would only be in shop for about 5 days being picked up last Wednesday and still a week later I am without a truck and no communication from my sales person Shane nor a friendly follow up call from Sales manager Mr. Moore whom promised me he would reach back out to me after I addressed my concerns and promised me that he would have me in something for the meanwhile if my vehicle was not ready on yesterday. I finally decided to stop by and see what is really going on and speak to another Sales manager after I requested the General Manager’s contact info. I again addressed my issue and for whatever reason they did not hand over the General Manager’s contact information but told me they would relay the message to him. I find it disturbing that autonation allows this type of customer service with so much competition out in the auto industry. Never again will I bring my business nor will I steer anyone to this dealership. ",1.4
2,"October 04, 2017","This has been the worst car buying experience of my adult life. I would be sure and check your contract and have your own financing when dealing with this dealership. The young man was nice but I would not recommend him in the future. I was asked to sign the estimate showing sales tax etc. On th estimate I was being charged for wheel locks which were not on car and window tint which is not on the car. 
The vehicle is 2015 and marked up by at least 5-6k dollars. This is not how you do business especially after a natural disaster. Because I need a vehicle I went ahead and bought it. I will not recommend this dealership in the future not even to my worst enemy.",2.2
3,"January 18, 2017","promised my car by a certain time. they took TWO DAYS LONGER! Promised my truck yesterday and today at 2 it's still in servicE!!!! last time my truck ""had to bring a part from DALLAS"" LIED about that 
HORRIBLE GO SOMEWHERE ELSE and they put you on HOLD FOREVER",1.0
4,"January 16, 2016","For starters if I could give their service department and the other managers I talked to a Z..For Zero then I would. My visit by for was the WORSE EVER IN LIFE.
It all started by bring my car in for a diagnosis. Here I thought it would better to bring my Dodge Charger to them seeing as though they work on the cars 24/7 365, But boy was I wrong. Well my car started to heat up once started to over heat once we put it in On status, keep in mind WE DID NOT START THE CAR, in which we turn it right back off and towed it to this horrible dealership. Once we got there we were told for a diagnosis that it would take over a week due to The Thanksgiving Holiday so we left the car with them.

Now maybe a few days later I get a text stating that they ran a few test and JUST HAD TO REMOVE MY CYLINDER HEADS..(Keep in mind I AM A FEMALE SO I""M LIKE HUH) so me being me I called the service department and asked for the lady that was my service agent( keep in mind service agents helping you or not working on the car they just pass you what was told to them). Now I ask ROBIN why did that have to be done when all I asked for was a diagnostic to tell my why my car was getting hot and the oil and water mixing. She goes on to say that ""They don't know why the oil and water is mixed and the only way they can find out why and see if it cause damage is to remove the heads."" I asked if you removed the heads then what do they do and where are they? She then tells me that"" The heads are only to small parts on top of the motor that MUST be removed to see damage and the reason why it's mixing., so i said okay if you do that then how much is it so she tells me 1,100 and something. Now I said that's a lot for a diagnostic and she tells me that just to find out Why the oil and water is mixing.

Now I know this might sound crazy but NEVER ONCE did she tell me they Already did a test and it STATED THAT MY OIL COOLER WENT OUT AND THAT WAS WHY IT WAS MIXING(Oil Coolers for my car only cost 200 and something for the part). After they basically TORN MY CAR UP they tell me 4,500 to fix the oil cooler, flush the hoses, and put my car together or I can pay 8,000 for a new motor( keep in mind there was NOTHING WRONG WITH MY MOTOR WHEN THEY GOT IT).

After they told me all of this I spoke with her manager and explained everything to him and he basically told me that I was lying and when I asked for the reports on the diagnostic test he told me I could not get them. I then asked for the GM name and number and he basically told me he stands behind the manager on everything. I had to pay 800 to get my car back.

Then for the final KICK IN THE BUTT.. When my husband looks in the car i had oil all in my truck from them completely pulling things apart that wasn't even supposed to be pulled apart all in my trunk. ALSO the WORKER THAT BROKE LITTLE PIECES WITHIN PARTS TELLS MY HUSBAND I BET IF YOU SELL HER RIMS THEN YOU CAN TRY TO FIX THE CAR BACK AND THEN LOL.....

When I took my vehicle to another shop to see what I could savage they told me it was a lost cause because too much is messed up and it would take over 10,000 to fix it back. Or 5,000 for a new motor then I would have to buy all the fans and parts around it due to the mechanic pulling smaller parts out of place. Also the hoses and fluids which would run up to a Bigger Ticket. Now I have whole car in my garage that I'm paying for but can't drive.

This place by far is the WORSE WORSE WORSE place to EVER GO and Once I find a good Lawyer I will try to Sue the crap out of. I don't see how they deal with these type of cars everyday but act and lie to people about things. Companies of this caliber should be shut down and ever be able to make any kind of money.

So BUYER'S BEWARE DO NOT BRING YOUR CAR TO BE FIXED OR BUY A CAR FROM THEM. UNLESS YOU WANT TO GET ROBBED WITH A SMILE AND RUDENESS.",1.0
5,"January 06, 2016","I MET WITH CHRIS IN SALES, VERNON IN FINANICE AND KEITH IN OPERATIONS. OVERALL I WOULD GIVE THEM FIVE STARS! THEY MADE THIS PROCESS EASY BY ACTUALLY WORKING WITH YOU WHATEVER YOUR SITUATION MAY BE.

IT'S HONESTLY WORTH YOUR TIME TO BE TREATED FAIRLY. I HAD DEALT WITH 6 DEALERSHIPS BEFORE GOING TO ALLEN SAMUELS  THAT ALL SAID NO AFTER CHECKING MY CREDIT. CHRIS IN SALES ACTUALLY WANTED TO MAKE THIS WORK FOR ME. VERNON IS WELL KNOWLEDGABLE ABOUT  YOUR FINANCIAL NEEDS TO MAKE A DEAL WORK FOR YOU. KEITH JUST MAKES YOU FEEL AT HOME. 

I WILL RECOMMEND THESE GUYS TIME AND TIME AGAIN.

6,"May 01, 2015",I took my jeep there three times to get fixed. They so called did a reflash on the tray and every time it went back to the same problem. I tried to tell them it's still hesitating and kerning but they do the same reflash every time. I'm really nervous the tray is going go completely out so I'll be taking my jeep somewhere  else. ,1.2

9,"March 19, 2013","One of the finest dealerships I've seriously had the pleasure of contacting! Doing some business out there and decided to look and test drive some cars and I was so pleased with how respectful and friendly there are. If you're in the Houston area, Allen Samuels is the place to go!",5.0
10,"March 07, 2013","So fortunate to find a dealership with the new Charger. Loved this car for as long as I can remember - reliable, great on gas, American made and very affordable. Perfect muscle car and safe enough for the family!",5.0
11,"May 21, 2012","We bought a car here and were lied to left and right.  half truths and tales of services performed and when it came down to double checking with the service department... nothing was ever done to the car.  I specifically asked about the indicator light during the test drive and the salesman said ""it's nothing, it's just on... oh look now it's off.""  come to find the light was on because the car was 450 miles over-do for an oil change.  When I called about it he changed his story twice about how many miles were driven as I revealed that I had already done my research and knew the dealership had driven it 3000 miles since they took possession.  Twisted stories and white lies.  DON'T buy here, and if you DO double check EVERYTHING!",2.6
12,"April 07, 2012","After we did our financing on our own they refused to sell us a car. Never in my life have I heard of such a thing & it makes no sense to me. We were approved through them, but for a new car at a much higher interest rate. We went to our local credit union, got approved for the used car we wanted (at 6%), went into buy it & they told us they wouldn't sell us the used car. VERY weird, and I can not figure out their angle, but it was really upsetting. ",1.5
13,"September 25, 2011","With oil changes this cheap ($9.99), there is no reason to not stop on by Allen Samuels!! They have a huge selection of Dodges, new and old!! ",5.0
14,"May 20, 2011","I have purchased several new cars and have never seen a lack of professionalism and honesty to this degree, and thats pretty bad considering the stereotype of dealerships to begin with. We were cash buyers with a paid for trade-in and still they played every trick in the book. The waiting games, the copy machine invoice trick, cuttin off the bottom and tops of paper and so on.  They located us a vehicle from out of state and promised a delivery date, not only did it not show then it never showed, the excuses were laughable and insulting.  Every promise made to us was broken and we wasted a tremendous amount of time, energy and sanity.  I would not send my ex-wife here.",1.8
15,"March 11, 2010","I bought a car from these guys in 2006 it took all day for us to decide what was right for us as we had no idea and they were very patient letting us test drive 2 cars twice untill we dicided. They even gave us sodas and fajuta tacos,we were there over 6 hours picking what was right for us. 2 days after we bought the used car we noticed it had missing seat belt covers on the floor and they still replaced them. The financing went ok I wish they had less paper work but I guess that's just how it is. They were also very helpfull 6 months after helping me get a scratched bumper repainted at their cost ($50 cheapperthan I was quoted) and helping me find after market runnungboards also cheapper than what I found on my own. Now that my family has grown we have out grown that car I whent there yesterday and was quoted 2500 higher on trade in than carmax we haven't picked anything out but they will look for what I need based on what I told them and call me as soon as something comes up. Well I received a call this morning at 9 they have 2 minivans I can go look at this afternoon after work my wife told me if I complain to BBB everytime I'm treated unfaily I should also let them know who I think is doing good I'm also writing to them after I get the next car to make sure it wasn't only that sales team from 3 years ago the sales guy was some kind of maneger now and he didn't attend us yesterday ",4.8
16,"March 22, 2005","Like any car dealership, they are only looking out for them selves, not the customer.  These people pissed me off so bad that we walked out.   As they saw that we got in our car they realized that we really were leaving.  Well, the all mighty dollar drives these guys.  They came out and wanted to do business and finally agreed to the terms we wanted all at the expense of my health.  As of the time of this writing they just called to delay the delivery of the car. I gave them a deadline and we'll see.  I'll update you.3-22-05 UPDATE!!Well after I told them that there is no excuse for them not to have the car ready and they have 11 hours to get it done, they did it in half the time.  The car was even better than the one we agreed upon. We agreed on a $25k car with discount bringing it down to $23k.  What we got was a $28k for $23k.   I guess I would go back to them since they know that they can't roll over me and BS me.",2.0
