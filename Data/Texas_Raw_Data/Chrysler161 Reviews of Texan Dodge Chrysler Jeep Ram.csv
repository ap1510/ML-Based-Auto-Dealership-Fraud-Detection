7,"May 06, 2020","My daughter’s dream car was a Jeep Grand Cherokee. We looked for several weeks until a mint condition 2018 with 8K miles on it popped up on their website. They immediately pulled it for us and Fransisco was waiting for us when we arrived. The car was everything she wanted and the price was much better than cars with much more wear and tear. He was compassionate and met all our needs, I learned he loved to go to the movies.

Fast forward to this week... I had been looking at Rubicons for awhile, mind you, my daughters might have inspired me a bit. I had some very specific requirements, one of which was a manual transmission (no one seems to sell these anymore) I knew that there were none in Texas, so I wasn’t expecting much, when I arrived he had two print outs of models that were close. I added a few features, and he found my dream Wrangler. Needles to say I am now a proud Jeep owner and Fransisco made it happen. Kudos to him. I bought this Wrangler because we created a friendship, that is important to us Texans. With all that is going on today, if you need a vehicle, ask for him.

8,"April 23, 2020","I am really disappointed with this dealership. Yesterday I purchased a Ram 1500 from Texan Dodge, including giving them a deposit. I was told the truck was in tip-top condition and that I could drive the truck away that night. Things all changed after they had my deposit, though.

After the deal was agreed on and they had my money, I was told that I could take the truck the next day. What? I'd negotiated in good faith that I could have the truck immediately. Oh well, it's just one night.

The next morning came and there was no contact from the dealership. So I call my sales guy, Bashar Naghi. No answer. So I text him. No answer. After hours of this, I finally get a call back saying I can't have the truck because it needs servicing. W.T.F. I was told the truck was in perfect condition! And I needed a truck that day, not at some distant time.

I'm really angry that Texan Dodge dealership makes promises to its customers and once it has our money it does whatever it wants. Buyer Beware!

Shop elsewhere!",1.0
9,"April 19, 2020","This purchase was a want not a need. When they couldn’t make the deal that we wanted work. The salesperson and finance person tried to use your truck going to break , transmission going to go out soon , etc. then as we were leaving the salesperson said the could get the deal done on other truck . My husband and I didn’t like the body style and explained that when he first showed us the truck. Which means he didn’t listen to any of what we told him and just think I was a loyal customer the truck I was trading in I got from them. I will never go back. And since he did give us his business card but I remembered the nickname on it",1.0
10,"April 09, 2020","It’s been over a month since I purchased my vehicle and they have yet to pay it off. I’m still receiving payments from my other vehicle. And when I called to try and find out the problem, they gave me the run around. And when I finally get the situation fixed, they fail to refund the money that I’ve paid on my old vehicle in the time they stated. Texan Dodge in Humble has always been crap. I just figured since they completely changed their staff that it might be better. NOPE!! Bunch of clowns who are incapable of doing their job.",1.0

12,"March 24, 2020","Purchased used truck 2Mar20. The purchase experience was average BUT- the service after I made the purchase was 
atrocious!
On the way home from the dealership I noted the radio antenna was missing. I called
the salesman but didn't get a return call for 3 days. Meanwhile
I called back the next day and spoke to a sales manager, Moises, who informed me that
radio antennas are removed for washing, had inadvertently not been reinstalled, that
he would have it found and overnight mailed to me. About 5 days later, I called Moises
back to check on the antenna. After some discussion he said he had NOT told me he
would immediately mail it but that he would ORDER it-basically calling me a liar. When
I raised my voice trying to get him to understand an address I was trying to give him
 (I stated 'nine, niner, the number after eight!' since he kept hearing '1'), he got
 overly sensitive and hung up on me!
I then called back the dealer and asked to speak to a senior manager. The one I was
refered to was supposedly 'out' and a callback request placed on his desk. I have yet to
receive a return call. 
The next day a dealer service person called to get my shipping address and indicated
the antenna would be overnight mailed that day. A week later, no antenna had
arrived.
I called the dealership again on 17Mar. Was referred to a Mr. Lee who listened to my
problem, said he would take care of it. Shortly later a William Vaca, apparently
a 'new sales director', called me back and told me the part was shipped and would be at
my address by 08 pm. Did NOT happen! 
Called Mr. Lee at 09 am on 18Mar, who said he would look into it, get a tracking Nr.
from UPS and call me back shortly. Did NOT happen-as of 0130 pm. Called Mr. Lee about
 8 pm-message machine-informed him I still had not received the part OR 
any contact from Texan dodge.
On 19MAr, called Mr. Vaca about 330 pm, got message machine, left message that there
was still no shipment received or contact from Texan dodge.
On 20 Mar about 9pm got on Texan website and had 'chat' with Amanda-briefly discussed
lack of service by mgmt and was told a sr. mgr would contact me 'asap'. As of 24Mar this has NOT happened.",1.0
13,"March 11, 2020",This dealership service dept is horrible. They don't listen to what you want and they turn service away even when there's ample amount of time to complete the service. You can ask for a manager all you want they won't get them for you and the girl at the front desk knows ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!! Try calling by phone.. IF they answer they won't transfer you to the correct person or they get it right but the person you're trying to get in touch with won't answer and I knew she was available because I hung up and went inside and asked for the same person and when the girl at the front desk called she picked up. I needed to speak with Vanessa Lianas and she's who I asked for but I had to go into the dealership to get what I needed because she wouldn't answer the phone then she wouldn't even come to the front to speak with me. I had to speak with her thru the girl at the front desk and her calling back and forth. I bought a oil change package from them but I REFUSE to step foot back into this place so I got a refund.,1.0

35,"May 21, 2019","I was stopped at a stop light when the driver next to me motioned to me. I rolled down the window; he informed me the passenger rear tire was flat. I thank him and went to Texan Dodge immediately. Chandler greeted me warmly and professionally and took my keys. As is always the case, I had a list of things I was hoping to accomplish and did not appreciate having to wait on a flat tire. Chandler had the tire fixed and I was back on the road in 30 minutes or so. My hat is off to Chandler and his ability to get the tire fixed and me back on the road in good time.
Later that morning, I puzzled over the fact my ""low-tire-idiot-light"" had not given me warning about the flat time. I returned to the dealership and went directly to Collin Eady and expressed my concern. He took the pickup back to the shop, the senors for the passenger side were not working properly. I had the sensors replaced that very same day and was ready to take off to Omaha the next day. I am extremely satisfied and impressed with Texan Dodge of Humble.  ",5.0

37,"May 13, 2019","When my Dodge Ram was way-laid by bad gas, the timing could not have been worse. I was in the midst of preparing Mother's funeral. Collin Eady, the service representative, sensed my need to focus on something other than the truck and took control. He worked with the insurance company and made arrangements for appraisals and the proper parts. He called me every two days with an update and assured me everything was getting fixed. His demeanor and confidence helped me let the truck get fixed while I tended to other business at hand. I would have never thought I would be too consumed with something to have to let a stranger take control, like I did with this repair. I have the truck now for ten days or so--it runs beautifully.",5.0

43,"April 08, 2019","DO NOT BUY HERE AT ALL!!!! 
They have god awful financing! They also royally messed up my title & registration!  First I told them my van needed to be titled & registered in Oregon... apparently they used my address but put Texas as the state! I've been waiting for my registration & plates for 4 months!!!! I've called every month & they keep saying they are working on it... so I finally broke down & called the Oregon DMV & asked what they needed to approve my title & registration. They said they never got anything for my vehicles VIN number.  So then I called USAA who I insured under.  They also didn't have the title or any paperwork for the sale... so I called the Texas DMV... they had the vehicle titled but here's the biggest shocker... THE TITLE ISNT IN MY NAME!!!! 

So now I'm at the DMV trying to figure out who owns my van that I've been paying on & why this dealer thought when I paid them Oregon tax & registration that I was registering in Texas & have my Oregon address all over the paperwork I signed! 

I was just staying in Texas with my mom for the winter & well now I'm stuck here since I can't drive my new van up to Oregon!!!!!",1.6
44,"April 03, 2019","Advertised internet price is not what you get when you go here. $35,513 +TTL is what they have for 2019 Grand Cherokee. However, when I ask the manager to honor that price, he says that’s BEFORE the extra add-on stuff. Really? Nowhere in the online add does it say "" TTL+Addons""! 
They wanted $40222 drive off, and refused to honor their online advertised price. I have pictures of their online price along with picture of their 40222 offer. 
 My math is pretty solid (Engineer) and TTL on $35,513 does NOT equal $40,222!!!

50,"December 12, 2018","Trey Wilmore is one of the service advisors and I was very dissatisfied with my care and service at Texan Dodge, Humble.  I had warranty work completed which require them to open the dash. They did do the warranty work fine but putting the dash back together left me with the  air conditioning flow not correct.  The initial service helper said they would have to talk to the service manager.  told me they did not do this. I spoke to the service manager and he claimed they did not work on it and I would have to schedule a service to correct it.  Not sure why I would have to pay for a service when it was working fine before the recall maintenance.

I had also purchased a three package for car wash, oil change and tire rotation package.  The first change the came and informed me of the vehicle requiring a hundred thousand tune up and cost me over $1,000.00.  The second time I went for the oil change, tire rotation and wash, I was informed of service required near $860.00.  My last stop for oil change, tire rotation and wash resulted in a recommendation for my engine tune up again, along with fluids changed for $1059.98; cabin filter change, wipers, and tire balance for $164.90; tune rec. 100k, fuel injection, and engine decarb for $450.00; ending total $1804.80. I personally changed the cabin filter earlier fall, I had two new tires and a alignment and they told me it was required again.

This sale pressure is like when I was working retail and the manager told me to work at getting a $100.00 dollar additional basket. Worse thing is Texan Dodge just completed my engine tune up.",2.4

69,"April 04, 2017","Dishonest Bait and Switch

Dealer advertised a good deal for a renegade online. When calling to ask about it, was explained that price is only with a bunch of rebates (of which nobody probably qualifies for all of). This in of itself seems like shady bait and switch tactics to me, but whatever, we say ok, not interested, and going to work a deal with another dealer.
Chris the salesman says ""if I honor the internet price will you come up here"". As it's an hour drive and we were in another dealer at the time we reconfirmed the final price. This was confirmed, a verbal deal was made.
While driving up, we re-called to double check, this is the price, no extra fees, add ons, etc? Yes, that's the final price he said.
Drive an hour up there and after a bunch of waiting and usual car sales delays, all of a sudden price is around $2k more and nothing they can do to lower. Hours wasted.
The dishonesty and being lied to repeatedly is a new low for me and car sales. I'd caution anyone buying a car here to expect to be told a different price than what you are first quoted.",1.0

85,"September 27, 2016","I purchased a used 2015 Dodge Rebel Ram a few weeks ago.  Upon inspecting the truck everything was good.  After doing all the paperwork I was given one key to the truck.  I asked where the other key was and was told by Benny Blanco the sales agent that I would be getting the other key in a day or two.  After learning that I was lied to and that I was not going to be getting a second key I stormed into the dealership demanding the key that I was promised.  I was then directed to Brett Campbell (sales manager) another liar.  I was loud with my frustration toward Brett of being lied to.  After I told Brett what I paid for the truck he informed me that I would get a refund for the cost of the missing key.  He informed Benny to try and get the key first from the previous owner and if they could not reach out to the owner to get the key they would give me a refund so I can get another key programmed.  I told them great now we are talking the same language.  I said thanks I will see you in a couple of weeks.  Two weeks has passed now I am being told by Brett and Benny that I was never told that I would get a refund.  They are both liars - don't believe anything anyone says at Texan Dodge.  Never believe a car salesman.  Lesson learned - I will never do business with this dealership again - I will also tell everyone I know to stay away from Texan Dodge in Humble, TX.

I called back and said he I was holding for someone and I got hung up on and her response was hold on, no apology no customer service skills whatsoever.  I've never heard the Receptionist say the name of the company when I call, just how can I help you with an attitude.  I asked to speak to a manager and she said I need to know what's this about so he can decide if he want to come to the phone or not.  I was finally able to get thru to Diane who checked on it and told me my plates and tags would be in Tuesday August 23rd, she claims they were backed up.  I asked about my title and she said oh you have to get that from the previous owner.  What?? Hello, I purchased the car from your dealership why do I have to locate the previous owner to get the title, you guys should have that.  Now I'm being told you should get it in the mail in 6-8 weeks.  When I mentioned it has been over 6 weeks, I was told oh well you should receive it any day, just wait for it.

I have pretty decent credit, and as soon as I questioned a higher than expected interest rate, he became very rude and unhelpful. This rude behavior got even worse when we did not want to buy the third party extended warranty and all the extra BS warranties they sell. It wasn't personal, we just couldn't afford them. Very cocky an arrogant. Nothing would delight me more than to see this dealership fail. Most recently, less than 1000 miles on New Jeep Wrangler hardtop and the roof leaks when it rains!!!!

130,"September 04, 2015","Where to begin...yes, they are that bad! Purchased a car in Jan 2015 from Texan Dodge. The sales rep was very good, finance was not bad, but then I went for my first service...it went downhill from there. So as not to be long-winded, I have been in 5 times this year and each time I have called and scheduled a service appointment in advance. Each time I arrived to the dealership they wouldn't have record of my appointment...each time I had to pull out my phone and show the service advisor the confirmation email they sent me concerning my appointment. 
Today (9/4/15) I showed up for my appointment (oil change/tire rotation/warranty repair of the alternator) and yet again, no record of my appointment. Once that was sorted out, I went to the cashiers desk to sign up for their complementary shuttle service to get to work. Filled out the information and once I completed it the cashier decides to tell me that the shuttle driver is on vacation and she doesn't even know if the shuttle is running today...this after she watched me fill out all my information...are you serious?! After a discussion with the Service Mgr, he decided it would be best if he gave me a ride to work (smart move)! 
Fast forward 4 hrs, still haven't heard a peep from the dealership...so I decide to call and check the status of my vehicle. 13 phone calls over 1.5 hrs later...after repeatedly being hung up on my the receptionist or being blindly transferred to someones voice mail or being sent to some centralized call center I gave up and just asked a co-worker for a ride to the dealership. 
The service advisor calls me as we pull into the dealership...

Let's just say that Texan Dodge has no regard for customer service or doing what is right. xxxx, they cant even answer a xxxx phone.

140,"August 31, 2013","Cold called the dealership on Thursday August 29 2013 for general information about ordering a truck after a bad experience at Spring Dodge the week prior and spoke with Aaron Simmons. I had never heard of Texan Dodge nor had I done any research at all about them Just googled for closest Dodge dealership with expectation of calling with a few quick questions but turned into a conversation with Aaron . He searched inventory then had Adam Pace return my call to tell me what they had in stock, I visited later that day because I was impressed and comfortable with phone presentation of both sales guys. Drove a 2014 Laramie Crew Cab 4x4 within 10 minutes of arrival to dealership that I was very pleased with but told Adam I wanted the best possible deal I could get on a vehicle so he directed me to a late build 2013 truck with everything I requested as options. After finding the truck I wanted the pricing process and finance was a breeze. Geraldo had me in and out of finance very quickly and was thorough with all my finance options, extended warranties and service plans etc. No pressure at all for extra add ons or services I wasn't interested in. He came back with great finance rates and several options for me to choose from, Geraldo got me rates over 1/2 less than what Spring Dodge claimed was the best they could offer the previous week. May not sound like much but Geraldo's rates will save me 7-8k over the life of my loan vs the so called ""best rates"" from Spring Dodge. I was also impressed with the great pricing I recieved without having to haggle for endless hours, I was in and out driving home in my new truck within 3 hours and had no intention on buying that day but very happy I did. Rebecca went over all the options and electronics setting the truck up for my personal preference and making sure I knew how to operate everything.

The price beat the so called ""True Price"" other dealers boast about and the whole process was best car buying pleasure I have had since 2011. Today I had to return to drop off extra keys for my trade in and the general sales manager David Premazon went over every detail of my contract with me to make sure I was pleased with the deal and just to double check all rebates and incentives were included in deal which they were. I had a few questions and he personally explained everything to me in great detail making sure that I fully understood all details and was very happy with the deal which I was. I live 5 minutes from Spring Dodge and have been a customer of theirs since 2002 but since Autonation took over I plan on driving past them to get to Texan Dodge for all my Ram Trucks and Jeeps, already plan on buying my next Laramie Limited from them within the next year.  I would highly recommend anyone looking to buy a vehicle give Texan Dodge first shot at your business and you will see too that buying a vehicle can be a painless and even pleasurable experience with these guys. No matter where you live they are worth the drive, especially if you are coming from the Spring/Woodlands area I would personally suggest calling these guys up for your next vehicle.

We had the pleasure of working with Capt. Ron(NOTE: He doesn't look like Kurt Russell but he made up for it with the quality of service we received!) and Lonnie Gipson. These two gentlemen blew my wife and I away after having dealt with horrible salesmen all day trying to haggle our trade in prices with us and not showing us what we wanted. 

I am currently in the Coast Guard serving at Ellington Air Field. Capt. Ron was a prior service member in the Air Force. We immediately hit it off and I felt like he was truly trying to get me the best deal he could.

We literally walked in told him what we were looking for and he pulled up two different Grand Cherokees. While we were test driving them he went and talked to his boss about our trade in, a 2005 Corolla. When we got back he gave us our trade-in price  and it was WELL ABOVE KBB's trade-in value for a vehicle in perfect condition, which our was not.

From there he got us over to financing and they got us an EXTREMELY LOW rate after shopping around for us. They beat the rate we were getting from my military bank by 1.6%!

If you ever goes to Texan Dodge please ask for Capt Ron and Lonnie Gipson!

I am well pleased with my experience at Texan Dodge and would recommend to anyone.

Keep up the good work Lonnie.",4.8
155,"May 29, 2013","Purchased a Dodge Ram 1500, May 2013. Many to choose from. Tom Huberty spent several hrs. with us; looking & test driveing. We didnt make our decision that day, but no pressure from him. We returned a few days later, after we decided which truck we wanted. He gave us a great price. We worked mainly with Tom, but Adam Baza also showed us some extra features on our truck. Next over to finance, Joey Yost, got us a great rate. We also added some extra dealer options, and Jason took great care of us as well. Everyone we worked with where top notch! A great truck at a great price with great people; what else could you ask for! Heads up to Bert B.

156,"May 06, 2013","I was referred to Texan Dodge by a dear friend and assured i would receive top notch service. I am thrilled to say it was by far THE MOST incredible car buying experience of my life. The professionalism, courtesy and honesty were outstanding. I would refer my dearest friend to Texan Dodge to be treated with the same respect that i received from Sales professional Ron Cox & his associate Lonnie. I LOVE my 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo and proud to tell anyone who asks about my fabulous experience during the purchase!",5.0
157,"June 10, 2012",After recently purchasing a new camaro for my wife from another dealership I was on the hunt for a Challenger. Planet Dodge had the best prices than other dealers. Most importantly I was VERY impressed with the knowledge of Lewis and another salesman. They explained all aspects of the car in detail unlike when I purchased a camaro just weeks earlier. I see me buying more vehicles from Planet Dodge in the future.,5.0

159,"August 03, 2010",I went to Planet Dodge to get my Jeep Wrangler serviced and the experienced was amazing. Planet Dodge offered a complimentary transportation for my convenience. Which was great because I needed to go home to take care of some business.  Great place to take your car if you needed to be service.   ,5.0
160,"September 17, 2009","Rude and pressure pressure pressure!!!!! Tried to sell me a truck for over what they were advertising it as and when I called them out on it, they tried to play the ""let's say numbers and point so fast is confuses anyone game"" which does not work on me. These guys are here to cheat and steal everything they can from you and will make it look like you are the one on the sweet end of the deal. Buyer beware! Do not go here if you don't like to be screwed out of your hard earned dollar, they will take it!. I left only after threatening to call the police to get my truck keys back. They had the balls to call me a few days later and needless to say, I didn't spare the cursing and Edwin eventually just hung up. NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER go here or any ""Planet Ford or Dodge in the Houston or surrounding areas, they are all the same, crooks! ",1.0
