1,"May 29, 2020","I believe in Buyer Beware.  Buyers need to do their due diligence and Sellers don’t need to disclose everything they think or know is wrong with the vehicle.  BUT they do need to answer questions honestly when asked and paperwork that is part of the transaction needs to be truthful and correct.

I purchased a used Ford Expedition from Sterling McCall “As-Is” which means that Sterling McCall is under no obligation to fix things once the transaction is complete and the vehicle leaves the lot.  This is not however a license to engage in fraud, which is what they did…read on!

The first thing I asked after the test drive was “Has the vehicle been inspected?”  I was told that is had been inspected.  Specifically, the Salesman said “We don’t put vehicles on our lot unless we inspect it first. Sir!”  It is in quotes because that is what he said.  I requested a copy of the report and moved to the next step, financing.  

The Finance Manager handed me a document that he told me was the inspection report for the vehicle.  I reviewed the document carefully and it showed that the vehicle had been thoroughly inspected by the dealership.  All the major systems, including AC were checked as functional.  I asked for a copy of the report and was told by the Finance Manager that it would be provided as part of the file associated with the sale of the vehicle.  Specifically, the Finance Manager said “Of course, of course, no problem, I’ll add it to the file.”

Well, I found out later that he did not add it to the file, and I did not notice that the Inspection Report was not part of the documents I received at closing because I did not recheck the file before I left.  My bad, I guess.

Over the next couple of days I noticed there were a few issues with the vehicle, like the AC was not cooling.  I also noticed that the passenger seat squeaked when driving.  I moved the seat and saw that the bolts that hold the seat in place were not fully tightened to the floorboard.  In fact, they were barely threaded.

I had the AC checked by my mechanic because I thought it might just be low on Freon which is an easy fix.  I was told by 2 mechanics (just to make sure) that parts were missing.  Based on this information, the only conclusion you can reach is that there is that the dealership never inspected the AC prior to the sale and the inspection report was forged.  This is not a case of “It must have broke after you left…”  The unit could not work in it's current state of missing parts.

Full disclosure again, it was cool the day I test drove the vehicle and I relied on the inspection report as full disclosure of the condition of the vehicle to close the sale.

I returned to the dealership and was told that they could not fix any of the items (there were a few others) because they were not safety related issues.  The bolts being loose on the passenger seat are not a safety issue.  Really?  Wanna go for a ride??

I told the General Sales Manager that I was given a copy of the inspection report for the vehicle and all major systems, including the AC, were checked as functioning.  Before even discussing any of the issues I had mentioned, she asked for the Inspection Report.  It was almost too quickly, like she knew something I did not.  Sure enough when I checked the file there was no inspection report.

I met with the Salesperson and finally the Finance manager involved in the original transaction.  They both claimed that they had no idea which document I was referring too and that their vehicles only receive a safety inspection.

I realized at that moment that they had a system in place to defraud people so why frustrate myself asking for an honest answer from dishonest people.

There is a pattern and practice at Sterling McCall to lie to customers by providing documentation that the used vehicles are fully inspected when in fact they are not.
 
I learned my lesson.  Get every vehicle independently inspected because people lie.  And spend your money with someone who values honest dealing.  Sterling McCall does not.",1.4
2,"April 15, 2020",I have no complaints! I had a problem with my trick! I took it in to Drew. He found out what the problem was and fixed it! I have no complaints he did a good job in a timely manner! I recommend him! He’s awesome!,5.0
3,"February 22, 2020","Went there yesterday 2/21/2020 after seeing a great deal online. I clicked the “schedule my test drive.” Ahmed texted me and said it was ready to look at. When I get there, they “can’t find it” but do I want to look at something else. I asked if I can get the same price on another one but they say the price is only available on the one they can’t find.

SCAM, Bait and switch scam. 

Don’t waste your time with this dealership and especially don’t waste your time with Ahmed.

4,"December 04, 2019","My experience with Ford and now Sterling McCall has been nothing short of horrible. Not only have there been 3 recalls on my car but when I dropped my vehicle off to get the recall work done , I was told that now I have to come up with an additional $500+ to fix something that is a result of the horrible vehicle Ford created.  I will never purchase a Ford again and the people that work in the service department are complicate in their actions. Not only did they string me along for 3 days before the news was broken , they then extended the work an extra day(so far).  Stay clear of this establishment if you want fair treatment.  UPDATE , sitting in the lobby they have now told me that my transmission recall work and now my warranty do not cover all of the work done on my vehicle and now they want $800 and lowering it to $500 would be ""helping"" me out.  The service agent of the day(Jerry Quick) is now saying if I put a negative review online they definitely make me pay the higher amount that I did not agree to. Do not deal with this company unless you are willing to fight them to do the right thing.  Horrible dealership service experience.  Jerry Quick was today's service advisor, my 3rd in 3 days and they have all told me something different.",1.0
5,"November 02, 2019","I’ve never dealt with such an unethical car dealership as Sterling McCall Ford. I truly thought this would be the easiest sale they had all week.  I already knew the vehicle I wanted, which they had in stock.  I submitted my “accelerated” financing application online, provided them with the information for a $500 deposit so I could make sure they held it for me for a few days. First bad feeling was when I asked if they could provide me with the pricing to ensure they would honor their internet sales price.  They said they couldn’t because it was the end of the month and when I came in at the beginning of the next month they could change.  I brushed it off and still moved forward. My husband and I arrived today and we got our second bad feeling.  They had moved the vehicle I wanted to the showroom floor and they wouldn’t move it outside so I could drive it.  They wanted me to speak to financing first.   When the finance guy came out with the numbers, the payment was literally $250 more a month than the internet pricing that was quoted AFTER they ran my credit.  After much debate, including some very shady pricing (at one point he claimed we’d have to pay a local sales tax, which is NOT true) we chewed them down within $20 of what we wanted to pay - but get this, they still would not allow us to drive the vehicle until financing had been completed.  Outrageous!  We walked!",1.0
6,"October 29, 2019",Coming for oil change  and battery test . First battery ok then when finished with oil change .   Vehicle will not start now I need a battery Advertise says battery 99 to 129 now 184,1.0
7,"October 18, 2019","First off, This has no reflection on the Salesperson I was working with. But the sale's manager. After spending 6 weeks comparing 2018 F150 XLT's , It was clear I had a real good idea what I wanted in a 2 year old NEW TRUCK. 

I arrived at the dealership one hour before opening, just to make sure the F150 XLT 5.0lt 4x4 was on the lot. The salesperson I was working with arrived. We test drove the truck and I made an offer of 33.500.00.  this was based off of the real window sticker, not the made up window sticker placed inside the truck, the dealership showed on their website the MSRP was 51,210.00, (really this was the Total Before Discounts price of the F150) with a dealer discount of 11,550.00,  the real window sticker I downloaded off their webpage showed a MSRP of 49,210.00. 

Again after 6 weeks of comparing 2018 F150 XLT's I also had a real good idea of the discounts being offer by the dealer within 100 miles of Houston. These discounts being offered where from 16.000.00 to 20.000.00 off MSRP. And my offer of 33.500.00 was based on the advertised discount flashing on the Great big sign in the front of the Dealership saying. 15.888.00 off all 2018 F150 XLT. (A get them in the door sign)

Here is where it gets to the interesting part. My Salesperson when back to the sales manager with my offer, and came back with an out the door price of 46,000.00.  I informed my Salesperson this wasn't going to work. Next was the sales manager. 

The sales manager came in and my first question was where are you getting and MSRP of 51,210.00, that is when he started with, This is our internet price. Then I pulled out my copy of the window sticker and showed him the listed MSRP. And then I heard this. Those discounts are optional for the dealership to use or not. At that point I was getting ready to head out the door. But I decided to stick around for a little longer. I then asked about the discount of 11,550.00. Again I heard this is the internet discount. I then told him about the dealership not 15 miles down the road that was offering 20,000.00 off the 2018 F150's, He wanted me to show him the dealership offering this discount. So I did and and when he seen the discount, He went back to, The 11,550.00 is our internet discount. So I moved on the the next item on the cost breakdown. The Spray on Bed Liner that was installed by the Dealership, Bed Liner cost. 794.00. I just said. REALLY. The dealer installed cost sheet I found in the console of this F150 stated the cost of the spray in bed liner was 499.00. The sales manager asked what do you think the cost of the bed liner is worth. I told him maybe 200.00. He changed to bed liner cost from 794.00 to 200.00. 

Then I asked about all these little fee's, These are Federal and States fees that have to be charged. The only good price on the price breakdown was the Doc Fee. This is where I got up. turned around and told the Salesperson Thanks you, for working with me by phone and email for the last 2 weeks. 

I really think the sales manager need to sit down and read Texas House Bill 3621. And he also needs to understand that people now do their homework when buying a new car or truck. 

Added note: Two hours after waking out of Sterling McCall Ford Houston, I was on my way home in a 2018 F150 XLT with 4 miles on the odometer, full warranty and a out the door price of 33,524.21

They kept checking on everyone in the waiting room and switched out cookies for fresh ones. If you had a question they would answer or find out. When they finished with my car I was expecting the long list I seem to always get with service. Things need immediate repairs and what not. That want the case. Yes their were a few items that were brought to my attention but I wasn't pressured into it, in fact they were nice and said that they were not needed today but we're recommended soon before my next service.

82,"January 17, 2016","Would never recommend anyone to give their business to this dealership, these people are scammers. They do false advertisement to just get the customer in the door and later refuse to honor what they have advertised. Today (1/16/2016 around 7 pm) I was going to close the deal on a new F150 Lariat at Helfman Ford when I saw their listing on Cars.com offering the same truck at a better price. I rushed to their dealership, the first thing I did was show their listings on cars.com to the sales person and asked him if they are offering the Ford F150 Lariat for the same advertised prices and he told me YES and they have a large inventory of them. After wasting multiple hours of my time at 9:30 pm they refused to honor their advertised price and discounts/rebates. When I showed the Manager multiple listings from Sterling McCall Ford on cars.com, he refused to honor the price saying the listings were system glitches. Not one, not two but all listings? what a joke. Just to make my experience worst the Manager had a bad attitude and a rude tone. He also claimed that Ford directly lists their inventory on Cars.com, which luckily his sales person corrected him on and told him that they list their cars themselves on cars.com. I was not bargaining on the price of the Truck, all I asked was they should honor the price they have listed for multiple F150 Lariat Trucks on cars.com, which any reputable business would have done. I think they purposely delayed me so that I couldn't even go back to Helfman Ford, as Helfman closed at 9 pm. 
At this point I was ready to pay them the same price I was paying at Helfman Ford for the same truck as it was a Saturday and I really wanted to close the deal and drive out in a new truck, but they were asking for $3000 more than what Helfman Ford, Autonation and other Ford dealerships (within 30 miles) are selling for. 
I just wanted to share this so people are aware their they do false advertisement and one would only waste time going to their dealership. They are just trying to cheat people and they should be reported. I am going to file a complain with Ford Motor Company as well.

Took my car in for an airbag light on Christmas eve. Turned out it was just a loose cable. However, it took 2 and a half hours for them to find this. Okay, not a big deal as long as it gets fixed. The only thing I had in there was my gym bag full of sweaty clothes and my prescription sunglasses I have to wear while driving that were tucked away in my gym bag because it was a dark rainy day. I didn't think anything of it because who would want my sweaty clothes? I actually trusted them to just not unzip my bag altogether. BIG mistake. When I got home I noticed rust all over the back of my drivers seat as well as my gym bag. Obviously they had gone through it and taken the only thing of value, my glasses. Spare change was also taken out of cup holders and center console. I immediately called and spoke to the service advisor who had helped me Yuny Yau and after explaining my situation he just hung up on me. I immediately called again and again explaining what had happened but anyone who answered gave me the run around asking me to hold until disconnecting my call or saying they would look into it and call me back or flat out hang up on me this continued until closing time and it being Christmas eve didn't take long. I guess I should've taken my bag out instead of making the mistake of trusting these ""professionals"" not to go through a bag of dirty clothes, ESPECIALLY on Christmas eve. So if you go here, clean out your entire car because they won't hesitate to take anything they can.",1.0

Mohanad was the sales rep I dealt with. He was friendly, not to aggressive on the sale, and pretty well versed with the features of the car. Once the deal got to finance, I did a bit of waiting for all the paperwork and for the finance manager to try and sell me extended warranties and and interior coating and whatnot. He was a bit pushy but still relatively nice. After signing everything and paying the down payment, I had to do a bit of waiting for my car to get out of the car wash and for the fuel to be put in it. After that, I got my keys and drove off.

102,"January 17, 2015","Mohanad Al Sahaf is the true hero of this story!  What started as a hybrid battery service (which would prove too costly) became a search for the perfect used SUV for me.

Traditionally, I'm a truly skeptical buyer, and I'm plagued by my indecision when it comes to large purchases.  When it became clear that this location did not have a used vehicle on the lot to satisfy my ""picky-ness,""  Mohanad stepped up!  

Mohanad humbly and selflessly spent a better part of two days with me in his office, searching vehicle after vehicle throughout Sterling McCall's numerous locations online.  Whenever we found a contender, Mohanad would selflessly travel near or far (even as far as KINGWOOD) to show me a vehicle.  After several tries, Mohanad brought me my low mileage Honda CRV and, after a week of ownership, I couldn't be happier!!!!!

112,"October 06, 2014","We all know how dealers can be... rude, high priced, drive your car around, and so on. 

This dealership really seems to be trying to NOT be any of those. They have made significant changes in their collision/auto body shop office and the rude attitude is gone and the new law of the land is professionalism. 

As for oil changes and auto inspections, I choose to get them here because they are price competitive and can do a routine inspection for things you actually need instead of trying to find things to jack up sales like other shops.   And, recently I have been receiving a hand wash car wash free after they are done with the work. I don't see anyone else doing that. I also like that I can receive a free shuttle ride to downtown and back when I need to leave the vehicle there - though sometimes the shuttle isn't convenient with pickup times due to my work schedule, it is nonetheless a free shuttle service.

I have been through the ugly times and since 2010 when I started going there, they have been getting better and better. I will always remain vigilant and call out any crap, but so far, of complaints that I had made in the past, changes were made and the shop improved with the corrective changes they made.  The car business isn't one that I would call friendly, or honest, but so far, I have been impressed with the changes made. I realize that things can go wrong, but when they do, how they are now handling things has been a huge improvement and shows that they really are trying to improve.  ",4.8
113,"September 10, 2014","First of all I was going to give these people a 5 star review (this is my first review EVER) even though the shuttle ran an hour late and I had extended wait for my car. Their people (Juan the shuttle driver and Andrew my service guy) were great with customer service. But as I'm driving home, I noticed one thing...

-My mileage when dropping it off was 21,638 (I wrote it down because I have a mustang and am constantly worried about someone taking advantage of my car), mileage out was lied about. Said 2 miles more on paper that I signed at the end but before my car was given back to me. The real mileage was 21,693. That's a 55 mile difference!! Not to mention a blatant LIE! (I even took pictures with time stamps once I exited the highway and parked, so there is no way in 15 minutes I could have put that mileage on in traffic at 6:30pm on a weekday. I'd have to average a speed of 137.5 MPH to accomplish that... in Houston traffic)
       -Where the xxxx could you go in Houston that is almost 60 miles away? Certainly not just around the block to test the suspension that they fixed, where the problem was only going over speed bumps. 
       -How the xxxx do I know an employee didn't take it home or out to lunch? I certainly want to see the video surveillance of my car on the lot to see how long it was gone.

-What was a full tank  when I dropped it off, minus only 14 miles on trip A, was down to 3/4 of the tank.

-The average miles per gallon was 13 MPG; NOT NORMAL as I consistently average 29/30 on the highway, and 24 overall. 

-I had reset the trip mileage and gas mileage estimate prior to surrendering my car. I dropped it off with 14 miles on the trip, got it back with almost 70 miles on it. That means the average mpg for those 70 miles was 13 MPG. 
       -Again, also evidence of the long distance drive. This was in addition to the tire tread in the back being down a little bit more than the front.

-Their employee(s) took my car for a joyride, ran it hard, possibly sped through red light cameras or tolls, which would give me even more evidence behind my case.
       -They also fully detailed the car to cover up. Nice touch. So how do I know they didn't damage my car and the real reason to keep it a day longer to fix the damage? I don't know, and am now paranoid about that, too.

**What does all this mean? Is this a normal amount of testing, you ask? My uncle, a mechanic for 30 years, said my suspicions were on point. He said this is excessive and abusive. (Why didn't he do the work? It's less than 3 years old, and completely covered by the warranty. But good question.)

It is absolutely disgusting to employ people that take advantage of customers. Y'all assumed you could get by because some young girl wouldn't be as into her car as I am. Well, we all know what happens when you assume. You messed with the wrong chick.

In conclusion, if you want your car violated by strangers, by all means take it to this service department.",3.6

I called Sterling McCall and was transferred to Todd. I cannot say enough how great of an experience my husband and I had dealing with Todd. He quickly turned this bad car buying experience full of road blocks into a very pleasant one.  He was very easy to work with, honest, friendly and funny...and made our car buying experience a great one. Todd was so friendly and was not your typical car salesman - he made you feel like a friend.
