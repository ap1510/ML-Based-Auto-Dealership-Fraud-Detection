0,"May 10, 2020","I found a used car I was interested in on Carfax, and contacted the dealership. Ajay Malani responded to me, and made himself available without pestering me or being pushy.

I pretty much knew I wanted the car before I stepped on the lot, and Ajay (my salesman) and Ryan (the finance manager) were helpful, patient, and took the time to answer all of my questions. I never felt pressured, but rather, just helped. I think the whole thing took maximum of two hours -- not too shabby.

Highly recommend these guys; they were a pleasure to work with.",5.0

2,"March 26, 2020","Dealing with riata is not like other dealerships,they don’t pressure you and your not just a number to them. Tony and Robert are good people to deal with,they know there job well and will do everything they can to get you the vehicle you want and not just put you in something so they can make another sale. I would recommend anyone interested in buying a new vehicle to give these guys the opportunity to help you. ",5.0

4,"November 11, 2019","We all know what an experience buying car can be, having said that I wanted to take time out to write a review about Riata Ford.  These folks at Riata were amazing, courteous, friendly, honest, and extreme professionals.  I especially want to give kudos to Mike Olguin...prior to me even drivng the truck I bought, Mike and I negotiated on the price of the vehicle and came to an agreement.  I showed up, test drove it and liked it so proceeded to do the paperwork.  While signing the documents, it became apparent that there was a slight misunderstanding on one of the accessory item pricing that was installed on the truck.  I was sure that the price we negotiated included the accessory and he was sure it didn't, so I decided to forego the accessory and live with it.  When Mike realized that I was dissapointed, he took it upon himself to include the accessory at no additional cost to me.  I was really impressed and grateful for what he did, and further enhanced my impression of Riata Ford.  In a day where we see less and less customer service, and everyone buying most everything on line, the folks at Riata still provide the good old fashioned customer service that keeps bringing back shoppers for an amazing experience...way to go!!! Total time spent at the dealership was a little over an hour...Also, wanted to say thank you to Garrett for the amazing service...",5.0
5,"October 28, 2019","I have had nothing but GREAT experiences with Riata. Tony and Robert are the worlds GREATEST! no pressure and they listen to me. I went in to get something fixed on my escape, had a little push back from the service dept and went to talk to Tony and drove away in a NEW car.",4.6
6,"October 11, 2019","I began my pre-owned car search using a great online service called TrueCar.com to find a newer Ford Escape to replace my old Escape with 263,000 miles on it. TrueCar found one that fit the criteria I was looking for-a 2017-2018, low mileage, one owner Escape, and it was at Riata Ford in Manor, TX, so I emailed them inquiring about it. Ajay Milani, their Master Sales Consultant contacted me and after a short drive from Austin, I saw one in that he had that was perfect. This was the easiest process that I have ever experienced buying a car. Ajay made it completely hassle-free and I am now the proud owner of a 2018 Ford Escape with 12,300 miles on it, from one owner, who Ajay has sold a few cars to in the past. He's a 12 year veteran of Riata, and no doubt has many repeat customers, and I will likely go see him again after logging in few hundred thousand miles on this one!

7,"October 08, 2019","First of all, if you are looking to buy a new Ford.  I highly recommend  going to Riata Ford in Manor, Texas.  I was looking for a new car and wasn't sure if I would be able to purchase one due to different issues. The Team at Riata Ford worked hard in seeking to help me find a vehicle but also met all my criteria that I was looking for from a to z.  I want to give a special thank you to Richard Martinez and Will for working together to assist me.  Also the financial team for making things work out as well. I walked out of Riata Ford not only feeling better knowing I had a reliable car but very grateful for the honesty and dedication of these men. Thank you!

The transmission was suppise to be repaired  cost $3000.00 for repairs. she has been back 3 times to seek proper repairs. she has spoken with managers.   her car is stiil not fixed. she cannot drive more than 45 minutes without it over heating.  she now had to take a bus to a funeral in Dallas, since, Riata can not repair her car correctly,after 4 visits for repairs.  I am truly saddened that a deakership would take advantage of a young woman trying to get proper repairs done.  I Believe the only recourse now is to contact ford corporate.  ",1.0
9,"June 16, 2019","I picked up a used truck a few months ago. I had to do ALL the maintenance myself. When I received the truck the air filter was terribly dirty... full of junk, same for the cabin air filter. I had to change the oil, it was very black(even in small doses) and it had the WRONG oil filter on.
I was lied to by your dealership about the maintenance being up to date. I am very unhappy with my experience. I contacted them about the issue after the purchase, but was never gotten back to.",1.6

I wouldn’t had purchase the car if I knew they wouldn’t hold the bargain if the deal and then was told it was too late for them to do anything about it.  Customer service sucks. When in today 6/5:2019 to follow up on my key that was promise. Customer service manager was like if you get something fix and claim it under your warranty and pay 100.00 you can get your key. That was not was promise at the time of deal. I left the shop get to my job three GM manager Mr. Buhl Called for me to come back once I got there he offered to give me the additional key I was promised then when I said I wasn’t coming Barack he wanted to not make me the key he offered to make. Mr. Buhl gonna say we’ll you want to forget about since you say you not gonna come back and I don’t make the key. Poor customer service that’s a threat to me either you come back and I make the key or just walk away. Another customer heard him walked up to me and said you need to call the Better Business Bureau he was wrong,1.0

I applied for financing on line and was contacted by Will Goodwin. Will advised that I was approved and had the vehicle waiting for me at the dealership. Will made it an easy and pleasant experience.

13,"March 25, 2019",Had a great experience with Angel Castilleja and Ryan Fisher of Riata Ford. These two gentlemen were not your typical aggressive car salesman. They were professional curtious and most helpful. I got the deal and vehicle i wanted and it didn't take all day.,4.0
14,"February 22, 2019","I first wanted a license plate holder and ended up buying a Truck and my partner got SUV. Both Mike and Tony took the time to listen and tell us how to get out of a lease and save money on a truck. 

I would never say this, but I am hate car salesman because they tend to bug you. Just when you are looking. There guys did not do that. I had to page someone to ask for help and most of all Tony and Mike treated us like family. We were not just a number. I wil say I will go back and buy from there again. Thanks Mike and Tony. ",5.0

16,"December 14, 2018","Ben Sofer did a great job following up and found me a really nice Ford F-150 truck in my price range and with low miles. He was laid back and helpful and really empathized with what I needed and didn’t try to sell me something I didn’t want. He worked with me to find me exactly what I was looking for. Ryan Fisher,  the sales manager, was really nice and gave me a really good deal on my truck. I am very happy with my purchase and I would recommend Riata Ford to anybody who is in the market looking for a Ford vehicle. Definitely contact Ben if you want a truly great experience buying the vehicle you really want. ",5.0
17,"November 19, 2018",Had a very pleasant buying experience at Riata Ford . I dealt with Will Goodwin and Ryan Fisher.

18,"November 04, 2018","Drove to Riata to look at a 2018 Mustang GT. I had been looking at cars at two other dealerships near my home. I met with my salesman Will Goodwin , that I talked to before going to the dealership. I test drove the car, and between Will G. and the sales manager they made me an awesome deal. I’ve purchased several cars in the last 10 years, and Riata was the best dealer I’ve worked with. Thanks Will , and I look forward to continued business!",5.0
19,"October 17, 2018",I will never show for another dealership for my next new truck.  Tony treated me like family and was able to beat all of the other Ford dealership in the Cen-Tex area.  He took his time with me and was truthfully the whole time while I tried to make up my mind on used or new Truck.  At no time was he never pressured me on making a decision and his biggest concern for him was to ensure I was happy even though he might not have the vehicle that I was looking for.  Great guy and once again Tony thank you for all the hard work you did to ensure my happiness.  ,5.0
20,"October 07, 2018","I just purchased my 4th car at Riata Ford.  Rick Stives (sales person) and Mike Olguin (sales manager) were there for all four purchases.  All four ""deals"" were very straight forward and easy to understand.  There are no ""smoke and mirrors"", 'numbers switching"", ""bait and switch"", or any other underhanded gimmicks here.  What you see and what you hear are what you get.  I will keep coming back. ",4.8

22,"September 28, 2018","When I pulled up to Riata Ford in Manor, I expected the typical salesmanship tactics - hard court press, feigning interest in what I'm looking for, playing finance games, etc.  Much to my delight and surprise, this was not the case with Ajay Malani (Sales) and Ryan Fisher (Finance).  Both men showed the utmost respect and courtesy throughout the car buying process, made good on their promises and delivered the vehicle ahead of schedule.  I've been researching the local Jeep Wrangler market for a month and found this deal that I couldn't pass up - paid below FMV.  I couldn't be more pleased with Riata Ford and the outstanding customer experience they provided me - well worth the extra few miles to do business with them!  I'm already looking forward to my next purchase with Riata Ford and Ajay.",5.0
23,"September 24, 2018","All sales and service at Riata Ford in Manor TX. are phenomenal and topnotch. My wife and I are proud owners of our second vehicle purchase from Riata, the first being a lease/purchase vehicle to which we loved and will miss. Our second vehicle purchased 9/22/18 is fun to drive and looks sporty from our point of view. Rick Stives and the sales and financing staff worked crunching the numbers for us to make our buying experience affordable and with every step, took the time to be courteous and considerate to our needs. Again, the staff here are like family and go that extra mile to see that we are happy with our purchase both past and present.
Great job Riata Team!

26,"September 01, 2018",I've purchased my share of cars and none would ever beat the service I received from Riata Ford.  I would send everyone I know who would be looking for a new car to them.  I cannot thank them enough for getting me into the car I wanted. They have truly exceeded the highest level of customer service anyone could expect!,5.0
27,"August 16, 2018","We stopped by to look at a new truck, they did not have the one we wanted on site, Rick immediately sent drivers to another location and brought back the truck we wanted. He got us out of there quick and never tried to upsell us on anything. this is the second auto we purchased from Rick this year.",5.0
28,"July 23, 2018","Just bought a 2018 F150 from them. They kept to their online pricing, which was much much lower than the MSRP, but didn't really budge below that.

34,"May 15, 2018","I recently purchased a new vehicle from Riata in Manor and very happy that I did.

In part b/c they're my local dealer.  They're more accessible than other dealerships I spent time with; I like that if my vehicle needs servicing, they're only a few minutes down the road.  And I know having my vehicle serviced at Riata didn't require I purchase from them, but all else equal, I always prefer establishing relationships with local businesses.

But in bigger part, the saleswoman I worked with, Joy, committed more of her time to help me than other sales staff at other dealerships did.  Of the 12 vehicles I test drove, 6 were at Riata through Joy!  She even brought in a Mazda I was interested in from a sister location.

And that time in each of those vehicles, w/her helping me understand each of them better, including strengths, trade offs, etc., is what helped me arrive at my final buying decision.  I started my vehicle search wanting a Toyota Tundra, but wound up buying a Ford Edge.  Perhaps a wide swing, but I'm totally happy w/the Edge and glad I went with it vs. a full size truck or SUV. I feel it's the perfect vehicle for me right now, and Joy played a huge part in helping me arrive at that decision.

From there, final pricing was competitive and Jennifer in finance walked me through it patiently and carefully.  She clarified each pricing component and indeed, the price Joy said I'd walk out the door with was the same price Jennifer had me sign off on.

Overall it was great buying experience once I found Riata; I'd easily recommend them when you decide to purchase your next vehicle.  Especially if you're in Manor, but greater Austin residents should consider the short drive to Riata worth it.  They're local, generous w/their time, knowledgeable on the vehicles they're selling, and deliver on the price they promise.  Overall a crack shot team that I'd easily do business with again.",5.0
35,"May 14, 2018","I just purchased a 2012 Honda Accord from Riata Ford - a great experience with Joy and Rick, who made it easy and satisfying.  Joy's response to my interest in the car was immediate and when she wasn't available, Rick did a great job of helping me deal with bad communication from my bank in getting the purchase complete.  I hadn't purchased a car since 1982 and expected difficulty, but they made it easy.  I didn't get a service contract with them only because of the distance between them and me but I have great faith that they would do a professional job if I had.",5.0
36,"May 09, 2018","My experience was great and Awesome, Ajay Malani, Sales was as great as always. He was very friendly, professional and gave awesome customer service! And thanks to him I am driving a new Ford Edge Titanium!

He is very personable, and really cares about the customer and is available even after the sale to answer all your questions.

Thanks for the opportunity to provide feedback on my experience.",5.0
38,"April 26, 2018","I worked with Tony and Joy at Riata. I had a pretty crazy situation but rather than just telling me no or trying to sell me a vehicle I wasn't interested in, Tony recommended a great credit union (that they didn't even work with) that was able to get me approved for the dollar amount I needed! On top of that, I was upside down in my current vehicle by quite a bit, Riata gave me way more for it than any other dealer I had been speaking with and still came down on the price of their vehicle I was purchasing. Awesome experience! I would recommend Riata and specifically Tony and Joy to anyone in the Austin area looking for a new or used car.",5.0

43,"February 20, 2018","Last Friday I walked into Riata after setting up an appointment to test drive a pickup truck I was interested in, that I found through the USAA Car Buying Service. As soon as I walked up to the door, Michael Jackson was standing there waiting for me. Yes I said it, Michael Jackson (not the music icon) The pickup was parked out front, clean, and waiting to go. Took the truck for a test drive and it was perfect! The best part about this car buying experience is how easy and hassle free it was. MIchael made it feel like I was buying the vehicle from a friend, which I truly appreciated. If you are looking for a vehicle and a stress free experience, do yourself a favor, walk into Riata Ford and ask for Michael Jackson. You will be happy you did.",5.0

During that time I never had a fun experience purchasing a new car like I just did two days ago buying a new Ford Fusion Ultra from Riata Ford in Manor Texas. Our salesman Ajay Malnai and the GM Tony made the trade in and purchase a fun time. The wife and I pulled away from the dealership pumped and not drained and exhausted as in past purchases.

50,"September 14, 2017",I was recommended by a co-worker to purchase my first car at Riata Ford and most specifically with Robert.  It was a great experience. There was no hassle or pressure to buy at the end of all my questions. (As opposed to Nissian where the salesman refused to give me any finance numbers unless I signed a contract to buy that day. Which I am pretty sure is illegal. Complete disrespect and bullying.) I wanted to make sure my decision was the right one. I got a great deal on a 2017 Ford Fushion SE. I love that Robert checks up on me to make sure I am fully satisfied with my purchase. The level of customer service I have received so far reassures me that when I need my car serviced (or something bad happens) they will go above and beyond. I am for sure a forever customer now. ,5.0

Riata Ford literarily made it possible for me to become one of those to envy. I have purchased many vehicles in my time and this was by far the best experience I have ever had. Tony and Robert were the complete opposite of the ""used car salesman"" stereotype. They were professional, knowledgeable and worked with my budget. They have won me as lifetime customer.

They had pulled it aside and had it detailed and ready for me to look at when I got there.  The car was as expected.  Very clean interior, engine, and with new tires.  Sales process wasn't pushy and let me think through my options.  Once I decided, the purchase process was just as quick and easy.  Since I was buying a vehicle for my daughter, they even delivered the car to me residence.  Overall great experience with Kristen Meredith.",4.8

54,"August 10, 2017","No high pressure sales staff!  Friendly! Patient! Informative! Understanding! Helpful!  What else can I say .... excellent service.  We stopped at another dealership prior to Riata Ford just to look around and get some information on a few prices.  We were so overwhelmed with the pressure from the sales manager that I decided even if I saw a car I liked for a good price that I would not buy there.  It was truly a horrible experience.  THEN ... we walked into Riata Ford.  Rick Stives was friendly, laid back, and knew what he was talking about.  He worked with us on what I wanted and for the price I wanted it for.  No games.  Then when we picked up the car the next day, Jeff, helped us get familiar with the features, sync my phone, and was patient with all of our questions.  My husband and I both bought our last vehicles at Riata Ford, bought this new vehicle there, and will go back when it's time to buy again.  It was a great experience.

61,"April 09, 2017","We needed a new car for my wife. She really liked the Escape so I decided to order her one from the factory. We were very specific about what we wanted and worked it up on the Ford.com website. We didn't want to pay for all the Titanium options so we chose an SE and added just the upgrades we were willing to pay for. I took the specs to Riata Ford in Manor and left a deposit. We were expecting the new car to come in 6 to 12 weeks. At about 8 weeks, we started calling to check to see if they had heard anything. John Alvarado said, ""no, we should give it a little more time."" So, between 8 and 12 weeks, we called a few more times and still John couldn't say when the car would arrive. We were starting to get a bit frustrated. Then, right at 12 weeks, John called us to let us know he had a Titanium model with all the options we ordered, including exact color matches inside and out plus additional options. He said since the Escape we ordered had not arrived yet, ""you win!"" His sales manager had decided to take the hit in the interest of customer satisfaction. So, we got the new Titanium Escape with everything we ordered plus some things we didn't originally feel like we could afford. Thanks John!

The Sales person ""Kristen Meredith"" gave a lot of ""lip"" service but when it came to delivering she ""back tracked"" all the way.  I went to Financing and that too was a ""one, two punch"" the lady spoke like she owned the dealership and stated that ""she"" would do this and that.  Then we had to involve the Manager ""Tony"", Bless him, he tried but really just covered up for his poor sales person instead of holding her accountable.  An example:  Kristen had told me that when I went in to pick up my 2011 Tahoe she would have it ""gassed up and detailed with the third row put in and back defrost line connected""  I gave her plenty of notice when I was coming.  We get there and third row was going to be put in and defrost line was still disconnected and when I call it to her attention she said ""You can go and buy some super glue and put it back on yourself""  OMG I couldn't believe it.  Then we go to drive off and gas tank was about 1/4 of tank. I text Kristen next morning letting her know and what she had said and her words exactly and I quote ""If I said that I misspoke.""  This was the last straw, she was so unprofessional and I informed her that she ""misspoke"" a lot of things, she focused on the sale and forgot about the customer.",1.8

89,"August 06, 2016","We had an excellent shopping experience at Riata Ford in Manor, Texas. We shopped other dealers but, in the end, came back to Riata for the best car and the best deal.  

We really appreciated the time, expertise, and patience of our salesman, Robert Carreon. Robert worked with us not only for the best deal but to help us narrow down our choices, as we changed our minds so many times about what type of car we wanted. 

Robert also worked and searched to get us the options we wanted. We truly appreciated him and the efforts he made on our behalf.  In fact, they didn’t have the car we finally chose in the color we wanted; but when Robert drove that Ruby Red Mustang GT Premium around, we change our minds about that blue paint we thought we wanted. We went into Riata Ford thinking we'd get a small, boring car for in-town transportation. We left with a beautiful machine, and haven't regretted it for a minute. Our old car was a Camaro Z28. Besides the Mustang GTs great ride and sweet power, the visibility in this car is amazing. I also have to say, their technician, Erik, kept that 2000 Camaro running for many years (if you have a car like that, you follow your mechanic). His technical insight and honesty certainly swayed our decision.

Jennifer Saldana, the Sales Manager, was also very helpful. Paperwork was done quickly, financing was a breeze, and she cheerfully answered a dozen more questions that occurred to us a few days after our purchase.

When I contacted Riata Ford about it I immediately heard from Tony Nguyen who went to work rectifying the situation.  I just have to say that Tony Nguyen really went above and beyond in making sure my wife and I were completely satisfied with the outcome of our car buying experience.  First, he found a newer vehicle that I was very happy with (my dream car) and he was able to get my interest rate down by 6%.  Not only that, but he was able to help us get out from under a previous vehicle purchase from another dealer where our interest rate was 14%.  He was able to get us into a brand new 2016 Escape SE with the 1.6 liter Ecoboost at 1.9% interest so our overall payments stayed about the same, but now more of our payment would go towards the principal instead of to interest.  My wife was pleasantly surprised to get a brand new car with more torque and way more interior room than our older 2012 Nissan Juke.  Our sales guy Jonathan Ling was very pleasant to work with and made sure our test drives were enjoyable and all our questions were answered satisfactorily.  When it came time to pick up our vehicles, they had been detailed and put into top-notch condition for us.

After the test drive, he offered to see if the dealer could find a better APR through one of their lenders.

138,"August 02, 2015","I recently purchased a 2015 F-150 SuperCrew from Riata Ford, after spending 3 weeks searching the internet for the right truck. I searched a 250 mile radius around Austin. I had a very tight budget. I worked with several dealerships and salesmen who were not interested in my needs, but only interested in lining their pockets with more money. In every deal, there is always a point where both parties benefit.

When I was contacted by James Labonte, I told him what I wanted, gave him my financing requirements, and told him my bottom line. We discussed the truck on his lot that I was interested in, but the list price it was too far above what I could afford. He informed me that Riata Ford has a price matching.beating policy. He asked me for the information of the truck at a different dealership that I was considering, what the price was, and if I could send him the quote. He confidently informed  me that if the 2 vehicle were similar, he would beat the price. In less than 1 hour he came back with a price that not only beat it, but it was 5% less  than the other truck, and over $1,000 below my max budget.

That night, I completed the online application and provide him the required documents electronically. The following morning, James called me with the final numbers which matched with what we agreed upon the night before. I took the family in that day, took a test drive, completed the paperwork, and left with my new truck within 2 hours of arrival. 

This was a very fulfilling experience, and worked well for both parties.",4.4

147,"May 13, 2015","DON'T BUY A CAR FROM RIATA FORD IN ELGIN, TEXAS. THEY WILL ROB YOU.  I listened to my Mom Cry on Mother's Day over what Riata Ford has done to us on this car. ""maddison"" of Riata Ford in Elgin, Texas sold us an ex-rental junker (we had rented it ourselves a while back, it turns out) with damage all over it, after showing me the car and promising that any minor defects would be fixed.  We waited weeks while the damage was supposedly fixed.  We took the car home at dusk and as soon as we saw it in the daylight, we noticed the damage was still present and the convertible top was coming apart.  After I had the car for about a week I realized it was the same car I had rented from Riata Ford a while back, right down to an uncleanable stain on the driver's door and my friend's name in the car's phone app.  When we complained, the sales rep ""maddison"" quit and her boss ""kevin"" gave us the run-around for months.  Originally they offered a seven day buyback guarantee- the only reason I trusted them in the first place- and we have been trying to get them to honor it ever since. This 2014 Mustang gets only 14 mpg (V6), has a furious heat problem in the driver's seat, malfunctioning thermometer that says it's ninety degrees at night when it's raining and cold, a broken convertible top, broken windshield, damaged doors, paint falling off, and a dented interior panel($740 replacement from Ford). My mother's 2008 4 cylinder Honda Accord feels peppier than this 10,000 mile mustang, but no one will address the way it runs or even discuss the mileage being so far off of expectations.  The car should be under warranty but ""kevin"" has threatened us and refused to honor the warranty.  Every time we call them they will only let us talk with ""kevin"" and he won't help us.  Dealing with Riata Ford has felt like being robbed by a gang of criminals.  Every time I look at the car I feel anger and stress over the manipulation it took on Riata's part to put us into this position.  For the first four months or so we had the car, the front tire leaked and we complained only to be ignored until we bought a tire at our expense.  We even told our sales rep- stressed the point even- that we were buying a car because I had just had surgery and needed a trouble-free car to make things easier...and we bought the maximum extended warranty...yet nobody at Riata Ford cared one bit when a man recovering from surgery was forced to bend over (not taking it 'easy' as the Doctor ordered) every three days to fill a bad tire that leaked from day one.  They failed to provide a front license plate frame- which got me pulled over while parking at SXSW and caused me to miss valuable time at the conference I paid good money to attend.  Again, NO ONE at Riata Ford cared when we complained.  Remember these jokers promise a  7-day money back guarantee and literally fired our sales rep to avoid honoring it on this car.  They could have fixed the problems, too, but instead they have ignored us and threatened us, manipulated us and lied to us.  NEVER buy a car from Riata Ford.  If this is not resolved I will never buy a Ford again and neither will anyone in my family.   I wish I'd stuck with Chevy, Nissan, Honda, or Tesla.  I hate this Mustang I should have really enjoyed more every minute I'm stuck with it.  I waited 25 years to buy a new car because I feared I could not trust ANY car dealer...I was finally forced to do it because of my health and thanks to Riata Ford it has been the most disappointing experience of my life.   My first car was a 1970 Mustang in 1989...and I guess I should have known better.",1.0

187,"April 28, 2014","I drove long ways from Uvalde, Tx to Manor, Tx to look at a used truck. It was the truck I was looking for. The staff mentioned above were great and very helpful and attentive. Their friendly customer service and knowledge of the business made the process very fast. John Civilla had the truck ready for me to test drive and was very attentive to all my questions and concerns. He offered me drinks and snacks while I was waiting for paper work to be finished. Tiffini and Olguin were very knowledgable on the financing part and offered awesome benefits.This kind of old fashion customer service is what is missing in many business these days. I have been doing business with local Ford dealerships in the area for a long time, but I plan to do business with Riata from now to buy future vehicles. I do have one suggestion to the Riata Leif Johnson Management to change their policy regarding the fuel capacity when purchasing a used vehicle. I think every purchase should be granted a full tank of gas, not limit just to new vehicle purchase. I only received 3 quarter of a tank of fuel and I had to fill up before heading back on my long trip. Other than that good job guys!!!",5.0
188,"April 25, 2014","The dealership is awesome. We had gone to another Ford dealership and it was like they did not want to help us with our decision. 
We call Ajay before we headed there and asked him about one of their trucks that was on their WEB site.
When we arrived at the dealership he had someone bring the truck from another one of their stores and had it sitting outside waiting for us. 
After driving it i saw another truck that i liked he went and pulled it up and we drove it. 
He sat in his office waiting for me to make my decision about the mileage between the 2 trucks. Then Tony came in an i told him my same concerns. He said well there is a Supercab with the motor i wanted. so we went to look at it and it was exactly what i was wanting.
Ajay was an awesome salesman. Price was great. Thanks again  you have a customer for life.

Thanks again

189,"April 14, 2014","My husband and I had been talking about purchasing a new vehicle for some time, but kept putting it off.  One reason why we delayed looking was due to our past experiences with pushy sales staff.  We had considered several different makes and models of vehicles before deciding on the Ford Edge or Explorer.  We had intended on making stops at several dealerships in hopes that we would find a SUV at the price range we needed along with a workable interest rate.  Our first stop was to Riata Ford in Manor, Texas.  When we arrived at the dealership we had anticipated on having a sales person on our heels the moment we stepped out of our car.  It was a pleasant surprise that we were able to look at the Edge and Explorer without having someone hoovering over our shoulders.  Once we decided it was time to seek out the assistance of a sales person, we were given the opportunity of working with Gabriel Baer.  After a brief introduction and our explanation of what we wanted he assured us that we came to the right dealership that will work to get us the best deal.  Gabriel worked his magic along with the store manager and we were able to purchase our 2014 Explorer Limited within the price range and interest range that we were wanting.

Gabriel made us feel comfortable with his knowledge, experience, and personable personality.  He stayed with us throughout the entire process and informed us of the different benefits that were available to us to protect our new SUV in the future.  Our overall experience up to this date with Riata Ford has been great and will be back in the future for additional purchases due to Gabriel and the entire staff. ",5.0
190,"April 14, 2014","   I need a new car as my current lease is expering soon. I heard a lot about Ford Fusion and its the car that i will be looking at.
me and my wife went to Riata Ford and started looking around used cars in the lot. After about 5 minutes, Gabriel introduced himself and asked if he can help us. I had some bad experiences with car dealers before , so i'm kind of passive and did not want to talk much and give too many informations.I dont want to be pressured. Surprisingly, Gabriel just went to the flow, is very polite and very patient. He got my respect and i started talking and sharing what are the options we are willing to look at.
 To make the story short , i went home with a brand new Ford Fusion SE with no sour feelings or whatever. Tiffini from the finance dept, during signing is also a great experience. It's just like talking to a friend and i did not feel any pressure at all. Some other dealers will constantly asked you of these 1000+ options that will add up to the price of the car. Bottomline,i am happy with my new car and if i will need another car for my kids, i will surely go back to Riata Ford and look for Gabriel.",5.0

I called dealer on phone because I was coming from Houston to assist my daughter in buying a car.I received a call back within a minute to set up appointment with a contact by the name of Rick,
When we arrived at dealership we were greeted.at front desk.We were asked who we were here to see.
Met with Chad.Car we were interested in was ready for us to see.Since I was a retired Ford employee,I received A Plan.
Our trade was fairly evaluated and we received the actual worth of trade in..We also were offered test drive,which we accepted.
Dealer did not use any high pressure.Gave us good information to make an informed decision.
No pressure .on who to use for finance source.Buyers order was done correctly and there were no hidden fees.
When we arrived at dealership on Sat.,2/15/14,our car was ready as promised.We met with dealer closer.Again all paper work was correct and no high pressure to sell us something we didn't want.

The thing that really made the deal was the Technology Manager.He went to car,set up Sync and even taught this old dog some new information.Again the concern of customer satisfaction just blew me away.

The team at Riata Ford has won a customer for life.I will drive a 170 miles for my next Ford.
You hear about all these Ford Dealers that win the Presidents Award.Riata should be on that list.I also intend to write a letter to Ford Motor Company about Riata Ford.This dealer is a diamond in the rough in tiny Manor Texas.

(I have heard this story before and usually do not get a call back). Imagine my surprise when he actually did call me back!, he let me know one of the vehicles was gone, and he would have the other that day.  I then proceeded to explain my situation to John, and after some very strategic questions on his part, we were able to start the entire negotiation process OVER THE PHONE. Several calls back and forth later, he had all the details, like monthly payment, etc... (including shaving several points off of the loan interest rate!) for me and said the vehicle was ready for a test drive! (I have never had a deal go so smoothly AND known what I am getting into BEFORE a test drive! ((the deal included a trade)).).

I went to the Riata Ford dealer website and filled out the online information form.  I was contacted the very next day (Labor Day) by Tiffini Morris.  It was available, for the advertised price.  I inquired about a direct mail Ford owner rebate offer I had received and was told I qualified.  Within minutes I had an out the door price.  Although the dealership was almost 8 hours away, I had a business trip to the area the next Monday anyway.  Tiffini offered to pick me up at tha airport.  I put up a deposit over the phone, and she held the car for me until I could get there.  

Since I had my own financing, I got busy arranging that, using the brochure that Tiffini emailed to me, with all the information and specifications. I made my flight arrangements and emailed the information to Tiffini.   When, I arrived in Austin, she was waiting for me, despite the early hour. We drove out to Manor, took care of paperwork,  and I drove away in my new car, for exactly the price I was quoted, which was quite a bit less than the sticker price thanks to discounts and rebates.  I got the deal I wanted, on the exact car that I wanted.  No one tried to oversell me or talk me into a bunch of add ons that I didn't want.  This was one of the easiest, most honest, straightforward, no surprise, transactions I've ever made on a car and I'm almost 60.  I've bought LOTS of cars over the years!

243,"November 09, 2011","I am very reserved on going car shopping, due to pushy sales staff in the past. On this particular trip I didn't feel this way at all.  Found a car explained the likes and dislikes and the staff, particularly Mrs. Johnson, made everything work out in the end.  Overall a very pleasant experience and would go back for any future purchases, too include any recommendations toward this dealership.",5.0
244,"October 24, 2011","Third vehicle in a year (ouch)!  The second was a used 2007 F350 dually diesel - lemon. Extended warranty didn't cover everything and expensive to have a diesel worked on.  Fourth visit to the dealership in about 5 months was enough and a bill of $1,000 approximately.  We traded for a 2011 F350 dually diesel - great truck, better mileage, quiter and better ride.  I believe we will save in the long run. Riate Ford in Manor really works with their customer to help them and tries everyway to satisfy them.  This is my husbands work truck so we need a dependable truck.  See Riate Ford in Manor before you trade AJ and Robert are the two we worked with both are great and you won't regrete it.",5.0

My sales person was very knowledgeable, thorough, and courteous throughout the entire sales process. I would highly recommend this dealership and this particular sales person to others.

246,"July 05, 2011","If you are looking for a new Ford, then this is the place to go. We were looking for a very specific vehicle, very hard to find.  When Riata did not have this vehicle our salesperson, Darin Ellis seached the state over to find us exactly what we were looking for and had the vehicle delivered to the dealership.  Darin even came in on his day off to make sure everything went smoothly with the delivery. We had visited many dealerships that day and Darin at Riata was the only person willing to put forth the extra effort to find us the perfect vehicle.",5.0

249,"April 06, 2011","I recommend you give Riata Ford in Manor, Texas a call before you trade vehicles - new or used. We received an excellent deal on our new 2010 Ford F150 Super Crew - no other dealership could beat their price and the financing rate we received.  The service we received before, during and after our purchase has been exceptional. They were not pushie at all but worked with us to get what we wanted and in our price range. I believe you will be happy you checked Riata out!!!",4.8
