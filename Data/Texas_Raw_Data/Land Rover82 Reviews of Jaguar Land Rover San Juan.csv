We have purchased several vehicles In the past with average to below average experiences, but everyone we dealt with at this dealership showed their willingness to help and try to give us the fairest deal possible. Parker's patience, knowledge,honesty and his hard work made such a huge impression on us. He is true to his word and not once was he ever pushy or inpatient with us.. Great person !!! Victor in finance worked very hard to give us the best possible rate and we felt that we really counted and they appreciated our business. Carlos went the extra mile and delivered our new LR4 to our home which made things so much easier for us. He was very professional and had such a great personality.

57,"January 30, 2015",Drove all the way from Austin down to Land Rover San Juan.  About a 10 hour round trip.  They had the car I wanted (2015 Range Rover Sport) and once Parker got involved in trying to facilitate as much as possible over the phone we were in smooth sailing territory.  I only spent an hour at the dealership and most of that was going over my actual car.  Ric was great at explaining everything on the car and I was on my way.,5.0

63,"March 27, 2014","I recently purchased my first Jaguar and conducted the entire process via the internet and email.  The quality of service received has far been the best I've ever had with purchasing a car.  Humberto and Parker were very timely with their responses and assistance.  Prior to shipping the vehicle they ensured the car was ready as promised and maintain communication until receipt.  Furthermore, Parker's assistance with ensuring my state's DMV had all the required documents was above the normal customer service description.  In fact, he provided an extension of temporary tags while the DMV completed the registration process.

Bottom Line:  I recommend this dealership above any other Jaguar facility.

Thanks team for the wonderful customer service,

68,"February 14, 2014","I was very pleased with my experience at Land Rover Jaguar San Juan, and especially with Parker.  I've purchased two new Land Rovers from other dealerships in the past, and while those were pleasurable experiences, this was the best. I was quite picky on every detail with this Certified Pre Owned Range Rover, as it is a very expensive car. Parker went out of his way to accommodate, and make right every request and concern I had with the car when I arrived to pick it up. I was also very please with the price. So much so that I flew down to get it and drove it back home almost 900 miles. ",5.0

My wife and I had a very specific list of options we were looking for and as a result we decided to expand our search outside of our local market.  Land Rover of San Juan, by far, was the friendliest, most accommodating, and easy to deal with of all the dealerships we contacted including our own local dealership.  This was not our first Land Rover and will likely not be our last and I will certainly go back to Land Rover of San Juan.",5.0

74,"September 16, 2013","We recently traded our '2010 Jaguar XF and upgraded to a '2013 Jaguar XJ. I'd had service on my XF a few times and worked with Annabelle and Rich and then met Mike(service tech) who explained about service required. I quickly became very impressed with the level of hospitality,friendliness and professionalism of all the people i encountered, even the ones whom i did not work with had a pleasant and welcoming ""hello"" are you being helped. When we decided to trade-up and subsequent purchase Elijio,Rich and Chris were extremely helpful and accomodating and made this purchase experience very pleasant and without pressure. Now my wife loves her new XJ and getting into her ""dream"" car was absolutely smooth while meeting all our expectations, now our friends and her colleagues comment on the great looking car she drives and i'm a happy husband because she's happy.
