0,"January 23, 2020","Do not buy anything here - especially used vehicles. I thought that an Audi dealership wouldn't be a cowboy operation but I was absolutely wrong. I traded a Volvo XC90 for a 2015 Q7 TDI. The deal was done online and over the phone as I am based further afield in Austin. Videos and pictures were shown of both vehicles with any known problems disclosed beforehand. They stated - 'Non smoker, no dings or scratches, interior perfect and everything working as it should etc etc'. I trusted them on their word (big mistake) and arranged for them to ship out the car and take mine. Once received it appeared to be ok (the money had already changed hands) but on further inspection the car is far from OK. Firstly it has been for sure a heavily smoked in vehicle (i had to buy an ozone machine to try to remove) and the smell was overwhelming. Secondly, the dash had a huge dent where it looks like either someone punched it or something was forced into it. Thirdly, the backs of the seats were completely detached - looks like some work had been done on the seats as we had airbag sensor light going off. Lastly, the car is overall a scruffy piece of crap -  interior metal trim pieces have heavy scratches and dings, the exterior is untidy and has scratches and visible paint where someone has tried to remove heavy scratches. The salesperson even test drove the car, filled the tank and said it was perfect (only 25k miles!) - he would of for sure noticed these issues.. I kind of blame myself on this one as I really should have looked over the vehicle myself but it was Audi, right? They have a reputation and they wouldn't cheat you on a bad deal, right? Wrong!! I complained about the dash dent as this was the big noticeable thing and they were good enough to replace the whole dash here in Austin - that took over 2 months as the dash was shipped from Germany plus they messed up the door on a lift and had to replace it! Just got the car back and now the key fob sensor doesn't work and the steering wheel is not aligned correctly. They also managed to pull of a trim piece on the dash - it's going back to them again! Anyway, I think I may have a cursed vehicle! DO NOT BUY ANYTHING HERE! DO NOT TRUST THEM. Out...",1.0
1,"October 21, 2019","I purchased a 2018 A6 and traded my 2012 A5. Ivan talked with me over the phone as I traveled 200 miles to purchase the vehicle. We negotiated the value of my trade-in site unseen. After I arrived and they found my rims needed to be resurfaced, Ivan reduced my trade by $500, but decreased the price of the vehicle by $2,000. The final price of the vehicle was at least $1,000 less than other similar vehicles. We did this negotiation in about 10 minutes with no hassle. I was in and out of the dealership in 90 minutes, including through financing ... on a Saturday. If you are in the market for an Audi, Audi of Ft. Worth is worth a look. Make sure you ask for Ivan.",5.0

3,"February 13, 2019",My daughters 2013 audi has had an appt for a coolant pump safety for a MONTH. I took off work and called on the way out of town to make sure all was a go . When I arrived @ FT worth audi they said they had run OUT OF THE PART not even 10 mins ago !!!!!!!! RUDE why would u not save the part for the car who had the appt for a month for the customer driving from out of town . ,1.3
4,"February 03, 2019","I purchased a 2017 Audi A6 on Dec. 1, 2018 from Audi Fort Worth (AFW).  On Jan. 10 I emailed the salesperson inquiring about the license plates.  She stated she or someone else would contact me when they were in.  During the sale both the salesperson and sales manager repeatedly stated a recall issue (airbag sensor) was repaired and the car was ready for sale.  AFW also promised to provide and install a front license plate bracket when the license plates came in.
On Jan. 23 I was notified by AFW they needed a current inspection to complete the vehicle registration.  They waited seven weeks to inform me of the inspection issue, with one week remaining before the temporary tags expire.  A current inspection should have been done prior to the sale, and AFW charged me an inspection fee on the bill of sale.  I had to have the car inspected myself and send them the inspection report (AFW did reimburse the fee).  However, when I contacted the salesperson about the AFW’s delay in getting the license plates and the expired inspection, she replied it was not her job.
On Jan. 24 I informed AFW the recall issue remained outstanding.  When I told the salesperson by email a VIN search of both the Audi USA and NHTSA website indicated the recall was not repaired, the salesperson still insisted it was taken care of, despite documentation stating otherwise. 
On Jan. 30, the day the temp tags were to expire, I called on the status of the license plates and asked about the front license plate bracket.  The salesperson claimed she didn’t know what I was talking about, “forgetting” our previous discussions.  She handed my call to a manger, Chris.  Chris offered to send a loaner car to me and they would take care of the recall and the license plate bracket.  I thought that was a reasonable resolution. He took my phone number and said he would call back with the arrangements.  I didn’t hear back from him.
There are other Audi dealerships in the DFW area; avoid Audi Fort Worth!

5,"November 19, 2018","Purchased used Q5. One week after purchase, I started having issues with brakes and noise in the door. I contacted my sales person who referred me to the sales manager. Weeks have passed with no return call. I am assuming because I am not a local customer, they have decided to ignore my call because I can't just show up at the dealership. I would not purchase from this dealership if you are not a local customer!",2.6
6,"September 10, 2018","
I’ve purchased 6 cars in the last 8 years and have never had an experience with a dealership as I have with Audi Ft Worth. I spoke with Deb in sales on a particular Q7  they had in stock several times through the week. She made me aware that the factory wheels had been painted black so the wheels were different than stock. She had another Q7 on her lot with silver 21” wheels that we were wanting and I had asked if it was possible to switch the wheels between the two vehicles and was told yes. We made plans to drive 140 miles to Ft Worth to look at the car and make our decision on Saturday. It took us 3hrs driving through heavy rain and DFW traffic to get there. Deb had text me that morning to let me know the car was on the showroom floor so we wouldn’t have to stand out in the rain to look at it. Upon arriving to the dealership we noticed the car wasn’t on the showroom floor. When Deb came up and greeted me she told me it had sold. Her response was “sorry”. The fact that she couldn’t pick up the phone and make a 30 second phone call to let me know the vehicle might be sold is a huge slap in the face. She could have easily let me know so I wouldn’t have wasted time and dragged my family through horrible rain and traffic only to find out the car was sold. The car was on the showroom floor so ANY of the salesman would know when the doors were opened and that car was being driven out for a test drive. With a phone call I could’ve turned around and I would’ve been fine. Then I asked for the sales manager. The guy that came out could’ve cared less of the position I was put in. Debs excuse in the end was “ I thought you wanted the other car anyways”  Save your money and time and pick any other Audi dealer in the DFW area. We ended up going to another dealer in Dallas and purchased a Q7 and received a lot better customer service.",1.0

They don’t call when your license plates are in ,nor do they seem to want to return phone calls. I have asked to speak with the sales manger and the phone just rings and rings.

9,"June 08, 2018",Do not purchase a car from Audi Fort Worth!! We purchased a certified pre-owned 2018 Q5 several months ago. They did not give us our license plates citing a delay with their headquarters and the DMV. We are on our second set of temp tags that are about to expire. We also just brought our car in to get a faulty drivers side window fixed. We are wondering if there was non-disclosed work done on this car before we bought it. We found out that the previous GM of Audi used to own our car and now there is a problem with the title. We get a different story each time from people like Mike McLeod. We requested follow up from Mr. Pedro Palenzuela (GM) with no luck. This is a very frustrating situation because it feels like we are in a stolen car.  Please really do your homework with this place! You need to know what you are getting into.,1.4
10,"December 20, 2017","Ignored for a while when we walked in. They were so slow! Many salesman walked by us without any acknowledgement. Finally got a saleswoman. She was overly bold. She mentioned that Audi got better MPG for 2018 even though it got faster. I said it's probably because of the Quattro ultra. Where it runs front wheel drive until you need all wheel drive. She went off sayin AUDI WOULD NEVER DO THAT. But they did... then when we found the car we were ready to purchase (Q5 prestige). It wasn't available even though she said it was. She drove us out to the storage garage. To ""look for the Q5 because it might of came in early""...The entire time she was downplaying the prestige model saying the lesser models were essentially the same. That should of drawn red flags but we gave her the benefit of the doubt. Eventually we test drive a lesser Q5 which I don't recall. But we were impressed anyways. So when we got back to the dealership we were ready to negotiate except everything was horrible... starting with everyone in the finance area as well as her being unprepared... we received the wrong price sheet not once, not twice, BUT THREE TIMES. All three times they were GROSSLY overpriced... once I called it out she realized (or acted) surprised and went to get it ""fixed"" claiming there was a ""glitch"" in the system. Each time she went to the finance guy she spent a long time there each time. She came back the final time and we lost our desire for the Q5. But we tried to hear her out hoping for the best. But the numbers did not add up. Claimed that the December special was not possible. No actual price reductions (just a wrong price that over priced the Q5 and ""discount"" to just make it slightly more than MSRP!!!) she kept claiming she wouldn't make a ""cent"" from this deal. When we tried to negotiate she said there is not anything we can do. It's an Audi and December they sell so quickly and easily. When I was explaining to her how the numbers did not add up she began to enter xxxxxxxx mode real quick. Everything from that point was a lie. Blatant lie. From financing is cheaper than leasing, we can't get the December incentives that Audi offers online, not knowing the incentives to begin with, that it would be impossible to lower the price even $1 even though it was priced way higher than it should of been, and so much more. We walked out. Yes I know we were stupid but my girlfriend and I test drove several cars... and the Q5 was just above the rest.",1.0
11,"November 23, 2017",John Bondurant was the Perfect guy to get me into not only my 1st ever brand new car but my first audi. His customer services was superior as opposed to any dealer ive ever been to. I promised myself that i would never buy from anyone else other than audi fort worth.

12,"June 04, 2017","Kyle Jackson went out of his way to find my wife a loan vehicle when we had an unexpected problem with our car.  We didn't have an appointment set up and had to have the vehicle towed to the dealership.  The service and sale are remarkable and we have purchased three (3) Audi vehicles from Audi Fort Worth.  We won't buy anywhere else!

13,"May 31, 2017","No matter what I do, whether I call to make an appointment or just drop my car off for service, they take FOREVER to even look at the car. When they finally do it takes them another two days to fix the most simple things. In addition to this, I had called a few days ago at 7:30 am (right when they opened) to talk to a service advisor and I PERSONALLY had to call back two more times throughout the day and STILL was told ""all service advisors are busy"" and to leave my number and they would call back. I never recieved a call. This has occured EVERY single time I have tried to do business with this dealership (I've been an audi customer for 7 years) and I have now decided to take my business elsewhere because this was absolutely awful service.",1.6
14,"March 27, 2017","My husband and I just purchased the new Q7 from DJ Camp at Fort Worth Audi and could not have been more pleased with our experience. DJ went above and beyond to help us get the best deal possible and make sure that all of our questions were answered. We purchased a few weeks ago and still if there are any problems or questions that we have DJ answers my calls or texts at any time of the day. I had a light come on, on a Friday night at 10pm and I sent DJ at text about it. The next thing I know she is calling me and has an appointment set up for me the next day. You don't find that kind of service easily these days! If you are looking to get an Audi, DJ at Fort Worth Audi is your girl! ",5.0
15,"March 20, 2017",My husband and I just bought the brand new 2017 Audi Q7 3.0 and we could not be happier will our sales Experience. DJ Camp is  friendly not pushy as I have experienced from  other dealerships. She is very knowledgeable  and answered all of our questions with patience. We will defiantly go back to buy another car from her once my husband is ready for a trade in. Thank you DJ for a delightful experience!,5.0
16,"January 07, 2017","My husband called up to Fort Worth Audi and spoke with DJ Camp about a car they had stocked on the lot. She let us know it did not have some of the features we were looking for. She immediately got a list of our must haves and 30 minutes later she had a car for us to look at. However the car was located in Kansas, not Texas. Some how she pulled some magical strings and got it there the NEXT day cleaned and ready for me to test drive. I had to work earlier that day so we did all the negotiating over text message and phone. So when I arrived to the dealer to test drive it everything was all but signed. They were willing to work with my budget and I feel light I got the vehicle for a STEAL! It is my dream car, literally has every feature I asked for and more. I have owned Mercedes, Acura, and Ford and I have never had such excellent customer service in one location. Every staff member there was kind and courteous. I cannot speak enough good things about them, but DJ was by far the shining star for my husband and I.  ",5.0
17,"December 08, 2016","Audi of Fort Worth has given me the worst dealership experience I could ever imagine. 
I had read the reviews, before buying, and decided to go with a 2015 model to avoid oil consumption issues... Well the issues managed to hunt me down. My car has 24k miles on it. Well Audi should start including QPG along with MPG on their vehicles because it burns through quarts almost as fast as gas. I took it to them and the service rep was very nice. and I  got a loaner car. 
They want me to pay for an engine rebuild out of my pocket, and are charging me for the loaner car. $65 a day while I had it. I cant get my car back until I pay the loaner fee. And it has been almost 2 weeks now and they haven't even told me the amount I owe to get my car out. so I've been having to find a ride to work and back every day I emailed them with no response. its getting old now.
They said since it had modifications the warranty is void. Well Audi is well known to have issues with their piston rings and have been sued over it before. Look up Audi oil consumption lawsuit if you want to read more about it. You can read about everybody else with the same issues
A known manufacturer defect shouldn't ever void a warranty. But they know I don't want to wind up in a lawsuit for the next year. Now I'm stuck with a car I don't even want anymore after knowing how id be treated. Also with a $5000 minimum repair, and I cant even get the car back because I don't know what I owe them for my loaner car.
 I wouldn't ever use this dealer again.
 I'd rather drive a ford focus if it meant I would be appreciated as a customer and taken car of accordingly.
It has been bad enough to scar me and will probably never own another Audi again, which is pretty bad because I was a diehard fan before all of this and grew up loving Audi. They lost a long time customer for sure
Save you time and money, I wish I did",1.6
18,"September 23, 2016","I looking for a used car, going through the motions with Autotrader and all the other websites. It seemed like I visited all of the large dealerships in the metroplex, whom all let me down and left me wondering if there was an honest used car salesman anywhere on the planet. I browsed over thousands of cars, as I was not really looking for a certain make or model, but rather just a quality car that would last a while, and a salesman who would be honest with the flaws. Well, I stumbled across a nice, used Audi A4 on Autotrader and decided that would be a nice car to own, so I scheduled an appointment at Audi Fort Worth to look at it. It was by far the best experience I had with any dealership, hands down. Alex Jaeger was an exceptional salesman, who handled everything in a professional manner. Before I took the car home, Alex had the car sent off to the car wash again to detail it, as it had a few smudges on the windshield. The attention to service and detail at this dealership is unparalleled in the metroplex, and has made me an Audi driver for life. ",5.0
19,"April 04, 2016",Amazing people and exceptional customer service. We traveled from Oklahoma to buy our first Audi there a few weeks back and we couldn't be happier!

20,"October 10, 2015","I had made a list of around ten vehicles I wanted to review as well as options desired on a vehicle.  First, I wanted a smaller vehicle than my Lexus RX 350, but I also wanted to retain the functionality of space for hauling. After excluding several of the luxury vehicles on my list, I visited Audi of Fort Worth. Although the vehicle I was interested in, the allroad, wasn't on the showroom floor, I was able to drive a nice loaner allroad. It was fun to drive, had great visibility and great technology. Tony Maloku was my sales advisor and he was very knowledgeable about the car and its technology. We priced the loaner car as well as a brand new 2016 and my SUV was evaluated as a trade-in. Two days later on Monday, Tony called me with alternatives that were very attractive. We decided to travel back to Fort Worth from Dallas to see the 2016 he had prepped for us. It was a beautiful car and perfect for my needs. If I had to reach to find anything negative about the car, it would be that it has a safety feature that turns off the radio or disconnects a phone call when in reverse--probably a very good idea!  I have no negative comments about the dealership. In fact, this was as pleasant a buying experience as I have ever had. Tony answered all of my questions and went out of his way to provide superior service. He has continued to make sure that I am happy and has helped me with some questions as I learn the technology on the car. Last week I returned to Audi of Fort Worth to have two windows tinted. They did an excellent and neat job. I was introduced to the dealership manager too. Everyone including the receptionist seems genuinely happy to provide excellent service. Thanks, Tony for a great experience!",5.0
21,"June 25, 2015","I can't express enough how much I wish there were another Audi dealership in the area. The service at Fort Worth Audi is terrible when compared to the service at Audi Dallas. If you have a service appointment at Audi Dallas, you're greeted at your vehicle where someone confirms your appointment and there is always someone available to help you unload your things if you have a loaner vehicle reserved. At Fort Worth Audi, no one greets you at your car or when you walk in. You just stand there waiting for someone to say something. Even if they see you have your hands full, no one opens the door for you or helps you with your things.

I've taken my vehicle her for service numerous times and every time I'm told the issues I'm having have been fixed, I literally jump in my car and the issues are still there!!! Recently, I called in advance to notify them of the time I'd be picking up my vehicle and expressed I was heading out of town and I was in a hurry. I was told the cashier was notified that I didn't owe anything, they would have my vehicle pulled up and that I would just need to grab my keys. When I arrived, the cashier had no idea what I was talking about, she said she didn't have my keys or my paperwork and she couldn't release my vehicle until she could confirm that I didn't owe anything. Twenty minutes later, I'm still waiting. 

Today, I called in advance to notify the service department that I was going to swing by to show them a noise my stereo has been making that they haven't been able to replicate when I've brought my vehicle in for service.  I pulled up and didn't want to turn my vehicle off for fear the noise would go away once I turn my vehicle on again but I was told to turn it off since the wait might be awhile. Sure enough, 35 minutes later when a service techician came out to hear the noise, I turn the vehicle on and the noise is gone. What a waste of time!!!

Although the team here is polite, the customer service overall is poor. I miss Audi Dallas! ",1.8

Five-months, four Audi dealerships, and three bottles of Pepto later, I had all but given up--- When, on a whim, I decided to reach out via email to the sales team at Ft. Worth Audi,  

To my surprise, within 30 minutes, my email had been answered, and within the hour, I was discussing car options directly with my new sales rep, Ryan Ziegler.   The entire buying process --  from custom order to delivery was seamless, with Ryan taking charge of all the details.

45,"January 26, 2015","Took my car in (2014 Q5 TDI )for 15k service and it has been a TOTAL NIGHTMARE. Car has been back 3 times in 2 weeks for an oil leak, which they have yet to fix!!! Spoke with the owner, he called only after he knew I had called Audi Corporate. He was unbelievably rude and accused my of lying about the oil spills in my garage. He claimed they couldn't leak because of drip pan or something to that effect. Well I can assure you the car did leak- my garage is full of oil stains. He stated that IF I would send pictures he would see if AUDI not his dealership MIGHT pay for clean up-mind you this was at my request certainly not his idea!!!!I I have never ever been talked to so rudely by anyone at a dealership much less the owner and the GM is basically non existent (yes owners son) who would not return my calls until I had called  Audi. DO NOT BUY A CAR HERE AND DO NOT HAVE YOUR CAR SERVICED HERE!!!! Should have listened to all the people that had bad things to say about this dealership-go to DALLAS AUDI not any dealership owned by the Baillargeons- they own the one in Hurst also!!! My ONLY good experience there was my service writer who was extremely kind and understanding Tie Johnson!!! Unfortunately all of this was put of her control.",1.0
46,"December 22, 2014","Buyer beware. Suggestion before buing - Google ""Audi carbon build-up"". Once you do you will find literally hundreds of posts complaining of this condition. Unfortunately, I am currently going thru the ordeal now. ~2K the first time around for manual carbon removal in which they remove your I take and scrape the build-up from you manifold and valves. Had that done about 3 weeks ago and my car has been back twice and remains i. The shop as I thpe (going on 6 days). The reason - ""random multi-cylinder misfires"" which illuminates the chk eng lite thus one is forced back to the dealer. I suspect my bill will run me another $1500 this time and I see no guarantee that the problem will be corrected. My stats: 2011 S5 4,2L purchased new from Ft. Worth Audi. I am ""lucky"" in that I got around 75000 miles on mine before the problem surfaced. Why? Because I drive mostly all highway and most at a high rate of speed. If you city drive a lot, you are doomed to face this much sooner than i (see posts). I purchased a ~$6500 extended warranty (top one offered"") but none of this is covered as they say this is ""routine maintenance"". Huh, a known and documented design problem and that is what I get. Also regarding my car, I have followed every scheduled maintenance and only the dealer has touched my vehicle so there is no neglect here. My suggestion, if you an to buy new and are shopping around, beware of any DFI reference to the engine - (Direct Fuel Injection). And if you plan on keeping the car for a while, don't buy any of the Audi's as they all have this same issue - VW too for that matter. Good luck. ",2.2
47,"September 04, 2014","Absolutely horrible service! Employees are thieves! Took my 2010 s5 in for service and my valentine 1 radar was stolen! I had it hard wired to the visor, and someone clipped the wire and never saw it again! They also stole a pair of North Face gloves I had in the glove box! That's over $600 of property stolen just from a routine maintenance! Talked to my service representative and told me he would look into it, however later he said that nobody could have taken it. Obviously if my wire is clipped and I had it in my car when I took it in, who is to blame!? Will never do any business with them again! That car was almost $70k and this is what you do, and I don't even get a compensation for my stolen items?! Pathetic. Do yourself a favor and go to Dfw Audi off 183. So much of a difference from Ft Worth Audi!",1.0
48,"June 23, 2014","This was the easiest car buying experience I've had.... Most of the interaction was via email, specifically Zoran @ Ft. Worth Audi. Zoran is a great salesman, very attentive and overall wonderful to work with - highly recommend anyone looking for an Audi in the Ft. Worth or near areas (we drove down from OKC area) to contact Zoran. You will get a great deal and the attention deserved. Everyone we encountered at the dealership was very friendly and easy to work with. Thanks to the whole team!",4.8
49,"June 21, 2014","I just purchased my 3rd Audi from Zoran. My first purchase with them was a long process, I couldn't make a decision and ended up ordering exactly what I wanted. They took their time with me and were always patient. My second was a move from an S5 to a more family friendly sedan, today I went full. Mommy and moved to a Q7. My Audi's have held amazing value and it's been an easy painless process.Z oran and the guys here are always friendly but not pushy. I never feel pressured but always well taken care of. Today I was in and out with a new car in just a couple hours, and that was only so long because I had a few test drives. 
I reccomend Ft. worth to friends all the time, it's well worth the drive from Dallas! ",4.8
50,"April 02, 2014","This was going to be my second car  from Audi, I went to dearlership in Fort worth, the sales person didn't seem like helpful,  she seems like she didn't really care if i buy a car or not. She wasn't rude but very careless and didn't seem like she is really trying to make it work. I didn't get a car from this dealership because of her attitude and and how she handle the customer. I will never go back to the dealership in Fort worth even tho i live in fort worth.  Worst experience ever. now i'm working with another sales person in Plano, he is so nice and kind and trying hard to get close to what i want.  ",2.0
51,"October 28, 2013","I bought a used 2010 S4 from this dealer about two months ago. The car was sold to me with a few rock chips and was missing a little button in the navigation wheel. They replaced the button for free on the spot under my ""factory warranty"". Which I was told had another 3000 miles left on it. I noticed the coolant was a little low and my salesman told me the system was just checked and was fine and it was ok to be a little low. I knew that wasn't accurate but I figured it would be ok as I had 3000 left on my factory warranty.

I drove my car home about 270 miles away and I noticed the car was slightly lower on its coolant. I went to my local Audi dealer and topped it off, about a month later I noticed it was low again. I decided I should bring it in for service under my factory warranty. It was then brought to my attention that my warranty actually ran out 2 months prior to me buying the car. I brought that to the attention of Ft Worth Audi and they didn't care at all and offered no compensation. After further investigation I found the leak was coming from a cracked radiator that was never repaired after an accident.

So now I have a busted radiator and no factory warranty not that the warranty would help, but I was lied to every step of the way. Audi should be ashamed to have their logo on this dealers sign and you should steer clear of them.",2.0
52,"March 12, 2013","We purchased our first Audi from Fort Worth Audi, a Certified Pre-Owned 2010 Audi S4 with the Prestige package. This was, without a doubt, the best car-purchasing experience myself or my wife has ever had.

Zoran Gutic was EXTREMELY helpful from the very first email inquiry and very knowledgable about the car. He never tried to ""sell"" me the car, but instead made sure it was the right car for my tastes. He guided us from start to finish with finess and patience, always inviting more questions about the car or dealership and making sure all our questions were answered.

Likewise, John, the Finance Manager, did not try to cram extended warrenties down our throats, but instead discussed in depth how long we planned to keep the car and what kind of driver I was (aggressive, leisurely, lots of miles each year, few miles each year), and tailored the extended coverage delivery based on that information (even steering us *away* from several categories of coverages). Every bit of the searching/buying/financing/extended coverage experience was low-pressure and very relaxed. I did purchase the nick and dent coverage because I'm nitpicky about paint blemishes etc, and a total freak when it comes to rim damage.
 
All in all, the experience was the best we've had with a dealership, and my wife and I commented on that two or three times on our lengthy drive back to Houston last night in the S4. Whether looking for new or used, we will bring our business to this dealership time and again as long as future experiences remain at this stellar level.

They work hard to make sure the prices are fair and the work is done right. They are always busy when I

My car sat there till Monday and still wasn't even looked at, the excuse was they where ""busy"" and ""understaffed"". Unless you want to be car-less for days without answers and to get the ""run-around"" on when your car will get looked at I recommend you go somewhere else.

58,"August 13, 2012","Jeff Orth and Rick provided a very professional and courteous service when i bought a CPO Audi Q5 from Fort Worth Audi. Most of the details were worked out over the pohne and via email. When i showed up to check the car, test drive and purchase it, the entire process was completed in about 2 hours (fast and friendly experience compared to my previous experiences at Toyota and Honda delaerships........although i still love my Toyota Avalon). Jeff spent about 20 to 30 mintues going over how all the features worked and how to set up the car including iPhone connection. I am happy with my experience at Fort Worth Audi and as long as the car performes well, i will be going back there for another Audi. ",4.3
