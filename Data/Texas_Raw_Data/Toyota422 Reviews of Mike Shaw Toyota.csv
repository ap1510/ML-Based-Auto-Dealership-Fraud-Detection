My job has kept me very busy & I need a place to go that provides an expert level of care. They don't miss a thing. My service adviser of choice is Michael Stewart for honesty & integrity in recommendations & repair oversight. Why go anywhere else? ",5.0
1,"March 06, 2019"," I took my truck in for its 10000 mile service. And guess what I had marked my tires cause I trust no one. They claimed to have rotated the tires, it took long enough and they could have but they were still in the same place that I had before going in. Over all I am totally surprised how this organization still runs. I know that if I had these issues in less than a year odds are they are doing it to more people that blindly being taken advantage of.",1.6
2,"December 18, 2018","I just bought a. 2018 Rav4. I Wanted to buy back my trade. Originally I was told it would be possible. But when I returned to do so ,I was given some xxxxxxxx story that I couldnt buy it back.. Sammy Pedraza gave me some bs story that it didnt pass inspection so they would be liable if something happened. I owned that car for 9 years.  I hate when a man thinks that because I'm female he can feed me any bs to send me on my way. However its good enough for auction.. That arrogant A  needs to go back to Fresno Tx. Corpus has no place for him.  Mr. Shaw I would get rid of this guy. This sales guy is rude. Do not buy from him. Sadly I will not buy from Mike Shaw again.",1.0

44,"November 23, 2018", Working with Anthony Johnson was absolutely awesome when I bought my dream car. He made it happen when I didn't think that it would. Honestly I didn't have such great credit but Anthony got me the car of my dreams and I was super excited. He made the price work for me and we got the deal done. Abel absolutely helped here's where the problem happened my dream car turned into a nightmare car. Once it was out of Anthony and Abel's hands it went to the service department. They sold me a car that had a torque converter problem in the transmission and also it had a cracked head... The car is under warranty for powertrain and that's awesome but it makes it really hard to cash in a Powertrain warranty when it's a Chevrolet and so I have to deal with Chevrolet. I was allowed to use a rental car or rather a borrowed car from Mike Shaw the first time while we figured out what we would do the bad thing is Chevrolet didn't fix the problem as a matter of fact they kind of ignored the problem and had my car for a month. Meanwhile I'm still making payments on this dream car. I get it back it still has problems and Mike Shaw says that I have to go with Chevrolet from now on. Chevrolet will only let me borrow a car for 3 days after that I have to have a rental they will only rent me a car for 4 days on their dime and then it's on me while I still make my car payment. I don't know what I'm supposed to do I can't make a payment and rent a car also and I don't know what to do I don't trust the Chevy dealership anymore that I worked with so now I have to go to a new one. And not such a big deal but it definitely does well my mind now that so many other things have happened I do have to mention that in the service department when they detailed my car and they waxed it for the first time before I left they left massive swirl marks on that card that still have not come out to this day I have only had my car since May 2018 it's only November 2018 and I have had nothing but problems with my 2017 Camaro I would totally buy from my show again but I'm really bummed about their service department. But AJ and Abel Rock so they really do a great job in sales.,3.4
45,"November 22, 2018","As a ongoing Toyota owner i can assure anyone that Toyota as a brand is far more superior than any other, attention to detail and commitment to quality are just a few key points.

He updated me on what was going on with my car - I had a slow leak on my tire and he let me know the status of the repair before the work was done. I do think that the price for repairing it (had nail on the tire) was a little high.  ,4.6
62,"November 08, 2018",the truck was dirty so it took them longer than I was told to get it back.  I wish that when the service people drive my vehicles they would leave the seat adjustment alone....you are just driving it around the building not cross country.,4.8

74,"November 01, 2018","So I saw a Facebook post from Mike Shaw Toyota where they were having an end of month sale where they guaranteed you would drive out in a vehicle. I, of course was skeptical. GREG RODRIGUEZ was the salesman who posted that on Facebook, so I called and asked about the promotion and he asked me to come on by, so I did. As I walked in I was greeted by a very nice lady there at the front and I asked for Greg Rodriguez, so she called him to the front and she offered me a beverage and asked me to take a seat. A couple of minutes and Greg Rodriguez comes to find me, he greeted me politely and asked me how he could be of help. I let him know that I was interested in a car, a Corolla orbs Camry, and I asked him if he could check my credit and let me know if I qualified for a loan to get a car. I told him that I was more than happy to give him my info and he could let me know the results, so he says to me to follow him. He took me out to the lot to see some cars, he was very talkative as we were looking at cars, never rushing me to make a decision. We picked 2 cars, just to see if I would be approved, we went back inside, he brought out some paperwork and asked me some questions also asked how much of a down payment I could give and what monthly payment I would be able to afford. With that info he went and started the process and about 15 minutes later he comes back to me and asks if I can put more money down and I said that I couldn't, so he went back and kept working on my deal and 30 minutes later he came back with the news that I was approved for a 2019 Toyota Corolla!!!! GREG RODRIGUEZ is the BEST!!! He got me in a new vehicle without any hassles, I have already referred a friend to Greg Rodriguez and Mike Shaw Toyota.

These coupons need to be explained when recieved, they are deceiving. I called 3 xs Mr. Barlow never returned my call. I left messages on his voicemail.

190,"August 22, 2018","Having purchased from Mike Shaw Toyota in the past we were surprised to have this experience.  
They had the 4Runner in the exact colors I had been hoping for and ultimately, we were able to negotiate what we considered was a fair price.  On a different note; they did let us join in their lunch during our long wait to finalize our purchase.  Thank you so much for that.  
This dealership now appears to be just like any other; more about money and less about the customers.  If you decide to purchase then plan on at least a 4 hour process...this with having excellent credit and gave a substantial down payment.
However, their offer for our trade-in was very low-ball.  The salesman misrepresented the presence of  paint protection film on the front of the vehicle.  We have verified that it is not there.  They wanted to charge us for the wire harness running to the hitch; even though it was already installed.  The salesman did not discuss the difference of getting the advertised 2.9% interest rate or getting the listed ""Keep It Wild"" $1000 discount for the vehicle.
Then it was on to Finance and the real smoke an mirrors show.  It started with having to choose between the advertised 2.9% interest rate or getting the listed ""Keep It Wild"" $1000 discount for the vehicle.  We were never shown the difference in payments between the two choices; just the final payment keeping the $1000 and an interest rate of 4.25% and it's payment.  We were never actually shown the total costs for the Extended Warranty/Service plans and that discussion was extremely confusing.  All we were shown was the change to our payments. Was that the intent ?  They tried to charge us again for the ""Vehicle Protection Package"" listed on the sticker and it does not appear to actually have been changed on the final paperwork after we had asked about it.  We were given a tube of what appears to be paint cleaner/wax for the Vehicle Protection Plan that recommends application twice a year.  The tube appears to maybe work for one application.  This ""Package"" was never really discussed with us.  We are wondering if the exterior/interior protection was really applied.  The package we received from Lexus included much more than a tube of car wax !

He told us finance would be coming out soon to help us and after waiting one  hour we went and found Alex to tell him we had been waiting an hour. He  checked and said we were next.  We waited another half hour and we asked again and he said we were coming up and he sat and visited with us about 15 minutes and guy from finance came out and introduced himself and said he had our file and he would come back for us in 15 minutes.  And hour later we were still waiting and several people around us had gone to other finance people and were done and gone.  We went to our salesman again and he went to his boss and they said the finance guy that was helping us had put someone else in before us.  So they scrambled around and found Alex to help us.  He was very apologetic and got us in his office immediately. Very nice man and did a great job.

305,"October 17, 2017","My granddaughter and I had searched for a first car for her at many dealerships in the Corpus Christi area. They had all been painful experiences 
due to poor customer service as well as other reasons. We finally went to Mike Shaw Toyota and it was a pleasure in every aspect! We worked with Jay and Jeff as our salespeople and Valerie in the office. They were all three very knowledgable and just the type of people you actually enjoy meeting and felt very assured when doing business with them. Jeff and another salesperson even delivered the car to my home, which is about an hour away from the business.

I have and will continue to recommend Mike Shaw Toyota to friends and family!

347,"October 06, 2014","I recently bought a used vehicle here at Mike Shaw Toyota with Jerry Rice as my sales representative. The reason I bought a new vehicle was because my previous vehicle was diagnosed with a blown head gasket and I couldn't even drive it 10 miles without it over heating on me. My mom suggested to use this dealership because she just bought a vehicle from here a year ago. The day my car overheated, I told my mom about needing to get a new car, and she called this dealer and her sales representative is no longer with the company and so Jerry stepped in to do what he could to help. My mom emailed him with a few requirements (I was at work so I was unable to do it myself) and he selected a few cars that matched the criteria and was hoping I would like. I went home and looked myself and sure enough, two cars that Jerry picked, I had also picked. I waited until the next day to contact him (it was around midnight when I got off work) and we set a time for me to go in, got the paperwork process started, etc. Jerry offered to come pick me up because he knew my car couldn't make it to the dealership (I live an hour away), and knowing I didn't have a ride, I accepted the offer. We got to the dealership and looked at a few of my choices, I test drove my top pick, and my second pick, and still was like ""let me see what other choices are here just in case"" so Jerry showed me a few others, let me test drive as well, answered any and all questions I had. He pulled like four or five different sets of keys for me to be able to test drive if I decided to, but I felt uneasy about a few of them and he said it's fine, there's a car out there for every one. I ended up choosing my top choice and I have to say I'm very satisfied with it. I will definitely be recommending anyone that needs a new car to go to Mike Shaw Toyota and ask for Jerry Rice!

371,"December 11, 2012","I found the vehicle I had been looking for online at this dealership.  I made a phone call that was promptly directed to the sales manager and then to a sales representative that assisted me in providing all the information I asked for.  This dealership was almost 4 hours from my home, but they had the vehicle I was looking for at a comfortable price and I chose to drive down to work a deal out with my trade-in.  I had a price in mind and negotiated with both the sales representative and sales manager to narrow our difference on what I was offered on the trade-in.  I gave in a little and they gave in a little... I feel like we were both happy with the price.  Two significant experiences made this a very satisfactory transaction.  One was that I was able to purchase this used car as certified due to only one stipulation that it didn't meet and the dealership working that out.  The other, I left the dealership on the 4 hour return trip home, about 40 minutes out the tire sensor indicator alerted me to an issue with a tire.  This was at about 6:45pm. I called the sales representative, he said to come on back to the dealership and they'd take care of it, not knowing whether it was road hazard or otherwise.  They found a faulty sensor in one of the tires, replaced it and by 9:00pm I was back on the road with no further incidents.  I received a follow up phone call the next morning from my sales representative checking to see if all was ok and that I made it home safe and sound. I did.",5.0

So stay away from Mike Shaw if you are in business for a used car, they want to sell, after they got your money, they don't care about you or your car anymore, but they annoy you with automated calls, that your service will come up and so on! 
In this case, the air bag warning comes on all the time, the engine is leaking oil and the drivers seat doesnot adjust, so major issues even safety issues, but they don't care! What a customer service! Never again from dealer! Stay away from these guys!

After I posted the above, we received a call from Robert Morris to bring in the car to have the issues taken care of. So this morning we took the car in and were told, that the safety issues (airbag warning and oil leak) will be taken care of with no cost to us. The adjustments of the drives seat will be inspected and if there is just a minor thing wrong, it also will be taken care of. Robert gave us a replacement car for the time of repairs.
So the only one I blaming is the sales man. Other than that - they all were really friendly and helpful. If all the problems are solved, I will take this negative review off and give them a totally different rating!
09.28.2012
The oil leak and the airbag warning light was taken care of - after TWO WEEKS!!!!
For the repair at the drivers seat they asked $ 1,200 !?!
After I got the car back, I checked it out, removed the seat (4 bolts and 2 connectors), it was repaired within 5 minutes! Just the hinges were rusted! A little bit of WD40 and moving the hinges a few times, it works perfectly!
What kind of mechanics do they have working in their shop? Two weeks for this repairs - ridiculous! If they would have checked out the car befor sales, the problems wouldn't be there in the first place! I wonder, whether they take that long for repairs on their Toyotas. Anyway, my rating stays as bad as it is, because my experience was that bad - sorry but never again Mike Shaw Toyota and for sure never again &quot;super Tommy&quot;! By the way, they didn't have change when I paid, so they still owe me some $ 8 and some change which they wanted to send me a check for - since I'm fed up with them, they shall keep it as a tip for their mechanics.
11.10.2012
Finally, after weeks of repairs, it got my Jeep back! Thanks to Mr. Morris it all worked out nicely. For the time of repairs he issued me a replacement car to use. The service was excellent, even though it started out really bad. Lesson learned: Never buy a used car other than the brand the dealership sells new. Thank you Mr. Morris for your concern and understanding - and of course for the excellent service!",4.4

I never felt like they were just trying to make a sale. He really looked at the money we had and then found a car that would work for us. When we are ready to buy a new car again we will go back to Carlos. The wait time from the bank took a little while but that is not really the dealerships fault.

Not only that but I accomplished it without my husband being there.  He was actually proud, so that says alot.  Seriously though the whole process was smooth.  There was not back and forth, let me go ask my sales manager stuff.  We made a deal just by sitting and talking all together with the salesman and the sales manager.  Very good experience.  This is my second vehicle from Mike Shaw and I would highly recommend anyone go to them for a new or used vehicle.  I tried purchasing one from their competitor and was first insulted by what they wanted to offer me on my used Toyota, and then they wouldn't budge of the price of their ""used"" Toyota which they obviously thought held it's value alot more than mine.  They didn't even try to negotiate.  So if you want a Toyota go see Mike Shaw!  Ask for Carlos Flores...",5.0

But I did and was intrigued by the information it showed of my current car payment and how much I could save based on my pre-qualification. I called the man who's name was on it, Leo Hernandez. I spoke to him over the phone, he said he could help me. I made an appointment with him and he introduced me to Carols Flores. Carlos Flores and Leonard Hernandez helped me with financing a vehicle when I didn't think it was possible for me to get any help. Leonard is my hero!! They were most respectful of my situation and displayed  professionalism not only in sales but also in finding a lender and working their magic (a true skill) to make this happen for me. I will forever be most appreciative and will recommend them to everyone. I know Leonard worked really hard for me and showed he would not give up until the deal was done. He should get a raise and be rewarded!!!! Carlos was most helpful in finding a vehicle that I was comfortable with. I have purchased several vehicles in the last 30 years but I can say this has been my most enjoyable experience in purchasing an automobile.

Thank you Carlos and LEONARD!!!!!!

382,"June 11, 2012","I found my 2008 chevy 2500 that I regret purchasing online and happened to be going to corpus christi  when I did.  The initial price wasn't bad so I went to look at the truck.  When I got there, no one was in the office that could help me, I had to wait 30 min for help.  The test drive went well but negotiations was useless.  They lied to me about ""Black Book Values,"" Witch doesn't exist thus giving me 3000 less on Blue book value trade-in with lots of extras.  The truck I bought had a little body damage but nothing major so I was ok with it.  There were a few requests that I had, wash the sand under the truck, a good detail, and replace the high beam bulbs.  Well they never washed the sand under the truck, I found dirt in one of the cup holders, and in the mist of changing the headlights, they broke the mounts to the headlamp assembly and neglected to tell me.  On a trip to New Mexico my headlamp fell out of is place and dangled by the wiring harnesses.  I had to replace that at my own cost.  The truck witch is partially my fault, didn't come with owners manuals, nor did it come with a tire tool.  They replaced the tires on the truck and one of my tires kept running down on air witch was due to improperly installed valve stem.  The spare key they gave me doesn't even go to my truck and in order to get one I have to pay $200 for a transponder key.  Later I found out through another dealer that if there are cracks in the window, the dealer is responsible for replacing the window, witch I had to replace at my own cost.  I feel I was taken advantage of because I'm Hypoglycemic and since I was there for 5 hours without anything to eat I rushed into the papers and they used that to my advantage.  I have many connections with fleet owners and I recommended to them to never buy from any Mike Shaw Dealers. ",2.0

I explained my situation and told him I wanted a new car as had too many bad experiences with used cars.  I told him my price range and credit challenge and without reservation he showed me some cars without pushing me one way or another.  I chose the Corolla S and could never be happier!  Although, I did not get the trade I quite expected, it was fair considering the problems it was having or getting ready to have.  My payments are about $40 dollars higher than I wanted, but considering the money I would have had to put into the other, this was not an issue.

Valerie Snyder quickly checked the inventory to ensure they had what I needed as well as the price I wanted.  Rick Garza had a Tundra in the front sales floor ready for inspection and a drive, as soon as we arrived. My family and I were treated to snacks, beverages and a friendly and relaxed atmosphere.  We answered a few questions and were given a quick sample of numbers upon our request.  Needless to say, because we found Mike Shaw was the best deal in town, we moved on to Mr. Jim Waldrop in financing, which treated us like family. His effortless expertise even got us the best rates available. We have only purchased new Toyotas in our family from the Corolla to the Sienna and now our 2012 Tundra and have never been treated as well as at Mike Shaw, no wonder he has been named Dealer of the Year.  Take a short trip to Calallen and you too will see why. We also take the short drive to service our other Toyotas there. Once you are a Toyota owner, with built in Texas parts, you will never buy another maker.

406,"September 17, 2011","My first major encounter with Mike Shaw Toyota dealt with my 2003 Toyota Tacoma and the dreaded 100,000 maintenance mile marker!  I went the whole nine yards and purchased a new timing belt, drive belts, water pump, transmission fluid flush, differential fluid change, coolant flush, and an oil change – all for under $1000 including tax!  In addition, I received a free “loaner” vehicle to use and still attend work and be productive!  How does this compare to the other local Toyota dealer (Champion Toyota)?  Well, I still have the quote for the exact maintenance items above, and the total was between 1400-1500 bucks– what a rip off Champion Toyota of Corpus Christi is (at least the service department!!).  Also, forgot to mention that they do NOT participate in the loaner car program – but I could have received a free ride to the mall (priorities are all wrong if you ask me!).  Here comes the worst part, I took the vehicle maintenance quote from Mike Shaw Toyota over to Champion Toyota of Corpus (since I reside right off of Ennis Joslin Road – approximately 0.5 miles from Champion) and asked if they could match the maintenance total provided in order to keep from traveling all the way to Mike Shaw (approximately 52 miles away round trip).   Well what a surprise, they do NOT do that either!  Not sure how the other Champion affiliates deal with customers, but my guess is it has to be better than this.   All of my future business, as well as recommendations will be directed towards Mike Shaw Toyota – great job Guys!  And thanks for the help Art A.!

My second encounter with Mike Shaw Toyota dealt with the purchase of a used 2006 Ford Expedition, which was a spur of the moment necessity.  Literally - my family planned on traveling with 6 passengers, not the smallest body styles to say the least; plus one dog, and of course personal belongings from South Texas all the way to Northeast Texas - approximately a 10 hour drive for them - in our former 2002 4Runner (and they were scheduled to leave later the same afternoon).  As you can see, this scenario spelled disaster from the beginning.  In addition, the 4Runner was NO where near tip top condition - in fact we ended up losing around $3300 on the trade-in.  Now, I informed Mr. Jason Rylance of the ""situation"" and what vehicle type I had hoped to purchase (at least 6 passenger, reliable, low mileage vehicle – and of course at a reasonable price).  Typically, it is impossible to find a reliable used vehicle for a descent price (not aggressively marked up).  However, I believe I happen to be in the right place at the right time.  Jason was super helpful, and at no time did he try the aggressive used car salesman approach, he simply understood our situation and tried to accommodate it as best he could.  Now, after the vehicle was chosen and all preliminary numbers were reviewed and agreed upon - it was time to visit the dreaded finance manager (or so I thought).   I am 28 years old, and have purchased 4-Tacomas, 1-4Runner, and 2-other American made vehicles; the point is I have been through this process before, and I have never dealt with a “finance guy” as professional, understanding, and willing to do everything within his limits to make this process smooth and still ensure that I received the best deal possible as Mr. Bill Maloy.  The overall experience was smooth, and the best part is that my mother, sisters, and myself left Mike Shaw that day with a sense of fulfillment.  I really felt like we came to the right place, and in the end we both benefited from the purchase.  Thanks again Mike Shaw!

419,"May 01, 2011","Today I went to talk a salesman about purchasing a new Toyota at Mike Shaw Toyota in Corpus Christi TX. I had Invoice numbers from Edmunds.com that I took with me. I asked to see a car that they had listed on their website as in their inventory. Guess what? it wasn't actually in stock, Their inventory shown for sale on their website has many vehicles that are marked as available in the vehicle description however that that actually means is it will be delivered to the dealer at some point in the future! The Salesman that was helping us pointed out for me the &quot;in-stock&quot; text that was in the description for one of the vehicles that they actually had on the lot. After I showed the salesman the invoice numbers that I got from Edmunds.com to see if  we could deal for the car that was &quot;not in stock yet&quot; he took them to the sales manager. Now for the real killer.. The salesman came back with an invoice for the &quot;not in stock yet&quot; vehicle that was several thousand dollars higher than the Edmunds.com invoice price &amp; informed me that Edmunds prices must be wrong because here is the actual invoice for this almost $40,000 vehicle &amp; the invoice price is ONLY about $1500 below MSRP. Yea right, &amp; my trade in is my grandmothers old car &amp; she only drove it to church on Sunday, so its really worth an extra $2000 above NADA average trade in, trust me on that. I don't recommend shopping with them unless you will be happy paying fairly close to MSRP for your next new car. 
I don't mind accepting average trade in price for my low mileage trade that's in good condition because they have to retail it &amp; that might take some time. And I don't mind paying $400 - $500 over the dealers actual cost for a new vehicle.  
However don't insult my intelligence with a customized invoice &amp; tell me that information I got from one of the Internets best resources is that far from correct... 
(Update I have been contacted by the sales team at Mike Shaw Toyota & They are working on finding a vehicle for me. I will add the conclusion & update with all info at a later time).",3.0

We had the best experience ever. We are so happy that now we have a Toyota dealership that is closer to Kingsville. ,5.0
421,"August 29, 2009","Best car buying experience I ever had!  The Mike Shaw Internet Team was the best.  Mr. Medina and Rick Garza treated me like family from the moment we walked in.  The dealership is absolutely beautiful and they had a playroom for the kids.  I strongly recommend Mike Shaw Toyota to all the people that are tired of being treated poorly.  Thank you and God Bless you for the best experience ever!
