0,"October 05, 2015","Just wanted to say kudos to Stuart Allen at Randall Noe in Commerce! My experience was wonderful. He was courteous, knowledgable and treated me with respect. So many times, women are not treated as thought they know what they are doing when buying a car. Thank you Stuart!

1,"January 02, 2015",Drove all the way to the dealership in Commerce to test drive a Ford Super Duty found online after speaking with a salesman who said there was wiggle room in pricing.  After test drive and waiting over 20 minutes on salesman to return with price was told it was miss marked!! Not $37100 but rather $42000! Waste of 3 hours driving time in the rain plus fuel and entire evening! Will NEVER buy from this dealership!!,1.0
2,"December 22, 2014",I went online and visited the Dealership as we went through the purchase of a pre-owned vehicle my salesman showed me the vehicle and the listed price was 4595.00 as we closed the deal an additional 1995.00 was added to the purchase price as added features to the vehicle and I was told these are mandatory add-ons by the dealership when I started asking questions about proof of added features the price dropped and the salesman became distant. My overall experience with this dealership is I would not and will not purchase another vehicle from them and I will be contacting the main branch to voice my complaints.,2.4
