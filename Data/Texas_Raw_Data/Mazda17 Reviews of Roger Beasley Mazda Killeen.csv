It was so easy, the staff and managers are a delight and easy to deal with.  They met all my needs, answered all my questions, provided the best service and I purchased my first Mazda.  I LOVE MY NEW MAZDA. I believe I received a great deal for the Mazda I purchased, they worked with me until my needs were met, no hassle at all .  It rides smooth and is roomy inside.  Highly recommend.",5.0

No quick push sales or financing, they will let decide. No problem recommending this dealership. Every experience with the service department was also smooth with minimal waiting. Very professional!!!",5.0
3,"August 08, 2016",I have been with Roger Beasley Mazda for 3 years now and have never had an issue. Their service department is always on point and Loraine is amazing! She is always there to take care of me and whatever needs to get done for my Mazda6. She is absolutely one of the reasons I will keep coming back to the Killeen store even after I move to San Antonio in a month!,5.0
4,"July 11, 2016",This is a great place to go to for a car - they do not play games and try to take advantage of you.  Everyone is very friendly and I have been going to this place for years and I have only owned Mazdas.  Brian Calderon and Jordan Vaca really took care of me and my mother - both us got cars on the same day.  Great sales people and the people in the Service Dept are great too!,5.0

Service personnel were courteous and very nice to my wife and I. This is not my first visit to Roger Beasley Mazda in Killeen, and have always had a good experience. Awesome service shop. I would recommend it hands down.",5.0

10,"January 06, 2016","My wife and I purchased a used truck in record time and the experience was so easy and fast. Our salesman, James Draeger, was very friendly, courteous and helpful--he took get care of us. The sales manager, Gi Choe, handled the business end of the deal because the business manager was away (we were there late in the evening).

We completed the sales process in less than an hour. Everyone was extremely competent and we felt very relaxed.

Many thanks! Oh, and we love our new/(used) Toyota Tacoma truck!",4.8

13,"October 26, 2015","This dealership can actually say that ""people come from miles away"" to do business with Roger Beasley Mazda... I was very impressed with everyone that answered my questions and guided me happily into the driver's seat of one of the finest sports cars in the world... The new 2016 Mazda MX-5 Club!
   Our daughter bought her first car (a new, 2012 MX-5) and raved about how well that she was treated. So, when it was time to replace my 1994, Mazda Miata, I reached-out to Roger Beasley Mazda... and you know, our daughter was correct! Great dealership!!",5.0
14,"December 18, 2011","The whole experience was outstanding!!!! I bought my 2011 Mazda 3 from Dennis Eakin Mazda in July 2011 and have absolutely loved it!!! The customer service was amazing, everyone was friendly and extremely helpful. They knew exactly what I wanted and I was in my new car very quickly!!! I recommend this dealership to all my friends and family and they all tell me the same thing, best car buying experience they've ever had!!!!

A few months after purchasing my Mazda 3 I took it to the same place for a full-service. After receiving such amazing service for a second time I had to find a way to express my appreciation. They checked and serviced my entire car in just 30 min and even found time to wash her up!!! I highly recommend this dealership for anything car related, my friends have even bought used cars!!!",5.0

16,"October 13, 2011","The have incredibly high mark up values on all of their cars and they lack a large variety of selection. I was going to buy a 2011 mazda 3 from this dealership and I wanted to test drive it before I made my purchase and it took the sale representative 20 minutes to get tags for the car and a key. Really 20 minutes! When I tried to confront him about the length of time it was taking he passed me off to another sales representative who then tried to show me another car which was way out of my previously states price range. I ended up taking my business to another dealership, where I received much better customer service and a better price. After about a week after this incident happened, the sales representative called me to see if I was going to purchase the out of my budget car and I told him that I had already purchased a car from another dealership in the area. He did not apologize for the bad experience, instead he just hung up. I will never go back to this dealership again and I have informed all of my friends and family to steer clear from the bad quality of this particular dealership.  ",1.0
