This is the most honest and reliable service experience I have ever had. I highly recommend the HUB Hyundais team!

15,"May 10, 2019","Got a used Hyundai, it has several recalls needing action, and doesn‚Äôt have Apple CarPlay installed (although it can handle it / be updated for it). They ended up needing to order all of the parts for the recall and to do the CarPlay update. Fine. However, they said they would call back to schedule the service, but never did. We called them back to find out they had received all of the parts - and tried to schedule an appointment for a Saturday (as I work and need a car during the work week). They scheduled the appointment. We called the day before the appointment just to check in (as we have had other issues with this dealership before) - and were told the person that does that wouldn‚Äôt be available on Saturday. It has now been over a week to just schedule the update and recall fixes. Worst dealership ever....no more chances for this place.",1.0
16,"May 07, 2019","If I could give no stars I definitely would. Don't bother coming to this particular location even if an appointment is made because they will make you come all the way here for your appointment time just to tell you they will not be able to check your car for another 3 days. They purposely waste your time and are very unprofessional! They will also claim that their online appointment system is down so they can't see that you have set up an appointment on their website but apparently are still accepting online appointment requests. Just be honest and say you guys are short staffed and double booked appointments. The Katy location is so much better with customer service, honesty and they have way more business than this 290 location. Never again!",1.0
17,"April 25, 2019","I brought my 2016 Elentra in for a new transmission which went out at 91,000 milesüò¨üò£ on Feb 28,2019. It took 2 weeks to get to be approved for a free transmission. It took ANOTHER month and a half to get the part!!! NEVER in all of my 42 years of living had I heard of such thing. They had NO loaners when I needed one. Thank GOD I was able to use my husbands new car to go to work, which he got due to being involved in a near fatal car accident on March4. He got a new car on March 18..it took till April 14th to get a loaner for HUB HYUNDAI!! I finally got the call on April 9th that my car was ready. I asked for an oil change hoping that it'll at least be free due to the LONG wait on my car...NOPE. I was charged for it. NEVER AGAIN WILL I BUY FROM THEM AGAIN!!

31,"October 25, 2018","Got the car in for service last Saturday, had to wait 2 hours to get the estimates, and another hour for service to be done. Asked to have the wiper refills replaced, but had both wipers replaced. Was charged over $300 to replace the hood struts. The car stalled on me that night. Took it back on Sunday, but there's no key drop box, so I decided to take it somewhere to have it fixed instead. 
3 questions: 
- Why did I have to wait 2 hours, even though I made an appointment in advance?
- Why did they replace both wipers, when I only wanted to replace the refills?
- Why did they charge me over $300 to replace the hood struts? The struts wouldn't cost me that much at the store. That's  a tremendous overcharge.",2.6

79,"October 03, 2017","My Equus was scheduled for service a 7500 miles. Your dealership called, made an appointment for 10:00 am for October 3, 2017. I planned my day around my car being taken. At 9:55 am, George called and said that since my car had been serviced early, at approx 4000 miles, that it was not necessary for the car to be serviced..this is after it was scheduled and according to warranty, the car was STILL scheduled to be serviced at 7500. I am 83 years old and did not want to deal with this guy. Granted I got a little sideways, and not being able to understand everything that he was SCREAMING, I asked him where he was from. This made him even madder and he started yelling at me on the phone. THIS IS HIS job to diffuse customers and to deal with the issue. At this point, he says his dealership will no longer service my car and I had to find another dealership. Granted I should not have gotten irritated, but his attitude left little room. George does not deserve a job at what once was an outstanding dealership, but he has ruined any chance of doing business with these people again. This was not a 10,000 old Ford, but at 62,000 dollar car. I will escalate this to the Better Business Bureau as well as Hyundai Corporate for his heinous behavior. 

Thank you George ....you are a true loser when it comes to Customer Support.

For a relatively small dealership their selection, at least of used cars, was fairly good. Of course quantity was limited, but there was nice diversity in their selection. But this place really shines with their staff. Honestly, buying a car isn't exactly fun for me, same as many people I'd assume, however; this dealership doesn't leave you feeling like you need to shower once you leave. As are many salesmen, the men that worked with me to find a car were not only friendly, but something past that. I'm not sure what word to use here but they don't feel like salesmen. They're there to talk specs and numbers when you'd like to, or just keep a friendly chat going while you're test driving.  
I can't say I felt rushed or on the spot like in other dealerships, I could actually think. 
So while sure, they're job is still to sell you a car, they're tactics seem to revolve more around hospitality rather than shady deals or slimy wording. And that's not to say their deals aren't good, because they are. As I was told numerous times, don't look at the sticker price, let the salesmen fight for a price that works with you. It goes better than expected. 

All in all, for a car dealership, its a great one. I got a fair deal on a great car, what more can you ask for?",5.0
212,"August 20, 2016","I bought a pre-owned car from Hub without ever seeing it or driving it!  My daughter and son-in-law undertook the task of finding me a pre-owned vehicle and wound up at Hub fairly late on a Saturday evening.  Within 15 minutes they had sent me photos and outlined the ""deal"" for each.  When they got home we talked about the vehicles they had driven at all the dealerships they had visited and it was time to make my decision.  They were so enthusiastic about Sales Associate Chris Torres and how ""un-salesie"" he was yet still professional, personal and easy to make a deal with that I was ready to buy from Hub!  I picked the car up on Monday night and unfortunately there were a few details on the car to be resolved and Chris Torres was committed to making every detail right.  Even though it took three return visits not only did he greet me by name, but so did the service office staff and the friendly sales and administrative team in the showroom.  COO/GM Mark Odat gave me his card and personal assurance that the team at Hub would make every detail right.  After having purchased at least ten new and pre-owned vehicles in my lifetime from various dealerships in the Houston Metro area, I can say the team at Hub are outstanding! I will absolutely recommend Chris Torres and Hub and when the time comes to purchase another vehicle - Hub and Chris Torres will be first on my list.

unfortunately my vehicle was totaled in the recent flood. I came in last week because this dealership advertised they could assist flood victims with loaner cars because rental companies were out of vehicle. I had explained over the phone that i was inquiring on their advertisement about the flood assistance program and they confirmed they did in fact have this program. So I came in and told the person up front why I was there. I was not ready to purchase a vehicle yet as i was still going through the claim process but wanted information about the flood assistance program. I filled out a form which they said they needed on file their system and if i was given a loaner. and was assured SEVERAL times they would not run my credit or anything of the sort unless I had selected to purchase a vehicle. WELL the sales associate assisting me Carlos Barboza took it upon himself to submit a purchase order to a lien holder for a vehicle I NEVER even looked at or discussed. Thankfully the bank called to confirm the purchase order and was kind enough to send me the proof. This purchase order had all my information, amounts for a vehicle and even had hand written adjustments and a signature. I went in and spoke to a sales manager Mark who apologized and chocked it up to an error due to sloppy handling. It is very hard to believe it was and error. How does someone hand sign a purchase order without even confirming who's information it contains? Last time I checked that was fraud.

317,"April 01, 2016","""Although some of my responses to the questions may reflect somewhat negatively on the salesperson (Carlos), in fact I was very pleased with our experience.  Carlos was very straightforward, informative, and helpful, did not try to push a bunch of extras or get us to buy a vehicle that did not suit our needs.  I would definitely like to deal with him again in the future.  On the downside, I noticed that on the hand-written """"total cost"""" sheet that showed the agreed-upon price along with the tax, title, license, and other fees/costs, the grand total did not match the sum of the listed costs.  The total was $299 more than what the numbers added up to.  I questioned that difference, and it turned out that it was due to someone automatically adding in (sneaking in??) a dealer service (window vin etching).  I don't know who filled out this sheet.  I suspect this is done with all vehicles at this dealership, and I did not like that in the least.  Even when we went to the finance person to sign the paperwork and pay, when he brought up the charges it still had the extra $299 included, so I ended up having to ask multiple times to have this charge removed from the total.  I believe Jordan Azar was our finance person, and he was very accommodating and nice, and this experience  was very positive.  But I was not pleased with whoever filled out that """"hand-written final costs"""" sheet.  I would like to come to this dealership again when I am ready to buy another vehicle for my younger son, however if I recommend this dealership to anyone I will definitely let them know about the """"hidden"""" charges that will be attempted.""",4.2

I was hesitant to come back since the customer service i received back then was less than satisfactory but i wanted the first check up service to be completed by the dealer. As i was talking to Dave Cambpell he was more then happy to try and rectify this previous experience and had the Elantra cleaned out for me. When it was completed we drove our 2006 Ford Explorer to pick it up. It was then that Jordan asked me if i wanted to get out of that and into a new car. I told him i didn't have the patience to sit through that especially after the way we were treated before. He then told me no pressure and was very relaxed and polite. I said what the heck, tell me what you will give me for the Explorer and we can see how far we are from getting a vehicle. He was a pleasure to work with. Very informative and didn't pressure me to buy what i didn't want. I told him i very specific needs and since i was so close to paying off the Explorer i really didn't need to get a car. But he found the exact Santa Fe I was interested in (literally the last car in the lot we looked at) and we test drove it and i said lets work some numbers. This was the least amount of pressure i have ever had when purchasing a vehicle. Jordan was excellent and Dave more then made up for the previous experience.

406,"October 24, 2015","Online purchase prices are incorrect and not honored. This is the most shady car dealership I've ever dealt with.

I typically take online reviews with a grain of salt since people have a tendency to write negative reviews more often than positive reviews...so we gave these guys a chance. BIG MISTAKE! I realize that the bait and switch is common practice in car sales, but we were repeatedly lied to my not only the sales rep, but even when the General Manager/CEO of HUB got involved. The GM even had the lack of class to call me at home and try to backtrack on the offer he had approved the night before. When I called him on it and said his business practices were unethical, he hung up on me.

Here's how it began: HUB Mitsubishi had a few of the models, trims and transmission we were looking for. We contacted sales rep Sal through their website, who e-mailed back and said he ""has several of these models"" on their lot ready to test drive and quoted us a price. When we showed up the next day, he magically didn't have any of them available, but only had more expensive versions with upgraded packages. After his Manager, Ed, got involved, he made excuses about how it takes several days or weeks to update their website and they had just ""sold"" the single model we wanted that morning. After some squabbling over inventory and advertised prices, we left. An hour later I received a call from Sal saying he had gone over his Manager's head and spoke to the General Manager who approved it for the price we were asking and just needed us to come in and sign the paperwork. Since it was already late in the day, we made plans to return the next morning. Before we could go out the door the GM called and said he was aware of our negotiations and would ""graciously"" lose money on the deal by selling us the car for $500 more than he had already agreed to sell it to us for. When I said that he needed to stand by his word and maintain ethical business practices, he hung up on me.

No one at HUB can be trusted. Their website inventory is incorrect, their sales reps and managers repeatedly lie, and their General Manager won't even stand by his word. Oh, and their showroom has live cockroaches running around...classy :)

Even though HUB 290 did not come back as the lowest price for the vehicle I wanted, I decided to go to HUB because of previous purchase experience. I made an appointment with Jordan Azar at HUB to test drive the vehicle I had been researching and he took me directly to the vehicle when I arrived. The whole process took about 2 and 1/2 hours and they beat by 10% the lowest price I had been quoted by all the other dealers in my area. This is he place to go when you want platinum service and a great price.",5.0
408,"October 20, 2015","I called and asked to Nguyen Le for my appointment in purchasing a new Hyundai and he was everything my brother told me he was.  He was friendly, offered my family water as we stepped onto the parking area and showed us the vehicles right away.  He was very interested in what I was looking for and immediately found the keys to the vehicle I wanted and we went for a test drive.  Just because of his friendliness and knowledge, I would become a repeat customer like my brother.  He purchased a car for his wife and loved the experience that he came back and purchased a car for himself by going to Mr. Nguyen Le.
I plan to do the same in a few years but this time hope to upgrade!!!
Thanks HUB Hyundai for treating your customers with respect and willing to listen and take care of them from the time they enter and through the entire experience in purchasing a vehicle!
Most appreciative,
Rebecca

We found out later they offer a cheap price before you leave to make sure you can't find the same price elsewhere and come back to them.  They call it their ""shop around price.""  Since I had it in writing (on a scrap piece of paper but it was in writing) and after getting ugly in their showroom in front of other customers, we did get the price.....with some conditions.  This was our first Hyundai based on the good reviews of friends, this experience took some of the shine off our view of Hyundai.

426,"August 24, 2015","I went in looking for a specific 2015 Mitsubishi.  As soon as I got into Chris' office I told him what I was looking for.  However, I was told he couldn't find the specific car I wanted. He said he found two cars the same type, but upgrades (ie more expensive).  While out there he tried to steer me towards the even more expensive Hyundai.  (I get it.  That's his job.  I was not mad.)  Once I said what my price range was and I was not going over he agreed to show me other Mitsubishis.  We go and look at the style I originally asked for.  Ironically the first car in the lot is the exact car Chris said they didn't have.  (I opted to just let that pass.)  After the test drive I decided that I didn't like the care and would check around to see what else I liked. We go back to Chris' office so he can get my license (which I had to surrender for the test drive.) A while later he comes back.  Not with my license, but with different pricing on a Santa Fe. I say ok lets test drive.  Well, I like the car and how it drives.  I say I will check with my bank and think on it. Ask for mu license so I can leave.  Again he leaves and comes back a while later. He says lets get your trade in looked at and see what we can do on pricing (it will only take 10 min).  I say ok. (sucker!) I realize that I am now trapped b/c they have my license and my car keys.  Every time I say I will think about it and ask for my things Chris leaves and comes back with more info.  After a long while I am talked into a Santa Fe, not a horrible thing as long as I can afford it. (Chris clearly has mad selling skills).  At one point I even bring up the fact that I am being held hostage because they wont give me my things back to leave.  Chris laughs, makes a joke, but never gives me my things back.  I then have to choose between a white and a silver.  ""What's the difference?"" I ask. Chris tells me they are identical.  After hopping in the white I notice the seat lift is broken.  I show Chris and say gonna have to think some more.  That is when I am reassured they can order the part, have it in three days, and will not take long to fix at all. Fine as long as it is in the paperwork.  Financing was a mess because no one actually wrote anything down.  Plus they basically refused to let me use my banks financing.  As in they wouldn't even put it in their system.  None of this I knew until too late.  Lots of running back and forth between the finance guy and sales.  Lots of double talk and lying (sales admitted to running my credit. finance guy said never ran my credit) After another hour I am finally done signing my life away.  That is when all ""good"" customer service died.  I had to wait another 1 1/2 hour while they wash, cleanout the car, and put on paper plates. Chris even admits that 1. he was neglecting me for a long while during the sale and 2. he did so because his boss said there was a more important sale that he needed to handle.  I get in the car and there are stains on the seats, doors, and ceiling.  Since it is after 3pm I just want to get out of there.  Before leaving Chris tells me, ""If you have an problems what so ever you make sure to let me know.  I will take care of you"".  On Monday I notice an odor from the c/a when I turn the car on.  I make a mental note to mention that when I talk to Chris.  By Wednesday I try calling the Chris and the finance guy (Daryll Zarevich) about questions.  By Friday I have heard nothing.  I get the finance manager on the phone and he answers my question.  I didn't get Chris on the phone until Sunday when I called his cell phone.  I ask for a call back about the handle and the huge crack in the back door (Did I forget to mention that?  Yes, a huge crack in the trunk door.)  I finally get a response today (after I call twice and text).  The part is on back order (of course) and I am just S.O.L on the trunk door. Over $20, 000 on a car and this is how you treat your customers?  They will not get any business from me, my family, and anyone else I can let know about how bad this place is.",1.6

I came in with low expectations because of the treatment I had received at previous appointments with other dealerships around the Houston area.  The team at Hub went above and beyond to get my vehicle financed for my budget.  I strongly recommend them.  The only issue I had, was with the inspection sticker for my vehicle and the confusion surrounding.  I noticed I had no tags when driving away in my vehicle on a Saturday night and called into the dealership.  The Customer Service Rep let me know it was up to me to take care of the tags myself.  I took a look at the paperwork when I got home and it WAS included.  Now I am having trouble finding time between work and when the service dept is open to take care of this.  I have also not been able to reach anyone to discuss this issue and don't want to have to repay to get a tag.  The guys there are very nice though and I know it will get resolved one way or another.  Thanks Erdwin!  Have a Great Day!

WARNING!!!!WARNING!!!!WARNING!!!!

There ended up being a big problem with the vehicle I bought.  On the 9th day of purchase my car flooded due to the sunroof, which was one of my main concerns with the vehicle.  Erdwin told me no problem to bring it in.  I came in the very night after work and was told that he had approval to take the car back and would return the deposit.  He also stated in front of myself and a witness that he got approval for this from head management Mike Cole.  We even have this recorded.  He was gone 20-30 minutes getting that approval.  He told me to bring the car the next day and drop it off and I would be sign to get my $1000 deposit back.  I have returned the car and have been told that they would stick by his word by Associate managers and NONE of this happened!!! I have yet to speak to Mike Cole, only voice mails.  One of those voice mails stated that he was not only not returning my deposit but he was not backing out of the deal.  I had bought another car on the word of Erdwin because I could not afford to miss work.  DO NOT BELIEVE THESE PEOPLE!!!!! ONCE YOU SIGN THE DOTTED LINE ALL GOES OUT THE WINDOW!!! ",1.4

I had been car shopping at many places but the friendliness, customer service and attentiveness I got from Erdiwn and Anil was superb.

Mr. Burl Franklin was our Salesman.  He was very courteous, helpful, and did all he could to help us find what we were wanting, and staying within our price range.

493,"April 17, 2014","I worked hard to hopefully get the best deal on my new 2014 Hyundai Sport 2.0T, which I picked up yesterday, and so far....GREAT!
My experience at Hub started with a very helpful Chris Torres, who spent much time finding a test vehicle that meant my requirements, and taking my wife and I on a test ride.  During the ride, he explained many of the features of the vehicle and was very positive.  I had hoped, if I bought at HUB, that he would be able to handle the transaction.
I left, and continued to shop.   HUB was actually my first look, and I was uncertain what brand/vehicle I was to buy.  On a visit to Costco, I saw their purchase plan and thought I would investigate.   This took me to Ron Valarezo, who handles the Costco requests.  The day I came to visit Ron, Chris was either off, or with another customer.   I did not find the Costco deal attractive and continued to shop, now only for Hyundai‚Äôs.
Eventually, I again contacted Ron, since he had already priced me a vehicle and we worked hard to get to an agreeable price, which closed the deal.  The HUB pricing was about $500 better that the second best offer, and their location is closest to my home.  Ron had the car prepped and ready for me to pick up, and the closing was easy, but in my opinion still took far too long.  After the buy Ron was very helpful in going over the operation of the vehicle.
Again, I want thank Chris for his initial help.

510,"June 22, 2013","I was shopping for a new Hyundai, due to the review and other owner's comments.  But it became a nightmare really quick.  I was told by NorthFreeway Hyundai in the Houston area, that the car that I was looking for is in stock.  So I drove about an hour to get to the dealership, and deal with a new salesman that really don't anything about the product, no less where the car was when I arrive.  He walked all over the car lot looking for the vehicle, but after all the test drive and providing all the info.  There was no negotiation what so ever.  He looks like he not even interested to sell the car.  No manager shows up to finish and nobody care if I but the car or not.  Never return this dealership.  If they treat you like this before the purchase, think what would happen after the purchase.

Second nightmare.  I was told by an internet manager at Ron Carter Hyundai Clear lake that they have the vehicle that I was looking for and she offered an internet price that was suppose to be real?  I have spoken to her twice on the phone to insure that there is no game playing with offer, and she reassure me that there is no game playing and the vehicle is real and she has the key in her hand.  Because I told her that I don't want to drive 1 1/2 hr. just to play game with the purchase of the vehicle. So I drove out to the Ron Carter location, and of-course she is not there, and someone else will be taken care of me.  Right!!!  In come the salesman and I show him the email that supposedly the internet manager send me with the price and everything.  At that point I was told that it doesn't include anything, so the price will be higher.
How much higher would you think?  Full sticker plus TTL.  What a shock, because I was told by the internet manager that it will not be the case.  But long story short.  It ended up that I was told by another supposedly sales manager, that the eprice doesn't exist, there is no such thing.  because they can't sell the car at that price.  What a joke.  (ANOTHER BUYER BEWARE)

So I was giving up on the Hyundai vehicle, and wrote to the Hyundai North America and file a complaint.  But I know there is nothing they can do.

But When I was about to give up.  Cornelius Ita with Hub Hyundai on 290, send me an email, so I thought there goes another scam.  So I called him and he verify the price and everything.  So I said what the heck.  I went out to the dealership that same day, and Cornelius was super friendly and helpful..He gave me the best deal and took good care of my purchase.  The end result is I am now a new owner of a 2013 Hyundai Veloster Turbo.  Thanks to Cornelius Ita.  highly recommend to buy car from this guy.

Mr. Pham in the Finance department is also another outstanding staff at the Hun Hyundai location.  He help me get a great deal and a great rate.  Super easy to deal with and work with.  

The last and only thing I can say is Thanks a whole bunch Hub Hyundai on 290.  Again with staffs like this, the dealership is highly recommended for future purchase.

511,"June 12, 2013","My wife and I went to Hub in hopes of finding a new 2013 Sonata for the best price. Robert and Mark made it happen! We are very grateful!

Now to be honest, it did not start out as well as we had hoped. We originally dealt with Cornelius. From the beginning of our dealings with him, we felt that he was disorganized and rushed, just did not feel comfortable with him. Luckily, he had gotten busy the first day we were there so we were able to deal with Robert for a while during the first visit. We felt comfortable with him right from the start. However, since Cornelius was technically still on our account, he remained our salesperson for the time and he rejoined us to discuss specifics we were looking for as well as a possible trade in of my wife's car. I had found a comparable model of the Sonata we were looking for and told Cornelius the price. He basically laughed it off and said we would not be able to beat the price he was giving us. Quite condescending at this point. We talked about the trade-in possibility, in which he gave us a very low offer and said Carmax, which just so happened to be next door, would give us the same. Needless to say, we left that first day feeling very frustrated and unhappy with the service we received. I spent most of the following day researching Sonata models comparable to what we were looking for at lower prices and actually found more than a few. Also took the wife's car to Carmax for an appraisal. They gave us a much better offer for it. However, we decided to sell it on our own.

The following Monday we scheduled another appointment with Cornelius, in hopes that my research would be more to his liking and smooth things out to where we could feel like he was trying to work with us. This was not the case. He continued to try and prove me wrong with everything I said and went on to a website trying to search through 15 pages trying to find the cars I was telling him about to prove to me I was wrong. When he did that, feeling attacked and insulted again as a customer, we immediately requested another salesperson and to speak with a manager. 

We spoke to Mark Odat, who is one of the managers, and felt comfortable with him right from the start. He was very apologetic and immediately addressed our concerns and what we were looking for from the dealership. He was very honest with us and showed that he was willing to work with us. He understood we had good dealings with Robert our first day there, so Mark transferred us to work with Robert for the remainder of the process. Smooth sailing from that point. We negotiated numbers with Robert, and with some help from Mark, we were able to get the Sonata we wanted for the price we preferred. Needless to say, if it weren't for Robert and Mark, I would be writing a different review right now. They made this process go from a 1 to a 5. I am giving a 5 because overall, we got what we were looking for in the end result. We had great service from Robert and Mark, and we got the exact car we wanted at the price that was best for us. Thank you Robert and Mark for making this a positive experience! ",5.0
512,"June 06, 2013","My husband and I went in for the first time originally looking for a used vehicle for my mother...actually a CRV we had seen on line. To be honest we expected the typical bait and switch where they say ""yes come look at the car"" only to find out that it was sold and therefore be talked into looking at something else. But...that was not the case at all. We met Sal who let us take the CRV for a test drive. We liked the  vehicle enough to pick up my mother so that she could decide for herself. 

Let me tell you how refreshing it was to not feel pressured by the ""sales guy"". I know most people are like me and my husband and dread the car buying process but Sal was professional and easy to talk to. He listened to my mother and what she really wanted and she ended up getting a much better deal on a brand new Outlander Sport. SHE LOVES IT!!!  Great mileage, unbelievable interest rate and warranty.

So all I can say is if you are in the market for a new or used vehicle check out this dealership you won't be disappointed. Thank you so much Sal, Ed and Mr. General Manager for a great experience.

I returned the next day to buy one of the cars I had driven, but in a different color.  They had a good selection of cars, lacking only manual transmission cars, which seems to be just the way it is in the greater Houston area.  I have to admit that waiting in the line of cars to drop off my grandson at elementary school is much nicer with a slush box.  I was pleased with the way they priced the Sonata 2.0T I ended up buying and they offered me a price for my '03 Element that I felt was very generous.  All in all I'd call it a good experience and am happy with the results.  My salesman, Steve Smith, went out of his way to explain the various features of my new car.  I bought through Costco and would have no problem suggesting, as my brother suggested to me, to someone who is looking at Accords, to call the HUB Hyundai people and look at their Sonatas.  The EX I was looking at cost about $110 per horsepower.  The Sonata I ended up getting has almost a hundred more horsepower and an additional gear at a price of less than $70 per horsepower and way more low end torque.  Happy with the product and the dealer both. Glad my brother suggested I try Costco and Hyundai.  Feel lucky HUB is the Costco contact for this area.

547,"August 29, 2011","Last week, Monday August 22nd, I recieve a letter in the mail.  The letter states that this gentleman can buy back my current Hyundai at $4000.00 over the Blackbook value (whether I buy a vehicle from them or not).  I had been thinking about buying another Hyundai Elantra for some time now, so, I thought I would look into things.  I call Mr. Odat (the person in the letter) to arrange an appointment to come in and discuss things.  Once I called him, he tells me that he will offer me a ""great deal.""  This call took place around 1:30pm.  

Around 5pm to 6pm that same day, I receive another call.  This call came from Mr. Odat.  Mr. Odat tells me that he received a message that I was interested in trading in my vehicle and I was looking into buying another vehicle.  I explain to him that we have already talked.  He doesn't remember any of this.  I go on further to explain what was discussed between us.  Our arrangement was that I was going to meet with him approximately 9am Saturday morning.  Instead of just coming forth and say he simply lost my info or forgot, he tries to cover up things.  I overlook the matter and we finally ended on that we are to meet on Saturday at 9am.

Saturday rolls around.  I call Mr. Odat when I am not far from the dealership.  The drive to his location, as I told him earlier in the week, is not exactly close so I wanted him to be ready to discuss things with me when I made it there.  I let Mr. Odat know that I am about 15 - 20 minutes out from his location.  He says, great.  He will be expecting me.  

When I arrive to the dealership, I go inside with my father.  I walk up to one of the desks and ask for Mark Odat.  The gentleman that I spoke to pages Mr. Odat to the front.  Mr. Odat was paged a few times.  After waiting for 20 minutes with no response from Mr. Odat, I go outside to look over the Hyundai Elantras this dealership has on the lot.  

Once I was done looking the cars over, I walked back to head inside of the dealership.  Another salesman approached me and asked if I was being helped.  I explained my situation and told him that he was helping me now without giving out the name of the other gentleman.  My goal was to buy a new vehicle and not complain about some guy that didn't want to help me with buying a new vehicle.  This other salesman is named Dan.  I had no issues with Dan.  Dan said to me that he didn't want to step on anyones toes, so, he had to get approval to be able to help me out.  Another gentleman came out and asked me questions on who it was that didn't live up to their appointment.  I didn't give out a name.  After a few minutes of discussing, it was decided that Dan would be allowed to take care of me.  

As Dan went to pull around an Elantra I wanted to test drive, Mark Odat must of caught wind about what happened and proceeded to come talk to me.  He told me he was waiting in his office the entire time.  My problem is that if someone has an appointment with you and even calls when they are almost at your dealership, you should be ready to make contact with that person instead of sitting in your office (in the back) not able to hear the calls on the intercom for him.  

Dan finally pulls around and I take an Elantra out for a test drive.  Once Dan and I get back to the dealership, we head to his office to negociate a price offer.  Dan makes an offer over the MSRP.  It was for something new that some dealerships are doing now called an ""addendum price.""  I have never had to deal with this new pricing structure before as it's over the MSRP asking price.  I told Dan of a counter offer.  He mentioned to me that he was unable to agree to this offer.  I explained to him of how I came up with that offer.  Dan felt that my offer was not unreasonable, but he would have to take that to someone over his head for any kind of approval.  When Dan came back, the person I had to work with at this point is Mark Odat (the guy I have lost all confidence in at this point).  

Despite the fact that I no longer wanted to deal with Mark, we ended up going to his office.  After talking about other things for awhile, I finally asked him about my counter offer.  He told me that the best he could do is the addendum price.  I reminded Mark that he told me that he would give me a ""good deal.""  In addition to that, I asked if he thought that this was a deal?  He told me that they can't keep Elantras on the lot and don't have to negociate pricing.  He told me that they sale these cars over MSRP all the time.  One of my arugments on this is why would you promise me a ""good deal"" when you can't offer a deal at all?  He told me that this is the best he could do unless.......

Mark told me that he could probably take $1000 to $2000 off of my price if I was to trade in my vehicle.  I followed up with mentioning how his letter to me (which I still have) says that he is willing to pay $4000 over the Blackbook value.  Why would I trade in my vehicle for up to $2000 when your letter says that it's worth much more?  Mark refused to answer the question and covered it up with how good the Elantra is.  

After I left the dealership with an empty promise and no good deals on their vehicles, I headed home after dropping off my father.  When I got home, and after I had time to relax and vent, I was still disappointed with what took place.  I decided to call the 1-800 Hyundai line to place in a customer complaint.  After talking with the customer service line for quite some time, I left things at that.  Shortly after, I get an email from the same dealership in regards to having me come in.  It's from a lady that works in customer relations.  I told her why I would not go back to do business at this dealership again.  I don't believe I gave the name of the person (Mark Odat) to this lady.  In turn, she sent the email to to Mark Odat.  

Mark Odat calls me on Monday.  He wants to talk with me about the email he received.  So, we talk.  I really felt like I was not treated like a valued customer.  In turn, I asked him in the end:  ""Did you feel like you were giving me a good deal?""  Mark says to me:  ""Yes.""  I asked him, ""Why do you feel you think you are giving me a great deal?""  He said:  ""Because you are buying a great car.""  That to me was not an answer to my question, but merely a ploy to avoid answering my question.  I followed up with him in regards to lettting him know that I don't think that a good deal has been offered when I have been offered to trade in my vehicle to him for up to $2000 and his letter states that he can give me at least three times that amount.  

In closing, I felt that since I have bought 2 Hyundai vehicles from them in the past, I felt that my owner loyalty should be considered.  Even if the Elantra is a great car, it has no rebates/incintives or owner loyalty.  With this being said, if a customer had bought from a particular dealership multiple times, you should want to take very good care of that repeat customer to ensure that he/she will return time and time again.  Unfortunately for me, this was not the case.  I would not recommend this location to anybody.  If you do decide to buy a vehicle from this dealership, I would like to follow up by mentioning that you do not do business with Mark Odat.  Hopefully your experience will go better than mine did if you do decide to buy from this dealership.",1.5
548,"August 17, 2011","I saw an advertisment on Autotrader.com for a Toyota Prius (a trade in) & contacted them immediately about making the purchase. A sales associate named Kam informed us of all the details on the car, after which we told him we wished to purchase the Prius at an agreed upon price. Kam told us that since we were the first to contact the dealership about the car after a recent price drop that we would have first ""dibs"". We live out of state so we discussed what info they would need for financing which would allow us to finance about half the cost of the car. We had informed Kam that we would be putting a large downpayment on it. We even offered a deposit and were informed that it was unneccessary as the paperwork was being processed. We emailed all the required info before close of business around 6 pm, and were expecting instructions on where to send the deposit the next morning when the banks opened. My husband called Kam from the bank at 8:30 am to inquire where to send any remaining financial requirements. Kam then informed him that they sold the car the night before, AFTER we had made the deal & had submitted financial information. He blamed us for not having put a deposit down even though he claimed it was on a hold for us. Not only had we lost the car, for which they could not provide a match as a replacement,(he tried to upsale us to a car that was priced $4000 more) but that night, since we thought it was a done deal, we had made travel arrangements on a rental car to get to Houston to pick the Prius up from the dealership. While I suppose what they did was not illegal, I just found their practices and the way they handled the situation to be highly unprofessional and plain ole' bad business. I wish to file this complaint to maybe spare others the trouble of trying to do business with a company that has no integrity.  If they'll mistreat you during the deal,there can be no expectation of better treatment after the deal.",1.0
549,"July 19, 2011","My house guest (A Korean exchange student) went to Hub 290 to have her 2010 Elantra's brake lights fixed (they would no longer work).  While there I suggested that since she was due for an oil change she might as well have it serviced (30k oil/filter change - air filter change and inspection as per the manual the came w/the car) there at the same time.  Shortly after inspecting her car she was told by the service Mgr. that the car also REQUIRED a coolant change, a transmission fluid flush, new spark plugs (note they are Platinum type) and a fuel injection service.  This was going to be an additional $549 and she was explained that it had to be done to maintain her warranty w/Hyundai.  She called me and I eventually spoke w/this service manager and he began to tell me the exact same thing; that Hyundai would not honor any warranty on the vehicle unless she had this service performed by them, that day.  Flags were immediately raised in my head and I called BS!  I questioned the requirement for a coolant flush, transmission flush and spark plug change based on a 30K mileage as well as noting that the vehicle was only 13 month old!  I checked the manual and his claims were not true - none of it was required; even under the extreme service interval.  Only checking of the fluid levels were required at this time/mileage interval.  I instructed her to only have the oil and filters changed and come home as well as assure the brake lights were fixed.

She is rather gullible/naive (and unfortunately the dealership sensed this - they preyed on her).  She arrived home that night with a new 2012 Elantra in tears, saying that they (a sales person came over to help her) and they went on to explain that purchasing a new car would be a better and cheaper alternative to keeping her current 1 yr old car.  They pointed out she needed 2 new tires due to safety reasons (and even noted in the inspection that there was 10/32nds tread left on them - hardly a safety concern!).  Well she bought it ""hook line and sinker"".  There is no clause in the paperwork allowing her to return the new car and I believe she is now stuck with this.  She really did not have the cash to pay for it as that money she used really supposed to be for her to attend college.  she had saved it prior to coming to the US and it was required to have up front in order to attend school and get a Visa).

This dealership is a bunch of scum bags.  the sales guy was an older Korean guy that she had confided in due to him speaking her native tongue, Etc.  I am truly outraged at this tactic the dealership used to sell her a car.",1.0

551,"June 07, 2011","I searched for a good deal on a lancer evolution for months and finally found one and called made a offer and sal said he would call me back. When he did he said that it was a go ahead and would sale me the car for $26500. So the next day my wife 5 month old daughter and I drove 1 hour and 45 min there and look at the car. It had some pretty big scratches so I said it was no deal unless they would fix them and put floor mats in. Sal said that they couldn't fix the scratches unless they up the price, so we negotiated the deal and finally he agreed to fix them nso I told them I wanted a we owe stating they would fix the scratches. Sal told memhe couldn't give me a we owe but he would give me his word. I told him that wasn't good enough and finally 2 hours later I got a we owe write Up. A couple more hours go by then we finally get into finance and start doing paper work and I look at the buyers order and they have the selling price as $27900 (they are dirty people be wary). So we got that fixed and I left with the car. I schedule a appointment to come in Tuesday to get the scratches fixed. So skip a week to Tuesday. I get to the dealership and hand the keys over. 8 hours went by and finally my car was ready. They tuched up the deep scratches with a different color paint and it looked worse than it did when I brought the car in. So I argued with sale for about 20 min and asked him several times to go get them GM and he wouldnt he said that they said they would touch up the paint and I said no you said you would fix it. So instead if getting mark the GM he came back with Rick Colman (the rudest one in the dealership)the used car sales manager who had already been really rude all day about my trade. We argued for about another 20 min and I pulled out the we owe and showed him were it said they would fix the scratches not touch them up. So he told me to take it to the body shop next week and leave it with them and that they would not give me a loner car for the week. When I get to the body shop they say that they have to write a estimate up and Rick has to approve it and he would call me and let us know something. Still waiting on a phone call and still don't have any floor mats. Overall this is a horrible stealership who just wants your money and will screw you over any chance they get. I will take this as far as I have to in order to get everything I was promised. My uncle is a top notch lawyer and if I have to take them to court I will. ",1.5
552,"May 09, 2011","After settling on a sale price of $23588 for a 2011 Hyundai Tucson GLS with navigation package, I drove from Austin to Houston to pick-up the vehicle. I had specifically requested my drive out price and was e-mailed $25400. When I arrived in Houston, the salesmen was very nice, but as soon as I sat down with the finance manager to sign the paperwork, I noticed that they had tacked on an additional $1200 in fees making my drive out price $26728.18. They claimed that they add two packages to all of their vehicles which are non-negotiable: simonize (5 year paint and fabric protection) and UUG Anti-theft ($5000 toward purchase of new vehicle if car is stolen in the first 5 years). We negotiated those fees down but still ended up paying the same price as we were quoted in Austin. They will underbid and lie on the base price and make up their money in the end with additional fees. You would be better off calling them and negotiating a good deal over the phone and then use that as leverage with a more reputable dealership. When the dealership won't match the price, but will get down to invoice, take their deal! You will be sorry if you trust HUB. ",1.0

I knew he was being bonused on these things, but did not need them. He go so angry with me and was harrassing me! I questioned the numbers and he did his dog and pony show with me. I signed, left and didn't feel the numbers added up. I went to my bank and had them look at the numbers. Sure enough, Amir through in $900 for something I didn't ask for. I had to get the GM involved who tells me I ordered etched sketching on my windows and some kind of special glass. He pretended that Amir would be in so much trouble, but reality is that prior to this Amir told me that he and Mark had been best buds for many years. Mark (GM) is a very smart man and very nice, but I believe he knew what was going on. I made them rewrite my contract but they took forever to get my license plates and 3rd row in which they owed me. Amir is still there and a coward. I am going to the news station over this one. Amir, you have not seen the last of me. I have proof of their fraud and some employees said it goes on all the time.

Then I've had several mechanical problems and the service guys always tell me ""there's nothing wrong with it, the sporadic idling and poping noise under your feet are normal."" I would never, ever buy another Hyundai and I especially would NEVER deal with HUB again.

556,"April 22, 2010","For starters I found this website off the internet from a car search website, and I found the car I wanted which this dealership had. So I call them and get them to run a credit application in which I knew I would be approved. So I ask Dan Hughes to get my monthly payments under $150 a month. So he calls me back all excited telling me I was approved and my payments were under $150 a month and to just come and pickup the car. So I drive 100 miles to get there to find out that the payments were not under $150 that he just estimated that it would be that when in fact he only said that to get me there, and it turns out the payments were over $250 a month which is well over what I wanted in the first place. So I am tired already from the long drive so I decided to go ahead and just get the car at that rate per month figuring it was a mistakes, when really I just wanted it to seem like that so I didn't go crazy that he lied to me and made me drive 100miles to get the car.


So I am sitting there signing the paperwork with Amir, and the whole time he is trying to sell me this warranty telling me that there is nothing wrong with the car that it is just good to have the warranty. So I tell him I don't want it because the car I am buying is practically new still with only 60k miles on it, so why would I need to spend $2,000 dollars on a warranty when it will expire after 30k miles anyway? Sure enough the deal was signed and I drove off the lot happier than ever, and when I got about 80miles from the dealership what do you know, the check engine light comes on lol??? Turns out there were problems with the car to begin with, and the dealership just hooked it up to the computer to make the check engine light go off for a couple of miles so that it would make the car look like there was no problems with it when I inspected it. I guess in a hard economy when nobody is buying cars and the dealership sees you coming and will do anything to make that sale, it is like throwing a piece of meat in the streets and watching a bunch of dogs kill each other over it, and in this case I was the piece of meat and the sales team at Hub Hyundai was the dogs tearing me to shreds.


The dealership is nice and the people seem nice at first but really they are all just a bunch of liars only out to get your money and give you a car with problems whether its new or used. But I guess this is all dealerships these days in America, everyday in this country it seems like everything is getting cheaper and cheaper and the crooks are getting richer and richer by ripping innocent people off. Well anyways I still having problems with them as of today trying to get them to FedEx me my license plates and not to send it in certified mail in which I told them at least 5 times not to do while they promised me they would send it via FedEx because there is no mailbox where I live. Sure enough my license plates are now lost in the mail and I have to wear that horrible Hub Hyundai license plate on my car even longer in hopes that this dealership can at least do something right by getting me my license plates. Seems like the people I talk to everyday about my plates are getting annoyed by me and that to me is a good thing because when people get annoyed they tend to just try to fix the problem so they won't have to deal with you anymore. So much for friendly customer service!
