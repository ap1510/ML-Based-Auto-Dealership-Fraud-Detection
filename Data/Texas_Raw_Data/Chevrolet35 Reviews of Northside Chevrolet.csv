0,"May 15, 2020","I called the day before to confirm prices, and they never mentioned there would be other separate charges like labor. 
I agreed to have the cabin filter changed, when I got my car back, I couldn't open the glove compartment. So I went back to them and they immediately denied ever touching the glovebox, saying they would never open it. Then I responded, ‚Äúhow were you able to change the cabin filter then?‚Äù. Then that‚Äôs where they realized they were wrong, and said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre right‚Äù. This causes us great dissatisfaction. What if I didn't need To open the glovebox before leaving the dealership? That would've meant going back, more time, money wasted. Not to mention safety in this pandemic time! Plus, you would think, charging 3x more would be better service! Why did they change the cabin filter carelessly causing the glovebox not to open! Poor experience. Never coming back and spreading the word. This isn't the first time, Northside Chevrolet. We got screwed here back to when we got the car, from the agent Sergio who also didn‚Äôt give us the promised referral fee. All the time we are displeased with everything. Also explains why the good people there like Too Tall and Josh left! Crooked management and agents like Sergio. Will never come back after the last cabin filter experience. Hope this reached the right people and fix that awful dealership!! ",1.0

2,"February 08, 2019","I have had my 2012 Cheverolet Silverado in this service shop 3 times for preventative maintenance and I had such a GREAT experience each time~
I highly recommend this dealership the staff is efficient, friendly, organized and I find that is so rare today~ JR is amazing and David Rice took such great care of me answering all of my questions and concerns about what my vehicle truly needed. The staff at the desk are friendly and efficient and check in and check out was flawless~It felt to me each staff member knew what they were supposed to do and they did it with a smile on their face~
I highly recommend this dealership for any of your service needs~ ",5.0
3,"November 08, 2018","Thank you for making my latest car purchase an exceptional experience.

  I have purchased many new and pre owned vehicles since I purchased my first car in 1977. My recent car purchase experience at Alamo City Chevrolet was by far the most exceptional in all aspects.
   My sales associate Mike Gutierrez was exceptional. He was very well versed on the vehicle specifications and operation. He was very familiar with what vehicles were available for sale, helping me find the one that best met my search criterion, without any sales pressure. After I purchased the pre-owned vehicle as is with no warranty, he pointed out that there was a rip on the passenger seat leather which they were going to fix at no charge to me. When I brought the car in the following week to have the seat tear repaired they determined it could not be repaired and they proceeded to replace the lower seat leather at no cost to me. Incredible. 
   My sales manager, Mike Flores, also was exceptional. My usual experience with sales managers required me to do extensive online research to be used for lengthy purchase price and trade in price negotiations. Mike Flores actually provided much of the online research which clearly showed the purchase price he posted up front was a very good value. We also quickly arrived at a trade in price that was in line with online research he also assisted with.
  My finance manager JJ Rodriguez also was exceptional. Even with a cash purchase like this, I usually have to wait a long time to start the closing and then I am subjected to hard sell theatrics. He quickly prepared the paperwork and met with me after a very short wait. He explained options such as warranties quickly and did not try to hard sell when I told him I was not interested in the warranties.
   I will definitely recommend Alamo City Chevrolet to others and most definitely will go to Alamo City Chevrolet first when I am ready to buy my next new or pre-owned vehicle.",5.0
4,"July 23, 2018","was looking to buy my wife a new car for mothers day 2018, walked into ACC and met Jennifer Schultz, at first was skeptical of a female car salesperson,  but Jennifer was very knowledgeable of her inventory,  and I feel that she truly listened to our situation,  in the end , we drove out with a brand new 2018 Chevy Malibu LT. Jennifer Schultz has not forgotten about us, as I recently called on her for a favor and she promptly delivered. thank you ACC and thank you Jennifer, hope to do business again in the near future.",4.0

9,"March 26, 2018","I started my buying process online with James Gillean. Once he found the car I wanted, we worked over the phone and through emails to finalize the deal. Working with Gary and JJ was a pleasure.  My time in the dealership was minimal by my choice but was treated wonderfully by everyone I came in contact with. 
Don't waste your time, go to Alamo 1st!",5.0
10,"January 12, 2018","I just want to let you know that you have a awesome staff.  I meet with Niem Harris.  He did a outstanding job.  He was very friendly.  I had a great experience with him.  He was very laid back which I liked.  He did not put pressure on you to buy a car which I liked.  I went to other dealerships where they put pressure on you which I do not like at all.  I do not like high pressured sales people.  That does turn me away.

11,"December 29, 2017","I took my car in twice under warranty. The first time I took it in I asked for a radio update to fix a bluetooth issue, an oil change, and I also had a starting issue. They replaced the battery and then didn't do the radio update as asked and did the oil change but didn't reset the oil monitor in the dash. I reset the oil monitor and checked the radio to find no update done. They didn't say if there was or wasn't an update, they just replaced the battery. 

Next week I have to take it in because I noticed a clicking sound coming from the blower motor and I ask them to do the radio update again. I set an appointment mind you and when I get there the service advisor tells me that it's going to take a while, about 2 hours. 2 hours later the advisor comes up to me and tells me that it's going to be another hour and a half and tells me that he's going to be heading out and another advisor will finish me off. So I wait an hour and a half then go ask the other advisor for an update. He checks and tells me the update is running on the radio and that it's going to be another 40 mins. I wait an hour and go check to find out the car is done and waiting... so total time 10:15 to 4:00 pm... just shy of 6 hours I'm sitting there for a simple blower motor and radio update

The guy on the service drive, not an advisor, was nice enough to give me two free coupons for two free oil changes but with the level of service I got on my two trips I'm not sure I will even use them.",2.4

16,"August 26, 2017","This dealership has top notch new car sales and finance departments but loses its value when taking your car in for simple oil changes.  They should have a larger staff that is solely assigned to performing oil changes in a quick manner similar to regular oil change businesses, where you can be in and out within an hour.  Having to wait 3 to 4 hours for a simple oil change is simply not acceptable!!

I always consider dealership service departments when purchasing new cars and will weigh on my decision to purchase from this dealership again.",2.8

20,"December 02, 2016","I took my 2011 camaro here and was shorted 3 quarts of oil which ended up destroying my oil pump and my engine. They refused to accept responsibility and made me pay for a new engine. They couldn't even install my new engine right without me having to take Myou car back to them 6 times the same day of every pick up for breaking other parts on my car. You will not geto compensated for your trouble. They had my car for 2.5 months because they kept screwing up the repairspecs and thenot tried to pass it off to me broken. Save yourself money and find another dealer. Better yet, don't get a Chevy.",1.4
21,"November 08, 2016","About a month ago I purchased a vehicle from here , I was assisted by Dorian , he was very helpful , they don't make you feel pressured and they really want to satisfy their customers and actually listen to what you are looking for , they just make you fee very comfortable and I definitely came out of there and still feeling that I'm glad I chose to go there to purchase a vehicle , I highly recommend this place and I'm sure all their staff is awesome but look for the sales person by name of Dorian !!!

23,"June 22, 2016","Saturday evening I scheduled an appointment to test drive a vehicle I saw on Benson's website for Monday morning. 10 AM first thing, sales rep. Errolyn Cutkelvin, met me and my parents at the front doors. She immediately informed us that the vehicle was undergoing some minor hail damage repair and she had already requested the vehicle be brought up from the shop.  We all went for a test drive; the car was lovely. Errolyn was ready with all pertinent and detailed information about the vehicle.

Errolyn asked us into the showroom and invited me to discuss a possible purchase. Errolyn was efficient, accurate and friendly in obtaining and relaying all of my information to the appropriate parties. She followed-up with all the facilitating of the information in an extremely timely manner and kept me informed of where we were throughout the entire process. She was extremely cognizant and respectful of my time and my family's time and pleasant and genuinely engaging throughout the entire process.

I was not specifically planning to purchase a vehicle Monday but I did!!!! Errolyn at Tom Benson was an essential and irreplaceable element of the entire process. I love my car!",5.0
24,"September 30, 2015","I went to Tom Benson because the reviews are amazing. I have been looking for a sonic. So i gave them a call 10 minutes later I am test driving a 2015 sonic and I fell in love. David  Rosalas not only found me the perfect car but helped me on every question I had to make sure it was the right car for me. I could not have asked for anyone better. He walked me over everything so I had knowledge. I had gone to another car dealership who had told me ""They knew what I wanted and not me because I was a woman,  and woman does not know what they want as long as the inside is pretty. "" So needless to say i was super scared I was going to be treated the same way. To my surprise the complete opposite happened. That is where I knew this was the place for me. David Rosales made me feel like family.  I will forever be thankful to him for his understanding and assistance. If you are looking for a car and want to have a wonderful yet trustworthy experience I am telling you this is the place for you.  Thank you Tom Benson Thank you David Rosales. ",5.0
25,"January 14, 2015","Roy McClure and his service team are the cream of the crop!  I had an issue with my tires (2015 Tahoe) and the sales guys and manager weren't trying to help me.  They even LIED and said I signed some kind of declination of warrenty for my tires.  I told them I would be on my way to the store so see this ""declination"" I signed.  I arrive and they said they didn't have anything.  So I finally go straight to the service department (Allen) and he took me to Roy McClure.  Roy didn't let me leave the store on a jacked up tire.  He took good care of me and made sure the issue was fixed.  Now this guy knows INTEGRITY, EXCELLENCE, and GREAT Customer Service!",5.0
26,"April 12, 2013","My wife and I stopped in late on a Saturday evening to look at a 2013 Chevy Silverado Crewcab.  We were met by Andy Heartman, who right away greeted us with a smile.  After looking at several trucks, we found the one we liked, and I was even allowed to take it home for 3 days, something no dealership had ever offered me before. That did it, I was hooked on the truck, and Tom Benson.
I received a fair price on my trade, and floor mats, a bed mat, and even two Chevrolet ball caps were thrown in the deal.
Andy and Stephanie were absolute professionals, and a delight to work with through the entire process. I never once felt pressured or misled.
The new dealership is beautiful and comfortable, and I recommend it, and Andy and Stephanie now to anyone looking for a car.
They'll have my business for many years to come.
Simply the best car buying expierience ever!

27,"August 18, 2011","My wife and I were looking into purchasing a newer vehicle and had test-driven a Chevy Traverse and really fell in love with that vehicle. We called and spoke to Russell in their ""Internet Sales Dept"". We made an appt. to meet with him and we were very surprised by the kindness and ""Non-pushy"" experience in dealing with him. We knew what we wanted and what we wanted to pay. Russell just helped us in meeting our criteria without all the ""BS"" that you sometimes have to deal with in other dealerships and their ""salespeople"". Everything from start to finish was a surprisingly great experience!!! I would definately recommend this dealership and if Russell or David Rice are around, seek them out!!!

28,"May 23, 2011","Great experience. Contacted the dealership about the availabity of a specific car that was on the website before driving from Austin to San Antonio. Karissa was assigned to help me once I arrived. She was very freindly and was knowlegeble about the Lexus ES350 that I was looking at. Once I completed the test drive, we went to her office and I made an offer which was accepted without any counter offers. The price for the car was very fair and well below the retail price. I was out of the dealership within a very short amount of time. This has been the best buying experience that I have had at a conventional dealership. No pressure, no hagling or time wasted.",5.0

33,"November 28, 2006","This is the best buying experience I have ever had.  Every other dealer in town jerked me around.  From the minute I arrived at Tom Benson I was greeted with a warm welcome.  They had the best selection in town on their pre-owned lot.  Tom took me through each step of the buying process informing me what was happening.  Took me through the service department getting me a direct contact to get my new vehicle serviced.  Even introduced me to some of the mechanics that had been there over 20 years.  I would definitely recommend this dealer and Tom Sanders.

34,"April 07, 2004","i would never reccomend this dealership to anyone in fact iwould discourage tmem from buying here. frank castillio tells you one price one day then goes up on it the next he did this at least three times in three days.mr.crow on the other hand just wont even call you back now thats real proffesional, and he is the manager,and besides that the vehicles lose their value by half as soon as they are driven off the lot and keeps losing value from then on.i will never buy nothing else from tom benson chevrolet where their word is like the wind you hear it but you dont see it im going to get adodge at least they have better resale value.        signed very disappointed-- jimmie deloach",1.0
