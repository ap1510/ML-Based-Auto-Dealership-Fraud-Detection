5,"March 09, 2017","Would not recommend this dealership to anyone. Bait & Switch. Drove 2 hrs to buy car that had been ""confirmed pricing, confirmed car was onsite"" only to get there at scheduled time and my salesman Jeff did not show.  Max stepped up and said the car had been sold....in the 2 days since I had talked to Jeff on phone about buying it.  (Later, when he was frustrated when I told him he screwed me over, he admitted the car that had been confirmed onsite on Wednesday Jan 11th had ACTUALLY been sold in November). They stated that they could not honor the confirmed pricing on the car, but could sell me another. Ended up costing me $2219 more. Went from 60 months of payments to 75 months just to get payments where I needed them to be.  I SHOULD have walked out. I just felt bad cause a friend of mine took me and I didn't want the trip to be a wasted one.  I drove 2 hours to get that price.  They delivered my car to my house since they didn't have what I wanted.  The car had a messed up paint job, 280 miles instead of 33, what looked like touch up paint on the side, and 4 low tires.....on a ""brand new 2017"" car, I immediately told them I did NOT want that car.  I was told ""hate to be rude, but....you signed for it....it's yours"".  Was also told if I wasn't completely satisfied with the car once the things were fixed on it, they'd see about getting me into another car.  Never happened.  Never took my calls after that. After it was repainted on top,  I got it back with a scratched door and scratched sunroof, and damaged handle.....mailbox full. Longview Hyundai (which is also a Randall Noe dealership) is who stepped up to try to rectify the situation.  Terrell dealership never took my calls after that 1st week.  Worst buying experience ever!! I Do NOT recommend this dealership at all. Look up BBB.Com before you buy. ",1.2

7,"November 24, 2016","I would recommend the dealership, Nick & Shelby where very nice. But the ball is being dropped somewhere after them. I met the owner and he was nice.",2.8
8,"November 24, 2016",Great experience for what car buying is... The only downfall was my car wasn't cleaned when it was supposedly going through a final detail at the end.,4.2
9,"October 20, 2016","to whom it may concern:

   I was in the store today. It was a very very long drive. I must have gotten there today around 5:30pm ~ 6pm. 
Anyhow, I had spoken to a Sara yesterday. She informed me that because it is a long drive that she would be happy to fill up my gas tank if I can come out to Randall Noll Hyundai. Upon hearing that, I stated thank you and that I would be out there today Oct. 19 around 2:30pm... However, something came up and I was running late, so I called Sara back this morning that I would not be able to make it by 2:30 today; to which she stated that is no problem; we will be here by 8pm. She stated that I could come anytime. She again confirmed that she would fill up my gas tank. So I said thanks.

  Well fast forward around 5:30pm. I am arriving at Randall Noll Hyundai and I was greeted by Max and then Nick. In the beginning, Max was very friendly as a car salesman normally is. He informed me that Sara was not present  and in fact that he was her superior. Max also confirmed that he would fill up my gas tank as Sara had stated.

  Well during the negotiations, when I rejected Randall Noll's offer, I stated that I cannot pay that was offered to me $20,300.00. I countered back with $18,000. I stated that I cannot pay more than $20,000 for TT&L. Upon hearing that, Max became irate and screamed at me and told me to get the xxxx out of his store. I said I will not pay that amount. Then he threatened me that he would call the police.
   I said, well what about filling up my gas tank as both Sara and Max had promised. He screamed at me more and yelled, ""Get the xxxx out of my store! And turning to his coworker to call the police.""

   Initially, I walked out; but after thinking about the actions of Max towards me, (a customer) I was very disrespected and spoken to in a condescending way. I decided to go back into the store and get an apology... and also to verify the names of ""Max"".

  Honestly, I do not think this Max fellow is fit to work as a salesman with a hot tempered, disrespectful, and condescending personality as him.

Sincerely, a customer,
Paul",1.2
10,"August 19, 2016","First of all, they did not honor with the email price they quoted, even I called and confirmed the price before I went !  Then the brand new car only delivered with one key, has been over a month from now and still no one really try to help getting another key for me, the sales team just keeping ignored my phone calls. Most terrible dealership experience I had !",1.0
11,"July 05, 2016","Benny Nordin is the best sales person I have ever met, and Nick is one of the most intelligent General Managers that a customer could ever ask for. Both of these guys know how to do business on a very effective and efficient manner.",5.0
12,"April 02, 2016",Great service. Everyone was great and courteous. I never had a better experience while buying a vehicle. I had such a great time and bought such a great vehicle. Time really flew by.,5.0
13,"January 27, 2016",Great attentive service. Knew the car well and acted like we were the only customers there. really made us feel  welcome and answered all of our questions. We'll be back! ,5.0
14,"January 20, 2016","Integrity is what was demonstrated here at this Hyundai dealership. Shelby, and Nick both were straight up with me when it came to making this happen. I actually tried to buy from a Dodge dealer close by and thats what was lacking. Integrity. The ability to loo me in the eyea and tell me what was wrong and tell me why omething wasnt working. The avility to lay it on the line and inform me of what was going to have to gake place for this deal to work out in BOTH our favor. Hyundai had it. The Dodge upper management dis not. So I bought from this Hyundai dealership. If you want a straight forward approach, a no BS dealership, look no further than Randall Noe Hyundai. Because in the end, you will know that you wee not lied to or missled. No surprises or being caught off guard when you think everything is going just great with your deal because you havent been told anything different only to be blindsided and told it wasnt going to work and not given a reason. Its called integrity. And for that Randall Noe will always have my business. In particular the Hyundai side. Love these guys. Thank tou Nick and Shelby both for all your help while I was there. I actually would have stayed longer if I could!!! ",5.0

17,"November 10, 2015","Nick, Cory, and Levon were amazing. I will recommend them to everyone looking to buy a car. They did an amazing job helping me find the car that I wanted and gave me a price that nobody could beat. Will be back next time we need a vehicle. ",5.0

19,"October 14, 2015","I had every intention of 'shopping around' & not jumping into a purchase.  The Hyundai dealership was the first stop and convenient since I work in Terrell.  The Santa Fe was the style I was interested in and the one we test drove had more bells & whistles than I really needed.  I did my research on prices of other makes and similar models - nothing compared to the Hyundai Santa Fe.  The safety rating, warranty, performance rating, price and overall make of the Santa Fe was impressive.  Do I feel like I could have received a better trade value on my car?  Yes, but was satisfied with the overall price offered.  The salesmen gave me time to process the deal offered with no pressure.  I felt comfortable with the vehicle and ultimately made the decision to purchase my first Hyundai.  So far, its been wonderful and I love it!  I'm technically challenged, so learning all that it can do will take some time.  I must admit that after purchasing the vehicle and showing off to friends an colleagues, I heard horror stories about the Randall Noe Service Department.  Not exactly comforting news after a major purchase, so I'm prayerful that the service area has improved and my service experience when needed will be nothing less than exceptional. Ryan was our salesman and knew I was not there to play games nor was it my first car buying experience. He is young and lacked knowledge of the vehicle, but he was very sweet and accommodating.  If he didn't know the answer - he made every effort to get one for us. Quality customer service be it in sales OR service is the KEY to return business and referrals. I trust I made the right decision on my purchase with Randall Noe Hyundai and will remain positive regarding future service needs.   ",4.0
20,"October 08, 2015","Took to long. We were there all day. I wanted to just forget it, not buy the car. I was tired of sitting there waiting all day. My husband got me to keep waiting . They said they would give us the tablet and the Walmart gift card, but have not heard anything about when are we supposed receive those items?",3.0
21,"September 25, 2015",Staff was very helpful and answered all my questions and concerns.   Would definitely recommend yalls dealership to anyone looking for a Hyundai. Thank you again for everything!,5.0
22,"September 06, 2015",I have purchased several vehicles over the years at Randall Noe and I have been satisfied on every purchase. Excellent dealership that will help you when you may need it the most.,4.8
23,"August 12, 2015",Everyone was so patient and nice. This is our second vehicle to purchase from Randall Noe and the experience with them the second time was even better.  Lavon has only worked there for a month and was very knowledgeable about all the features. It was over 100 degrees outside and he was willing to walk around with me for as long as I wanted him to. ,5.0
24,"July 30, 2015","Thank you very much, Ryan Hawkins!!  You are a great salesman who took care of me from the time I called on the phone to find out how to get to Terrell.
Thank you very much Steve Powell for all your hard work on my horrible credit!  I couldn't have gotten my great deal from any buy here pay here car lot.
I really appreciate all of you.  ",5.0
25,"July 21, 2015",I enjoy dealing with Mr Billingsley and buying many cars from Him/Noe.  He is an excellent salesperson with whom I like to deal with.  He and Nick ---- are very courteous.,5.0
26,"July 07, 2015","From the moment I contacted Randall Noe Hyundai regarding a specific Hyundai Sonota Limited I was looking for, I received an immediate return call from Brent. He was very polite and professional during our conversation. We had a 45 min. drive from Dallas to the dealership in Terrell, but upon our arrival, he immediately greeted us, brought us bottles of water, then proceeded to show us three vehicles of interest. Once we made our final decision, agreeing to a purchase price agreement with Manager Brian went very smoothly and to our satisfaction.Picking up the car also went perfectly. Brent spent a great deal of time demonstraing the many great features on this car, pairing the Bluetooth on the cell phone, then time in registering with Blue Link. He has followed up with us to be sure that we are happy with the purchase and to see if there are further questions. Manager Nick also spent time with us during this final stage to be sure we were satisfied. A smooth car buying experience!",5.0
27,"August 27, 2013",This was by far the worst experience I have had with a car delership! I looked online to find the new Hyundai I wanted and selected the one that had been reduced. I drove 30 miles to see the vehicle and checked with Gary the sales guy if it was the one i had seen online and confirmed the price and he said it was correct. After a test drive I said I would like to go ahead and purchase and was then told the price was incorrect and it was really 3k higher than advertised!! I then asked to see a manager and was told it was not their fault as they used a third party for their internet sales.I argued the point and said I would complain to the BBB and the Chamber. The sales manager walked away and I heard him cuss.I complained about that and spoke to yet another manager who said there was nothing he could do. I said this was deceptive advertising and he said it wasn't! The managers there have no people skills and do not care about deceiving their customers.I would not recommend anyone to visit this dealership!,1.0
