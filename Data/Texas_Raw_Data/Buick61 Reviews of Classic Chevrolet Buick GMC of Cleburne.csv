38,"August 15, 2017","Initial contact with Dawn gave me the impression Kris Brown dealership was prepared to offer me a great vehicle purchase experience. An appointment was setup to match my schedule which introduced me to Rocco"" the car guy"" in sales. Rocco had my chosen truck upfront ready for my test drive. He walked me through the sales process, working I believe to give me the best value for my trade-in while explaining optional equipment of interest to me. There was a little waiting for the finance process but I understand that part of the deal requires some time. I was happy with my rate. My experience was completed with Rocco going through the trucks many features. I expect the Kris Brown service department experience to be as good as my purchase experience. ",4.8

Bill (?) in inventory quickly located the Acadia Denali AWD Quicksilver Metallic (all the bells and whistles) that I was looking for. I would also like to compliment the parts department for resolving an issue with after-sale upgrades that I experienced (they even washed my truck after a tiny adjustment!).

Having known him outside the dealership for the past several years, he was just the type of guy I wanted to buy my next truck from. And I was right in my decision of doing business with him! He made the entire a process an absolute pleasure. I feel like I got a great deal, no pressure whatsoever, just very down to earth. I even took my kids with me to purchase the truck, I thought they might get bored but they had a great time, sitting in a few cars and taking ""selfies"" in the Corvettes.  Bill is the kind of guy I prefer to buy a vehicle from, straight forward, personable, hard working guy.
