0,"May 06, 2020","I was hoping for a great experience. I worked with my salesman over the phone before arriving. We came to an agreement on the price of a new pickup, I confirmed this with him twice. When I arrived I heard “simple mistake” and the price was $5,000 more than discussed. Additionally, there was an $1,100 accessories fee they added to the already inflated price. The last thing, and I knew it would be different (lower), is their online trade in calculator. It is based on Kelly Blue Book values. The salesman stated they don’t use KBB but rather the current auction rates. Fine, but don’t have it on YOUR website as a customer resource if it doesn’t matter. The total price discrepancy was over $10,000. I was prepared to walk out with a new truck. They did not uphold their end of the deal. When I let the sales manager know what happened he just stared at me, zero response. Pretty unethical sales tactics. I do not recommend this dealership",1.2
1,"February 24, 2020","My husband, Mike, and I had fallen in love with an Expedition Max from one of BB’s sister lots, however the sales rep there didn’t seem to have time to talk to us about it, so when we were in the market to by the expedition and a commuter car, we ended up at BB. Matt Mooney and Joe Deleon were great, ended up working out a deal to trade in our 2012 sienna for a ’14 Fusion and the Expedition that we loved. Well after a few days, my husband got the alarm that the engine was hot in the fusion. He put coolant in it and hoped for the best, keeping an eye on it. After 500 miles of driving the new to us Fusion, we had complete engine failure… your worst nightmare buying a used car. We took to it to an auto shop who told us that the coolant was leaking into the engine. We bought this car as is, so we thought we were screwed. My husband decided to take a chance and call Joe at BB and tell him what was going on. Joe immediately asked if he could get the car there and was SO willing to make it right, even tho it had been weeks and we purchased as is. We got it there and put they immediately put it in service, even gave us a loaner car. After my husband and I talked about, we told Matt and Joe that we were just not confident with this car anymore and they completely understood. They ended up swapping out the fusion for a nice ’15 Mazda6 that was an even better value than the fusion. We are SO happy with how they handled everything, they could’ve said ‘sorry, as is!’ but they DIDN’T and worked hard to make us happy and they DID. I will recommend them to everyone I know and will definitely go back in the future for our kids and ourselves. ",4.6
2,"February 13, 2020","Purchased a Ford Transit van from Bluebonnet Used in New Braunfels Tx.  The process was fluid from start to finish. The sales person we worked with was Jerome Richard and our Finance Provider was “Too Tall”.  Customer service is a dying breed in today’s society but this team has it down pat (if your old enough to have heard that before).  

I’m happy.  Easy process.  I highly recommend them. ",5.0

I took the car back only then blue bonnet says they found paperwork showing there body shop had done body work and paint. So I returned the car and went to Jordan Ford. I do not recommend blue bonnet! They wouldn’t even come off the price after finding out it had been wrecked and knowingly  tried to cover it up .,1.0
4,"April 12, 2018","I want to personally thank Mr. Eddie Rodriguez for his professional, courteous and patience.  Bought a Used 2006 Ford F150 and the vechicle was spotless, clean and excellent. Mr Rodriguez gave me the run down on used vechicles and as soon as I saw the Truck, I knew it was mine. Eddie  delivered on the promises he made, Car Washes, cover for Bed etc.  It's a good feeling to know that Sales people like Eddie still exist.  On a further note, I live in San Antonio and this is the second vechicle I have bought from BlueBonnet Motors, seems San Antonio still does not match up to the hospitality that strives in New Braunfels, Texas.     Thank you Mr. Eddie Rodriguez ",5.0

12,"April 06, 2018","Bob in parts dept is a less than enthusiastic employee. He barely acknowledged his female coworker from service when she needed his assistance on my behalf. He never looked at me. He was in charge of ordering a keyfob since mine no longer worked on my Grand Cherokee. He quoted a price and then was adamant about getting a P.O. from service before ordering, 
It turns out Bob failed to give an estimate for the price of programming the keyfob which brought the quoted price of $165 to $308 instead. 
I explained to service dept what I was quoted and that had I known the real price I would’ve looked into alternatives. Service: female (Michelle?)-the only female in service write ups was wonderful and explained the situation to Danny-service manager. My fee was changed to what I was quoted $165.  I only hope the money comes out of parts NOT service dept. I told Michelle? That I did not want to have to deal with parts again as they have been less than satisfactory while service dept goes out of its way to help.
It’s a shame that parts is not up to par with service dept. Thank you so much to the service team, Michelle, Danny and Manny, they’ve got my back!",5.0

17,"April 06, 2018","After doing some research online for a used truck, I drove to the used truck lot to have a look. I pulled in to the lot and could not find the truck in question, so I asked the only sales agent in sight, Alan Brucks, and he checked the inventory for me. He informed me that it was at the the main lot and offered to show me the truck. After a test drive we headed back to the first lot to discuss purchase. Alan was very courteous and knowledgeable. During our conversation, we discovered that our wives know each other. I did purchase a new (used) truck and am very happy with it. Alan was great and patient when showing my wife how to operate the command center. I would definitely recommend BlueBonnet Ford to everyone. The whole experience was great, fast, friendly, and hassle free. ",4.8

22,"April 05, 2018","Hopefully you have received the review I submitted to Ford shortly after purchasing my Ford F-150. Here is a recap: My wife and I were shopping at the Creekside Shopping Center in New Braunfels.  We stopped at Bluebonnet Ford on the way home to Universal City to look at the new Ford F-150 trucks.  Antonio Martinez approached us within minutes after we arrived to look at the line of F-150's.  I had no intentions about actually buying a F-150 that day and only once before back in 1989 did we buy a vehicle the first day. We were just going to look.  Antonio showed us a number of F-150's but we remained interested in the gold/white F-150 we first looked at.  About 30 minutes later, we were in the office completing the paperwork for our beautiful F-150.  Antonio drove the F-150 to our house in Universal City so my wife would not have to drive in the heavy traffic on Interstate 35.  He then briefed me on al the features of the new truck.  Afterwards, he drove our trade in Expedition back to Bluebonnet.  A few days later, we drove to Gear Stop to have accessoriness we ordered installed, cargo tie downs, sprayed in bed liner, Roll-N-Lock bed cover and chrome fender trim.  We then ordered a fold out step to gain entry into the bed easier.  Antonio accompanied us to Gear Stop.  He provided a truck for us to drive so we would not have to wait for all the accessories to be installed.  We ate lunch and shopped at the Creekside Shopping Center until called to pick up our F-150.  This is our first time at Bluebonnet and we were very pleased with the sales staff and also Chris and his team at Gear Stop.,  Two days after the accessories were installed and after listening to my buying experience, one of my friends bought a Ford Escape at Bluebonnet.  We are very pleased with our Ford F-150 and you would not believe the compliments we have received! ",5.0
23,"April 05, 2018","Our BLUE BONNET FORD experience purchasing a new Commerial vechical for our company was achieved with up most customer servce by Mike Mcquire in sales & Donna in finance.
The Dept was well staffed & the inventory was very selective.
I find Mike to be well rehearsed in answering all our questions & eager to satisfy our wants & needs.
Adding the BLUE BONNET FORD Truck to our fleet was just want our company needed.

26,"October 25, 2017","Our Salesman is Bill Turner and we have purchased vehicles from him in the past and will continue to do so in the future.  He is professional, courteous and not at all a high pressure salesman but instead goes the extra mile to make sure YOU are sure this is what you want.  Before deciding on a vehicle he arranged for me to take a loaner for a day to really test out the vehicle.  After eliminating all that I thought I wanted and numerous swap outs we made our purchase.  
I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND NOT ONLY THIS DEALERSHIP BUT PLEASE ASK FOR BILL TURNER!
THANK YOU AGAIN BILL",5.0

28,"June 08, 2017","My sales consultants name was Jeff McCullough, who came highly recommended from a good friend of mine at a sister dealership. I had a great experience working with Jeff. Like many buyers I'm sure, I came into the dealership expecting to buy a used pickup at an affordable price. Jeff mentioned that we should at least take a look at the new trucks and consider the rebates available. I was a bit nervous about buying a new vehicle, and after a couple hours of searching we didn't find one I believed would be in my price range. Jeff was not pushy, he told me to take the day off and he would contact me the following day with more options. The next morning he sent me a link to a brand new F-150 right around my price range that I could not pass up after the rebate. He had it transferred to his dealership immediately so that I could take it for a test drive. I was so happy with the price, the sales professionalism, and the vehicle that I bought it right then, and even added on a few upgrades. I highly recommend Jeff as Ford sales consultant, and greatly appreciated his strong family values. This is my second vehicle to buy from Bluebonnet, and I will definitely take my wife there to buy her next new vehicle when the time comes.",5.0
29,"April 17, 2017","After finding a great deal on a new 2016 Focus Titanium on Bluebonnet's lot, my wife and I pre-qualed ourselves through Capital One. We don't like haggling, or negotiating...and we definitely don't like wasting anyone's time. We visited to the dealer with the intent of buying *only* the specific car we found, *only* at the quoted price, *only* financed through Capital 1, at *only* their terms. The only circumstances under which we would bend would be if a lower rate was found elsewhere, or if we were offered a lower price (no way that was happening, as the car's price was well, well below MSRP). We would not have purchased a vehicle if any of the conditions were not met. Bluebonnet's sales structure, with their no-haggle pricing, and their reasonable fees, accommodated all of our requirements, and made our couple of hours there pleasant.

From the beginning stages of us online shopping, to the end when we drove off the lot, we were helped by Lee Agnello. He was professional, personal, honest, and clear. He wasn't all about the fake smiles, or the fake pleasantries, or the general fake sales attitude that many sales people have. He was exactly what car sales people should be.

When we arrived, he immediately walked us out to the Focus (he had it pulled out up front for us) and gave us a 3 minute sort of walk around. There was a mechanic tinkering with it when we walked out. Because the car had been on the lot for a while (hence the ridiculously low price), he asked the service folks to drop a new battery in it, which was a nice touch. After he was done walking us around it, he offered to take us on a test-drive. We declined, as we wanted to go through numbers first. If the numbers didn't work, there was no sense in us moving any further.

He put together numbers, which were exactly what we wanted. He collected our credit application, and per my instruction, told the finance crew that we were insistent on financing through Cap 1. While they did their work, we went out on a test-drive. When we test drive cars, I prefer just...quiet. I prefer to listen to the car...the engine, the wind noise, the brakes, etc. I try to remove distractions to really ""feel"" the car. Some sales people will yammer on about whatever while on a test-drive. Lee just sat back and let us do our thing. It was great.

When we returned, another gal (I can't recall her name) sat with us for a few minutes while Lee checked on financing. She pitched us some car protection packages...paint sealants, interior sealants, and car detailing. We declined. Based on our past car buying experiences, we expected a bit of pushiness. Nope, the gal just thanked us and called Lee back over. No pressure what-so-ever.

Lee walked us over to finance, where we waited maybe 10 minutes. Our finance rep (Cody) walked us into his office and started going through the final steps. He asked us questions about what we do for a living, other general small talk, and about our driving habits. He was personable, and like Lee, straight-forward. Like I figured, his driving habit questions were leading into pitching us an extended warranty. Before he began, I essentially cut him off (I may have been a bit rude...if any Bluebonnet staff are reading this...sorry about that) and mentioned that we didn't want any additional warranties. He was fine with it, but explained that he was required to talk to us about them. He did, we declined, and Cody moved on.

When Cody mentioned that he final numbers we were given matched what we were pre-qualed for through Cap 1, we were elated. We signed some paperwork, and went on our way. I should mention that our credit application was run through 3 lenders. We would have preferred to stick to only Capital 1, but per Cody, they were required to try at least 3. Anyone reading this should note that this means that there *will be multiple hard pulls of your credit report*...but don't fret. The pulls will all be flagged as auto loan related, and will be identified as a ""cluster pull"" (I believe that's what it's called), which, for scoring purposes, will only count against you as if it was a single pull.

A few extra things to note. 
- On our test drive, I noted a slight steering wheel vibration. When we were done, Lee had the service dept look into it. It turns out that there was a small ""flat spot"" in one of the tires. Like the battery replacement, this was directly related to the fact that the car had been parked on the lot so long. The service crew re-balanced the tires, and did what they could to work out as much of the flat spot as possible. The vibration is about 95% gone, and will hopefully be completely gone the more we drive the car. Lee noted a free tire rotation in our file, which will accompany our complimentary 5,000 mile oil change.
- Make sure you ask them about their 1 year of free car washes (interior and exterior). The offer a year of free washes on every new vehicle they sell. The free washes are from a car wash chain with plenty of convenient locations in San Antonio and the surrounding areas. You could literally get your car washed every day for a year if you like.
- Don't expect to walk into this dealership and negotiate their bottom-line prices. Maybe there is wiggle room, but the way I understand it, their vehicles pricing is what it is. In looking at several other cars online, their pricing is very, very competitive.
- Don't be afraid to say no. No one that we dealt with was even remotely pushy. A simple ""no, thank you"" from me was enough for them to carry on. These folks are not about high-pressure sales tactics.

Overall, it was a SOLID 5 star experience. Everyone at Bluebonnet was great. Big thank yous to the team that helped us make our short day-trip to New Braunfels fruitful. We're looking forward to having our new car serviced at Bluebonnet.",5.0
30,"April 12, 2017","This was the most straightforward and honest dealership of the many that we visited in shopping for a new car. Keith took excellent care of us from beginning to end. The facility is beautifully maintained and was a comfortable place to spend a few hours while finishing up our purchase. We would consider driving from San Antonio for service to enjoy their waiting area- pastries, coffee, oversized leather chairs- world's above the offerings of our closest Ford. We would wholeheartedly recommend Bluebonnet Ford.",5.0

32,"March 29, 2017","The salesmen who help me (Oscar and Josh) were both extremely helpful, friendly, and professional.  They were able to make a great deal on both my trade in and my new purchase, as well as some additional incentives (the price they offered me was actually $800 less than what I was expecting to pay).  Cody, the finance guy, was also very respectful and did not try shove any additional warranties down my throat; he told me about them and their benefits, and that was it.  This is in stark contrast to the borderline extortion that goes on at other dealerships.

I would highly recommend this dealership to anyone out to buy a new car.",5.0

Anyway, after they appraised my trade in and was told that the bank would not carry it over, I was quickly shuffled out the door with barely a goodbye and not even a thank you. Didn't even ask me if I had money to put down. I quickly left the dealership and told myself that I would never come back here and would not recommend this dealership to anyone. ",1.0

He listened to me and took note of all my needs and work with me to find the right car for the right price. Now for years when I have shopped cars I have found that the sales staff either were so pushy or they just don't care. Bill was easy to talk to and never pushed. Was a gentleman. that means so much to me.
After I choose the Lincoln I wanted he made sure everything was done and gave me all the info I needed. I had a friend with me and she watched how I was treated and what kind of service I got. She was impressed and said when she gets ready to buy that she was not only going to Bluebonnet but that she was going to buy a Lincoln. I am so very Impressed. I have always bought dodge. No more :)
I am sold on Lincoln!!! Now that that is said...as soon as I use the service department i will do a review on that end. You can have a great sales person but what keeps one coming back on top of that is the service department. As of yet I have never been at a dealership with a 5 star service department. I am looking forward to seeing if this company will get a 5 start on that end.

49,"March 24, 2016","Overall I had a great buying experience using Bluebonnet Ford in New Braunsfels Texas. I was searching for our daughters first car in which we were very interested in purchasing a Ford Focus. We saw a good deal in our Sunday Newspaper. We immediately called the dealership, where Mr. Curt Hammock answered our call... We spoke and we provided Curt with our price.. He went beyond our needs and came back with a price we were happy with. Curt had the vehicle ready upon our arrival to the dealership. He explained all the details of the vehicle. After the road test we were satisfied and Curt then processed the buying paperwork. The paperwork aspect went very quickly and flawlessly. This is our second purchase at this dealership. Outstanding sales support in which Mr. Curt Hammock provided makes buying vehicles a pleasure. He did not pressure us, and listened to our needs. I would recommend to my friends to seek Curt Hammock when purchasing a vehicle from Bluebonnet Ford..  Also outstanding cudos to Mr. Jason Gonzales who processed our loan...

However one thing that did grind my gears a bit was the $200 charge for the initial clean up of the vehicle. That should %100 come with the purchase of the vehicle, especially one so expensive. That's really something to think about. But to end off on a good note I was pleased with everything else. ",4.6

3rd experience - called BB Jeep early in the morning (after dealership was open) but got voice mail. Left message to call me. Never returned my call;

Also a relative of mine bought a car from Bluebonnet dodge and had found an oil leak the second day they had it.

92,"October 11, 2012","I purchased a certified used 2010 Ford Escape hybrid from them in July, 2012.  Because it is a hybrid, this car is VERY hard to find (new or used) and carries a very high book value when compared to other Ford Escapes.  In spite of that, Brad worked well with me on the price of my trade-in, and the price of the car I purchased.  

Brad was very well informed of what the car could do, and its' features.  The negotiations on price went well, and took less time than many other dealers I have dealt with in San Antonio and South Texas over the years.  There was no evidence of any &quot;bait and switch&quot; while at this dealership, which is something I can't say about other dealers (are you listening, &quot;Red&quot;?)

In addition to being a Ford Certifed vehicle, they included a copy of the AutoCheck on the car even before I asked for one.  It was washed and filled with gas when I took delivery.  The car was exactly as represented, and has performed flawlessly in the three months since I made the purchase.  

Bluebonnet and Brad Traster have followed up several times since the purchase to ensure everything went well.

I had just had a very poor experience through a Dodge dealer on the other end of town, so I was pretty frustrated and sceptical.  I saw the ad for Blue Bonnet for with a too goo to be true price in the ad.  I thought I would read the small print to laugh at the ""one in stock - subject to pre-sale"" disclaimer, but was surrpised to see the ad said ""7 in stock.""  That was different.  

I called the dealership and they put me through to Marty.  He told me he had 3 left, they were flying like hotcakes (at that price I can see why!).  I asked him what the total price was, and he gave me the price of what the truck was, with a bedliner (a must have), tint, alarm, tt&l would be.  The total price was around $10k less than what sticker + the add ons + TT&L would be!  :)  I asked if I could get it in writing, and he gladly emailed it to me.  I had already test driven a Ford F150 at another dealer who only had brown in stock in what I wanted.  So I knew that I liked the truck already.  I told Marty that if his numbers didn't change, he sold the truck, all I needed to do was pick which color and sign the paperwork.

I drove up after work, and he had all three ready upfront for me to take a look at - a blue, a black, and an adobe one.  After looking at each and talking with the wife decided on the blue one.  We left the lot with my new truck less than 45 minutes after we arrived!  

Marty was extremely courteous and straight forward with everything.  Salemen know the price of the vehicles they are selling, and if they won't tell you their lowest price upfront walk away and call Marty!!!

105,"May 08, 2012","I had a great experience with a Ford dealership in San Antonio who told me I was approved through 3 creditors/banks. He even showed me the computer screen where I saw 3 green check marks next to the 3 banks. Bluebonnet Ford in New Braunfels lied directly to my face. 

First of all they treated me like I was a huge inconvenience and waste of their time and not just the man we were working with but every one acted that way. Any one who walked through the hall just looked at us like we were scum, even the old woman walking around in a short dress and stiletto heels. Trashy. They were condescending and acted like my business or money wasn't good enough. 

I was approved with 3 banks on the condition that I put $1000 down. Bluebonnet lied to me and said I was only approved through ONE bank and that I had a $14,000 cap. It's so convenient that they had just bought 4 Nissans priced around $14,000 that they obviously were desperate to get rid of. They kept telling me that was the ONLY car I qualified for. I could have bought any car on that lot if I wanted to and they still insisted on their ugly Nissans. I told them they were wrong about the banks and they continued to lie to my face. I also told them which car I wanted to make a deal on and they said it was impossible. 

I've never heard of a dealership WANTING to push away a sale but that's exactly what they did. Bottom line they are stuck up, full of crap and think they are better than every one else. It's a good thing I had plenty of other dealerships waiting to make a great deal with me. I will never recommend them to any one and I'm sad that they are such a huge disgrace to Ford considering my family has driven Ford forever and my grandfather and brother worked for Ford as well. My parents have also done a lot of business at that Bluebonnet location and I always thought they were great until my experience. If you want to buy a $30,000 car or more and have perfect credit with $10,000 down then you are definitely WORTH their time. If you're price range is any less than that then they want nothing to do with you. Don't waste your time because you will only be a waste of their time.

I tried to find out why they would not send out the check and all got was a bunch of excuses from Liz. She was extremely rude and offhanded.  In addition, they refused to send a check for the inspection which they charged me for on my contract and I had to pay for because I was sold a car without an inspection sticker.

When I took the truck into the service department for warranty work, I asked about the plates for the truck. I was tossed back and forth between the new and used lot; just to be told the plates were about to be mailed from the new lot because they hadn’t been picked-up yet. Again, I never even got a call to let me know the plates had arrived. Then, I receive a random check in the mail from Bluebonnet which stated “Overpayment of Registration”.  A few days later, I received a renewal notice from the DMV and realized that the check was meant to pay the registration for this year. Again, there was a complete LACK of communication! I lost this check while helping my sister evacuate from their home in Bastrop. When I called to get the check re-issued, I got tossed back and forth just to find the person that could help me. I was told the check would be sent out that following Monday. A week later, I called and got even more of the run-around. I had enough and wrote a letter of complaint in the feedback section of their website. I quickly got a call and was told the check was ready to be picked up. I was told then that the General Manager would be calling me. The next day, I received an e-mail from my salesman. I’ve copied the closing statements from his message:
 “…Again I am very sorry for all you’ve had to go through. I can only hope that you will consider our apologies and also realize that we are all human. Though it may seem, in your opinion, Bluebonnet is not worth recommending, other dealerships have humans working for them as well and no one is perfect. Your letter indicates you will not be shopping here again or recommending us. If that remains true I hope you find a dealership that meets your standards.
 Respectfully Yours, 
 Jerome Rickard / Sales Representative 
 Bluebonnet Motors”
I sent back a letter stating that poor customer service on account of just being human was flat out pathetic and inexcusable.  I received another letter from the General Manager’s Administrative Assistant. She assured me that I would get a phone call very soon, and that the GM was personally going to review my file to see what they could do to make me happy with my purchase. That was on September 28th, and I haven’t received another phone call or e-mail from them since!  So, when they say that at Bluebonnet, “Price is the Difference”; they really mean that the true cost is customer satisfaction and service. This experience has reinstated the fact that you get exactly what you pay for!

111,"September 06, 2007","This dealer plays the shell game game with its internet sales. I viewed one of there used cars online. Requested more detail photo's and made them an offer the same day. Car listed on Auto trader and dealer website for $11,995.  Immediatly, after making the offer the salesman called back said that the car sold 10 minutes prior. The next day I had looked at dealer site and viewed same car (matching VIN's) advertised now for $17,995. Called inquired about vehicle asked them how much they were asking, just to play stupid. When confronted they said car advertised was sold. However, the Matching vin #'s was the proof in the pudding. I would reccomend caution in dealing with this unethical establishment. ",2.3
