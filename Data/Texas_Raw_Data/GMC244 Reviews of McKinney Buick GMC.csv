0,"June 04, 2020",We were very disappointed by our experience at this dealerships service department. We dropped the car off yesterday to diagnose a noise coming from the front. We were told it might be a day or two. No one called us with updates by late afternoon on day two so we called them.  We were told that no one had looked at it yet and that he had put it in the que but had no idea when they would get to it. We found this to be very unacceptable response. We went down and picked it up and the service guy would not even look at us or apologize for the delay. Terrible customer service. Stay away from them. ,1.0
1,"May 04, 2020","We bought 2 vehicles and Derrick was awesome. If you need a vehicle without the usual 'car salesman' pitch and pressure, I highly recommend you go see Derrick B. He went above and beyond any salesman I have ever dealt with. He was patient, helpful and very knowledgeable. Derrick kept asking if we were happy with our choice and took the time to show me how things worked in my Terrain. He took the same amount of time with my husband and his Canyon. It was very late by the time we were finished, but no steps were skipped. Our vehicles were detailed, Michelle inspected the vehicles after and they were perfect. I would definitely recommend McKinney Buick GMC to anyone looking for a quality care buying experience. Brandon in Finance explained everything clearly and made sure we got the best warranty coverage and stayed in our price range. ",5.0

5,"December 27, 2019","I purchased my gmc yukon on 11.02.2019. The sales reps Josh and Perez, were awesome. 
However,  SERVICE DEPT IS  HORRIBLE! The manager has no customer service skills whatsoever, so you can imagine how the remaining staff treats customers. On  Saturday Nov. 9th, my vehicle was detailed/onstar setup.  Got home and realized my GPS is defected. Called back and they requested I bring my vehicle back in. Please keep in mind that I live an hour away. I go ahead and decide to bring my vehicle back to the dealership. Dan, the service manager, helped me and adv. he would have to order a part and he'd be in touch. (Fast Forward), here we are 2weeks later, Monday, November 25th, no callback, no follow up, and after several attempts on my end to get an update, BRANDY, had the audacity to HANG UP on me!!! Dan never followed up, refused to call me back. I just dont understand.  A simple update would have solved the problem, but instead of taking ownership of the situation, the Service Dept has turned this into a pure xxxx show. I get it Dan, you're busy, managing ... but BRANDY?! She's busy making a simple issue a lot worse. I'm sure she's done this before. She needs training over providing excellent customer service. 
I want this complaint to go as far as it possibly can go! 

Update: Called Corporate, Dealership was provided another opportunity to make things right,  but of course,  failed to do so. Car problems still exist. Next step is BBB. 
Who would've thought,  buying a car from a dealership would need so much immediate service!!! Nothing but problems!",1.0

11,"November 15, 2019",Worst dealership I have ever dealt with.  Refused to honor USAA car buying service price.  Also tried to add on additional money to sales quote.  Do not deal with these people.,1.0

16,"October 09, 2019","Josh Black took care of us throughout the purchase of my Sierra Denali and ensured my complete satisfaction. Michelle assisted when I found an small dent after vehicle was released to me. My wife has had good experiences with the service department on her Yukon Denali, but I found my recent experience with them a little more transactional and less personalized than I am used to with my service at Classic BMW. All in all a good experience and I would certainly recommend this dealership.",5.0

I am not expecting them to give me special treatment but the fact that he did it made me feel different about the dealership. I am so impressed with his service and kindness the he showed me. I was about to write them off but because of the service managers willingness  to  help me  has changed my feelings about this dealership....",5.0

24,"June 21, 2019","Purchased a CERTIFIED Tahoe a few months ago. During the transaction process, pre-owned sales guaranteed that the Tahoe was 100% inspected and Certified. Minor cosmetics were fix and I trusted the service inspection and I did not look under the car. 

False ad, the ad reported 73k miles. Car had over 80k miles
GM would not respect CERFIED due to miles over which they told me after signing the contract.

On the first oil change service after 3 months, I finally had a chance to view underneath the Tahoe.  Service mechanic went through the inspection process and reported that the 2 front struts are leaking. Recommend to have them replaced.

I called service to report what I found right away. Brandy my service rep said McKinney GMC BUICK is not in service for free. Comment received before I was even able to ask for the pre-owned sale Mgr Dan.

I then tried to contact Dan Avshalumov. I was told we was not in and will give him my message to call. I waited for a couple of days but no response. I tried calling again for Dan and I was told he’s on vacation and we’ll send him a message which he never did contact me.

Several days go by and I finally tried customer service, my complaint was taken and no one ever called me.

False ad of CERTIFIED car (untrustworthy)
After sales completes, pre-owned sales will never call you back.
Customer Service, they’ll chat with you but that’s all you get.

So willi suggest buying car from McKinney GMC BUICK, that’s a big NO.
Make sure you do your homework, do physical inspections of the car your buying. Look under the car and every inches, NEVER TRUST the seller.",1.2
25,"June 17, 2019","I requested yesterday Sunday 6/16/19 to be contacted in reference of a Honda Pilot in excellent  shape. I live in Richmond VA and it is very difficult to find this kind of car in very good conditions and with a clean Carfax. I was willing to take it from Texas. 
Today Mon 6/17/19 am a salesman contacted me giving me the great news that the car was available. I told him that I was very interested in it and he requested me personal information to start with the financing process.
At 2.22 pm of Monday 6/17/19 the salesman left me a voicemail saying that he got a great deal for me.
At 3.01 pm of Monday 6/17/19 the salesman sent me a txt saying that the car was just sold.
The minimum that the salesman could have done was contacted me and asked me how serious was my interest in it to buy it or not because there was another person that was interested. In fact, I considered that wasn't necessary since I gave him my info to start with the financing process which its implicit that I really wanted the car.
Anyways....I m VERY VERY disappointed with this dealership. They are not serious and there is not commitment with the client.

Clarence Davis, Brandon Young, Mat and Michael as well as Brandie were all very professional and excited for me in my new truck. Then it got a little emotional. Personally it was God's grace in the process. ",5.0

Jared, Rod and Joshua made me feel so comfortable and really truly cared about finding something within my budget yet still managing to give me everything I asked for and more.

32,"April 21, 2019","I just need to take a moment to brag about the incredible staff at McKinney Buick GMC! 

I began searching for a new vehicle when my 2011 Dodge Nitro decided to take its wiring issues and multiply them. What started as the clock losing time the day I bought the car in 2012 became a whole range of wiring problems including the horn randomly honking & the hazards running periodically while the engine was off. Last week was the icing on the cake because the battery was being drained overnight while the car sat on my driveway. 

I got online and started hunting. I drove a GMC Terrain as a rental a couple of years ago and I only remembered how comfortable every one of those 2,057.1 miles were that I drove. I came to realize that there weren’t many used GMC options which told me without question that they are a vehicle make people keep. I wanted to be one of those people who loved their car so much they couldn’t imagine driving anything else!

You guys, I stumbled across the team at McKinney Buick GMC only to realize I’d liked their Facebook page a year ago when I’d read their reviews then. - Derrick Bofferding (sales), Josh Lewis (finance manager), and all of the unsung heroes who worked with my less than stellar credit score not only made me feel like I was a part of the family, but they treated me with respect. I didn’t feel at all like I was being given a sales pitch. I felt like their entire team understood my frustration with my inability to be free to get up and go as I please. Their team went out of their way to stay late and cater to my questions. - I cannot say enough positive about them!

Perhaps the greatest evidence I have of the way I was treated was the fact that I reached out willingly to give Derrick a hug as we left. Both my mom & my brother’s jaws were about on the ground. Because I don’t do hugs, I don’t do people in my personal space. But these guys went out of their way to make me feel welcomed and comfortable throughout the entire process, from the time my initial inquiry hit their system to the moment I drove out of the parking lot. And for that, they’ll never truly understand the impact they’ve had on me.  

I am beyond happy with my purchase and will be back to McKinney Buick GMC for years to come as they have certainly exceeded my expectations and have earned a client for life!",5.0
33,"April 05, 2019","I always feel like the service department does a great job, and deals honestly with customers. Always bring my GMC for service/repairs to Mckinney GMC!",4.8
34,"March 27, 2019",I had an engine problem and the team was amazing. They kept me up to date and as they found more issues they were in constant contact to update me. They had it for over 2 weeks which ended with a full engine replacement. I will be a GMC customer for life and this is my dealership that I will be using. ,5.0
35,"March 12, 2019","DO NOT buy a certified pre owned car from here unless you get a detailed checked list of the mechanic and what he checked. Short story for here: I bought a Certified pre owned vehicle from GMC McKinney and was bent over. Before I took possession they replaced the upper A arms and lower ball joints. Not long after my pitman arm and idler arm. Three other shops went on record with me to state the mechanic either overlooked or completely dismissed that if you replaced the Upper A arm and lower ball joints then the pitman arm and idler arm would have had play and need replacing too. The mechanic certified the vehicle with problems with the vehicle and ignored them. The vehicle was sold with problems the mechanic ignored or skipped. The certification process was questioned and no paperwork could be provided to show the process or what was checked
The media needs to be involved with this. If GMC McKinney is selling these vehicles like this to people and they are not TRULY certified pre owned there is an issue.

36,"March 01, 2019","I contacted the dealership ""Malcomb"" in used car sales about a 2013 BMW X3 with 34k Miles for $23k It was listed (and still is) as having ""everything BMW can put on the vehicle. It was listed as having Heads up, Leather, Nav, Bose, Harmon Kardon, Heated and cooled seats, Backup Camera on and on. I talked to Malcomb several times BEFORE I came out and told him to ""verify"" this car had all it was listed as having, he said he would and so on. I made the trip to look at the car last night and was shocked when it had NONE of the features listed, except Leather. The car was also ""pretty well worn"" as well. After getting in an noticing the VAST DIFFERENCE from what was advertised to what it really was I told Malcomb, ""We are done here"" and asked for my keys back. The used car managers in  the booth made no effort to address me, or even look at me when we came back in, instead choosing to cower in their tower. I would NEVER, EVER RECOMMEND Mckinney Buick GMC to anyone for any reason. This dealership is dishonest, misleading, deceptive and unethical. I will be reporting them to the complaint center as well. Thing is...I was a cash buyer",1.0
37,"February 23, 2019","I live in California, and flew into Texas to purchase my 2018 GMC Yukon EX Denali.  My salesperson was Mike Perez and he went beyond normal service to make my purchase very enjoyable and easy. Since I was out of State, communication was excellent with emails, texts, and phone conversations. He picked me up at the hotel in my Yukon, and I was soon leaving the Dealership with my purchase, and heading to California,  I would recommend if you want to purchase a GMC product call Mike Perez, visit McKinnery Buick GMC, and drive home with a purchase I know you will be extremely happy with.

38,"February 12, 2019","The service center is top notch. I have never bought a car from this dealership, but I can positively say that the service department is like no other. I have been taking my car to this dealership for 3 years now. Justin in the service department is the person to talk to. He will respond quickly and help out however he can. I have a very busy schedule and I easily get stressed out about car repairs. Justin always helps me understand what is going on, gives me timely updates, and helps work around my schedule so that way I am not as stressed. I absolutely don't know what I would do without this dealership and great workers like Justin in the service department.",5.0
39,"February 09, 2019","Buyer Beware..  Very disappointed in the Manager staff at the Used Car section of McKinney Buick.  We arrived to look at a car quoted online at a certain price.  First round of paper-work quoted included an extended warranty at an extra cost, but the car is just 1-year old with less than 20K miles.   Told the salesperson I would talk it over with the wife. Later in the evening, brought the wife in the look at the car. As we are negotiating the price, we advise the salesperson that we do not want the extended warranty.  He comes back with a new offer that removed the extended the warranty but added $1,000 for re-conditioning, which was not on the original quote I received just hours earlier.   It was a shell game - removing the ""extended warranty"" but adding ""re-conditioning"" to a vehicle that needed none. They priced the car low to get folks in the door - but add on fees that make it no deal at all..     This is a shady and dishonest practice that McKinney area residents should be aware of at this particular dealer.  Buyer Beware..  We will continue our hunt and look for a honest dealer... ",1.0

When I got there, they couldn’t find the keys and I had to wait around for 30 minutes. After we looked at it they started in on the classic run around.

We agreed to a deal, signed papers, wrote a check for a down payment, and I shook hands with multiple managers only to have that deal rescinded due to a mistake in the valuation of my trade. They restructured a new deal that was not the one I signed for and ultimately unfavorable. When I brought this to the attention of the general manager, I was met with an incapacity to understand the situation. The car was conveniently dealt to the other person interested.

We had dealt with Justin before on my wife's car and were thrilled with the level of service we received.  It's a car with electrical parts, so things are bound to happen.  We brought the car in on a Saturday and they fixed the issue within a couple of hours, or so we thought.  The engine light came back on, so we brought it back again the same Saturday.  It was thought that the part was defective so they replaced it again.  Monday came and as I was driving to work the light came back on.  This time, they gave me a loaner and did a deeper diagnosis.  The problem was diagnosed and a fix in place.  Hopefully they got it this time.  They are a refreshing group and a pleasure to work with.

87,"February 13, 2017","My wife and I purchased a 2014 Prius 2 from the pre-owned side of the dealership on Saturday, and were very impressed with the overall accommodation and professionalism of Matt and Jerry, the sales guys we dealt with. I emailed and spoke with 5-8 other dealerships that had comparable vehicles, and found Matt and Jerry to be the most courteous and most willing to cut us a great price out of all of them, beating the next best price for a comparable Prius 2 by $750, and most of the others by around $1,000 – and to top it off, the model on their lot had a very clean CarFax report and the lowest mileage of all the cars that we were looking at. Jerry and Matt were willing to let us get the car checked out by a 3rd party mechanic, and since everything looks great,  we feel that we really got a great deal. 

Our only complaint is that the finance department seemed to try to get several large charges by us, but ultimately we got the numbers back to where we wanted them, and we bought a modest warranty package and they beat our credit union financing rate by a pretty good measure. 

Overall, we are very happy, and would recommend Jerry and Matt to anyone.

I ended up making a deal and purchasing one of thos two trucks.  I later found out that the truck didnt have items that he said were included.  The next day when i noticed i called david kelly the gm and he said there was no proof i was told.  After i made the deal and the deal was approved it took 1.5 hours to talk with finance.  I wanted some accessories for my new truck and my sales rep said finance would discuss these option.  When i finally got to finance he told me the parts departmemt deals with add ons and he could assist me. By this point i had been at the dealership approx four hours so i was ready to leave. So i purchased with no accessories.  After signing paperwork i went outside to do a final walk odlf the truck. During prep they put two scratches and a dent on the new truck.  The first words out of her mouth were, ""usually when younpurchase a new vehicle it is as is, but we are going tonoffer to fix this damage"" wasnt that wonderful since they created the damage while inwas signing papers.  When they didnthe repairs they broaght me a loaner with an empty tank. They took my truck with a full tank and brought it back on half.  It was also filthy dirty. They didnt even clean the vehicle before returning.  There are swirl marls in the paint where they did repairs.  When i discussed all of this with the general mgr david kelley. He told me the truck was full and detailed when it left the dealership. He refused to fix the items the sales rep said were on the truck.  And last but not least.  I was charged over 2000 for dealership add ons.  The adds were, tinted windows (which was already listed on the regular window sticker), nitrogen in the tires (there were no nitrogen valve stem covers on the truck and no literature inside the truck), paint guard and fabric guard (no literature or proof of either of these). Again mr kelley lied and said these were on the truck.  This is the worst dealership i have ever dealt with.  And for someone on the GM level to outwardly lie (i still have the full email list) is absurd. Most of the time mr kelley would ignore my calls and emails.

Normally a service advisor takes the time to advise about your vehicle. Not at McKinney GMC. 
There was no post service review, advice given about future service needs, or discussion on routine maintenance schedule.

We decided to drive by and look at what they had on the lot in person, with no intent to deal with sales people that day.  Luckily, we ended up crossing path's with Larry.  He was able to pair us up with a new crew cab truck that had enough rebates to meet our needs and still offered the space we needed for two children.  Larry was ver conscious of our time constraints as our son was at school and had to be picked up.  He handled all of the heavy lifting to get our deal squared away before we left so that all we had to do was go through finance when we came back in the evening.  Although the finance portion of the deal always seems to take the longest, the process was pain free and we ended up with a good deal on a great truck.  Very happy we ended up stopping by that day.  We probably would not have bought or even sat down if it had not been for Larry.

We were planning on buying a 2015 and expected to have to make a few compromises but ended up with a 2016 that was within our budget and was EXACTLY what we wanted. Nick (sales manager) made sure we got all the incentives we were eligible for and worked with Austin to find the right truck. There was also an issue with one of the payoffs on our old car and Nick handled it with no hassle on our part. The price we agreed on was the price we paid. The finance department is night and day compared to a couple years ago when Damien was around. What a nightmare that was. Things were problem-free this time. Armando handled our paperwork and had us out quickly. They will offer you extended warranties when you go to sign but they are optional. I think some people mistake this as them changing the price. 

Austin and Nick made sure our experience was painless. They were completely honest and transparent with pricing and everything throughout the whole process. They did all the work and made sure everything was handled for us. Any hiccups we encountered they resolved. It was the most pain-free experience I have ever had buying a car.

Then when we said we were not interested but wanted them to research to find others, they weren't very helpful. We let them do a trade review for our car when we were there which we never got anything from them. We expected some contacts from them the day after we were there but no one followed up. That was a Tuesday - the next day we went to Ewing GMC and bought a 2015 Acadia Denali on the next Saturday, 4 days after we were first at Ewing.

146,"September 12, 2014","Let me state first that our sales rep, Shae Williams, was nice and courteous. It is the sales manager in pre-owned,  John Williams, that I am unhappy with and am basing this review on.  As my wife and I were leaving the finance department, he walked right past us without saying a word. He smiled, but that was it - no congratulations, no handshake, no thank you for your business, nothing!  While waiting on the SUV to be cleaned, he left his office two times and walked by us, and still nothing.  Additionally, the very back of the SUV was not entirely clean and we didn't even get a full tank of gas.  The last two items may seem petty, but I expect a tank of gas at the very least after spending what we did – give me more than 2 days worth of gas to drive around on.  It was literally closing time when everything was finished, as John was starting to lock up and was turning off the lights when they brought us the vehicle, but that shouldn’t matter - we should get the same level of service and professionalism no matter what time of the day.  It was clear to me that John did not appreciate our business and that he wanted us out so that he could get on home for the evening.  We will never buy another vehicle from them.  ",1.6

173,"May 14, 2013","I won't name any names in this review, rather just say that the entire car buying/considering process was the worst I've ever had at McKinney Buick/GMC. 

While the staff was friendly when we walked in they simply would not listen to what we tried to tell them we wanted. Every used car salesman trick in the book was pulled out, which is fine to a degree, I expect to deal with that when purchasing a car. But when the customer is trying to tell you they want something specifically, don't spend time selling them something esle.

The car buying process has shifted, from negotiating on the sales lot for the over price of the car to the finance desk where negotiating comes down to years and monthly payments. Don't fall for this trick! McKinney Buick/GMC has it down to an art. Make the purchasing decision before the financing decision, that means talk in terms of total dollars on the car first, then interest rates and length of loans.

We actually finally were able to get the salesman to talk in terms of actual car price, and eventually got the deal we desired. Upon entering the finance managers office we were told they needed to add an additional year on the car loan to satisfy ""bank requirements"". I asked what does that do to the price of the car and was told ""don't worry, your monthly payment didn't change."" When I said if my monthly payment didn't change, and you just added a year to the loan, didn't you just add to the overall price of the car by the price of 12 payments? They said ""no, it doesn't work like that."" When the contract was pulled out to be signed, sure enough the selling price was 5K higher than originally agreed, stretched out over another year so the payment stayed the same.

We proceeded to walk out of course, but it made me wonder how many people have signed up for that without thinking twice. There are MANY car dealers in the DFW metroplex, all with much more integrity than McKinney Buick/GMC.",2.0

You can just tell when a person is giving their best effort and focusing on what will help you the most.  Clearance Davis and the guys he works with are top notch!

My experience with Rodney Bellar in the service department has been enjoyable as well.  I had been getting my cars serviced down the street at another dealership but always felt like a number.  Their concern for me in a recent visit made me feel like I was working with the right people.  It looked like the keyless entry was not working on my car even though it had a new battery.  I took it in fully expecting to be charged $150 for new one but the woman working with Rodney and the parts guy took one look, cleaned off the contact points, tested and it was ready to go.  These guys go the extra mile and that is rare in this day and age.

If you have never had an experience with no stress at a dealership, check these guys out.

Had never had problem with Air Bag light flashing until recently.  Was told the battery was low and was causing the Air Bag Light to Flash.  Really??!!  Trust in the dealership went out the window when I left and couldn't put gas in the car because the post locking mechanism was now not working.  Now it makes a GODAWFULL clunk when I lock the car.  Get the feeling things get broken rather than fixed here.

FMVSS NONCOMPLIANCE

Bulletin No.: 11306A

Date: January 06, 2012

Subject: - 11306A Front Passenger Airbag Compliance Reprogram Sensing and Diagnostic Module

Models:
2008-2009 Pontiac G8

Supercede:
The Note statements and instructions for Steps 3 and 4 of the Service Procedure have been revised. Please discard all copies of bulletin 11306, issued November 2011.

Condition

General Motors has decided that all 2008-2009 model year Pontiac G8 vehicles fail to conform to Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208, Occupant Crash Protection. A 5th percentile female anthropomorphic test device (ATD) in a 30 mph frontal barrier test exceeded the Head Injury Criteria requirements of the Standard. With the front passenger seat positioned full forward, the seat position sensor will cause a 30 milliseconds deployment delay between the first and second stages of the dual-stage frontal passenger airbag. In the event of a crash severe enough to command deployment of the front passenger airbag, this delay may result in increased head injury to certain (5th percentile) front seat occupants. 
Correction

Dealers are to reprogram the Sensing and Diagnostic Module.

Vehicles Involved

Involved are certain 2008-2009 model year Pontiac G8 vehicles.

I had to finally ask what was taking so long.  I was told that it was too hot for the workers and that were working slow. I understand that it is very hot outside but I sat and waited for 3 hours for an oil change, we didn't get a car was because they said they were too backed up to do it.

Everyone was very help and had a great overall buying experience. Will and have recommend Jason, Eric and the dealership to my friends and family.

202,"July 17, 2012","We have had nothing but problems with this dealership and have been very disappointed. 

First it took them about 5 hours to get our paperwork together and get us signed. At one time one if the managers finally came out and told us they were shorthanded and I understand that so I was fine with that. That was on a Saturday night. On Monday the salesman bob had called us and told us they had messed up on some paperwork so we had to both come back and resign. My husband had to be late for work that day. What happened apparently was the interest rate they tried to get us the bank declined so they lowered the value of the car to keep my car payments about the same. It still went up by $10.00 a month. 

Now we get a call from bob again stating that we have to come up with and $500 for the down payment on the car by the end of the month. Bob has called us everyday this week asking if we have come up with any money yet. To say that I am mad is an understatement. I am livid with this dealership and have already let everyone I know exactly who you are. When I get my next car you can guarantee it will NOT be here ",1.8

Return phone calls were never made as requested.  The length of time exceeded the insurances rental car coverage putting me in the middle of the dispute with the body shop and insurance carrier.

Overall, I will most likely not return to this shop for future service.  Customer service needs severe improvement.  A lady answers all the calls and never has an answer.  She always says she will have someone return the call and the someone does not return the calls.  ",2.6

206,"July 03, 2012","I was greeted, as usual, when I drove up to the garage. I had already spoken with James in the Parts Dept. about ordering new tires for my Terrain, he said it was not necessary for me to make a separate appointment with the service area, so I didn't.  However, when I got there in the afternoon, there was no appointment for me.  Shane was slightly hesitant to have my tires done this day because they were pretty busy, but I explained it was the only time I had so he accommodated me.  I had also asked that I be able to keep my old tires and he was very kind to make sure they were ready as well when the car was done.  The only thing that I noticed is that the tire people did not replace the tube cap on a couple of the tires. (can't think of the proper name for this!)  All in all they did a good job!",4.6
207,"July 02, 2012","Chip Ruckel has been very helpful. Everytime I have brought my car in he has been consistently courteous and has informed me about the nature of my repairs.

210,"June 21, 2012","I bought a 2006 used Chevrolet Impala.  
Problem 1:
The car was sold to me with an expired inspection sticker and I got a ticket.  The good news is that the dealership immediately inspected the car and agreed to pay the ticket.  The bad news is that the put the incorrect mileage on the inspection report.  

Problem 2:
The used car was sold to me with an extended 24,000 warranty.  During the sales process, I was required by Mike (used car sales manager) to sign a document stating that the manufacturer's warranty had been explained to me.  When I questioned him about this, he told me not to worry that this would be explained later in the car buying process.  It never was.   Additionally, what the extended warranty did or did not cover was not explained either.  However, I did read this and realized that I needed to carefully follow the manufacturer's recommended maintenance schedule to keep the warranty from being voided.  So, I went back to the dealership and requested that someone explain to me exactly what I needed to do to keep the warranty from being voided.  Such as easy task with no one willing to help!  I went to service dept who sent me to used car sales who sent me to finance who sent me back to the service dept.  I left very frustrated and upset because no one seemed willing or qualified to give me this very basic information.

Problem 3:
The incorrect mileage was placed both on the inspection report and the document showing that GMC had changed my oil.  This was a very bad thing because the warranty of the vehicle requires you to have service done at specific intervals.  If the mileage is incorrect, then you are pretty much doomed in the world of extended warranties.  Additionally, I have to wonder just how legal is it to put the incorrect mileage on a vehicle inspection report.

Good news!
I sent an email to the GM, Mr. Jeffers, and he immediately had my concerns addressed.  Unfortunately, they were unable to correct the mileage on the documents.  The good news is that they did address this in writing so I do not have to worry about my warranty being voided.

In closing:
GMS of McKinney has a great service department and new car sales department.  I would do business with them in a heartbeat.  However, their used car department puts an unforgettable blemish on them.  I would not recommend ANYONE to buy a used car from GMC McKinney.  They require you to sign documents saying they have done things that they have not done nor plan on doing.  Additionally, they will sell you a car before it has been internally shopped, AND they are rude and very defensive about their unethical practices.

It is a toss up.  I will have my car serviced there and possibly buy a new vehicle there.  But I will never make the mistake of dealing with their used car department in the future.",3.0

218,"June 10, 2012","I had inquired online about an Acadia.  Franklin responded to my inquiry, assured me he had an Acadia that would work within the range I'd given him.  I drove from Rockwall to 'make the deal'.   

While I was waiting on the value of my trade in to be determined,  the Acadia I was waiting to test drive was shown to someone else so Franklin found me another car .

Franklin brought out a 2010 Chevy Treverse and the paperwork ..... $24,999 for the car  $17,000 for my trade in .... tax title & liscense,out the door for $8,8.... something.

After test driving the car I asked him again the sales price on this car.... ""$24,....."" as he walked away to assist someone else.

I parked the car, was looking at the window sticker, when Franklin came up & told me that was the wrong sticker on the window..... this car was not really listed for $21,999 and it did NOT come with the warranty.

Once inside, Franklin again reassured me that was NOT the price of the car.... that was a 'code' for them, they don't put the price of their cars on the stickers.  He knocked my out the door price to $8,500 at which time I asked for the CarFax & went back out to look at the sticker on the window.  verified the VIN & stood in amazement.  Casey, another salesman who had gone on the test drive with us (because Franklin was busy) came out and asked me what I was thinking..... to which I replied"" I don't like being bald face lied to""  then here comes Franklin out to the car where Casey & I are talking.  Franklin then tells me that since I'm here buying a car without my husband, he wants me to be a happy customer, so he will honor the sticker price of $21,999, (even though that's the wrong price) but I still don't get the warranty without paying the additional cost of $1,500.  Then the CarFax report was brought out to me at which time Franklin left me alone & went back inside. So I'm standing alone in the parking lot with the car & the CarFax..... which read 5/31/12 Chevrolet Certified, Dealer McKinney, Tx, Offered for sale as a Chevrolet Certified Pre-Owned Vehicle.

With CarFax in hand I head back towards the sales office where 4 salsmen are standing on the porch, so I stop & read from the CarFax & ask them what does ""offered for sale as a Chevrolet Certified Pre-Owned mean""?   Dead silence..... finally the used car sales manager speaks up & tells me what's included in the warranty, I ask him to come with me, so back across the parking lot we go, to the car I've been told is listed for the wrong price with a warranty that does not qualify, to which Mike (?) or Mark(?) whatever his name is, verifies the sticker price is accurate, yes the car comes with the warranty.   He stands there silently.  Now there are about 4 other salesmen standing around watching the scene .... I ask my daughter to go back in & get my purse, I hand the sales manager the keys to his Chevy  & ask for the keys to my van. The manager brings them to me, does not say ""I'm sorry"" .... ""how can I make this right"", ""Franklin is a liar, trying to take advantage of a woman"" & ""I'm as bad as he is because I'm his boss & obviously support every underhanded deal he attempts to make"" !!

219,"April 23, 2012","The auto industry has a reputation (and certainly deserved in a lot of places) for being under handed and ""anything for a sale"" attitude.
I am pleased to say that this is not the case with the folk at McKinney GMC, they actually do more than talk about customer service and satisfaction; they deliver against it.
I have purchased 2 vehicles from them and am about to purchase 2 more (growing family and kids keep taking my truck). 
I have no hesitation in strongly recommending them to you or anyone. I am fairly tough to satisfy, certain on price but they do their level best to meet the target.
