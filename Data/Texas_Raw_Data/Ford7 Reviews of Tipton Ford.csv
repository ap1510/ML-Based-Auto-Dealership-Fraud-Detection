5,"April 12, 2013","Tipton Ford is the most experienced, customer-service driven dealership in Brownsville. Every person I dealt with (salesmen, sales manager, finance manager) was professional, courteous, and cared about my needs. The salesmen at Tipton Ford go the extra mile to make sure that you feel satisfied with every part of the buying process. They have a great selection of new and used vehicles and they do their best to get the right vehicle for your needs. I will buy every vehicle I ever drive from Tipton Ford and I recommend them to everyone I know in search of a new or used vehicle. ",5.0
6,"December 27, 2012","If you are going to buy a Ford, get it from somewhere else because after they make the sale they careless about you. They had me going back to the dealership for stupid things. Then they try to make it up for all the delays and mistakes with free gas tank. All I wanted was an apology from the owner or the finance/sales guy. It makes me feel like I owe them for them sale me the vehicle.",3.0
