3,"December 14, 2019","Fantastic dealership and friendly staff.
After a negative experience with toyota of boerne (no honesty, manipulation, safety violations) I found my way to red mccombs. My family was picked up by our professional and friendly salesman Ernesto just to make the purchase. It is clear this dealership has customer satisfaction in mind. I even got a courtesy call the very next day regarding any potential concerns of mine. Mad xxxxxxto Mr.Esteves and to Hyundai northwest as a whole!!!!",5.0
4,"November 01, 2019","I've never experienced better care and service than what I received from Genesis of Northwest San Antonio.  Starting from when I walked into the door to a month later when I needed service, I've been treated like a king.  This has all been made possible by Paul Flores.  I usually don't write reviews but I've bothered this man at work and off work and his diligence has never failed.  I will never go to another dealership in this city.  I will never not recommend this particular dealership to anyone in need of a vehicle new or old.  They have never not taken care of me and I couldn't possibly be more grateful of Paul Flores' hard work and the backing he has received from his leadership at Genesis of Northwest San Antonio.",5.0
5,"October 15, 2019","Service ruined our custom wrapped calipers and scratched our custom painted rim in the process of servicing the car, which was in pristine condition when brought in.  Not bad enough, the Service rep and then service manager, Patrick argued non-stop with us speaking in a manner that was close to threatening tone.  This was by far the worst experience I have ever had with a Ford dealership service.
The service manager tried to bully us into believing the wrap had been ruined from the heat coming off of the car prior to bringing it  in for service.  He clearly knew nothing about custom wrap.  We should have been notified that this work at this service location could ruin the wrap and scratch the rims, but no such information was provided.  I have reported this to Ford Motor Company as a formal complaint against this dealership's customer service service department. We do have proof that this custom wrap can withstand a very high heat without damage.  We have driven this beautifully custom designed car for over four years in Texas with NO damage to the wraps.  Patrick talked over us, would not listen, talked down to us, argued with us, lied to us, and generally caused us to definitely loose trust in  Ford Service.",1.0
6,"August 14, 2019","I spent over a week contacting Hyundai dealerships in the San Antonio, Austin, Dallas/Ft Worth, and Houston markets, asking for their best offer and a detailed pricing sheet explaining the costs.  My experience with this dealership was stellar from the first email to the final walk out the door with the keys.  The salesperson sent me what I asked for first, and the pricing was so reasonable that they ended up beating everyone else out in the end, I was almost astonished that there was no more haggling to work through once we sat down to discuss.  

Thank you for making my purchase an enjoyable experience, I will make sure to point people in your direction if they are in the same market.",5.0
7,"July 22, 2019","This is the second vehicle we have purchased from Red McComb's Northwest. We love our 2013 Sonata Ltd. It was our first dealing with the Hyundai brand and we are hooked. Added bonus was the service from Eddie & Gonzo in the service dept over the 7 years we owned that vehicle. Let's face it, once you drive off the lot, service/maintenance becomes a large part of vehicle ownership. We decided to purchase a 2019 Tucson Sport. Little did we know when we inquired about the vehicle it was our sales rep Jordan's first day, He handled every question we had seemlessly and didn't play games when it came to pricing. We asked him for a final price and that is what he did. From start to finish he handled all our needs/questions like a pro. He demonstrated superb customer service skills. He even pumped gas in a severe thunderstorm so as not to make us wait to be on our way. This dealership is small in size compared to many in TX, but the service in sales & service depts is well above other experiences we have encountered. I can highly recommend the Hyundai brand and this dealership.

8,"April 18, 2019","50 years, 20+ car purchases or leases, and this is the worst dealership experience ever. Salesman himself was fine, no complaints with him - it's the finance and management you should beware. Zero customer service, zero initiated communication unless they want something and even if they've said they'd call, and zero ownership of their internal issues. Apparently they are not interested in putting the customer first - if they were they'd own up to taking 40 days to payoff a trade-in and causing all sorts of additional financial stress and forcing us to cover their errors. I thought Red McCombs was above the infamous dealer failure to payoff a trade-in scam. ",1.6

10,"December 13, 2017","I am a repeat Azera customer, purchasing the 2017 Azera. I drove my 2008 Azera for nearly 10 years, and frankly, only traded it in because my wife was insistent that having 142,000 miles was tempting fate for a breakdown. That car ran smooth and quiet, and left to myself, I wouldn't have traded it. I sold two Azeras to friends who rode in mine and subsequently purchased one (one of whom was a BMW owner.) The new Azera seems to be an adequate replacement, and I hope that will hold true as time goes on. On a separate note, the service deprtment at Red Mccomb's Hyundai was a major factor in choosing to purchase there again. They proved excellent maintenance service, bar none.",4.8
11,"December 11, 2017",Best experience I've had during the purchase of a new car. The sales staff were fast and met my expectations on my trade-in. Jose was a friendly and professional salesman who knows how to relax his customers while going over all the options to buying a new car.,5.0

15,"November 30, 2017","Every thing about the buying experience was positive with regard to the salesman. The only negative was the meeting with the Credit Manager.

31,"October 27, 2017","I walked in to Red McCombs looking for a used Elantra. After some test drives and much discussion, what I wanted in features lead me to a brand new vehicle. I could not have had a better experience with Max, my salesman. He was so helpful and friendly. He didn't try to push me into something I really couldn't afford.

36,"September 15, 2017","Before going to Red Maccombs, I had a terrible experience at Cavender, Cristian Garcia personally helped me to relax from my terrible experience.

39,"September 13, 2017","This is my 3rd Hyundai. I have learned it is not just about buying a car, you buy the service department as well. I bought my 3rd vehicle due to how I am treated by the service department and how nice the vehicles are. Paul Flores, in the sales department did anything he could to make sure I got the car I wanted at the best price he could with my fair credit. The new Elantra I purchased has a lot more horsepower and that was very important to me. Paul did a great job showing me the vehicle features but did not get too pushy. I also had a great experience with the Finance guy but forgot his name at the moment. He got me sold on the smart payment plan and I am so glad I did it with the miles I drive to and from work. All and all, the whole buying experience was great, even though I am paying more than I planned on, driving out of the lot. I thank all the folks who helped me.",5.0

48,"August 21, 2017","As a grade school teacher, i took my time and most of the summer for my first vehicle I would purchase on my own. I chose the Cadillac ST5 as my choice, by chance I saw a Hyundai Tucson at a rest stop on a trip to San Antonio. I decided to get a closer look and stopped at Red McCombs. I was impressed with the quality, technology and comfort of the vehicle. It took two trips to get my Tucson, the second visit was very haggle-free and straight to signing.  I am very happy with my Tucson.  I have not thought about the Cadillac even once.",4.8

50,"August 18, 2017","If I could rate this place  a negative 1,000 stars than I would.  Please DO NOT come here for any services, unless you are looking to pay for damages to your vehicle that you didn't make.  I brought city, don't make the same mistake that I did.  Just moved to the city and my husband and I were my vehicle to this location for services and ended up with a large scrape on the side of my car when it was returned to me.  When I inquired about the scrape on the back of my vehicle with the manager and technician I was basically told that I had to pay for the scrape to be fixed because it wasn't their responsibility, after my vehicle was left on their premises for two days and I spent well over $650 at this dealership for a diagnostic test, tires and an oil change.  Yeah REALLY!  I hesitated to take  my car here because of the previous bad reviews and because the other dealerships in the city wasn't  able to work on my car until two weeks later.  So PLEASE pay attention to the bad reviews because they are true.   I wish I listened to the other unsatisfied customers that took their vehicle to this awful place  and just waited two weeks to get my car in with another dealership in the looking for a honest place to take my vehicle for services and ended up having a bad customer experience at this location.

I loved every moment of my time at this dealership.",5.0
56,"August 04, 2017","The sales person was highly-knowledgeable about the vehicle line-up. Unfortunately, the pricing discussion took four hours. Much longer than expected even after the True Car price had been negotiated. The Finance department charged $500 more than the agreed upon out-the-door price, but refunded the additional charge within a few days. This last part is the only reason I will return to the dealership for a future purchase. They are obviously customer-oriented, and want long-time/lifetime customers.",4.2

Chris Posada, my sales professional was amazing and went to extra extremes to ensure 150% satisfaction, communicated personally and professionally.

Chris Bond, my finance professional, excellent, we developed a great rapport, thankfully no one was waiting to get in at the time I signed, as we were having a lot of laughs and light hearted conversation that made the process so much better.  Chris went above and beyond working out the finances that did not break my bank.  Scott Brown - For providing excellent leadership and for creating a Stress Free buying experience.  Ultimately he has review of the deals, and from what I observed, he does everything in his power to makes sure the dealership makes a profit as well as provide a pleasant environment for the professionals he works with as well as guests to the dealership.  I was impressed with the overlap, meaning I was Chris' customer, but I had a couple of other sales professionals come by and see if I need water or anything.  Excellent and pleasant environment.  Patrick Stephens - For follow up after the sale on and truly showing he cares about facilitating the stress free, customer focus and ensure that there is continuity across the departments.

161,"December 17, 2016","My only thing that I have to gripe about so far is that they sold me a 3000$ warranty without telling me they were tacking on a 3000$ warranty to my financing. If I had known it was 3 grand, I wouldn't have purchased the warranty. So now I'm financing nearly 10 grand for my car as opposed to 6k. I'm not happy about it but I am looking into canceling it.

My salesperson, Aaron Charles, was awesome, very helpful, and straightforward about the sales process. The person who did my paperwork- Andrew or ""Drew"" seemed nice enough, he allowed me to charge my phone while I was doing paperwork and was pretty friendly. I didn't feel like I was swimming in a shark tank while trying to purchase my vehicle.

Andrew and Aaron both spoke to my dad over the phone, giving me and my dad peace of mind. The finance department was able to finance my car through my credit union for less than I got financing my car directly through them. My credit isn't great, so I was looking for a lower APR, and I got one by going through the dealership. That was very nice. I don't know how they managed that. 

The service department wasn't helpful with my iPhone port and aux jack not working, they said it was something with my phone's compatibility with the car system. Whatever- I left upset instead of sitting down and asking more questions. I got it to work on my own and honestly, replacing that part is only about 2 hours labor (if I do it) and a 30$ part. Not a big deal.

Other than that, it was a nice dealership, everyone was semi-professional. The receptionist remembered me even though I had never really seen her the first two times I was there- which shocked me. Great customer service and professionalism there.

Overall, I would recommend this dealership but with caution. Know what you are getting yourself into and go through the paperwork in depth so you know exactly what they are trying to tack on. My dad isn't happy, but honestly, the warranty does give me peace of mind even if it is overpriced.",4.4

178,"November 29, 2016","Bought a 2010 Prius with low mileage, car was in great shape with only 20k miles.  I flew in from Houston to pick it up.  Did all my credit app and insurance before i left.  I was told everything is good to go.  I flew in to pick up my car and the car was as advertised.  

Here the bummer part and all of you better be careful.  When I did my paper work with the finance director (only one available) that's when everything went sour.  At first he showed me my lowest credit score to justify 5.59% interest rate that was offered to me.  I asked if they send out my information to obtained more banks for better rates as i have scores range from 650-720 depending on which credit report you use.  He refused to do so and insisted that I go with Fifth Third bank as there are 2 people behind me.  They know that I was out of town I didn't have the choice to come back and i will have to take the high rate.  I took the rate thinking that at a dealership they won't pull some shady credit score - hike rate stuff on you.  Be aware they will, i called and verified it. 

Few weeks later, I received an letter from the dealership that score of 705 was to be used.  I called fifth third bank to get their current rates which is at 4.39 or 4.14% with direct withdraw.  I called the fiance director back hoping that he would make it right but all i get was ""if you are not happy you are refinance.""  I asked why their rates was higher than the rates quoted by fifth third bank directly, at first he said b/c it was your credit score.  I told him that fifth third bank give the same rates with my credit range than again he said ""if you don't like it you can refinance.""  What a bad experience i have to say.  I bought 4 new vehicles and 3 used vehicles since 2007, this is the first time a dealership purposely steer a consumer to higher rates so they can make their cut.  Stay away, if you need to finance a car, i would recommend going with Credit Union.  I will refinance it with my credit union with 3% interest.  Stay away and think before you sign paper with them.  He will use the slogan ""it's only $20 a month difference but think about the big picture, $20 x 60 month is $1200.

Just to be clear, this is to review their finance department, not the sales department.",1.0

First, he actually came by my house and picked my wife and I up and drove us to the car lot.  He understood our situation of being without transportation following the hail storm that totaled our two 2013 Hyundai Sonata’s that we loved so much.  He focused on our needs directly and respected my request to be treated fairly and expeditiously during the buying process.  He immediately helped us find our cars and got us through the process pretty darn quick which my wife and I salute him for.  We really would not have dealt with any high pressure salesperson under any circumstance.  We had already agreed to call a cab home if Adam did not keep his word to keep things simple and direct.  I have purchased more cars than I can even remember, but I do recall the process always being a full day long and such a difficult process.  With age and experience you learn a few things about buying cars, but it still doesn’t eliminate the stigma that a person attaches to the car buying experience.  Adam came through for us when we needed someone like him the most.  We were at wits end with all of the damage to our home and cars and were in no mood to tolerate the usual car buying experience.  Adam made the experience a good one and we will always appreciate his service.  Everyone we met and worked with that day was awesome… Finance, Manager, Service were all so very nice.

Overnight they sent an email saying they would take another $500 off due to a special pricing.  I went to another dealer for the same car and was sold it for $3,000 less than the $29,500.  The additional discounts I received from the new dealer were normal factory incentives.  I was not offered the normal factory incentives at Red McCombs and went to Austin to buy my new Hyundai Sonata Hybrid.  I saved $3,000 just because they offered me the normal incentives that Hyundai was offering.   I would have been out $3,000 of normal incentives had I not shopped around.

378,"November 01, 2013","Both my husband nor I had any time to go into a dearlership to look at cars.  So we both searched our vehicles via the Internet.  When my husband found a car he liked; he called the dealership and Marco answered.  When my husband said he couldn't go in the dealership; Marco quickly said, ""Well then let me bring the vehicle to you"".  So Marco did and my husband was able to see the car.  Because of this,  a sale was made.  There was never any pressure from Marco to go in to see the car.  He just quickly accomodated the needs of a customer.  His manner was also very pleasant and there was no typical sales pressure.  Also, we came with our own financing.  We told Marco we did not want to spend time with Finance and he assured us we would not have to.  However, the Finance Manager came and quickly tried to get us to go with their financing; but we didn't.  This was not due to any fault of Marco.  

Marco should be highly commended on his superior customer service efforts.  He didn't hesitate to step outside the box to accomodate our needs.  He knew our needs and never ever tried to push anything else on us to add to his sale.  We were firm with what we wanted and did not want; and Marco respected that and kept focus on assuring our needs were met.

This place is the perfect example of EVERYTHING that I hate about slimy car salesmen.  With the back and fourth, lets see what the manger will approve, all to make you wait as long as possible so by the end of it all you're so exhausted and willing to sign anything.  Our sales guy didn't listen to us; doing everything he could to push us into their hot new car of the moment, the veloster. His customer service was terrible, he spent most of our interaction talking with my husband in spanish knowing full well that I was the one paying and that I didn't speak the language.  

The service department is just as bad.  I pre-purchased the maintenance, and when it came time to check out, the cashier got snippy with me for disturbing her face booking and gave me massive amounts of attitude for suggesting she do her job and call the company to verify my benefit and purchase.  We also have had a major issue with the steering wheel peeling off.  I brought this to the attention of the service staff and their manger told me to come back another day so he could take photos and submit a claim (any day but saturday or after 5pm).  This is nearly impossible for me, which I explained, and once again received attitude.

I have had my seat belt broken but warranty does not fix this nor will they despite their own mistake. They over tightened my breaks to the point that the car could no longer roll down hill next to the highway. They left an oil rag in the engine that caught fire while my wife was driving. Had it towed in not realizing what the burning smell was and while a flaming something fell out of the car. (Car next to my wife pulled her over and told her). The employee said but the rags are flame retardant. What he does not seem to comprehend is the oil on the rag is not flame retardant. They put deep scratches in my dash when fixing the a/c.

Awesome employees make all the difference and this department has the best group of employees.  Keep up the great work.  Looking forward to bringing my '07 Accent in for its next service needs.",5.0

393,"April 02, 2012","I bought a brand new Sonata from them last year. I went back exactly a year later to replace my other car. They had an ad for 2011s in the paper, but didn't find out til I went in that those were used.  Amanda was willing to see if they had anything that was in the price range I wanted to stay in. She found a used Sonata I was interested in.  Maybe it's because I was in a tshirt & jeans or because I was looking at used cars, but Amanda tried to get me to verbally agree to the sale before telling me my interest rate or payment, and then while we were waiting for the Finance mgr she came back in & tried to get me to sign paperwork that said I intended to purchase the car. I don't blame her though-I think the mgr was pulling her strings. This dealership wasn't even willing to negotiate; they just wanted to trick me into purchasing.  I guess buying from them doesn't buy you any consideration. My friend & I walked right out the door, and as soon as we did, Amanda called & acted like they hadn't pulled anything, and she eventually put the Sales mgr, Nick on the phone. I don't know if he was the one that was originally causing her to jerk my chain, but he was pretty straight up on the phone. Unfortunately for them, there are many other options and dealers out there, and thanks to them leaving such a bad taste in my mouth, I went to Gunn and bought a new Altima for the same price as the used car they were trying to screw me on, and I had a great experience at Gunn. You blew it, Red McCombs Hyundai NW!",1.8
394,"December 13, 2011","I am a single woman, and to say the least I was anxuous about the task of dealing with a CAR SALESMAN.  HOWEVER, Ricardo, and the entire sales team were extremely
 accomodating.  The floor manager, the credit manager and Ricardo were so nice.  I walked in to look, but walked out happily owning the car I only wished for yesterday!  I highly recommend this dealership!",5.0
