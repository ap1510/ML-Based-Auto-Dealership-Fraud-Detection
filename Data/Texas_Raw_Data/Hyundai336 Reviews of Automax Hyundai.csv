6,"January 22, 2019","I cannot believe I found a dealership that has such an awesome service department.  I went there with a bad taste in my mouth about mechanics, service departments and repairs in general and was about to give these guys grief because of what I consider PTSD from my hometown dealership of Greg May in Waco Texas being such a crap dealership and even worse service department.  

Was I ever wrong.  The drive of 45 minutes down the road was all the difference in the world in service experiences.  AutoMax Hyundai and Michael Bowman run like a well oiled machine. I had an appointment, was greeted and my car was rolled like an assembly line into the bay with a dozen other customers.  I thought I would be there for hours so I am asked to wait.  Not that I was inconvenienced one bit in a luxurious waiting area, ample with free coffee, sodas, snacks, TV and WIFI.  I received text messaging about the status of my car thought-out the process.  About  an hour  later, not only was my car fixed fast, she was fixed right the first time.  WHO KNEW you can have it all.   Word of advise, get to AUTOMAX as fast as you can.

7,"December 27, 2018","By far one of the worst new car buying experience we’ve had to date.  The managers are no worried about customer service it’s all about the sell. The vehicle was not serviced or detailed correctly upon delivery, the car was a mess! The oil filter was leaking from being over tightened which caused damage to the metal housing where the O-ring of the oil filter makes contact. The entire experience has been one that shed light on the dealers inability to provide quality workmanship. We will never have the vehicle serviced by or purchase another vehicle from this dealership. ",1.4
8,"December 15, 2018","Niky my sales person was very professional and really friendly, well verse in the vehicle accessories 
She took the time to explain what was the use of all the dashboard lights and bottoms, she also set up my phone and service dates  
It was a good experience on this purchase

9,"December 14, 2018","Buying a car is always an intimidating experience.  It is a big financial commitment and want to make sure I get the best deal for the money.  Max Dalouche was the salesman, but he was more of a consultant.  We told him what we wanted and how much we wanted to pay and he worked very hard to make that happen.  All the negotiations were done by phone or email.  Max was very prompt in returning my text or calls whether it was 7 in the morning or 7 at night.  We got the car we wanted at an excellent price.  When we came in to sign the papers the young lady who coordinated all that was very efficient and knowledgeable.  At no time did we feel pressured to buy. It was a great experience and we are very happy with our new Hyundai.",5.0

17,"July 05, 2018","Slick Willy would be a better name for this auto sales. Use great caution if you chose to deal with them and look over your paper work CAREFULLY!! 
We wanted to buy a new car advertised on the Internet. After conferring with our so called sales person ""Renee "" that there are no other fees other than TT&L, we drove 2+ hours to get our new car. Once we got on the finance depart the cost of the car changed and our ""sales person"" tried to gloss over it like we shouldn't be surprised. After going round and round the dealer was unwilling to remove this FRAUDULENT almost $1500, undisclosed charge. 
Buyer beware !!",1.6

33,"November 28, 2017","I first had a blue Elantra Limited on paper, and I had received the Tan one and then he was trying to sale a car to my daughter and drove up with a Red Elantra Limited and I got the color I wanted from the start but I was told there was only 5 available Elantra Limited 2 Tan, 2 Silver, 1 Blue but I did not know there was a Red Elantra Limited until he tried to dale that car to her and I wanted that color and after that I want happy and the Red Elantra need paint chip repaired but I did not care I just Love that car and still loving it    I am s happy customer   Thanks you Mr. Yamil",4.8
34,"November 28, 2017","We came to Automax and looked for Yamil since he wasn’t pushy with us the first time. He did his best to find the exact car we wanted even when it wasn’t on the master inventory! We were unable to come to a price point that worked for us on our intial visit, but he kept us in mind and called with an offer we were able to work with three weeks later. He is a great asset to your company and we will return to work with him, and refer friends and family his way. On another note, there is a “pushy/overwhelming” feeling when you first pull onto the lot with the 4 salesman stopping your car and wanting to pounce. If we didn’t have a previous relationship with Yamil this tactic would have driven us to do business elsewhere",5.0
35,"November 27, 2017",Good location and options.. offered several maintenance options.. good sales person.. answered  questions when asked... price of vehicle was decent and warranties were good as well.,4.0

43,"November 10, 2017","My first day I had a helpful sales guy named Raphael from the Ford side, he did a great job showing me what I wanted to see but when it came time to talk numbers Mike Hernandez the Ford sales manager did all the talking.  Crazy talk really, the prices I was getting were way higher than even the advertised prices with no hint of the rebates thrown in.  I let it be known we were not even close and I was given another set of numbers way off the mark.  Mike offered to have me come in again to ""talk"" but I was not trying to do that song and dance. I thought I made it clear I wanted pure price but I guess not.

Unsatisfied at this point I decided to work with Terry Johnson the next day directly through the Hyundai dealership with Robert in finance where they seemed to be much more willing to listen and get me where I wanted to be price wise with very little wasted time.  After that it was smooth sailing with Terry who did a bang up job and is a real professional who knows how to get it done.  I met with Jamie in the back who was pleasant and courteous to finalize the paperwork then was handed to Antonio Fernandez from Hyundai who did a great job explaining the ins and outs of my then new Hyundai Elantra Sport and taking care of little touch up work right until I left.

Overall I feel the sales guys are really great and want to help you find what you are looking for.  But once it goes ""to the back"" for wheel and deal time you need a sales guy who really knows what you want and you need to pay attention as fiance and sales at Ford side will try to get you good with the offer letters initially given out.",4.4
44,"November 03, 2017",Overall good experience and the people were great. Had an issue with financing where the interest rate increased once it came back from Hyundai Finance and it was not known until we were signing the final papers - watch out for that.,4.2

When I gave me ""leave me alone"" response of ""I would love a 6-speed!"" Zeb knew exactly what they had on the lot.  Instead of the general response ""good luck with that"" he told me they had three and introduced me to the options.  Although the sales pitch was successful; I never felt pressured or intimidated - it was smooth from start to finish.

262,"August 04, 2016","I flew all the way from Maryland to purchase a vehicle from James Billelo after hearing how great he was from my parents who purchased a car with him just a few weeks prior. After dealing with rude salesmen and horribly overpriced inventory in Maryland, I decided what did I have to lose? So I called James and told him exactly what I wanted. He said come on down. I flew down within 12hrs and about 15min later at the dealership, he had already found exactly what I wanted. He did not pressure me into something more expensive and honestly got me a fantastic deal. He was SO knowledgeable about the inventory. He could tell me anything I wanted to know about any car I pointed out. He went way above and beyond what his job requires of him to make me happy. It was obvious that he was actually honest with me about my concerns. And he valued the well fair of his customer over the sale which speaks volumes! We will be purchasing a second vehicle in a year or so and plan on flying down again just so James can help us. He was the best person we could have hoped to work with. I can't praise him enough. We didn't feel like we were working with a car salesman, but rather a friendly family member.   The finance guy on the other hand was very rude, pushy, and unprofessional. His name was Stacy. I felt he was not entirely honest and thankfully James and I had done our homework, otherwise I think he'd have ripped me off. Stacy also tried to force me and my elderly mother to stay late to complete the sale rather than letting us come back in the morning. It was nearly 10pm and I had been up since 4am traveling. We were all exhausted. After numerous attempts at asking if I could sign a buyer's agreement and return the following morning, I finally called James who called his manager. Stacy was VERY rude and acted as though we were a huge inconvenience. I will not work with him again. But I'm very thankful for James as he did advocate for us, the customers, and finally we were able to go home. Stacy needs some serious lessons on what it means to be professional as he also dropped the f word a couple of times.   But all in all, James was so great. Which is why we will be returning customers. He even contacted me to make sure I made it home safely. The kid goes above and beyond his job to make sure the customer is happy. And having that prioritized over the sale makes the customer feel valued and respected. That is what makes James an impeccable staff member. I hope he is given the appreciation and recognition he well deserves.",5.0

266,"July 22, 2016","Firstly, as I recall Inventory Control is a real problem with this dealership, the day I purchased a vehicle (not the one I started looking at), the salesman and I walked the entire 40 acres of sales lot looking for 2 specific models the inventory database said there were 2, it was pretty close to 95 degree day (Texas), we found one but never located the other, while on foot; made it back to the dealership and grabbed a working loaner car to explore the ""far overflow lot"" and that's where we found the one card I did test drive and eventually purchased. That being said - the sales experience was top notch, had I known how much my trade-in was going to bring to the table, I'm certain I would have chosen a more expensive model as I knew going in that I would have to carry some of my current note onto the new vehicle I was hesitant to make the ""bill"" any bigger without knowing how much I was going to carry. The boast by Sales Management that they ""could put heated seats in anything"" definitely sealed the deal for me.

I hate the pressure sales, haggling, and the time it takes for all of the paperwork, but the team at Automax Hyundai relieved my anxiety about the whole process.  My first impression was the thoroughness of their on-line posting of the car I was looking at. They provided very thorough information and took pictures of every part of the car.  Howard Kinsel was my first contact and sales rep.  He was very personable and patient and most importantly not pushy.  I live in Abilene and he took the time to be my eyes to look over the car for me and provided all of the information I needed so my trip to Killeen was not wasted.  Mr. Ferrell did my paperwork and was very personable, thorough, and patient.  There were no surprises in the final bill.  He patiently broke the numbers down for me answered all of my questions thoroughly.  No surprises.  Finally, I need to also give kudos to those that are behind the seen, the people that clean the cars.  They cleaned my car so well I thought I just bought a brand new car from how it looked to that new car smell. Even though it's a bit of a drive, I will definitely be purchasing another car from them again and referring other people.  It's well worth it!

334,"June 06, 2015","The worst place for sales and customer service that I have ever experienced.  

I purchased a Hyundai Tucson 2014 The Walking Dead special edition from Automax in January of this year that they had obtained from another dealership in Austin in a dealer to dealer trade.  The special edition came with promotional materials and a cargo net that were missing from the vehicle when it was obtained.  I was promised by the Automax sales that the missing items would be obtained if I went ahead with purchase.  It took almost 3 months for me to get the cargo net.  Then after almost 4 months of getting the runaround by sales staff and management, first being told that they were working on getting the items and would let me know, and then being told that the items could not be obtained because only enough of these were made to go with each vehicle (1000 were made) and no additional items were available.  In compensation they offered me 2 ""free"" oil changes.  I had already purchased the extended service contract that included oil changes, so this was of no value to me, and when I said this, I was told this is all they were willing to do.  

About 3 weeks ago, I called the head of Hyundai USA public relations in California.  I received a call back the same day, and within a week had received half of the missing promotional items, and a week later had the remainder of the items.  So basically Automax lied to me when telling me the items could no longer be obtained. I called the sales staff at Automax after receiving the first half of the items, did not tell them I had contact public relations and had been able to obtain the missing items.  She again told me that they were not able to obtain the items, that these were no longer made, and the oil changes were the only compensation that was being offered.  However, she would talk to management again and get back with me to see if something else could be worked out.  That was over 2 weeks ago, and I have never received a call back.  Public relations at Hyundai in the meantime has been in contact with me 4 times, ensuring that I received the items, and on my last call with them, said they would be in contact with Automax Hyundai to relay that they had provided the missing items, and that the customer service received from Automax was not acceptable.

335,"May 28, 2015","I bought a car from Automax in December, from the beginning I told the people I had a coupon from USAA, the man who we discussed the price with told us flat out he would not honor the coupon. My opinion they use the coupon to get military people in and then deny the coupon. ",2.4
