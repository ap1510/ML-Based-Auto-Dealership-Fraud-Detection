0,"June 25, 2020","  As an older person who is vulnerable during the pandemic, I was very concerned about having to get my car repaired. The service staff cooperated in receiving my vehicle when it was towed to the dealership so that I did not have to be present. They diagnosed the problem and repaired my car in less time than expected. They also arranged for me to pay over the phone and have a contactless experience when I picked up my car. All in all, a first-rate experience.",4.8

17,"November 04, 2019","So my husband and I took the courageous decision in shopping for the first time for a vehicle. Coming from Mexican families are known to be scared in taking a huge commitment like this in purchasing a new car. Things like ""its too expensive"" or ""you're going to be in debt"", and my favorite ""for $2,000 you can get a car that can bring you to and from work"". So we always had that mentality that those statements were true. Am I (the wife) have always been the type to go for what I believe in even though everyone says the contrary. So one day talking to my husband we decided to give it a try, being that prior we had a horrible experience at another car dealership, my boss recommended Tipton Hyundai. At first I was scared for Hyundai being such a big name in cars, but my husband and I took a chance and we were totally blown away by the salesmen as we walked in. We set up an appointment with Victor De Leon and as soon as we got there he showed me that even though being a carsales men he cared for what my husband and I were considering in purchasing. He helped us and in less than 2 hours I walked out being approved with a 2020 Elantra, I felt so good and at peace cause not once did he make me feel pressured into buying anything until he made sure that my credit was well enough to qualify. I would most definitely come back to him. I'm so glad that he made it such an awesome experience and I couldn't have it any other way.   ",5.0

My son wanted to look at other vehicles, so we actually left and we got no hassle in doing so.  My son decided that the vehicle he wanted was the Volester N, so even though we were at the Hyundai in Harlingen at the time, we decided to go back to Brownsville to make the deal with Joe Mejia.  The deal went quick and Manager Puente made the deal pretty quick.  Great experience.",4.6

However, I went into Tipton Hyundai, and was treated to one of the best buying experiences we’ve ever had. Joe Mejia took care of us from the beginning and until the end. He was with us ever step of the way and always made sure he was thorough with every detail. Joes a great guy who puts his customers first. He offered us everything to make this buying experience wonderful. There are a lot of car salesmen out there; and then there’s Joe Mejia. He offered every possible scenario to help make the deal work out. He introduced to every employee he interacted with and made us feel extremely comfortable. I will honest, I was a little skeptical stepping into the door. But Joe made all of those doubts disappear. He treated my wife with the utmost respect and never pushed anything on us or made us feel uncomfortable. His detailed explanation for the automation and special features in our new vehicle was unlike any I’ve seen. My wife feels like she is getting the most of her new vehicle because of Joes explanation and guidance. Mr. Mejia understands people, and that’s a very important tool to have as a salesman.

99,"June 03, 2018","After looking at the Escape in the Tipton Ford dealership, I made an appointment to test drive the three engines with salesman Juan Serna.  I waited too long and all the 2018 Escapes were sold by the time I got back to Ford.   Juan Serna got me into several Ford SUVs in a range of sizes for test drives and while all of them were nice to drive, I could not get used to the limited visibility when I turned to look behind the vehicle, in any of them.   Serna was so patient with my need to test drive and to check out the Escape's rear visibility.  He  escorted me  to the Tipton Motor group parking lot that had used and new vehicles.  There was a used Escape for me to check out!   I also tried driving several other SUVs, and did not like any of them.  Then Juan showed me a row of Hyundai Santa Fe Sports.  I picked one to test drive and found it an enjoyable space to be in, and comfortable to drive.  It felt like a smaller vehicle, while it had  better rear visibility, great cargo volume, the smaller wheels I prefer for our local roads, and a Satellite Radio!  I even liked the color.  Sale made.  Juan spent a ton of time with me, getting to know my driving preferences and just plain old getting to know me.  Next day, I came back and bought the car from Juan.  I was a bit nervous about going to see 'The Finance Person', but Noelia Escamilla made me feel comfortable.  Finally, Juan introduced me to Adrian Santillana from the Tipton Hyundai dealership next door.  He  took time to explain the features of my new purchase, and introduced me around the  Hyundai shop.  TIpton Auto Group, you have some very good employees!  Will recommend Tipton Ford and Hyundai to family and friends.",4.8

We left the TUCSON on 06/12/2017 becose several concerns, 
I left written details of concerns and instructions. (I did this so there was no miscommunication) 
06/14/2017
We received the call that the Tucson was ready for pickup
We went to the dealer ship and the person there told us that a few of the items on our list where not resolved, we tested the Tucson with him and he saw that there were still failures on the AC display and on the Radio Volume buttons,
He also admitted that the service of the 15,000 mile that was requested in writing;  was not performed
by this pint I was very upset ,and I told him that we can not accept the Tucson and that we  wanted to leave he called the manager and then he thretend me and my wife to call the police if we took the loaner.

I exploded, throw the Tucson key on the counter top and left the building.
My wife remained inside and asked him to call the manager, he refused to call the manager. 

Bottom line:
 We were told by Hyundai that my concerns would be repaired or a plan to fix them would be given.
My concerns were not repaired nor a plan to fix them was  given.  They LIED !!!!
We were told that we would have a loaner for the repair period and in reality, we were called to pick up the Tucson before repairs was completed and before the “15000 mile service” that I had requested was performed. And in addition WE WERE LEFT ON FOOT!!!!!!! AND WERE THRETEND BY THE DEALERSHIP !!!!!

We left the dealer ship. Without The Tucson, and without talking with someone in authority  and without the loaner!!!
I HAVE NEVER EXPIRIANCED SUCH BAD SEWRVICE IN MY LIFE!!!!
