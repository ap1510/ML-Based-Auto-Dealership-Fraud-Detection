0,"April 30, 2020","Found this place 3 hours away from Dallas drive was no problem, at first I was very happy with trading in my f150 for a newer F150, didn’t give me too bad of a deal. Felt some what rushed on them trying to make me buy it. 2-3 months past I never got my registration or license plate I bought this vehicle in December, I was told to use the plates off of my old vehicle. Still have not received any plates, I was told to tell the dmv I lost them so the dmv could replace them. Another problem, I asked the service adviser multiple times if the vehicle was in any wrecks because I saw a medium size dent on it he said no and printed off papers showing it was “the best truck he ever seen”. A few months later I had another dealership run my vin and I found out the truck was in 2 big wrecks were the bags were deployed. I’ve tried contacting the general manager many times left name and phone number and no calls back. I would not recommend any family or friends to buy a vehicle from this dealership .- Antonio Rogers",1.0
1,"April 10, 2019",3/27/19-I arrived to get any oil change at Quick Lane Dept-Relaxing waiting for my services to be completed-When a female customer brought in a HUGE brown Tall Dog into the customer sitting area. I wasn’t ask if it was okay!  The Dog wasn’t a Service Dog!  I was very uncomfortable & nervous being in the tight small sitting area with this Huge Dog. The dog laid down on floor with his butt in my direction. The owner saw my nervousness!  Please make a RULE-NO PETS in area unless they are Service Dog!,4.6

3,"August 24, 2018","Bought a new car here. 
Would have also bought a new truck here but the salesperson didn’t respond to my request until a week later and then only to email some pics from the website. Lame.
My friend bought a car here but of course they never gave me the $100 referral bonus. Just talk I guess.
Sales Dept sold my information to warranty companies, I got literally hundreds of mailings for extra coverage offers. Flooded my mailbox for a year. 
Service Depart refused to fix my new car. Went to appointment and they told me: ‘we don’t do appointments, it goes in line a 9am and we get to it.’
Put it in line a 9am on Thursday. At 5pm Friday they hadn’t even looked at it. I called them repeatedly for updates and they kept telling me it was “about to come in the door.”
Nope. They never touched it. 
It’s out of warranty now so they successfully lied to run out the clock. xxxxxxxx. 
GO ANYWHERE ELSE! 
Johnston Ford is right down the highway if you really need Ford.
Save yourself the aggravation.",1.8

13,"April 01, 2016","Shawn was an awesome salesman, met every one of my requests and was a pleasure to work with. He even brought the car to my house over an hour away from Texarkana and explained everything in great detail. His finance officer was awesome and got me an amazing rate as well! I will never go anywhere else for a new or used car again. Thank you Shawn and the Mclarty team!!!",5.0
14,"April 01, 2016","I had the best experience at Mclarty Ford Dealership.  Shawn Martin was my salesman.  He was very helpful in helping me purchase my 2016 Ford Explorer.  He personally delivered the car to my work place so I could look at the car in person.  After making my decision to buy the car, Mr.Martin stayed after hours helping me finalize the deal.  The finance department was very nice and helpful as well.  This was by far the best experience I have ever had in buying a new car!   I would highly recommend purchasing your next vehicle at  McLarty Ford and be sure to ask for Shawn Martin!!",5.0
15,"March 03, 2016",I went to Mclarty ford after Shawn Martin called me to inform me that they had the vehicle that I was looking for and that he would garentee that he could get me financed. With me totaling my car 3 weeks ago and visiting EVERY dealership known to man and getting told everywhere they couldn't make it happen I didn't believe shawn could.  But after 20 mins of arriving I was told congratulations your approved. So after a short walk around found a car that worked and I left a few hours later on my new car. THANK YOU SHAWN!!! And the whole Mclarty team that helped,5.0
16,"February 14, 2016","I recently called McLarty Ford and Shawn answered the phone. From the first second I could tell this purchase would be different. He answered every question I had about the truck I wanted. I told him I didn't know when I could make it in due to my busy work schedule and the issues around my town we were having. I'm maint. for our town. He asked what town I worked in and  what kinda work I was doing. I honestly felt like he actually cared and didn't just want to make a sale!!! Later that day I completely forgot all about the truck and got busy with work. Then a young man pulled up and asked for me by name I told him that was me. He then proceeded to walk towards me and my team with 2 pizzas for me and my guys. It was Shawn Martin. He Spent 20-30 mins just talking to us and hanging out.  Never once did he try to ""sell"" me the truck. He honestly cared about what we were doing and then left. Well after he left all my guys asked what I had done to get pizza delivered all I could come up with was I called looking for a truck. I was honestly WOWED!!!! Then I came in for the purchase and I can't tell you enough how awesome the whole experience was. I went back this weekend because I had gotten a call saying my plates were in. Shawn met me in the parking lot and even put my plates on for me. And if all this isn't enough. My wife was driving the truck and was getting a low tire light. After she filled it up she stopped by McLarty and shawn got her into there shop immediately and come to find out we had a un fixable sidewall hole. So after hearing of this news Shawn explained that if they new there was damage in the sidewall they would have never sold us the truck in that condition. And they were going to get a new tire for free. WOW!!!!!! I will never go anywhere else than to see Shawn. He is worth every penny I spent and then some!",5.0
17,"July 20, 2012","We blew a tire and had to use our spare.  Called McLarty Ford right before closing time (from fifty miles away) and Jim (the service manager) told us they would be open the next morning at 7 o'clock.  We made it to Texarkana and stayed the night.  Next morning, w arrived at McLarty Ford to find Jim had already researched our type of car, figured out what tires were recommended, checked his inventory, and printed out information listing all our options.  They got us back on the road quickly. Everyone was very courteous and friendly.  I would highly recommend this dealership.",5.0
