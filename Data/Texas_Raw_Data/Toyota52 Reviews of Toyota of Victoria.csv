3,"August 07, 2019","I take extreme care of my vehicles.  Took my 2019 Sienna SE in for the first service based on time rather than mileage.  Took the van on vacation and was 1200 miles away and the service light comes on.  Called the dealership and asked if the service is supposed to include resetting the service reminders?  Their answer was the light wasn't.  I asked ""doesn't the form say to reset the monitors?""   Nsver got an answer.  It makes you wonder what other items they skip on a service.   Now I get to drive 90 miles roundtrip to have the reminder light reset.  Guess my time is nt important.  Be cautious with this dealer, they don't show the after sale interest most high end dealers do.",2.8
4,"March 14, 2019","DONT TRUST THE ONLINE VEHICLE EVALUATION!!! Even the manager, JOSH SMITH, will not honor the evaluation! 
I live 4 hours away, and have my bank approval for $35,055 to purchase a truck. I knew I would be a little upside down in my trade, so I used the online vehicle evaluation. The evaluation came back at $10,525 - $12,625. When I submitted everything and asked for the buyer's order from the dealership, they was $900 over what my bank agreed to. I looked over the buyer's order, and my trade in was listed at $9,350. I contacted Josh Smith, and begged him to increase the trade in value to honor their online evaluation so I could make the purchase. He simply refused and stated they would not budge from the trade in listed. He gave up a 35k sale because he would not honor their online vehicle evaluation!!!!",1.0

I got what I needed/ordered others that weren't in stock.  Pleased with the visit.  I am glad they are open on Saturday as I work out of town and can't always get somewhere before they close on weekdays.",5.0
13,"October 15, 2018",I made an appt for 9am for a simple oil change  (as recommended for faster service).   I left at 11am (the same time as someone else in the waiting area with a 1015 appt)   Friendly service but No explaination. People will understand if you just let them know what is going on.  I recommend that the service department step it up and certainly needs to communicate better with their customers.  ,4.2
14,"August 23, 2018","Toyota of Victoria's internet rep, Bryan Wagner, attempted a bait and switch. That royally pissed us off. We were told we were not going to find a White Toyota SE or XSE for the features and price we want to pay in the state of Texas so we should buy the one on his lot. It didn't have the dual air and was Pearl, not white. I clearly stated in my emails and on the phone that without certain features, we are not interested. Bryan did this on purpose. We find it underhanded and disrespectful. He did instruct one of his team to fill up our gas tank for our troubles but that took out 5 hours (round trip) of our day on my wife's birthday weekend. We could have spent that with our children and family but were busy with the con Bryan and Toyota of Victoria dealership tried to pawn off on us. We will not be back. And anyone considering buying from them should avoid them by all means.

And, on a final note, Fred Haas Toyota World called me Sunday morning (the very next day). The car that Bryan and Toyota of Victoria told me on Saturday that we would not find anywhere in Texas the white 2018 SE or XSE Camry with dual a/c for the price I wanted to pay.  An XSE that Bryan and his team said the best they could do was $488 a month payments. This was the best price after Bryan allegedly spoke to his manager who read all my emails. Nowhere close to my $375 a month range with $0 down that I asked for. Bryan said it could not be done. Well, I say, they truly didn't want to. They wanted us to buy what was on there lot and not what we wanted. Our satisfaction was not what Bryan had in mind. Like I already said, we will not be back and you should avoid them at all costs.

16,"June 16, 2018","We initially spoke with internet sales associate Mark and this dealership was recommended by friends who had recently purchased a vehicle.  We arrived at the dealership on April 14th and were greeted by Brian.  We mentioned Mark’s name and were handed off to David in the sales department.  We purchased a new 2018 4Runner and initially everything was great.  The vehicle we purchased was not available at the dealership so, we were provided with a loaner through the weekend until ours was delivered a few days later.  The dealership sent surveys for us to fill out and we left raving reviews within a few days of the purchase.  Then, we started receiving multiple text messages and phone calls from Carrie asking for more reviews.  She was asked to stop multiple times via text.  David called from his personal cell phone, late one evening, asking why we have not filled out recent surveys sent via e-mail.  The manager, Greg, was contacted immediately and we asked for his staff to please stop harassing us.  A few days later, we were contacted by Mark asking if we were still interested in purchasing a vehicle.  We told him that we did come into the dealership and already made a purchase.  He was verbally upset that we didn’t ask for him upon our arrival.  The fact is, we did ask for Mark upon arrival and were told that he’s just an internet guy.  We are now at 5K miles on the vehicle and we live 4 hours away from the dealership so we called a week in advance to schedule the first service appointment for June 4th.  Upon arrival, the outside service department greeter was very rude and unprofessional.  This was our first service department visit and he was upset that our vehicle was facing the wrong way in the wrong spot.  Everyone else was parked in this area facing the same direction so how were we supposed to know how to park for service.  Anyhow, upon trying to check in for our service appointment, we were told that the vehicle could not be serviced at this time and the outside service department guy kept talking over the service woman saying he doesn’t have time for us.  We will be contacting Toyota and BBB for the service department matter.  Overall, just beware of leaving positive reviews too soon after your buying experience.  Make sure they earn your positive review, not demand it! I initially told David our salesman  that I would be back in Aug for a new Tundra But they could care less about repeat business.  Buyer Beware.",1.4
17,"April 07, 2018","The Land Cruiser received the best marks in a Consumer Reports article.  I went to Toyota of Victoria to get more familiar. The salesperson spent 2 hours showing me the features and the finance team found terrific terms.  All my questions were answered with total transparency.  I got a great car, at the right price, with an affordable payment, from the professional staff at Toyota of Victoria.  I’m very pleased ",5.0

20,"January 26, 2018","I inquired on an in-stock vehicle via phone. I was an out of state buyer and was going to fly to TX or have the car shipped. Pricing was verbally confirmed over the phone and we agreed on the deal. The first time I spoke with the Finance Manager Nigel, he said to get the agreed upon price I would HAVE to finance with them, that was never told to me in the beginning and I wanted to use my credit union, regardless I wanted the car so I reluctantly agreed. Gave all my information and completed a credit app, they ended up pulling my credit 3 times with 3 different lenders. It took them over 36 hours to respond because they are a ""high volume dealer and were too busy to call me back"" I finally asked to see the purchase contract after a day of not hearing anything, when they showed it to me there were $2500 in dealer add ons that was NEVER communicated to me before. I managed to negotiate down most the dealer add-ons but again. . . they were FORCING me to buy the Dealer Installed GPS Tracking (Apex Protection Plan) in order to buy the car. They stated they it could not be removed - LIES. Funny thing is Apex Protection Plan headquarters is right next door to the dealership. I wrote a long email stating that I wanted to see an update purchase contract that reflects my credit card deposit before they mailed it out to me and how they haven't been transparent in this whole process. I never heard from them again and they sold the car to someone else WHILE we were still working on the deal. Please stay away for your own good. Brandon the sales rep was nice however very inexperienced and would lie to help close the sale. Nigel would constantly blame the sales team for not being transparent and up front when. Worst buying experience ever, don't believe their lies that you need to finance with them or have to purchase the dealer add ons.   ",1.0
21,"January 17, 2018","I came in the dealer to looking for a Van for my sister and then I made an appointment with Bryan Internet Saleman to come in the other day to do paper work.  Before that day, he let me know the Van is sold.  He is such a liar.  So we came to check out another Van.  The Sale manager Jason is horrible.  He has very bad attitude look like he doesn’t need and care the customer.  Over all, before you come in to this dealer, you have to think carefully.  Thanks",1.0

26,"April 19, 2017","Wow!  April 14,2017 turned out to be a remarkable day for me - the day I purchased my new 2017 Camry.  From the moment I walked onto the lot every single person I came in contact with greeted me and offered me water and/or coffee.  The receptionist called ""Lloyd"" out of a meeting to assist me.  I was undecided between a 4 Runner and a Camry, and I was thrilled to test drive both.  Lloyd was able to answer all of my questions about both models, and I finally decided on the Camry.  Lloyd started the process by having me fill out an application, assisted me in turning-in my lease car, helped me compare the advantages and disadvantages of leasing or purchasing the new vehicle, and then turned me over the ""finance"" person to complete the paperwork.  Finally, I was helped by Mr. Gutierrez (Danny ?) who went through all of the wonderful APs and features of my new Camry.  Lloyd came out several times to check on me several times, and then let me know that new car mats had been ordered and would be ready for pick-up the next morning.  I drove off in my new car and, arriving at my house and checking out the car, noticed a small scratch on the driver's door.  I immediately called Lloyd and he said not to worry, they would take care of the scratch the following week.  

I am thrilled by the care I received at Toyota of Victoria.  I drove in at 9:00 AM and left with my new car (spotless and with a full tank of gas) at 12:30 PM.",5.0

36,"November 02, 2016","Everything was great with my Salesman Chris Martinez but the Sales Manager Greg lied to me. He told me that i would not have to put money down if i bought a Brand New Toyota, the next day when i went in to sign paperwork he comes out to tell me His words ( Ok with your $500.00 down ), my husband stopped him there and said wait you told us face to face yesterday that if we bought a brand new toyota that we would not have to have money down, he would not look us in the face at all, he blamed it on the bank, so my husband told him to go back and tell the bank what he told us, he never came back out to talk to us, he called our salesman to his office to have him come tell us that we couldn't get a car without putting $500.00 down. All i have to say is do not tell someone something if you are not sure it is the truth. Between the 2 days we waiting a total of 5 hours to get the car. Everything else was great.",2.6
37,"March 23, 2016","Bought my vehicle in for some work. The work on the interior of the car was done and it is fine. But the condition it was returned to me was not good. There was dirty black streak marks on the cloth seats. This could have been avoided by covering the seats before doing the work. There were rubber streak marks on the interior of the windshield that weren't there before I bought it in. It was caused by rubbing some parts that were changed. Should have been cleaned up. I had to spend some time erasing those marks as they did not come off easily. The ac vents which were worked on were stuck in some weird position. I had to finagle it with a screwdriver to set it properly. Should have been inspected before returning the vehicle. Overall, a little more attention to details goes a long way to leave a good impression of ones workmanship. ",3.2
38,"August 05, 2015","My husband I went in because we were recommended by a close friend every thing went smooth up until we went to finance to sign papers with RJ. We went with our two kids my son is 1 and he was extremely tired, frustrated, and hungry. We had been there for 3 1/2 hrs. He gave my kids a look any mother would have jumped over the table and rang his neck. RJ had my husband sign the papers and wouldn't give us a chance to look the papers over before signing. We were told that the car had had a recent oil change and that it had been fully serviced and everything was good to go. I have had my car for 2 weeks and the oil is blacker than asphalt. I live 2 hours away from a Nissan dealership which is the car we got from them. I am currently at a local dealership getting the oil changed. The ones that should be paying for this is Toyota for lying and saying it was already done. ",1.4
39,"July 22, 2015","My husband and I purchased our first dealership vehicle from them they are crocks. The purchase price was $21,000 with tax and title it should of been a total of a little under $23,000. We had $1500 for our trade and put $2500 down. Loan papers come in the mail and our loan was for the full $23,000. Can't seem to get any answers from them just get passed from person to person each blaming the other. At a lose as to what to do they use $4000 the way I see it.

I specifically told this guy I wanted a truck and I wanted a Toyota! He said he was bringing a black Toyota Tacoma for me to look at and he pulls up a beaten up F-150! I tell him right of the bat that I'm not interested in that truck I asked him where the Tacoma was?? He said he never said Tacoma even though my mother was there with two other ladies that also heard he was bringing a Tacoma!  That was the first lie, then he says ok I'll go get the Tacoma!! He then pulls up with an old 2008 Tacoma that he says it has over 100, 000 miles and it's filthy from the inside and it doesn't look like it's worth $23,000 which that's what he said I was approved for!! I told him I was leaving! I told him thank you for wasting my time which was a 3 hour drive from my home! He said to wait that he would get the manager to talk to me! When the manager arrived and I explained to te manager why I was unhappy and told him that STEVE was trying you put me in a 2008 tacoma that had over 100, 000 miles then STEVE argued with me saying he never said it had over 100,000 miles he asked me if I was calling him a liar and I said yes you are a liar you said it had over 100,000 miles which he did say that! He screamed at me and said I'm through with you and walked off!! YEAH THAT'S THE KIND OF PROFESSIONALISM THEIR CUSTOMER REPRESENTATIVES HAVE!!!!! I WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK TO THIS PLACE!

They will tell you anything to make a paycheck and will send you off to different people if they think they can't do it. I bought a vehicle from Francis. Francis turned out to be a crook and no longer works there. So coach had to deal with my situation. My situation was the car itself was a lemon. No one wanted to take my situation I would brush me off to others. Francis no longer work there so I got put on coaches desk coach couldn't figure it out so he sent me David Canales. David took his sweet xxx time, didn't give two xxxxs. Then tells me, ""I'm just a salesperson I don't have anything to do with the situation so I will send you to coach the manager."" Remind you, coach sent me to David. Coach himself took his sweet xxx time doing absolutely nothing. The only time he ever thought about my situation, was when I was there in his face, he didn't care, because I wasn't a part of his paycheck. Coach then decides to continue to tell me that it wasn't up to him that it was up to the general manager, the next day it wasn't the general managers decision, it was the banks. He just continued to flip flop every day. Never had the same story. I went yesterday August 27th at 10 o'clock in the morningand once again he had nothing for me no answers know anything. He told me to give him an hour and he would have some type of answer. He then tells me he will call me and I never received a call. At 4:00pm. I called and was informedthat coach was busy with customers. I asked to speak to the general manager and like always there managers are quote on quote in meetings. I was the pushef off to the general managers assistant, Robin. she was a very sweet lady and very understanding. She took down all my information and told me she would look into it first thing this morning. Surprisingly she did call me at 11 00 in the morning and told me that everything was fixed with my car need to remind you I'm not there to get my car fixed, I'm there to get a new vehicle. She didn't ask me what's wrong with this one and I tell her. The car doesn't go over 60 miles an hour and it chugs a lot. It burns oil at rapid speeds and I never traveled anywhere. she says she would personally take it for a spin and give me a call back we hung up at 11 30 in the morning it is now 530 in the afternoon and I have yet to get a call back from her. This place is a rip off they will not tell you anything its a bunch of smoke and mirrors I never get the truth. Do not do business with these people it was better when the previous owners were there. It has gone to xxxx don't do it!

The salesperson Veronica is extremely lazy and the definition of incompetent. Ignores questions or just answers what she feels. You are on her time and she will take weeks to get things done half-way, when she says they will get done right-away.  The sales ""manager"" Angel is a liar and doesn't stick to his word about anything. He is a coward that will avoid you at all costs and ignore phone calls, etc. It was a chore just to buy a truck from them. They screwed up the figures, the delivery, lost keys, had items stolen, lost paperwork with my social security number on them, etc etc. Anything they could screw up it seemed they did their very best to screw it up even more. Afterwards they showed no care or concern and never came through on what they said they would to try to rectify their screw-ups. I would not recommend this place to anyone.

Both told me it was the motor and the housing and would cost over $2100 to replace.  I always thought the problem was with the switch and not the motor.  They did not listen to me at all.

Took it to Toyota of Victoria, spoke with Bradley Parker, who listened to me and arranged to have the switch replaced, and it works perfectly now.  I will be forever grateful to this absolutely fantastic service department for the wonderful repair they made on my car.  I'm seriously considering making the 1100 mile drive for all the big scheduled maintenance my car needs because I have so much confidence in them!

47,"August 06, 2013","Horrible. Was lied to, and mislead by sales people who knew nothing about the car they were trying to sell.  I spent a day researching the Prius before I went in and the sales person could not correctly answer any questions about the car and the ones he did, were completely wrong. I had to get a brochure to show him and teach him about the car.  Really felt that thy would say anything just to get you to buy the car, who cares if it is a lie or misleading.  The finance guy I talked to also knew nothing about current incentives offered by Toyota.  They would not acknowledge up front that they did 0% finance at the time and tried to lock me in at a much higher percentage and I have flawless credit.  Really made me second guess my decision on wanting a Toyota.  Dealt with this same kind of things with other dealers in the past and won't put up with it.
