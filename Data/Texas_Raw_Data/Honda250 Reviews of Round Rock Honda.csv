I was about to give up when Dustin gave me a text with the exact car and color I wanted.  I drove it and came back and said I’ll buy it. They were so professional and friendly, I would definitely 
buy a car again from them.",5.0
1,"June 17, 2020","This is the second time I have come to Honda to purchase a new car, and every time I've came here, the service has been nothing but superb and fantastic. I had the honor to meet Trish and she easily welcomed me into the facility and into the Honda family. I was a little anxious because I didn't really prepared myself for an appointment as it was made the day prior. Nevertheless, Trish made me feel like at home and helped answer every question with optimism and positivity. I can't thank Trish enough for helping me feel at ease especially during a stressful time period. I also had the pleasure to meeting Jason. Jason has helped my family with the finance portions on the last 3 cars we took home. Jason was super informative and treated us like a friend. Seeing Jason again was a nice surprise as we already had a connection with him and happen to have many similarities in our lifestyles. Our visit at the Honda dealership is one I would certainly never forget as I felt more than a customer, Trish and Jason included me into the Honda family and I can't wait to promote their services to our friends and families.",5.0
2,"June 10, 2020",We really appreciated the assistance we received from Trish Scheffer on our purchase of the Honda Passport.  Trish and I started communicating after I submitted a request for information on a Honda Pilot I saw online. Trish would always answer all of my questions and I never felt pressured.  I have purchased a lot of vehicles over the years and it is a process that I have always hated due to being pressured.  Trish worked with us on a few vehicles and always answered our questions.  We were very concerned about trying to purchase a vehicle due to the coronavirus and Trish understood our concern and took measures to make things as safe as possible.  We looked at several other brands at other dealers and we never felt as safe at those dealers as we did at Round Rock Honda. I hope those same measures are extended to other buyers. We decided to purchase the Honda Passport and it was getting late in the day and we were exhausted and didn’t want to spend more time going through the buying process.  Trish and Art Hellman agreed that we could wait until the next morning to complete the deal on a virtual handshake.  At that point I felt some trust that we would be back the next morning.  It’s very refreshing that deals are still being made in that manner.  Thanks Trish for making the process better.   ,5.0
3,"June 05, 2020","I was going from dealer to dealer to find an eight passenger vehicle with some very specific needs. By the time  I came to Honda  I was exhausted and frustrated until I met Josh. He was a no pressure sales person, he listen to our needs, ran around the lot and pulled different vehicles for us to look over.   He let us look and ask as many questions as we wanted, but he never tried to push us into a vehicle.  When we decide to go with Honda the financing was a breeze because of Sam.  I have never been happier with a vehicle purchase then I am now and I have brought a lot cars.  Josh our sales rep I can not say enough about how he handled the whole buying car experience.  Josh is not our sales rep, but part of my family now and forever.  You would be crazy not to go to Round Rock Honda for your next vehicle purchase and when you do ask for Josh!  ",5.0
4,"June 03, 2020","I came prepared to buy a Honda CR-V as I have been doing my research and planned my purchase for almost a year. My salesperson was Joshua Scruggs. He was very respectful, kind, and easy to communicate with, and, most importantly, not at all pushy. Not only that, when it got to the financing part, that guy was absolutely wonderful too and very easy to work with. Another note: When I went to the dealership, I really liked that they are taking the pandemic seriously while not taking away from their brand - they even provide disposable gloves to wear when you're test driving a vehicle. Round Rock Honda is literally the best Honda dealership in the area and I highly recommend them. ",5.0

9,"May 13, 2020","I was buying my leased vehicle as my lease was expiring. Trish Scheffer and Joshua Scruggs were magnificent. They answered every question that I had. My doctor did not want me going to the dealership due to the virus, so the dealership came to me. within 24 hours they secured a car loan, picked up the car  for inspection at the dealership and returned the car to me the same day and all the paperwork was completed within that 24 hour period.no one believes me when i say 24 hours from start to end!!

51,"November 20, 2019","I've bought my last 3 Hondas from Round Rock Honda through the same salesman along with Sophia Wingfield (who assisted me when I purchased my 2015 Honda CRV). So, in November of 2019 when I wanted to trade in my CR-V for a 2019 model, I was heartbroken to find out that the salesman had retired.  I dreaded the thought of working with a new salesperson.  I contacted the Sales Manager Kyle Click and asked for Sophia.  Luckily, she was still working there, so Kyle had her contact me.  Sophia was awesome!  I told her exactly what I was looking for (model, color etc.) and she found the perfect car for me.  She was friendly and extremely helpful to me in the whole car buying process!  She wanted to make sure my experience was the best.  I would highly recommend Sophia to anyone looking to buy a car from Round Rock Honda. Also, Kyle was extremely helpful, in not only connecting me with Sophia but making sure my experience was pleasant.  Once I reached Finance, they explained everything so I completely understood everything I was signing.  Kyle greeted me at the end of the process to make sure I was happy.  And the car is beautiful and perfect!",5.0
52,"November 19, 2019","Normally buying a car is such a chore.  Pushy salespeople. Haggling over a price, etc.  But it was actually a pleasure at Round Rock Honda.  A big part of the transaction being so painless was due to Trish Scheffer.  Trish is a knowledgable salesperson who knows her product and actually listens to the customer.  She was on top of communications with us and backed off when we said we were taking a break from shopping for awhile.  Once we were back in the game, she was right there with us.  We had actually gone to 2 of the other Honda dealers in town and it was the stereotypical car shopping experience: inept salespeople, lack of knowledge, a manager who comes over to start putting on pressure.  We decided at that point that if we were going to buy a Honda, we were going to buy from Round Rock.  We are glad we did.  Trish went to bat for us and got us a good deal on a new Ridgeline.  Once we had all agreed on terms, we met with Ricardo in Finance and the whole process from negotiating terms to signing papers took all of 1-1/2 hours and we were driving home in our new vehicle, very happy with our purchase.  And very happy with our decision to give our money to Round Rock Honda.  They earned our business while other dealers simply wanted our money.",5.0

55,"November 15, 2019","We just purchased our second car from Round Rock Honda in three years. This and our previous purchase were far and away the best car buying experiences we have ever had. 

Buying a new car has always been approached with some dread.  In our opinion car dealerships and their sales and finance staff have built a reputation on more hustle than honesty. Our experience at Round Rock Honda does not fit this mold. They have created a culture that focuses on complete comfort and satisfaction with what is often the largest financial transaction the buyer may make, right behind buying a home.

She kept saying it was a coincidence and it would be $95 for a diagnostic fee, since they most likely didn’t cause the problem. I did a walk in the same day to talk to Macy which is the service manager. She treated me like I’m stupid and said I could bring it back the next day. I brought it back and Ray my service advisor tried telling me there was no way it was their fault. I’m a smart young woman but my A/C doesn’t work fine and then all of a sudden stop after being worked on. The found $3,000 worth of of damages which was bs.

Then the finance manager told my girlfriend that a 4000$ warrenty was added to the contract an was required for financing. That is an illegal scam dealers use. Carl the salesman is a manipulative snake. Everytime I tried to discuss things with my girlfriend he would distract her by waving something in her face. Our first time at a big dealership thinking we would get a better deal then buy here. I'll go to a buy here then a big dealer ever again. The things they said were borderline illegal. ,1.6

92,"June 25, 2018","When I brought my car into the Service Dept at RR Honda, I was told the charges would be about $90 for having my car's transmission oil changed. But on my bill, I was charged 97 cents for ""Service History Admin"" and $5.58 for ""Misc. Fee and Supplies"".  When I asked what these charges were for, I was told the 97 cents is for Round Rock Honda having to tow away other peoples' cars who have left their cars there and never picked them up. Whaaat?? Why should my repair bill for my car include tow charges for other people? This doesn't seem legal. Now the Misc. Fee and Supplies was for disposal of my transmission fluid, which I am not disputing, but the bill should've clearly stated what this charge was for besides ""miscellaneous"".  RR Honda is going to take the 97 cent charge off my bill, but I still find it very unethical to charge customers something so esoteric as ""Service History Admin"" which really means ""towed-out"" charges for other vehicles.",1.3

The car is a nightmare. It has almost caused several instances of multiple car pile ups because the anti-collision system will engage for no reason and slam on the brakes in high speed traffic. Turning it off does no good, it just turns itself back on when the car is shut offf and intemitently during the course of driving. In addition, the GPS system is useless. It just goes blank in the middle of navigation to an address even after update from Garmin was uploaded. Seat warmers turn on for no reason and won't shut off. Tire pressure warning comes on when tires are at reccomended pressures. Recalibration does not resolve the issue. Theft alert system becomes disconnected for no reason necessitating a complex reboot etc.
The lane guard system has attempted to steer the car off the road into the shoulder and toward a ditch or guardrail. 
This car is an extreme safety hazzard.

95,"May 15, 2018","I don’t normally do something like this, but I just had to speak up. I recently just bought a 2018 Accord. The experience was Great; I was treated with respect and received a good deal. There was only 1 minor issue; they could only find 1 set of keys. 
The whole deal was very pleasant and I'm happy with the care, other than the issue with the keys. No big deal, they said they would find by the next day or so. I gave it over a week with no word. 
I went to the dealership to see if they found the other set of keys. Well, no luck. I was sent off to a Michelle M. who I was told would take care of this. She promptly informed me that I would have to leave my car with them and that it takes a couple of hours. Really??? I’m bit puzzled by that response and asked if we could confirm. I find it hard to understand that something like this should force me to have to leave my car with them. With that be said, Michelle called the service department to confirm that it will take 90 Minutes. WOW. Needing the second set of keys, I guess I’m stuck with having to make an appt. Once that was completed with the service depart. Note: all this being transacted over Michelle’s phone to the service department. Michelle couldn’t ran off any faster Speedy Gonzales. Not even a thanks for stopping bye or sorry that we couldn’t find other set of keys, nothing. I kind of felt like she had other more important matters to attend to, and I was just not that important.

Well, round 2.  The day of the appt.  I went  to the Appt. that was setup by Michelle M, and wasted another 45 minutes of my time, just to have the service guy come to me and tell me that the key fab that is needed is not in Stock.  He’ll call me when they have stock.  Who knows when or if they’ll call?  Someone should’ve checked that they had stock before making the appt. and wasting my time.  I’m quickly becoming dissatisfied.  I don’t blame Honda, just these few people that makes me wonder

103,"December 14, 2016","I purchase two vehicles from this dealership and was lied to both times on what my warranties covered. 

With my first vehicle I was told oil change and wheel rotation was covered. I paid extra for this extended coverage only to find out later that only oil changed were covered. I spoke to a sales manager about this issue only to basically be told that I was in the wrong for thinking that even though that's what I was verbally told. 

I then purchased another vehicle with extended warranty that supposedly covered any issues at all that I would have with my previously owned honda certified vehicle. Then to find out that it didn't cover any wearable items (brake pads or rotors). Once again was told by a sales manager that it was my fault for misunderstanding. 

The last vehicle that I purchased had some steering wheel shake when I drove it off the lot and I definitely should have turned right back around to have the issue resolved. I made the mistake of waiting too long to report the issue which ended up being a warped rotor. I ended up speaking to a sales rep about the issue who ended up being completely rude and unhelpful and was once again told it was my fault and probably my doing for the warped rotor. On this front I probably shouldn't have waited so long to report the issue. But my understanding was that the warranty would cover this and that it wouldn't be a big deal. 

Bottom line, don't trust anything anyone at this dealership tells you and make sure to read all the fine print. Part of this was my fault for putting any trust in the sales team. And lastly don't expect any real customer service. If you happen to shop for a car at this dealership definitely be on the defense. The attitude here is that it's you against them. I will not shop here in the future and cannot recommend them.

104,"November 26, 2016","I negotiated a very good price on a new Honda Ridgeline and my trade in.  It took the usual amout of haggling. I said ""no"" to their price(s) 3 times and they decided to take my ""out the doorprice"" offer as I was preparing to leave, etc.  Sales and other staff were fine.  The truck that I wanted was already on allocation and being built.  It was to arrive in about a month.  I had a written sales agreement signed by the dealer and signed by me.

My salesperson was ""on it"" and gave me calls every week. A few days before the vehicle was ""due"" to the dealer, I drove by one evening and saw that it had arrived and was on their storage lot. I called the salesperson the next day.... he didn't return my call (Thanksgiving Week).  I went to the dealership that afternoon. They indicated that my salesman was on vacation all week and paired me up with another one.  He too was very nice and helpful.  We drove the truck and I confirmed that wanted it.   I explained the deal and that I was ready to write a check for the agreed price.   He wrote up the paperwork.  All was good to that point!

After about 30 minutes, while everthing was being processed (and I had cleaned out my old car) the salesman came back to me.  He indicated that they had reevaluated my trade in.  Because 4 weeks had passed and the car had been driven,  It's value had dropped another $500.  THEY WANTED MORE MONEY ON A DEAL THAT THEY HAD AGREED TO IN WRITING. They knew and agreed that my car would be a month older when I signed the original agreement!  I very clearly said NO.  He went back and they agreed to their original contract.

Folks, I was reluctant to go to this dealer in the first place, based on the sales reputation of their Toyota dealership next door.  I was plesantly surprised with the entire experince before and after the incident. The sales folks and everyone I met worked hard to build my trust and earn my business.  However, the sales manager destroyed that trust completely by pulling the ""your trade in isn't worth it stunt"" at the last minute,   She moved a solid ""5"" rating to a barely a ""3"" rating.

On March 23rd 2015 we purchased a Hyundai accent with about 35,000 miles: we needed this car for some sense of security.  With a child that had to be transported to Dell Children’s on a regular basis for cardiology visits.  Our old car unexpected broke down. We needed a reliable car with a/c because the summer was fast approaching.  We explained to our Sales lady what we were looking for: reliable, low mileage more importantly no accidents, one owner; thus our purchase.  Within a few days we had to take the car back because of a dented front rim: after much accusation from the sales lady and the finance guy they found our wheel and tire warrantee: issue was fixed.  July 22nd 2015, four months later my car starts to over-heat, the A/c stops working also.  We quickly took our only car to a well know repair shop.  The repair guy took one look at the car and ask with horror in is eye “where did you buy this car?” We explained and this is when the rug the pulled from under us.  My car had previously been in a front end collision:  the radiator of that car was hang by a thread, burning a hole into the reservoir tank, the car had previously had its front lights changed and other work done, also.  This could not be right!  We told the older sales lady what we were looking for, we had our girls with us, and how could she lie to us.  SHE DID! $800 repair bill, issue still not fixed turns out there is more wrong.  I could not take it anymore.  Drove the car back to the dealership.  Well, we were reminded that the car was purchased as is and that it was our fault that we relied on what we were told and the car fax report.  The sales manager then told me that he had cars on his lot that had clean car fax reports however, he knew they had been in accidents and by law he was not required to tell his customers.  Even writing this makes me sick to my stomach.  SAVE YOURSELF THE HEARTACHE THAT I AM CURRENTLY ENDURING AND LOOK SOMEWHERE ELSE.

Salesmen here are SHADY. I visited to test drive a Certified Honda Civic Hybrid with 74400 miles on it. The car was advertised on their site, on the car, on the 182 pt check off list he showed me, as well as by 2 different salesmen as certified preowned.

Started negotiating with the salesman(Buddy) on price for vehicle + TTL. As soon as we started talking financing, I said they would have to be able to give me a better rate than 2.25% I already had approval for through a credit union. This salesman took the offer on the table back for approval and came back within a couple hundred dollars. I was ready to buy the car. 

Then he informs me that the car is in fact not certified preowned. He insists human error happens and that cars can only have up to 60k mileage to be cert preowned. There are 2 cars on their website, advertised as cert preowned, with over 60k mileage.

They knew I drove 3 hrs to their dealership and screwed me over. I guess not getting all the extra add ons and financing elsewhere was enough for them to lie and not sell me a car. Management didn't even come out to meet me and try to explain the ""mix up"". The Civic is still listed on their site over 24 hrs later as cert preowned.

I spent the better part of two days driving to and from round rock away from my family on my day off, researching and getting set up with a loan and getting the salesman to set up the paperwork for me. So he put the car on the sold lot ready for me to pick up with all the paperwork ready to go and so I left work in southwest Austin early to get to round rock to pick up the car and he calls me when I'm on the way to let me know that someone in upper management saw the car in the sold lot and told him that his son wanted to purchase it so he bought it out from under me.

117,"April 16, 2015","1999 Honda Accord at 196,000 miles.  My wife was in Texas to scout for a new home.  The fan belt was failing, I told her to go to a dealer for a replacement.  She said they had a timing belt special (I was planning on changing the timing belt when the car got home anyway)  I said go ahead and do that too.   When the car got home the oil was low and there was a puddle under the car.  I took it to Ray Laks Honda, in New York.  The wrong seal was installed on the cam.  Round Rock Honda did pay Ray Laks to replace it and the timing belt which was soaked in oil. The car continued to leak, though not as bad.  I took it to my mechanic.  He found the cam had a nick in the seal journal.  He replaced the seals and timing belt again, but it still leaks as he said it would.  The only way to fix it is to replace the cam shaft, and if you didn't know this, VTEC cams are expensive.  The leak is getting the timing belt wet with oil and will likely cause it to fail prematurely, and when it does the engine will be destroyed. The car leaks to this day.  If you value your Honda, I would go elsewhere to have your car serviced.  They might be willing to rectify the situation, but I would never go back there.

Despite the inspection and certification process, it was sold to me with a broken brake caliper and badly worn belt.  I took it back to have those fixed and asked for a complete inspection, as those are far too obvious to have been accidentally missed.  That took multiple days, multiple delayed shuttle rides, and a rental car fiasco that was enough to send me through the roof.

I thought I was done.   Now I've found that the AC has multiple leaks and the timing belt pulley is failing, both showing indication of having been long-term problems that were missed by RR Honda.  I'm out of pocket on the AC repair, but thankfully the pulley was found before the powertrain warranty ran out.  I obviously am not having it serviced by RR Honda.

119,"May 15, 2014","I was shopping for a used car for my son and found an '08 Honda CRV at Round Rock Honda. Salesman Charlie Alexander told me they had ""just traded for it"" from a local customer. I asked him about warranty and he said we could purchase an extended warranty, but if we didn't, they would take care of any problems we had in the first thirty days.He told me about the extensive check-out that each of their used cars received before they would sell them, and told me a couple of stories of repairs they had made for customers within the first few weeks of purchase. We bought the CRV.
A few days later my son called and said the AC was making a strange noise, the TPMS light was coming on - even though the tires were fully inflated - and a few other minor issues. I called Charlie and told him we would bring it in to be checked. He immediately started walking back the ""we'll take care of it"" assurance, but said they'd take a look at it, so my son made a service appointment. Thirty minutes before the appointment, Charlie left me a message and said there was no warranty on the car and we would have to pay for any diagnostics or repairs. When I called him back, he denied he had ever made any statements about taking care of any repairs, even when I quoted him re: his stories about specific cases where they had done repairs for customers within a few weeks of purchase. I also quoted him on the ""extensive"" check-out that every car received, and how they stood by what they sold. Charlie said he'd check with the manager and get back with me. Later in the day he left a message that the car was high mileage, there was no warranty, and he had never committed to any needed repairs. I called him back, left a message, and never heard from him again.

I checked the car's history on and found that the car they had ""just taken on trade from a local customer"" (first week of May) had actually been in their inventory since March.

Bottom line: Charlie Alexander at Round Rock Honda is a liar. RR Honda is a corporate dealership, and they'll tell you anything to make the sale. They will also turn their backs on you when you try to hold them to their commitments.             ",1.5

125,"August 20, 2013","I was purchasing my first car, which meant going to various dealerships, and Jason was by far the most helpful and friendly car dealer. I didn't have anything in mind when going to look at cars, and Jason was the one who showed me the Honda fit, which I'm now absolutely in love with. He wasn't at all pushy or difficult, and was super incredible in helping me with where I needed to be financially.

127,"August 07, 2013","My car buying experience at Round Rock Honda was a good one.  As a first time car buyer, I did not feel overwhelmed by ""pushy"" salesmen.  I think it is important to note that I visited Round Rock Honda twice.  The first time, I was paired with an inexperienced salesman who knew less about the car than we did which ultimately led to us leaving to visit other dealerships.  I then researched for a while on my own and ended up back at Round Rock Honda with more information.  Jason was ultimately the one to sell me my car and he was very patient and attentive.  He knew his stuff and was great to work with.  I only wish that I had been introduced to him the first time I visited Round Rock Honda, then maybe I would have bought a car sooner.  In the end, I feel as though they were fair and worked with me on my price limitations.  I now have a new 2013 Honda Accord and I am loving it!",4.4
128,"July 26, 2013","Our experience at Round Rock Honda was exceptional based on our representative Jason Auglay.  His ability to explain various options, listen very patiently, and answer all questions in detail regarding our Honda Accord.  He also spent over 3 hours with us on a Tuesday morning (thereby missing his lunch) to make sure that he answered all questions and found us a car that met ALL our needs. There was no pressure, his follow up and communications was amazing. For the record we traded in a 2004 Chevy Silverado on a 2013 Honda Accord. 

Everyone we encountered at Rock Round Honda was just great (including Veronica, Jeff, James, Antonio, Ray). Very accomodating people that actually enjoyed their job.

I would buy a 100 cars from Jason based on his genuine personality, superb communication skills, and just all around good individual. We went in for a brochure on a 2013 Honda Accord and came away with a 2013 Honda.  Follow up from Jason was excellent - wanted to make sure that car was doing fine and actually cared that we were happy with our car and purchase.  We did have a one issue with tint and it was rapidly taken care of by their outstanding service department.  

I will never consider another dealership to deal with than Round Rock Honda.  I highly highly highly recommend Jason Auglay as a excellent representative of Round Rock Honda.  ",5.0

He gave us all the information we needed to seriously consider the lease.   When we returned, it was basically to test drive the vehicle with the family and commence the paperwork. We were assisted by Jason Agulay.  Even though he was rather new to this dealership, it did not hamper his ability to handle the lease smoothly.  I am usually apprehensive about taking test drives with sales personnel. Jason is the first sales person who wasn't like a sales person.  I mean that in a complimentary way.  He was very professional and at the same time I felt like he was one of the family in the car.  His sincerity was what made us feel very comfortable and at ease.  He was conscientious in giving thorough instruction about the computerized features in the Odyssey.  He was most helpful and the process was quick, enjoyable, and rather easy.  It was rather uncanny that when he picked a random Odyssey for us to test drive, it was the interior and exterior color that we had previously decided on.  It was a done deal.

145,"July 04, 2012","After a bad experience at Howdy Honda on 6/9/12 with the 2012 Honda Civic EX I bought there, I decided to trade it in for a 2012 CR-V EX-L at Round Rock Honda on 7/2/12. On 6/22, Paul let me test drive a CR-V and a Civic Si.  He was very focused on my needs.  He did not have the CR-V that I wanted at the time but he told me when the next one would be in.  I put a $500 deposit down.  I could not decide on whether I wanted the White Diamond Pearl or the Crystal Black Pearl.  I later decided on the Crystal Black Pearl.  The wait was well worth it. What a beautiful vehicle.  I love it!  It had 10 miles on it when I got it.  Personally, for me it is worth waiting over a week for a new vehicle that was never test driven by a lot of other people.  Only Round Rock Honda test drove it as is required.
I bought a new 2007 Honda Civic EX back in 2007 from Paul.  I do not know if I wrote a review about him then, but he is still as awesome as he was 5 years ago.  He devoted as much time as I needed to get the vehicle I wanted.  The used car department there gave me $18,500 for my “new” 2012 Honda Civic EX that had 859 miles on it. First Texas Honda wanted to give me $17,500 and Howdy Honda, $18,000. The MSRP on the 2012 Honda CR-V EX-L is $28,075. Dealer invoice is $26,409. Paul’s first offer was $27,575.  I asked him if he would go down another $200 to $300 and they went down $225.  On paper, I paid $27,350 for the CR-V.  They gave me $191 over Edmund’s true market value of $18,309 for the Civic.  Of course, that value keeps changing.  With that figured in, it brings it down to $27,159.  I also asked if he would throw in some wheel locks.  He said these are worth around $87.00. Personally, I think that is a very inflated price for wheel locks, but it is what it is. That would bring the price down to $27,072 with those things considered.  A week ago or so, my CR-V EX-L had a true market value of $27,050.  I would say I did a pretty good job this time around, but I lost close to $2000 by trading in my “new” 2012 Civic EX that I bought from Howdy Honda.
I strongly recommend Paul Koehler at Round Rock Honda if you are in the market for a new Honda.  He will treat you right.  My experience at Round Rock Honda was the exact opposite of the experience I had at Howdy Honda. Those guys are so tight they will not even throw in some wheel locks. Paul not only threw those in, he had them put on the vehicle! The drive from Cedar Creek to Round Rock was well worth it.",5.0

148,"March 02, 2012","To whom this may concern:

I’m not sure who to send this complaint to, but I went online to research Hyundai customer complaints, somehow I ended up finding the Penske Group.  I called the contact number located on the site, however I was transferred to a Linda, which I received her voice mail.  So I decided to email my complaint instead.  

Since I was in the area looking at Honda vehicles for my wife, I parked my vehicle near the Honda dealer’s parking lot, and then walked over to Hyundai Round Rock area to discuss an issue pertaining to my vehicle.  While walking towards Hyundai I was approached by a gentleman by the name of Mr. Owens.  He asked if there was anything he could help me with, and then stated his name.   I begin to explain my situation, but suddenly his cell phone rings, and immediately he answers it.  Mr. Owens said “Baby I’m busy, let me call you right back.”  After he hangs up, he apologized, then I begin to speak again attempting to explain my circumstances; however his cell phone rings yet again, and he answers it.   He stated, “Baby I can’t talk right now I’m with a customer”, although he was stressing to someone that he was with a customer he continued to speak with them.  This time I walked away very irritated and annoyed. 
 
My questions I wanted to ask were regarding a tapping noise I was hearing when I initially start up my car in the morning, and I had questions regarding my warranty.   I was going to walk in the Hyundai building, but I was so aggravated with Mr. Owens customer service, I left.  I ended up contacting another dealer to assist me with my problem and answer my questions.

150,"February 13, 2012","Mid-2011, we were in the market for a minivan (Sienna or Odyssey).  Stopped at a few other dealers around town and settled on Rock Rock Honda as they also carried Toyota.  Huge plus to have both under same roof.  We also enjoyed dealing with Sophia, our sales rep, much more than anyone else we talked to at other dealerships.

We settled on the Odyssey but were dissappointed to find very few in stock as they were still recovering from the devastating tsunami.  Most that were on order were already sold as well.  The reason for the (4) rather than (5) for customer service is for 2 reasons:  1) We were waiting to test drive a Touring model.  One finally came in so we made special trip to test drive it.  I even called to verify it was still there to test drive before making the trip.  When we got there, it was sold and unable to drive.  Very annoying and a waste of our time.  A quick call would have been appreciated and would have gone a long way in building a solid relationship.  2) There seemed to be a lot of confusion around the 2011 and 2012 models.  We finally decided to purchase a 2011 due to great financing offer, got passed to the finance guy to negotiate, and within 15 minutes were walking out the door as we could no longer order a 2011.  Again, I felt this should have been communicated upfront as Sophia was aware that they did not have the model that we wanted in stock and she was also aware that we wanted the special financing (the offer was not extended to 2012's at that time).  Sophia was very nice and we enjoyed working with her. I'm just a very critical guy and thought a couple of things could have been done just a bit better to make the experience truly outstanding.  I would still recommend her to anyone as the above situations were not typical and were related to the limited stock and new model year transition.

Not being turned off, we waited it out and towards the end of 2011, their stock of 2012's began to build and they also extended special financing on the new model year.  Great!  From there, things went very well and everyone else at the dealership that we dealt with was very nice and attentive.  The only other source of frustration was the low ball offer that we received on our low mileage and clean trade in.  They obviously didn't want it so we took it down the street and got $3K more for it without any discussion.

The overall experience was pleasant and I'd recommend Round Rock Honda to anyone.

Cut to 3 weeks after purchase... while grocery shopping, someone must have decided to try and park their car in the same spot that we were parked.  After realizing a car was already parked there, the nice person drove off.  Imagine our surprise!  We took it to Round Rock Collision Center and the experience was fantastic!  Updates every few days and they finished sooner than expected.  Great work and everything is as ""good as new"". ",4.4

Our intent was to buy a car although we did not know we would purchase one that day.  We were interested in the Toyota Corolla and a Honda CRV.  We had owned a Toyota Corolla in the past and a certified Honda CRV.  For me, a driver in commuter traffic, I wanted something smaller and with excellent gas mileage.  Listening to us weigh the options, Lee suggested the Honda Fit, a car we hadn't considered.  It immediately felt just right and we were surprised at how roomy this small car was on the inside.  It fit our needs perfectly.  Lee listened and helped guide us in the right direction.  There was no pressure and the process was easy.

163,"October 20, 2011","My husband and I were narrowing our car search down to two vehicle types: Honda and VW.  We stopped in to look at the Honda Cross Tour comparing a new (at Round Rock) and a used 2010 at another dealer and those both to a VW.  Sam was very helpful in helping us compare the used to the new working up the differences and we discussed the benefits of each situation.  We determined that we did not want the large mileage of the used for such a small difference in prices.  Sam was very helpful and patient knowing that we may or may not buy on that day, of course doing his best to encourage a deal if possible.  We still wanted to compare our last choice of VW to Honda.  Sam let us take the Crosstour up and test it out side by side with our other VW choice in order to aid us in our final selection.  We took about an hour -- going over the pros and cons of both vehicle choices; our final selection was the Honda Crosstour for its over all smooth fit and finish, functionality of ease of seat drop down with an easy pull of a lever, both seats lying flat when needed and the hatchback having a flat entry and exit without having to bend over and lift up and then out with heavy items and finally we topped it off with the leather seats.  

Driving back to the Honda dealer we were very satisfied with our final selection and working with both Sam and the finance representative to close out the paper work was very fast and efficient including the trade-in of our old vehicle at a great price.  The whole team worked well together to complete all efforts including the after sales department for ordering and installing the trunk area rubber mat and putting on the plates when they arrived a week or two later.  

The car now has over 1,000 miles and is running great, its very comfortable and I hope to keep this vehicle as long as my last Honda Accord which we bought new and owned for 14 years, taking it overseas with us and back again!  

So regarding Sam Stipe's efforts to give us the data we requested to compare the 1 year old Crosstour to the new Crosstour, his services was outstanding.  Regarding his letting us take the Crosstour on a test drive and then again let us take it to the VW dealer for a side by side comparison with our 2nd vehicle option I was very impressed with, even though we were gone for about an hour; patient and not overpowering -- well done!  For the expeditious closing by Sam and his finance manager of all the paperwork for both the trade-in of our old Honda and the sale of the new Honda Crosstour once we made our decision - Bravo!

I have nothing but good things to say about the sales and group of technicians doing the new installation of trunk mat and license plates at Round Rock Honda.

I have bought several vehicles and never dealt with a nicer person then Mr. Valdez,he went beyond his duty as a sales professional, he was honest and simply.

169,"September 13, 2011","This is our return visit to Round Rock Honda. Even after investigating other dealers and car make and model possibilities, we returned to Round Rock Honda because of our good previous experience. The experienced and well-informed employees we worked with this summer always took ample time to answer our questions. We felt at ease with their genuine concern for our needs and requirements in a vehicle, and their friendliness in going beyond the ""call of duty"" to take all the time necessary to make sure we were satisfied at every phase of discussion, negotiation, and eventual sales completion. Manuel Valdes, our primary contact and sales representative, helped us throughout the process. Manny was assisted by Bill Alsbrooks, and Bill was most efficient in explaining the details of the Pilot, and very upbeat telling about his own personal experience with his Pilot. We were certainly convinced by Manny and Bill that the Pilot was right for us. Michael Hiler, the Business Manager, was always friendly and personable and made the paperwork processing seamless and easy to understand and manage. He was most efficient.

Our experience with Round Rock Honda has been exceptional --- a most pleasant experience. We are people who investigate the facts intelligently and purposefully before a major purchase, and we are aware of the questions we want answered. Our sales representatives for this purchase handled our questions with ease and gave us the appropriate information to make our choice of models. We could not have asked for a more rewarding experience. Having been Honda customers in the past (we also own an Accord), we have been extremely satisfied with the service area (for normal maintenance) and the accessories department. They have been efficient and responsive to our needs for any type of service.

Round Rock Honda is a good model for what dealerships should strive to be. They are an excellent example of good will and fair dealing in all the departments we've experienced. We recommend them, and hope their excellence in all aspects continues for the future. They have continued to honor their commitment to us as the customer, with good service and high quality of operation. For this reason we anticipate our continuing good relationship as repeat customers, and will continue to recommend Round Rock Honda to others.",4.8
170,"September 07, 2011","David Carruthers was very helpful and courteous in the purchase of our 2011 Odyssey. We told him what we wanted and he  made every effort to locate the vehicle with the color and features we preferred. Since Round Rock Honda nor any of the local dealers had what we wanted, he placed an order with Honda in Lincoln, Alabama. When assembly was completed, he notified us to take delivery of the vehicle.

Although there was a waiting period of about four weeks, Mr. Carruthers kept us notified of the assembly progress and furnished an estimated time of when the vehicle would arrive at the Round Rock Dealership.

On the day we came in to take delivery, Mr. Carruthers was completely prepaired to complete all neccessary forms and give a detailed demonstration of the Odyessy's new radio-navigational features. This effort was very helpful and made reading and understanding the instruction manuals much easier. All neccesary paperwork was filed with the State of Texas, and we received our new license plates and title within two weeks. We have had the Odyessey about eight weeks at this writing. The vehicle is an ultimate pleasure to own and drive.

We received exactly what we wanted and the price we wanted to pay. There was no haggle about price. As we felt the price was right, we paid it. We looked at four other dealerships before buying from Round Rock. When the other dealers told us their prices, we just walked out.",5.0

172,"August 25, 2011","Last night, I purchased my 4th Honda from this dealership and I'm amazed at how they blow me away EVERY time!! I never dreamed I'd have the car I have now or that a dealership could be so awesome. 2 of my 4 purchases with them were the result of ""let's just go be nosey!"" and BAM - getting into something better than I had before... but the other 2 purchases were emergency situations where an accident had occurred and vehicle totaled... And how they can make a bad experience (wreck) feel SO good/positive is a mystery but they TAKE CARE of YOU at Round Rock Honda. From offering to give me a lift to rental place to going the extra mile and working with my insurance company to EXPIDITE the process of getting me into my new car. This place won me over the very first time I walked in, feathers drooping, thinking they'd prolly laugh me outta there or not be able to help me at all - AND all I can say is that it's been ""RED CARPET TREATMENT"" every time. They make YOU feel special and worth their time & attention and extra special care - regardless of ANYTHING... and that means a LOT to me! They are ALL so welcoming, polite and professional - I just can't say enough. 
I moved from KY to TX in 2005 - literally bringing only myself & my Honda Civic. I had a blow-out where my car ended up going down the road on it's SIDE (driver's side) and then back on all fours again... windows/tires busted - all a mess - but I walk away with only a few bruises. That led me to research a HONDA dealer close by and I stumbled into Round Rock Honda - not having much hope (worrying about my shabby, post-divorce credit and ALL)... and next thing I know I'm driving off in a new Accord. Later went back (just to be nosey & see what they had) and next thing I know I'm in a new CRV. Drive it & love it for a few yrs. then this past May I got letter about trading in 2009 CRV for 2011 & went to check it out - next thing I'm driving off in my 2nd new CRV... I had JUST made my 3rd payment on her and then this past weekend had a swerve to miss deer accident... hit a concrete culvert straight on at about 55-50mph... airbag deployed... junk dropped DOWN from under hood instead of coming into compartment - JUST like they say it will!! She had to be totaled... but I firmly believe she saved my life! Honda makes a wonderfully SAFE car - I know, I've tested them myself TWICE!! I'm a believer and SO proud to be in the Honda family.. and so lucky to have stumbled into the RIGHT Honda dealership!! So, this leaves us at present where I went back into Honda thinking all kinds of negative and doom/gloom and they have done right by me AGAIN. After the genuine concern expressed over the accident and loss of car - they really did WORK IT for me and make a GOOD thing happen! Now, I'm in another new CRV - and she's loaded... and beautiful... and I'm in LOVE again... I love (and even name) every Honda I've ever had and believe in them. I played with comparing a Dodge Nitro (my rental) to the CRV before making this purchase and was blown away by the safety test results and I feel I'm living proof of it. So, I think my main point here is, if you're thinking about joining the Honda Family - I'll tell you I've NEVER regretted it. It really IS peace-of-mind! And if you're already a Honda Family member and just looking for the right dealership - Round Rock Honda has my 1st & only vote! I came to them when they were still called ""Classic Honda"" and I will continue to stay with them as long as they're there. To me, in this day and time - to create a loyal/repeat customer out of a skeptic like me - is really saying something about how they run their business.. I've always left there smiling ear-to-ear. And Manuel Valdez is THE MAN when it comes to showing you all the ins/outs of a Honda. This purchase will make my 3rd CRV purchase and I'll be darned if ""Manny"" didn't show me something about them last night that no-one had showed me yet and that I didn't know! Come to find out, he was the salesman who sold me first car at Round Rock Honda - when I had 1st wreck and he got me into my Accord. The salespeople for all my other purchases were awesome as well - BUT after dealing with Manny again on my last purchase - I've realized he has something going on that you don't see everyday - he really does go the extra mile and he's genuine/sincere in his quest to get you in a car you'll love! And the business manager that helped me out (Michael Hiler) was downright AWESOME as well... this group will tell you the truth - not jerk you around - you can trust them and relax. Perfect ending would be to say I'm not the most social person and tend to get nervous about situations - like buying a car! - but each time I've entered that building a little nervous - it takes literally less than 1 minute for me to forget I'm scared/nervous because they are SO kind and you greeted by practically everyone upon entering... even if they aren't the one who's helping you - everyone is SO friendly and always making sure you're getting the help you need. I always walk away feeling like I've just left a big family reunion - it's that kind of good vibe thing they have perfected! I want to THANK all the people at Round Rock Honda who've helped me over the years with my purchases... I would recommend to anyone.

173,"August 08, 2011","Paul sold us the model we wanted at the price we wanted.  No suggestions for add-ons that we were not interested in.  I've had the car for 14 months now.  One very nice thing is the care Paul took to initiate us to the use of the car.  In a schooled, intentional, succinct way, he led us through important information about using this model.  One nice touch that I appreciate everyday was Paul's setting the radio stations in ascending order, according to my tastes.  That gesture has probably prevented accidents because there's no problem finding the stations I need.

Best of all, the car works wonderfully and the service we have received at approproprate mile check-ups from Round Rock Honda has been well-priced, well-done and best of all, fast.",5.0
174,"June 02, 2011","Hello, my name is  and I recently purchased a 2011 Honda Civic si from Round Rock Honda.  Now that the formalities are out of the way I shall tell you of my whimsical journey into that wondrous place most commonly referred to as the, &quot;small to mid size sedan marketplace.&quot;  Aaah yes, I knew that I would have my opportunity to tell you of those individuals who did not help me and tell you of those individuals who DID help me:  for you see I live in Austin, Texas, and there are several Honda dealerships located within Austin, Texas; consequently, Round Rock Honda was my last stop.  First my Father and I went to First Texas Honda--which was a horrible experience because the finance manager was absolutely UNWILLING to negotiate--his demeanor flirted with rudeness (however the salesman over there who helped me, I believe his name is Nick Rhodes, was very polite and respectful).  Thus, we went to a second dealership, I believe that it was Howdy Honda.  Overall my experience with them was good, but the salesman there asked me for my Social Security Number, which I foolishly gave to him, and later learned at Round Rock Honda that, that is a practice which is not entirely legal.  I believe the salesman who took my Social Security Number is named Courtney.  Alas, we have arrived at Round Rock Honda.  I had been searching all day for a civic si, and low and behold Round Rock Honda had one.  It was absolutely beautiful--the only one left on the lot.  Red with the rear spoiler and exhaust--needless to say I love it.  As soon as we walked into Round Rock Honda I could tell that business was done a little differently there: they were better staffed and gave off a much more professional appearance than both of the other dealerships combined.  We were immediately asked if we had been helped as soon as we walked into the showroom (and the individual who asked us was not even a salesman!).  Shortly thereafter we were introduced to Sophia Wingfield.  I would like to say this--she is the reason why my Father and I bought that car from Honda.  She informed me that she had been a Honda employee for 12 years and that she truly believed in the product (for she herself drives a Honda); subsequently, we took the civic for a test drive, and after some negotiating, the car was mine.  I really feel as though Sophia deserves some kind of a promotion, for she is truly a loyal employee, for I wouldn't be surprised if she bleeds Honda blue, lol.  But seriously, that entire operation over there in Round Rock should be your flagship for the entire region--they definitely are a cut above.  But I would just like to reiterate my appreciation for Sohpia Wingfiled's professionalism and courtesy.  I believe that it takes a certain type of individual to recognize that they are, at once both a representative of themselves and a representative of the conglomerate they work for:  needless to say Ms. Wingfield understands this. Thus, due to her helpfulness and courtesy Round Rock Honda has secured a lifetime customer.  You're probably asking yourself, 'why is this individual going to such great lengths to profess his profound appreciation for Round Rock Honda?'  The answer is simple, when we left Howdy Honda things looked grim, but when we arrived at Round Rock Honda things started to look up:  you see I wanted that si soooo bad, I mean I go to the University of Texas, I want a car that has some kick in it, and everyone else just kept giving excuses as to why they didn't have it in stock.  And those excuses are reasonable given the horrific magnitude of the Tsunami, but these guys on the ground in Austin, Texas made it happen.  And they were extremely polite and respectful--and Round Rock Honda had waaaay more foot traffic than the other two places combined!!!  So anyway, to conclude, I just want to show my appreciation to Sophia Wingfield, because this really didn't take up much of my time.  Also, it would behoove whomever sees this to supply Round Rock Honda with the best inventory and the most resources, because let's face it Texas is a good place to do business--and they are the best.  Also, the finance manager named Tom who helped me out was extremely polite and respectful as well, and I noticed his appreciation ring that he wears on his finger for his 20 years or so of Honda service.  You guys should retain him as well, he definitely knows what he's doing.  Oh yeah, and I read your warnings, so follow up with me if you want to, I will be more than willing to answer any and all questions.",5.0
175,"May 30, 2011","Please be wary of this place. Some of the salesman is cons. 
In my negotiation with salesman the total price was to have included 100k 5 yr warranty. The MSRP was 23175 and the price with warranty was 23678. I was promised over a $600 under MSRP and a good deal with warranty extension
Now for the following I have myself to blame because I did not look closely until about 1hr after getting home. But when I got home I saw that I was charged 23678 for the base and 1450 for the warranty. 
I went back and had to fight hard to get them to fix this but was stuck with MSRP.  Because they could only find 2 of the 4 negotiation paper work and they conveniently were missing the one where 23678 included the warranty. 
I was saved only by the fact that what was in the numbers did not make sense or add up and that they had claimed to be a no haggle dealership (obvious lie but I did fine where it was advertised).
I would have cancelled the contract all together BUT in doing my research it was unlikely that I could have implemented the 3day rule.
Now I will be rating them at the lowest possible when i fill the customer service. And if anyone knows that will put pressure and probably hurt then more than the con attempt

The Pilot gave its life (totalled out) to save mine.  I already loved that vehicle, but now that it had also proven its safety features, I definitely wanted another Pilot.

I planned to purchase a pre-owned Pilot, but I decided to see what kind of a deal I might get on a new one from Round Rock Honda.  I had aready purchased 4 vehicles from them and they have always been good to work with.

I enjoyed working with Tony Dismute. His first priority was to ease the difficulty of my immediate situation: struggling to get a vehicle ASAP after my accident. He worked with his supervisor and very quickly came back with a good price on a new 2011 Pilot. I needed a little more time to crunch the numbers, since I had been expecting to get a pre-owned vehicle.

The next day I decided the deal was too good to pass up, so I called Tony and set up an appointment. I didn't realize that he was coming in on his day off, just to make things more convenient for me. He had everything set up when I got there and I was in and out faster than ever before.

I've had my new Pilot for over a week now. I love it. And I'm thankful to Tony and Round Rock Honda for helping me through a difficult situation so painlessly, and giving me a great deal.

Yes 3 years with Manual not giving up, not harassing but just being kind and following up letting him know he is there when he is ready! This is a trait you don't find in most car salesman and I want everyone to know how happy I have been with the service I have received from ""Manual"". After 2 cars and having 4 family members plus friends buy this is truly a family dealership. Super excited to have another Toyota (I have a 1997 4 Runner) (and a 2008 Honda Civic..) Thank you ""MANUAL"" (AKA MANNY) ""ROUND ROCK HONDA/TOYOTA SALES"" for continuing to treat me and my family like we belong and our business is appreciated! I don't drive 65+ miles for nothing!

202,"September 16, 2010","My husband and I were welcomed from the moment we arrived by all staff members. Our sales rep, Sophia was friendly, fun and took customer service to a whole new level. We purchased a vehicle from RR Honda several years ago and have since referred family and friends to Sophia.  

When we arrived, we were impressed at how friendly and upbeat the entire staff was. We told Sophia what we were looking for.  She checked the inventory and took us out.  It was another hot day in Texas so Sophia took the time to start the cars that we were interested in looking at so that the cars would cool down before we test drove them.  Sophia was so knowledgeable about the cars and was able to answer all of our questions. 

Upon making our selection to proceed with the purchase.  We were very please with the outcome of the price negotiation.  Management worked with us to deliver a fair and reasonable price without a hassle.  

We arrived at the dealership fairly late but we never felt rushed.  Tom was the business manager that took care of our financing needs.  The interest rate was awesome and much better than we expected. We ran into an insurance issue towards the end of the deal.  Tom offered suggestions and patiently helped us work through it. 

This was really the best car buying experience we've had.  We really liked how the entire staff worked so well together.  It was obvious that customer service is RR Honda's number 1 priority. ",5.0

211,"August 21, 2010","We wasted our time going doing online research through the website and using the Black Book trade appraisal tool which is apparently endorsed by the dealership because they provide a link and send the appraisal report to the dealership upon completion. Although the report says they price may fluctuate based on the vehicle condition or the current market rates, we were seriously low-balled because the dealership felt they couldn't sell our vehicle on their lot (a Chevy Tahoe). That has nothing to do with either the condition of our vehicle nor the market value of it. In addition to that, after driving 45 minutes each way, the moment we walked into the dealership, someone else was test driving and ultimately purchased the only vehicle we wanted. When asked about finding another, we were told it would require a deposit!?!? Are you joking? A deposit for something I can do myself? In addition, during the initial phone call with the salesman, he told us he could sell the vehicle for a whopping $550 less than MSRP. That's a pretty sad ""clearance"" sale if that's the most you can come off the MSRP for last year's model. I received an email from another salesman after completing the vehicle appraisal that happened to contain a quote for the vehicle we wanted and it was apparently already less if you purchased from him instead.",3.0

We first stopped at Round Rock Honda thinking we probably will go to the other two dealers as well to find a good deal. In the showroom we met sales person Terry Doan who was very warm and genuine. After Terry learned about our accident and that we preferred an SUV he gave us a thorough introduction of all the safety features the new CR-V model has. Then he was very patient with us for test drive and color selection. Terry didn't push for up-sells and gave us a good price. The paperwork was fast and we were on our way back with our new CR-V in less than two hours! 

Now, one and half year later, we are still enjoying our CR-V very much. My wife drives it to work and I drive it during weekends for shopping etc. The drive is always smooth and the maintenance services at Classic Honda couldn't be better.

I have always been treated in a courteous, professional manner, not only by the sales and finance departments, but every employee that has helped me, either in person or over the phone.  I researched my purchases well before going to the dealership.  Manuel Valdez facillitated two of the sales and financing with fair and competative prices and interst rates.  I have been so impressed with the Roundrock Auto Group team that I have refered several friends and family, who have also bought their new cars from Mr. Valdez.  He even took time out of his busy day to take a friend of mine for a test drive in a car that she had told him she had no intention of buying, but thought that is would be fun to drive.

He said he would be in the office in the morning and just to come in and he would help us with the car we wanted.  When we arrived he let us take another test drive and asked if we had made a decision and we had.  It only took two visits to his supervisor to confirm the pricing we wanted, this was about 10-15 minutes.  He then offered us some food they had since it was the 4th of July holiday while we waited for the paperwork to be put together.  Bill Owens walked us through all the warranty options and then finalized all the paperwork which also took around 10-20 minutes.  Terry then walked us around and showed us the service area.  He then went over all the books he gave us and then answered any questions we had about the options on the vehicle and how they worked.  I had a very nice experience and I am very happy with my car.

You will find their prices to be very competitive (always lowest price on my three cars)and the service is out of this world.  Yes the service is also very competitive but where they separate themselves from many service departments is that they are very honest and reliable.  No surprises that majority of their staff has been there as long as I have been doing business at Classic/Round Rock Honda.

I generally dislike the car buying process, but my Salesperson Terry, his manager and Bill the finance guy, made the process smooth and easy.

235,"May 07, 2010","In my opinion, Round Rock Honda is an exemplary Dealership. No car is of much value, unless Competent Service is readily available,  RR Honda provides quality serviice at reasonable prices.  After each service, someone from that department goes over the service invoice with you, explaining what service was provided and the charge. Should the customer have any questions, the service persons listens attentively and provides you with a godd answer. Serveral times we have had questions and ""Josh"" has come from service and answered to our complete satisfaction. The ""Service"" is always thourough and to our satisfaction.
Walking into ""Honda"" is always pleasant. As you enter the front door, you are frequently greeted by a lady by the name of Robbie Travis.  She frequently calls you by name and listens as the customer explains their needs. She is a true ""Greeter"" and starts you off on a good footing. Additionally, Mr. Cutis Salter, the General Manager, offers a friendly greeting.  Mr. Salter does a good job as the General Manager.
We have never left this agency, withou feeling ver confident of our business dealing.  Whenever we need a different or newer vehicle, our first thought is,""What will David Carruthers at Round Rock Auto have to offer.  It is always a pleasue to recommend David to other propective customers.

Living in Houston and purchasing a car in Austin says something about her...she is true to what she believes in and has always been an advocate for her customers. ,5.0
