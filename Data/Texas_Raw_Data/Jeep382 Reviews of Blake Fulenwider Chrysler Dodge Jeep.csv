24,"September 12, 2019",We just went in to look to see what would best fit us. 3 1/2 hours later we were driving off the lot in our brand new car! Super thankful they could get us in a new car big and safe enough for our soon to come baby! ,4.8

 The service department  is doing a great job!  They are highly recommended !!",5.0
28,"September 08, 2019","I've never had an issue with service or the quality of service at the dealership. The only blip last time was the cost and the fact that air pressure wasn't checked or corrected to the proper level. As far as the air pressure goes I always periodically manually check the air pressure rather than trust the electronics, and since I have a compressor I adjust it myself as needed. I was just surprised since I had the tires rotated that it wasn't done. As for the price that's another story since a different company was advertising full synthetic oil change, free tire rotation, etc. for $44.95 instead of the $109.00 I paid for the oil change and the charged for the tire rotation. I paid $29.99 for an oil change when I had my 2016 Ram 2500. I already knew they sold packages for oil changes. However, some dealerships have deals making the packages not necessary. As a senior citizen on a fixed income one must always look for the best deal or where one can save the most money. I guess when it gets time for the next oil change I will have to shop around.      ",3.8
29,"September 06, 2019",The dealership was very helpful in getting me exactly what I needed and handled everything quickly and patiently. They even set me up with a loaner car since i lived 2 hrs away. I would definitely go back to that dealership again. ,5.0

The atmosphere is so friendly and no one attempted to push us towards anything we did not want. A+++ and we will recommend to others and be back in the future! ",5.0
31,"September 05, 2019","Made appointment for inspection and oil change but when I arrived only had me down for oil change then they offered to rotate tires also and I agreed if it wouldn't take to long because I had another appointment but it ended up making me late but service was good other then the usual oil spilled in spots under hood.

44,"August 13, 2019","This is the second vehicle that we have purchased from Blake Fulenwider Dodge in Clyde. We had the vehicle for 3 weeks before we took it back due to the power steering being out. After the service center looked at it, they determined what was wrong was not covered under warranty, which is fine. We got with our insurance to get the problem fixed. They stated Blake’s labor prices were too high. Knowing it would be hard for us to drive the vehicle somewhere else, & the fact we are returning customers, the service center seemed uninterested in their customer’s best interest in making sure the work remained under warranty. The vehicle has less that 1k miles & needs to stay under manufacturer warranty. They were unwilling to attempt to keep a loyal customer. We will not be returning to Blake Fulenwider for the purchase of future vehicles nor service. ",1.0

68,"July 16, 2019","I was driving back to Midland from a trip to Dallas (loaded with food items from shopping) when I noticed it was getting very hot in my car.  Once I realized that the a/c wasn't working, I started trying to find a Jeep dealership that could help me.  

I called one in Abilene and was told they couldn't do anything until the next day!  I called Blake-Fulenwider which was in Eastland (a long way from where I was) and spoke to Forrest in the service department.  He was so kind and helpful.  He told me that the dealership in Clyde would be closer and even called to set it up for me!  When I got to the Clyde dealership, I was met by a smiling helpful young man who took me to meet Glen in the service department.  

Glen was great!  He took all my information, got me into the cool waiting room, and went to work.  They had the problem resolved in about an hour.  I was so impressed and thankful.  I made it home and none of the food had even spoiled.


I feel very fortunate to have encountered such thoughtful and caring people.  The managers of both the dealerships in Eastland and Clyde should be very proud of the people they have working for them.

124,"May 04, 2019","Initial buying experience was great, Steve was very helpful and good to work with. Bought a warranty for tires and had to replace two of them within the first 2 weeks of purchase. Not a big deal but it was over a month and multiple phone calls before I was reimbursed.  I then realized my driver's side headlight was loose. When I went to tighten it up, I found extensive damage to the brackets that held it in place, leading me to believe that this truck was involved in a collision.  I was told that this truck was entirely owned by Blake Fulenwider, so I was disappointed that it was an issue in the first place, especially since it wasn't listed in the Carfax report.  Then I shelled out 600 in labor charges to have my exhaust repaired which I'm pretty sure was also a pre existing issue.  What started out as a good and happy experience went South rather fast.  I have a lot of thinking to do before I'd consider my next purchase here.  ",2.8

I've gone from a service department saying, ""we don't know what else to do"" to one saying ""let's at least keep trying"".  Rick Ann has been professional and genuinely concerned about my problem.  The techs have also been invested in finding a solution.  I'm not sure if it's the small town mentality, but I like the effort I've seen.  While my issue is not yet resolved, I don't have the feeling I have been abandoned.   ",4.6

Left facility and drove approx. 3 miles in light mist and turned on wipers only to have a 4 inch strip on passenger windshield not wiped. Pulled over checked wiper blade to find same size tare in blade. Looked at service report showed large number of items including wiper blades to be in good condition. Returned immediately to facility and pointed this out and expressed my feeling to management that how can I trust any of these items were actually checked.

He also stated many times the fact that we did not purchase the vehicle from him, why does this matter? you sure did not have issue selling me a $3500 warranty policy and taking my money. and your a jeep dealer that claims to have excellent service? this dealer has done nothing but lie.....

He understood my unique situation and handled it professionally.  He explained everything in great detail.  I've used Blake Fulenwider CDJ two or three times for oil changes and Jonathan was actually the service adviser both times.  This dealership has at least two GREAT service advisers.  Brandon Dodson, the service tech who changed my oil was very knowledgeable about my car's engine and took the time to explain the needed repair in layman's terms so I could understand it just as Glenn had done.  I really appreciate the kind and prompt service as I travel for my work as a Petroleum Landman.  Sometimes I have work and sometimes I am laid off so I have to watch every dime I spend plus when I'm working I'm never at home. Glenn understands my unique situation.  If I lived within an hour of this dealership, I would use it for all my service and repair needs.

I had to take vehicle back for same problem only to be told by service manager the mechanic did not hear sound or they did not see the problem until they tore into it.  The problem with this is I could hear the exhaust acting up why couldn’t they.  

The service department did fix one side then returned vehicle to me and I had to take it back.  They did make it right by checking and fixing the other side, but in my opinion it should have been checked before I picked up the vehicle.  I rely on my vehicle to get to and from places especially work, I had to get another car (for 3 days) for them to fix the first side and then the next week find a ride to work only to take my truck back.  

I am thankful the service department made the situation right and fixed it with no problems, but I really wish they would be mindful of customers who turn their vehicle in for service especially to fix them right the first time around.

381,"August 13, 2013","2006 Dodge Mega Cab with 62,000 miles...Initially when I took the truck in to find out why the A/C wasn't cold, the service welcome was lukewarm at best.  The service ""rep"", Jake, didn't call me after three days so I called him to find out the status of the repairs.  THEY knew the Freon had leaked out but didn't know where the leak was yet.  I got a lot of excuses about WHOEVER worked on my truck in the past, which was THEM, had not put things back together right.  I find that excuse REALLY hard to believe because the A/C worked four years before the compressor went out n I had it replaced n it worked fine for a couple of years. Then the A/C began just cooling on the driver but not in any of the passenger areas.  Then it stopped cooling completely after having my oil changed at the Eastland service department n asked them to check the Freon.  BOTTOM LINE I WAS TOLD THREE DIFFERENT TIMES OVER A 3.5 WEEK TIME PERIOD MY TRUCK WAS REPAIRED n paid a total of $2700.  When I contacted the GM & Owner they were both defensive about not being able to fix every problem that comes in.  The GM, Cody Foster, told me it would be best if I take the Truck elsewhere for repairs.  I said that was my intention but I needed a full refund for the what I paid.  He said that wasn't going to happen because THEY did work on my truck.  I hung up n filed a complaint with the BBB, I added my Google comment to the other people who had the same problems with this dealerships service department BUT DID NOT GET THEIR money back.  I shared this whole mess with a dozen or more social media sites.  I know I will get my money back, eventually, even if I have to go to small claims court.  NO ONE should have to go through this type of experience on ONE of the MOST EXPENSIVE items you will buy in your lifetime.  This dealership is NOT service oriented...",1.0
