Suzuki USA has gone out of business in North America....Wonder why?  Let me enlighten you.  Lets start with my car...a 2007 Suzuki XL-7.  The XL-7 was only made for 3 years.  Suzuki was in collaboration with GM on this vehicle and built the drive train and other components for this car.  It turns out there was a major defect in the engine where the heads and timing chains were going out starting about 45K-60K miles.  Because the parts had to replaced with OEM parts (the only ones available), they were destined to go out again since they all had the same manufacturing defect.  None the less, the production on this car was halted after 3 years and Suzuki USA pulled out in 2012.  Guess why?

Now with that said, let’s talk about Expo Suzuki (aka Kingwood Suzuki... who cannot be a Suzuki dealer since Suzuki does not sell cars in North America).  My car, a Suzuki XL-7 with 130,000 started to experience the problem as noted above.  I had the timing chains professionally replaced, but it did not solve the problem.  The car was still running pretty good but I brought it to Expo (because they had Suzuki repair experience) so they could assess the camshafts.  Now remember, the car was running OK at the time I brought it to Expo/Kingwood Suzuki.  I was informed that one of the heads would need to be replaced with a cost of approx. $3500-$4000 for just one head since the head was not capable of being repaired for this type of damage but needed to be replaced.  Also remember, there was another one that could also fail.

OK, here comes the good part....I declined the service and told the service mgr. to reassemble the car as it was not worth this cost.  The service mgr called me and said the car was ready...""and by the way, you now have another problem...your car will overheat and the AC will not work....we can fix that for another $300-$400 additional cost"".  So, who do you think caused this problem....not happening before Expo/Kingwood Suzuki took the car in for a diagnosis.  They caused this and did not want to admit it as it was going to cost them for the repair.  
I picked up the car and barely made it back home. Since I declined this major repair, the service dept, in my opinion, just decided to go ahead and KILL this engine since they were not going to make any more money off of me.  I had to sell this car, for a tremendous loss, to a car wholesaler as both Suzuki USA and Kingwood Suzuki (or whatever they are calling themselves this week) have now put an end to this car for me.  Or otherwise, Kingwood Suzuki but the nails in the coffin and cost me a lot of money.
DON'T BRING YOUR CAR IN FOR ANY TYPE OF SERVICE FROM THIS USED CAR LOT (BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT THEY REALLY ARE) OR EVEN PURCHASE ONE THERE...BETTER YET, JUST STAY AWAY FROM THEM.

1,"February 23, 2015",I went to this they dealership twice two years back to back and each time I left very unsatisfied the service was poor the dealers were very disrespectful and very selfish they were taking lunch breaks while handling my file their only focus was getting my money in spite of putting me into something that I would be happy with they each came in taking turns asking me things that were irrelevant at one point in one of the dealers came in and begin to insult me about my finances and if you're not careful they will put you into something you do not want they had me to test drive one car and once I gave them the OK that I like the car they pulled around another car and typed up paperwork on it and try to sell it to meI have never been treated so poorlybut I should have known based on all the people that went in and came out very dissatisfied eat salesman that came into the office where I was were very rude and disrespectful I will never try to do business there ever again viewers please beware there are other places that will treat you properly and put you into something you will love it's your money so you should be happy with whatever it is that you purchase and is also your right to be treated fairly and with respect they need you you don't need them,1.0
2,"September 25, 2014",They were horrible to deal with and sold me a car three times the worth!!! I found out my gmc was a salvaged title!!! It was horrible to get insurance for and I'm begging you do not go they're so unprofessional and didn't have anything together. And when I purchased the car they couldn't even clean it and when I complained the managers son did nothing!  ,1.8
3,"September 17, 2012","I got a GREAT deal! The employees were really friendly and they took their time with my deal to make sure I got the absolute best price!They treated me like family and Armando Jr. was a great salesman. He didn't haggle me for a downpayment or to even purchase a vehicle. I got a 2011 Chevy Malibu with 5,000 miles on it for $15,000! Great DEAL! I pay 300 a month with gap included, my choice. I didn't have any credit and I didn't need a co-signer. I didn't have to pay a downpayment either!! Recommend it to all buyers looking for a car! Tell them Jennifer sent you!",5.0
