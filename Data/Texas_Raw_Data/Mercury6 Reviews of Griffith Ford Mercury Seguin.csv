2,"August 01, 2018","Our experience thus far with this dealership has been lackluster at best. It started with our initial visit to the dealership (an hour away) to look at a car that was listed online. We called before we headed out; leaving our young son with a babysitter so we could keep the process a little less stressful. 
Upon arriving at the dealership we were told that the car was in fact not there at all. It had supposedly been lent out to another customer without the knowledge of the manager or anyone else. Later we were told that not only was it not there but it had been driven all the way up to the DFW area.
After some convincing we decided to go ahead and work on the paperwork with them to see if we could come to an agreement on the price of the vehicle and the value of our trade before we went any further. We came to an agreement on the finances, the things that needed to be fixed and that they would deliver the car to us first thing on Monday when the other customer was supposed to return the car. We didnâ€™t take delivery of the car until Thursday or Friday of that week after a wasted trip of the salesman to our home with the car in filthy, unkempt state, apparently directly off its trip to DFW.
This was all back in November of last year! While they have made good on the easier/cheaper stuff that needed fixed, we have been given the run around on fixing the hail damage on the roof since then. It was all in the contract! Calls and texts have gone unanswered for close to probably 6 months now.",1.6

4,"June 14, 2010","tHIS DEALERSHIP IS WILLING TO WORK WITH YOU......iF YOU FEEL A MAINTENANCE PRICE QUOTE IS A BIT HIGH THEN ASK FOR IT TO BE RECONSIDERED.  i'VE DONE THIS SEVERAL TIMES AND HAVE HAD THEM REDUCE MY BILL BY 10%. tHE SAN MARCOS DEALER IS VERY GOOD AND IS WILLING TO ACCOMODATE YOU NO MATTER THE PROBLEM.  THEY WILL EVEN WORK ON NON FORD VEHICLES....A PLUS WHEN YOU DON'T LIKE A LOT OF RUNNING AROUND.

PLUS THEY HAVE AN OWNER ADVANTAGE PROGRAM THAT REBATES YOU A PERCENTAGE OF YOUR LAST BILL....IT'S SUBTRACTED FROM YOU NEXT BILL AND YOU CAN LET IT ADD UP.  MY LAST BILL THERE WAS 64.00 AND I HAD 21 DOLLARS IN THE REBATE ACCOUNT.....SO MY ACTUAL BILL
WAS 43 BUCKS....NOT BAD AT ALL.  I LIVE 52 MILES AWAY FROM THE SAN MARCOS DEALERSHIP
AND IT'S ALWAYS CHEAPER FOR ME TO GET MY F250 SERVICED THERE ( EVEN COUNTING FUEL
COSTS ).

THEY MAY BE A SMALL NON FANCY DEALERSHIP BUT THEY ARE AT THE TOP WHEN IT COMES TO SERVICE.",5.0
