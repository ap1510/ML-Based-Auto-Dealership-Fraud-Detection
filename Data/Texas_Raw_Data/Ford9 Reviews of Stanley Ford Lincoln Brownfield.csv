0,"October 18, 2019","We bought a vehicle here.  First of all, when my husband went to pick it up, they had loaned it out to someone.  The truck was already in my husband’s name and covered by our insurance.  He had to drive a couple of hours to pick it up.  It was muddy and dirty.  There was even mud under one of the seats.  He hasn’t had it even a month and it’s broken down.  Of course, it’s not covered by the warranty.  It’s going to cost over $2000 to fix. Stanley Ford didn’t try at all to lessen the cost or help.   You would think if someone spent $50,000 on a vehicle that they could count on it lasting at least a month.  Even back alley tote the note places would make it right if the vehicle didn’t last a month——- Not Stanley Ford.  Fair warning to anyone looking here for a vehicle.",1.0

3,"November 24, 2017","I purchased my Ford truck new at Stanley Ford Brownfield approximately two years ago  and have always had it serviced there.  I also brought my son's Ford there to have the tires replaced. Their management, technicians, sales, and service staff have always been courteous, professional, and helpful. I have not included everyone's name here since I have been to the location so many times, but I have had excellent results from my visits there.",5.0

6,"July 13, 2016",We did a ton of research and shopping around talking to different dealerships before deciding on Stanley Ford. Lisa was very helpful and up front with us. She would answer the many questions we had promptly and never seemed annoyed or bothered by our questions. We did much of our talking through email due to being out of town a lot and this didn't bother her either. Many places were very pushy about scheduling an appointment to come look before giving us pricing or calling on the phone but Lisa was amazing! We bought a new ford from her and are extremely happy! We drove 45 minutes rather than staying in Lubbock. The prices and rebates were great and Lisa did all that she could to get us the best price  possible. My mom lives 3 hours away and may come here to shop at Stanley Ford in Brownfield because of how pleasant our experience was. ,5.0
7,"March 24, 2015",We are so thankful to have found great people to purchase our car from.  We purchased a used vehicle and they have went above and beyond to deliver the best for us.  We had one small thing that needed to be taken care of service wise and were met with top notch service!  From our mechanic to the service desk... the sales team - Daniel and Joe... Mr. Vannoy... you just can't get any better than these guys.  ,5.0
8,"July 28, 2014","I felt I was among fiends dealing with  the staff at Stanley, especially Triellis Stewart.  He was friendly and low pressure, really none at all.  He brought me each vehicle to look at and drive.  Always  there to answer my questions.  

When negotiating the sales price it come down to my vehicles value.  Although I wanted more, the person I was dealing with, don't remember his name, took time to show me how he arrived at the value.  He even showed me his research.  I appreciate their openeness and honesty.  

I hate to buy cars, but Triellis and the rest of the staff made it a pleasure.
