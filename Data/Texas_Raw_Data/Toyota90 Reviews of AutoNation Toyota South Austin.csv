0,"June 27, 2020","I have bought 5 brand new cars from different dealers in the last 11 years of buying new vehicles, and have dealt with multiple dealers of multiple makes and models during the shopping process, and by far, AutoNation Toyota South Austin is THE WORST.  I stopped in to test drive a vehicle, and the gentleman that helped me said he would have to ask his manager.  Since when do you have to ask a manager to test drive a vehicle?  He left to go into the building while i stayed outside (social distancing and all) And after waiting about 15 minutes, i walked inside to see what the deal was.  His manager came out and had the absolute audacity to tell me that they are working on an appointment only model and that i would have to make an appointment just to TEST DRIVE a vehicle.  I say audacity because the salesfloor WAS ABSOLUTELY EMPTY and there were salespeople sitting outside, under a tree, shooting the breeze!  Obviously me being there was enough to ruin their day and upset them, and CLEARLY i was a bother to interrupt their BUSY day.  Its a shame too, im actually in the market to buy a vehicle and i would have purchases today if it were not for this situation.  Absolutely horrible customer service and i will not recommend them to ANYONE.  Ill refer my friends to Charles Maund or Toyota of Cedar Park first.

1,"April 20, 2020","The day before I visited Capital Cheverolet I explained everything I wanted and that I wanted to stick withing a budget. Salesman was very pushy from begining, spent most of his time with me bragging about his experience and then found a vehicle and had me put down a 5004 deposit well that was without even running my credit, left here went back the next day told him i recanted,went to Toyota spoke with Cate explained my situation she was very honest and forthcoming from the begining not showing me anything i did not feel i could afford, Capital Chevy was not even willing to talk numbers just deposit, after 30 mins Cate came back with her manger he told me he could get the deal down and withing 2 hrs I was done with a big bow on a 2020 Corrolla with only 15 miles!!!",5.0
2,"December 13, 2019","I saw a vehicle online late Tuesday night and reserved via their website for a 3 day hold. I set an appointment for Wednesday morning to at 10am to see the vehicle. I called at 930 to make sure the vehicle was there and was told by Keston  it was still in service until 6pm. I made another appointment to see the vehicle at 6pm. I called at 530 pm to make sure it was available and was told it need more work and wouldnt be available until Saturday at 3pm. I made another appointment for Saturday at 3pm. I get a text from Keston at 530 friday night that another customer was coming in to by the vehicle site unseen. I proceeded to call and text Keston and remind him that I had placed a reservation on the vehicle. I neither called me back or texted me back. I called and spoke with a manager named Todd and explained to him that I had a hold on the vehicle and was waiting to see it. He started to explain that he didnt show a record of the hold. When I told him  I have the email showing the hold he magically saw it. He then stated someone was on their way down to purchase it. I told him nobody gave me the option to put a deposit or purchase it sight unseen. i told him I could be there in 15 minutes to put a deposit or  purchase the vehicle. He stated the person was already on their way.  He said he was gonna call the general manager and see what he wanted to do and call me back in 5 minutes later. 40 minutes later he called and stated he couldn't get a hold of the GM and was gonna sell to another person despite my appointment and reservation. This is the tye of greed at this place. Won't honor a reservation on a vehicle. Don't waste your time with this dealership. Please go ahead Todd and Keston and try to dispute any of these facts. Keston has the worst follow up. I had to keep calling him or else I would of been driving to your dealership multiple times for nothing. You screwed me out a vehicle. I passed on other vehicles to look at this one and kept me on the hook for 3 days and screwed me. My wife and I took off work to look at this vehicle. This is a used Prius for my niece to get to school. Its not a large sale but the Tundra I am in the market for is and I am gonna drive right past this place with a smile when I do.  I have attached a photo of my reservation on the vehicle. Its Friday night currently and my reservation is still good through tomorrow.  No apologies. What a giant waste of time. Feel free to shop here and get a similar experience.

5,"August 23, 2019","I purchased this car with some defects, which they said they would take care of it, after one year of upsetting phone calls and appointment cancellations, they look at car and now they don’t want to fix it because it’s been too long the damage it’s worth about $2,000 dls maybe, they dropped the ball to I wasn’t here, I don’t remember and the salesman it’s been too long I canceled the appointment but it’s been too long.... never going to come back to this place or referring anyone, no way!!!! Rate minus 5 stars ?? ",1.0
6,"June 29, 2019","I will have to warn to stay away from this dealership, they cannot be trusted to honor price agreements and will up prices at the last minute. Don't be afraid to walk off last minute on them and make false verbal agreements, they'd do the same to you.

Sales rep provided me a quote on a Tacoma which I agreed to and so I drove 40 minutes back to their dealership to make a purchase. I go in, confirmed the price verbally, test drive the vehicle then they sit me down to pull a credit check which I was comfortable with as I have near 800 credit. I sign the paper, they run my credit.

THEN they tell me there's a problem, that there's a mistake on the price. They need to charge me another $1500 + $800 for their security package. Normally I would just walk away at this point, but they made this a personal attack on my wellbeing when they made a hard pull on my credit before telling me they're changing the price on me. Not to mention the time it takes to get answers at a dealership.

I am not going to blame the sales representative since they can only do prices someone else approved. I am blaming AutoNation, a public company that can't take responsibility for its employees actions despite making a net profit of $400+ million a year.

I will also point out that I didn't like the tone of the manager, David, who said I signed the credit check approval papers when I pointed out they already did a credit pull on me. Well of course I signed it, I trusted in the previously agreed price and signed the bloody approval papers to buy the car at that price. Said they won't honor it unless it's on their paper with all prices written down. He then disappears and let's the sales rep do going back and forth again and I get to spend my time sitting there waiting. I budged a bit to add another $500 on the previous price but they were not going to do it.

Petty me is now here having to write bad reviews and will be warning people about them online for the next 2 years because that's how long a hard credit pull stays on my credit report.

You've been warned. Don't be a fool, don't try Autonation.

They will be seeing me again though. I have a lifetime warranty on my Camry'a battery with them. But now I need another place for oil changes.",1.2
7,"May 10, 2019","Initially reached out to the dealership on 4/3 to alleviate an issue, and it has been over one month with nothing but radio silence from them. So please know, if you have a problem, they don't care. They don't follow-up. 

After leasing two cars from Alamo Toyota over a 5 year period, I decided to purchase a brand new truck. I understood that a disposition fee of $300 would apply if I did not finance through TFS. Upon financing the vehicle, the salesperson and sales manager assured me that although the lowest rate was not TFS, they would have my disposition fee waived. 

A few months later, a bill comes in the mail for the full disposition fee. I reached out to Toyota corporate, who forwarded it to Michael Hadley, the Customer Relations Manager. We spoke on 4/3, and he told me he was going to address my concerns and get back to me that week. 

It has now been 5 weeks since we talked, and he has not gotten back to me. I left him numerous voicemails, and he has been too scared to call back. I followed up with Toyota corporate, and got a call from the salesperson the next day, who has no control of alleviating the concern. 

Despicable dealership from top to bottom. Fraudulent charges, deceptive sales practices, and scummy customer service. Shop elsewhere. ",1.0
8,"February 26, 2019","A NOTE FOR THE HIGHER MANAGEMENT AND CUSTOMERS:
Exceptionally poor customer service. So I walked in for an oil change and Nathan (A service advisor) walked up to me to help me out. He gave me the wrong information at first about the pricing (Maybe commissioned service advisory) and then when he realized I knew what I was doing he backed off and changed his statement. I went ahead to verify the information he gave me and in the middle of the conversation I was having with another service advisor (Matt Roberts) he came up and told the Matt Roberts what he told me to avoid any discrepancies (everyone is included in this corruption including the general manager of the service department). Matt Roberts changed his mind and led me to the wrong direction again. Somehow I agreed to get it done through Matt roberts but in the middle of the paperwork he said you need the complimentary car wash as well as you want to apply the $10 coupon (that I searched online and brought in) in a disrespectful  manner and also to degrade me. I assume the coupon and the car wash were for the customers to avail but it seemed otherwise at this dealership. I went back to the manager after this happened and explained him the whole situation (Nathan's and Matt Robert's) and in return he asked me if I wanted to get the service done or not. 
This made one point clear. It was neither Matt's nor Nathan's fault. It's the store manager who doesn't care about earning business or customer service. Maybe his manager is the same. I don't know how long the chain is but there definitely is a bad guy in the chain. P.s as I walked in the general manager's office he was calming down another customer who was pissed off because of customer service issue (From what I understand, no one took car of him/her when he/she pulled in to be taken care of). I think the Manager's only job is to pacify customers having issues with the service and the service advisor's only job is to make money for the dealership anyhow.
I have never been disappointed on someone this much. This is not what TOYOTA/LEXUS stand for. The stand by their customers and their quality cars. This dealership should get some lessons from Sewell Lexus or any sewell dealership. Unfortunately, sewell doesn't have a location in Austin.",1.0
9,"December 28, 2018","I recently bought a Certified Toyota at a dealership in San Antonio.  When the car got delivered I realized the the interior light was not working.  Closer inspection showed that the bulb was missing.  So I had three choices
1] Return to San Antonio
2] Buy a bulb myself and replace
3] Visit this dealership and explain the problem.

When I got to the dealership I initially talked to service person Mark Annabelli.  He checked with another service person and they said they could not do anything.  I asked Mark if you could ask a supervisor or manage if they could do anything.  He then happily approached the service manager Keith Hennessy and explained the situation.  After explaining they couldn't really do anything, he then reconsidered and told Mark to just take care of giving me a replacement bulb to install.

My experience does not seem like so much of a big deal but these days customer centric service is not really a common thing.

I would just like to say thanks to Mark and Keith for providing great customer service when they actually did not have to do anything.  They did their dealership and Toyota right by acting in this way.

Regards,

10,"December 08, 2018","Every time I take my truck in for my warranty services it takes them a minimum of three hours and that is with an appointment. This time they flat out ripped me off. When I dropped my truck off for a balance, rotate and alignment, I had pressure washed the tires the day before because it had been sunk in the mud, I told tony from the service department that if the tires needed further cleaning that I would do it myself. But instead they had or of their service guys clean them and charged me 400 dollars. Absolute con job",1.6
11,"November 23, 2018","I got good experience in this shop 3 years ago. But 2 days ago when I was trying to buy new car, they were my 1st choice in mind, but as I assume many shops are also good enough, I did my part and called all other stores including autonation before go personally to autonation first based on previous good experience.    After look at the car, test it, check all features, now time for negotiation the price and as I know the minimum price around, I was targeting reach to same deal or little above it.  I put down my price and waited for the sales manager to start the negotiation.   But the big shock was waiting for me.
I never imagine there are sales manager that could make you hate the place more than the one I met.  The guy told me, are you free today?.... my time is valuable, I don't want to waste it....  when I mentioned the price in mind and already get offer for it, he told me in sarcastic way “if I give you my money, can you get me such car with this price”.         I felt really down, but why you say that to me.  the negotiation part was within 5 min, I am the customer ready to make a deal, I am your customer who did a deal with you 3 years ago and I didn't think twice to come to you first, why speak in bad way, bad body language!!  After all negative talk from his side and I am fully calm try to understand what is going on and pop up my price to the price already offered to me (Note the price in mind was just $1000 below the existing price), in the middle of his negative talk and before I reply: the guy shake hands and turn around and left me in the middle of the store shocked.   
The guy has no idea about good customer service or sales, no idea about be nice person and respect customer, no idea about negotiation the price with old customer that you need at least to maintain.  I am not frustrated because no deal, or he didn't accept my offer; I am frustrated because he insult me and make it impossible to stop by again.  On the opposite side, all other Toyota and other car dealers shops are still contacted me and all of them saying we need your business with full respect.   
I don't recommend Autonation because of this sale manager there (one of them, I don't judge all) is really horrible and will show you no respect with his wards and body language.",1.2
12,"April 24, 2018","I went to dealership to purchase a vehicle after researching the website. Every vehicle that I was interested in was suddenly unavailable however; there were a few that were available however; they cost about $5,000.00 more than I vehicles I was interested in. So the up-selling begins...

I purchased a Certified Pre-Owned Vehicle, that was anything but a CPO. I had issues right from
the start. The dealership was not willing to work with me regarding my options. Needless to say I took my business else where.

Sales Manager David Valdez, is very rude and unprofessional. He uses high pressure sells techniques and does not listen to the needs of the customer. He only cares about the sell vehicles and not the customer. 

Luis Castillaja is only interested in making the highest profit for the company no matter the cost the consumer. Up sell, up sell,  Up sell.

Toyotas are great  however; this dealership is the worst. Be careful.",1.0
13,"September 01, 2017","I have to say, I am terribly disappointed....my family and I just left Houston because we are unable to get to our home due to the flood. We borrowed a friends truck to get here and need to return it at some point. We came in, checkbook in hand, ready to buy only to be told that all prices were non-negotiable. The reason? Because people from Houston would need vehicles and they would actually be raising their prices.....

17,"January 13, 2017","About 6 months ago I was looking into getting my first vehicle on my own, I went to AutoNation after doing some research and seeing good reviews on this dealership. I found a vehicle that I liked on their website and went in for a viewing. The vehicle that was listed online was a 2007 Toyota Highlander Hybrid Limited after viewing and test driving the vehicle I decided I liked it and would apply, by this time it was already late so they allowed me to take the vehicle for the night. I came back the next day to find out that their finance department had lost my application and any other information I had provided them. I spent about 6 hours that day in the lobby waiting for them to finish my paper work every time I would ask how much longer the would say ""only a few minutes"". When it came to the end of the day my paper work was finally finished and I was ready to sign and leave since I had spent the whole day waiting! A few weeks later I was made aware that my vehicle was not a limited vehicle, it did not have grey leather interior, a sun roof, or any of the other features a Limited edition vehicle would have. At the time of purchasing I assumed that the dealership knew what they were talking about. I am paying for a limited vehicle! I have the paper work that they First gave me on the vehicle with the VIN number being the same but the description stating limited. When I realized this I had already Had the vehicle about 2 months I went back and brought it to the finance departments attention. I spoke to Darren about the situation and he said he would pass the information on to the Manager and would give me a call when he had any information. I never got a call so I decided to go to the dealership just to be told the manager had been on vacation, I then left and still got no response weeks after. To this day I still have not been contacted. I am paying WAY to much for this vehicle. I went back to the same dealership to get the sell/trade in value and was told   They could only give me $6,000 when 6 months ago I purchased for a little under $12,000 (still in great condition with hardly any miles from the purchase date). They did put the correct discription of the vehicle on the contract, but advertisement and information was false from the beginning!!",1.2

20,"July 24, 2016","I brought my land cruiser to the service department for the 120k service that was a $1500 job. It was a simple service job that involved mostly fluid swaps and a spark plug change. I was promised to have it done in 1 day. When I went to pick it up, they were unable to complete the job. I gave them the chance to make it right and brought it back and was out my vehicle for another full day. Upon my return the second day, I had to wait for a full hour because they couldn't even find my keys or paperwork. Come to find out, the truck was parked all day and nobody touched it, despite me making an appointment and being assured it would be done. In addition, the service advisor ignored all my calls/messages during the day and hung up on my the one time he actually answered the phone. Since I already paid for the work in full, I was forced to bring the vehicle back a 3rd time where they gave me a free detail for the trouble. They were able to complete the work and all seemed well until I picked it up and saw their detailer tore my weather stripping. After a lengthy conversation with Keith, the service manager, i was promised they'd replace the part for free and he'd call me to schedule the install. That was 3 months ago and I've yet to hear anything.

The AutoNation website also had this same car advertised with many pictures depicting this suv as great condition, leather interior, etc.  Both the rep and the sales manager agreed to come off the listed price $500, and also verified it had leather, exact mileage, etc.  When it came down to it, the vehicle was not even there but being loaned out to an individual, so I could not come see it that day.  Took off the afternoon today, got my husband to take several hours off to drive me there only to find that this vehicle had a dent in the bumper and no leather anywhere.

The remainder of the stay led to some consternation. The Finance Manager did not provide reasoning, why he put me on a finance schedule  when I was paying cash or that he did schedule my truck for the first scheduled service.

No matter how bad I felt, I had to catch this Memorial Day deals.  Went to AN, even though it was raining and I have pneumonia, and met a very impressive salesman, Adam Shotwell.  Adam listened to what I wanted, gave me a truck to test drive, then asked me what I could do without in that vehicle. My first statement was ""The Navigation System"".  What an annoying distraction!  This led me to the Texas Edition which was 25% off!  I had to settle for white ( I prefer Red or Green) and a 4 x 4.  This truck didn't have leather and the rear cam, but, they cut me a little deal on those additions, plus I got a nine piece Milwaukee Tool Set.  I returned at a later date to have the leather and rear cam installed.  I asked for a loaner truck, and, without hesitation Adam said sure.  The next day Adam calls me and tells me my truck is ready.  I could hardly wait to see it.  WOW!  What a beautiful job with the leather.

40,"March 20, 2013","The processing of the finance documents bordered on harrasment and almost killed the deal. First, the finance person, Korey Dupree tied to tell me that the deal that was struck between me and the sales manager and salesman was not possible, something to the effect that Toyota was no longer giving 0% financing and reductions in the MSRP for the 2012 camry i wanted to purchase. He insisted that the sales manager and salesman could not make such a deal. Not until I told him that would kill the deal and started to walk out, did he relent and say he would check with the sales manager. 

I ultimately got the deal promised to me by the sales manager and salesman, but not until after I spent at least 30 minutes listening to Mr. Dupree and his sales pitch on all the additional warranty, window treatments, etc. that he wanted to add to the sales contract. I told Mr. Dupree before he started his sales pitch that I did not want any of the add-ons but he insisted that that I could not get financing through Toyota Financial Services unless I listened to his whole sales pitch. I knew beforehand what he was going to say since I had bought my 2011 Toyota Camry from Champion and Mr. Ben Bennatt had made almost the same sales pitch. Moreover, Mr Dupree had no creditability with me since he had just tried to up the sales price on the car by $1000.

Were it not for the fact that this was my 5th or 6th Toyota I have purchased since 1992, and the third from Champion, I would not deal with Toyota or it's dealers. The sales experience was pleasant until I got passed to the financial processing guys. My experience suggests that the financial salesman deserve the reputation that used car salesmen used to enjoy.

41,"February 27, 2013","To start with, my wife and I have worked with Champion Toyota first when I bought my 2012 Toyota Camry Hybrid there in November 2011. The customer service was great even though it is a good distance from Georgetown. Round Rock Toyota seemed too busy and their customer service was not prompt like Champion Toyota. In addition, the fact that the company is one of the Costco-affliated dealers is a big plus. So, after 15 months of driving my car and comparing notes with the car my wife planned on getting, I wanted to get a hybrid car with the color I have wanted for the longest and the new safety features that my wife's new car will have. Long story short, once I made up my mind what I wanted (2013 Toyota Avalon Hybrid), the rest fell into place rather quickly and smoothly especially with the help of Jesse who is the Internet Sales Manager at Champion Toyota. In sum, I would definitely would recommend Champion Toyota to my friends both for auto sales and auto service.

47,"December 29, 2012","After shopping almost every Dealership, make and model around Austin.  I was pleasantly surprised by the sales support of Laura Dean. 

 I had only seen the Prius on the road but was very interested in learning about the car and it was so nice to speak with someone that actually knew a lot about the product she was selling.  

I also appreciated learning about what makes Champion Toyota stand out from other Dealerships.  The small but useful perk of lifetime oil changes was a huge plus and the fact that they have a special drive through bay for that so, the wait is very short is nice.

I am still looking at cars but if the Prius with the 56mpg is the one I pull the trigger on it will be through Laura. ",5.0

57,"August 23, 2012","Buy at your own risk!!!!  

They only care until they get your money and then you become a nobody to them.  I had problems with an alarm system that was on the new Tacoma I bought there and they were TOTALLY useless and didn't care about my situation.  Worst customer service I've ever experienced and I'm 45 years old!

The finance manager lied to us about the cost savings associated with the LoJack (?) that he sold me.  He said it will (not ""might"", but ""will"") save $120 a year on car insurance, when it actually saved me $6 a year.  Yep, got swindled on that one too, pure and simple, and no mater how they may try to spin it, they are simply dishonest at Champion Toyota!

Only upside is the Tacoma itself seems to be a good truck...everything I had hoped for from a Toyota, but the problem here is they have apparently evolved to be a business that feels they no longer need to be honest and offer good customer service because they do have a great product (Toyotas).  That's my take on it.",1.4

Both of these individuals have continued to follow-up with us to make sure we had what we needed or knew where to find them if we didn't.

Such dedication and resolve to help is wonderful in today's world--They have been in contact with me each day since my purchase to be sure I am taken care of and pleased.  I will recommend this dealership to many people as the AAS is a specialty product that many people need in my circle of life.
