18,"May 12, 2017","Mike and his associate (Ron or Joe?) were wonderful to work with.  As was the Service manager.  They were both very attentive and helpful.  Ron (or Joe) was especially helpful when I brought my car back for some body work. ( I hadn't gotten used to the back up camera, thus I messed up the back on a mail box.)  Mike and Ron I rate EXCELLENT  Our only difficult experience was with the Finance Manager at the Ford Building.  This guy was curt and acted as though we were interrupting his day because we wouldn't buy the additional warranty.  I don't have a fax machine and needed him to fax several pages to my Credit Union, and he made a comment about him having to do other peoples work. He should really take some classes on providing Good Customer Service.  Mike or Ron would be excellent instructors.  They both know how important it is.  The Finance guy was only interested in the commission he'd receive IF we bought the extended warranty.  I rate him a 4.  He provided the info, but was rude.",5.0

30,"March 11, 2017","First I have to say that having the sales person in the car during the test drive is very DISTRACTING, he was very polite and nice, but still a huge distraction, between my spouse and I .  Once I chose the vehicle I wanted, the process took several hours and the vehicle was not prepped while I was waiting. Vehicle was still dirty inside, had not been vacuumed or wiped inside. After waiting so long , by the time I got to finance person I then felt like I was getting double talked, rushed and they were not fully aware of the incentives being offered by manufacture. ($750.00) additional discount.  I was asked if my info was correct on an info sheet, but never asked if my mailing address was same as my home address . By the time I finally got finished it was getting dark so of course I was ready to go home and a bit frustrated. About  4 hours later, so I did not go over the vehicle with anyone ,I was just ready to go home.  I did sit in the vehicle out front for several minutes looking at the different features of the vehicle and the salesman came and made sure I was ok. He realized I was a bit frustrated with the process and was tired. He did a quick question and answer with me and walked me through the vehicle feature guide. He realized I was ready to just go, and did offer to spend time with me another day if I still had questions and to set up the Blue link. The waiting was not entirely his fault.  It just should not have taken as long as it did, yes the entire experience could have been better.",2.8

106,"April 24, 2012","By far this was the best buying experience we have ever had. Sales Associate Matt James and Sales Manager Stephen Jimenez were courteous, honest, informed, and professional in every respect, so much so that I wrote Jerry Durant a letter to commend the Granbury dealership. Matt and Stephen went out of their way to earn our business and never once pressured us into making a decision. In fact, they stressed the importance of selecting the right vehicle for our needs. They patiently answered all our questions, stayed past closing time, and fielded calls on a Sunday. I would recommend the entire Hyundai line and the Granbury dealership to anyone looking for a fair price, honest dealings, and courteous service. I look forward to years of service from our new 2012 Genesis and to working with the fine folks at Jerry Durant Hyundai, Granbury. ",5.0
107,"January 18, 2012","On March 31, 2011, I purchased a 2008 BMW 535I from Jerry’s Hyundai in Granbury.  I also purchased a 3yr/50k warranty.

I was later informed by Jerry’s warranty administrator that the warranty I purchased was no longer available, but that a similar one, 3yr/36k warranty, was substituted. 

I have not experienced any mechanical issues with the car until now.  I called this week to arrange repairs, and discovered that the similar warranty was never entered as active as I was told. 

I took the car to Autobahn for diagnosis and called Jerry’s to ask for their help in getting the correct warranty information entered so that I could get the repairs completed.  I dropped the car off at 9:30 a.m.  Autobahn diagnosed my car and finished repairs by 12:30.  I was told by the Jerry’s warranty administrator that the correct warranty was being entered and that there would be no problem, but that the differences in the warranties was that I would only have 36,000 miles instead of 50,000 miles and that my bumper to bumper coverage would now only be powertrain coverage. I waited at Autobahn for four hours after the repairs on my car were complete, waiting patiently to get the warranty payment authorization from the warranty that Jerry's sold me.  I called again and was told that Bob Cote Sr., CFO, had instructed the warranty administrator not to enter the correct warranty, as it was going to cost the dealership about $186 more than what I had paid.  I called Bob directly to find out what was going on and offered to pay the difference, even though I was getting a warranty with lesser miles and coverage.  At this point Bob, told me that it wasn’t not going to happen today but that he would get it taken care of.  He told me to call Stephen Jimenez, Sales Manager at Jerry Durant Hyundai Granbury, and pay the difference. Stephen Jimenez or his Finance Manager would never return my calls while I was waiting at the Service Department at Autobahn. At this point Autobahn had a driver take me 45 miles to my home without my car. 

After arriving home since my phone call attempts fell on deaf ears, I again called Bob and was patched through to his mobile phone.  Bob told me that he had already talked to Eddie Bermea, Finance Manager at Jerry Durant Toyota, and that I needed to call him and he would handle everything.  So I then called Eddie Bermea, who told me that he didn’t know what I was talking about and that this was the first he had heard about the situation.  He said he would call right away to find out what to do and call me back.  I still haven’t heard from him.

So the situation is this: 
I have a car and a warranty that I purchased from Jerry's that needed servicing that was covered by the warranty and the work has already been completed, yet I can’t drive my car because the warranty is inactive due to Jerry’s being stubborn over $186.00/$554.00/$839.00, which is it really? I have Bob Cote, who is the CFO for the entire Jerry’s organization giving me the run around about a warranty I paid for almost a year ago!  My mother is having heart surgery in the morning, I need the car to take her to the hospital and I am getting lied to by everyone I talk to at Jerry’s. I have exhausted my efforts with the good ole boys. I have now picked up my car and was forced to pay my own repairs that were covered under the warranty that I purchased in good faith!

Below is an email last resort of trying to deal with the CEO of the Jerry's Auto Group on January the 18th 2012. All I wanted was my car repaired under a warranty that I bought in good faith for $1,323.00. I was even willing to pay the difference for a lesser warranty with lesser coverage, yet look at their response to me!

I now understand the vehicle is out of warranty and there will be no refund at all.  I can’t give you your money back for something that was your fault and not mine.  I think you bought a warranty and now it has expired.

108,"November 14, 2011","I bought a 2012 Genesis from Jerry's Hyundai.  This was a very pleasant experience.  The car was in perfect condition and everything regarding the deal was exactly as discussed on the phone.  Derek Simpson is a friendly and honest guy.  There was no pressure to buy add ons or extended warranties as with some dealers.  Pricing is competitive and they treat their customers well.  Stephen, the F & I manager was also very pleasant to work with.  I was in and out of the dealer with my car in under 90 minutes.

I would buy from them again and recommend Jerry's to my friends as well.",5.0

Thank you very much. Dave E.",5.0
110,"September 27, 2011","I usually dread buying a new car, but this was a very pleasant experience.  Juan Munoz is the best salesman that I have dealt with in many years (I have been buying cars for over 5 decades).  He treats customers with respect, and he listens to them to find out what they want.  There is no game playing --- just straight dealing without the high pressure.  This was probably the best experience that I have ever had in purchasing a vehicle.

I want to let you know I have never ever recieved the kind of treatment from any dealership that I have just recieved from Jerry's Durant in Granbury Texas. I called the dealership and talked to Noel Rivera and explained what I was looking for and how I would like to buy a 2011 Hyundai Sonata Limited-I wanted the Pearl White and I told Noel the deal I was wanting and Noel said he would have to take the deal to the Business Manager Mark Clark and that he would call me at 11:00 the next morning and at 11:00 Noel called and had the deal all worked out for me. Except they went above and beyond my expectations and gave me a better deal-than I expected and I went in there expecting to be treated like other dealerships have treated me in the past and to my surprise I was shocked by how the dealership treated me. With Reaspect-Kindness and it made me believe in their honesty-to their customers. It was the way a BUSINESS should Handle their BUSINESS- WITH RESPECT TO THE CUSTOMER. Noel was the best salesman I have had to deal with in a long time. We did not have to wait for them to give us the run around-we did not have to set and wait for hours for the paper work to be finished Steven in finance was the best I have ever dealed with.And Mark Clark the Business Manager was super in his trearment to us with how he gave us a deal we did not think would happen. I will always recommend and use Jerry Durant Dealerships. Thank you all Mark-Noel and Steven for the wonderful deal and treatement you gave us which was above and beyond anything we ever expected.

Randy Evans then showed us a demo that had the options we were looking for. We test drove it and really like the ride and comfort it afforded. A few days later we were back in and took the car home for the night. Prior to leaving, Randy obtained an out the door price which was very good.

The customer service was excellent. They go above and beyond to please the customer. I dealt with Hal initially through email before meeting him at the dealership. He always answered my emails quickly and made sure to answer each and every question I had. I will make sure to recommend Jerry Durant to my friends and family here in Killeen.

121,"January 24, 2011","My husband and I decided we wanted a new Sonata after seeing them on the road and reading up on them.  My husband got in touch with Hal via the internet and Hal was very helpful.

My husband told Hal what we were looking for and Hal had several of them, in the colors we had specified, pulled off to the side for us when we arrived.

Hal was very friendly, not only to us, but to our 14 year-old son who had come along with us (and seemed to be more in the way, but Hal never made us feel that way).

They had all of the financing worked out before we even arrived, so it made our transaction a very smooth, quick one after our test drive.

We wouldn't hesitate to recommend Hal Norman, or Jerry Durant Hyundai to anyone looking for a vehicle.
