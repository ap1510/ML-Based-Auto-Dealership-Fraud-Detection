Since my warranty was running out on my 2013 Sonata, I decided to peruse the inventory on line and try to determine the trade in value of my current vehicle.  Even with high mileage at 99,000, I was pleasantly surprised by the range of value that was provided me at the AutoNation website.  As expected, a salesman called me the following day to help me determine the exact value of my trade in and help me find a new Sonata.  What I did not expect was the professional soft sale technique I found dealing with the AutoNation sales representative, Bryan McGovern.  He recognized me upon arrival at the dealership, was eager to help, respected my time which is pretty limited these days, provided a wealth of information, and patiently answered all of my questions.  There was no hassle and no haggling.  I purchased a much nicer Sonata with many more features with no money down, essentially the same monthly payment and a 125,000 warranty.
