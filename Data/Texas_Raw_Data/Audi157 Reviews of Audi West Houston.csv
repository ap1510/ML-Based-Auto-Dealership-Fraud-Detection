0,"February 02, 2020","Every single service visit always lead to something missed or ticket claims something performed and it wasn't.  All started in so called ""make-ready"" which missed many items on delivery.  Bad sign.  Also, watch their Finance Dept, they will cheat you on finance rates.  My bank showed me that they actually offered me better than what was showed.  In my book, I got lied to.  
Every service advisor (I've had 3 different ones) take forever to update you on your car.  I usually have to ask just to get an update.
Emailed GM - still no response.  Based on what I've read on here, expecting never to hear from him.  My salesperson lasted about 2 months, then left.

This Dealership has issues starting from the top resonating throughout the departments.  First and last Audi purchase.  I will also avoid ALL Sonic Automotive Dealerships moving forward.  Time to visit Sewell as they seem to have great customer feedback.    Trading my Audi and not looking back!",1.8
1,"January 25, 2020","The sales manager is a crook, he tried to lowball my trade in, I went across the street to Infiniti West HOUSTON and got 2500.00 more for my trade in, DO NOT BUY FROM AUDI WEST HOUSTON.",1.0
2,"November 05, 2019","DO NOT BUY AUDI OR FROM WEST HOUSTON AUDI!!!!!!Do not but from Audi west Houston  or this product!!! I have had my car in this shop 10 times for the A.C. The GM Mack Albukhari is less than satisfactory with his Inability to return a phone call, with several voicemails left from myself on sept 3rd, regarding this manner. This dealership feels the solution is to buy another one and forget they have been useless in solving the problem. Why would I want to buy from this dealership or this product ever again???I have left multiple reviews on various websites in hope that no one else will receive this blatant dismissal of this huge problem, or any problem. The ONLY thing you can count one from this dealership is GM Mack Albukhri to never acknowledge your concerns, never returning a phone call, and him asking an  employee, to ask me to take the reviews down. He did not even have the decency or respect for me as a customer to call me himself. He will not acknowledge my existence or this problem, but he sure did not mind taking credit for a job well done when I bought it. I will say I have been very pleased with the others that have had to be the middle man between him and myself, and my mechanic Adan is AWESOME!!!!. The employees can only do so much, but it is them and ONLY them that I have not rated this dealership and product sooner. If I were Audi USA I would be appalled that the GM Mack Albukhri still has not called me, the customer. It’s now Nov. 5th, 2019. GM Mack Albukhri, obviously has the leader mentally  over all at west Houston Audi, DO AS I SAY, NOT AS I DO!!!!!!Bc the service manager, my service consultant Jon, my mechanic Adan, have all called me back in a timely manner and/or called me just to give me an update of the situation. Mack Albukhri,  I personally think you should be released from your position. Mack Albukhri knows the problem I have been enduring for 3 1/2 years (the life of my car), but the only problem he sees is his name being called out for his Incompetence with the position  he holds!!!!!!! So, I ask you consumer is this a place (bc of Mack Albukhri and Audi USA) that you would want to do business. If you have a problem or a have a recurring problem you have no one to go to. Audi USA WONT CALL YOU BACK,  NOR WILL GM MACK ALBUKHRI OF WEST HOUSTON AUDI!!!!!!!! SHAME ON YOU MACK ALBUKHRI, wanting me to take my review of YOU and THE AUDI PRODUCT down. SHAME ON YOU. Another fun fact, he knew who I was without me even leaving my name. So, he does know there is a huge problem with my a.c and he chooses to  turn a blind to the problem until he was called out for his incompetence. I would love to leave my full name but due to internet being it is, I can’t. DO NOT BUY, DO NOT BUY, DO NOT BUY!!!!!! MY AC BLOWS 125 DEGREES I have multiple upon multiple videos of this occurring. MACK ALBUKHRI OF WEST HOUSTON AUDI AND AUDI USA DO NOT CARE!!!!    I wish I could have given them the stars they deserved ZERO!!!! ",1.0
3,"June 11, 2019","If I could give a Audi west Houston negative star, I would have done so. I came in and bought an BMW X6 2014 for a fair price. What I never knew was that the car had a lot of maintenance work to be done on it. Oil leak, Cylinder gasket, battery etc ( total cost ~$7000).  According to Audi West Houston, the car had just passed inspection with no trace of all these repairs. Because I trusted them, I never bothered to take the car to BMW for a proper check, which I normally would have done so for a car that expensive. 3 weeks after purchase, I realized that I had all these repairs, so I contacted Audi west  Houston, and all I got from them was that I refused to buy their extended warranty and for that reason there  was nothing they can do for me. Infact if you check my previous review, I gave them 5 stars after the purchase but after this experience, I would strongly consider before shopping with them again. I am very disapointed.

My review 3 weeks ago before the incident

Dana Armstead is an exceptional person. I walked into the shop just for eye shopping and moved out with the best deal I could ever find in the market. The value and the quality of the product is just perfect. Thanks Dana for your assistance.",1.0
4,"April 14, 2019","The service on my Audi A4 2018 was nothing short of terrible. Service advisor Robert got my car washed and the wiper blade on my right wiper was off for some reason. The day I picked my car, it started raining and the rain sensing wiper turned on, scratching my windshield as the wiper blade was off and lying unattached under the windshield. Avoid this dealership for service. Terrible. I am trying to get them to fix the damage done to my windshield but they are super rude and are not even getting back to me.",1.0
5,"March 29, 2019","3/29: Please avoid this service department! Believe me and read all the 1 star comments in the reviews. The service department here is a waste of time and money.  Three months, three loaners later... still my brand new tire is losing air with no reason as to why. AS SOON as I pick up my car from the dealership, my light comes on for the same tire. No explanation. I have the tire pressure checked somewhere else and it's way below the psi it was set at after being told over and over that ""we can't find anything wrong"". 

***When they replaced the tire after missing the nail the first visit, the new tire was on flat the next morning. *** see pics on google

Not to mention the weird sound my car made only AFTER they rotated my tires *** I wish I could attach the video...

Also, it was overlooked that I have the PREMIUM WARRANTY... I've been complaining about my brakes for sometime now, but they kept brushing it off. Then they finally quoted me for $2,000+ for brakes... when I have that as part of the Premium Warranty

I really hope I help save someone time, money, and the disappointment in this ""luxury"" dealership!

12/21: Brought my Q5 in for scheduled maintenance and also for them to check my front left tire because my tire pressure light was on for that particular tire. I recently purchased my tires from Audi with warranty. They checked twice and kept saying they found nothing and couldn't replace my tire. I thought, hey maybe they are right.  I allowed them to rotate my tires. My husband decided to take the tire to get it patched if the light comes on again. Sure enough, get on the road to head out of town for the holidays the next morning and the tire pressure warning came on for the rear back tire! The exact same tire they rotated and supposedly couldn't find anything wrong with it. We pull over and there is a huge nail that you just can't miss.  It's impossible to miss this one. I went straight home from Audi that day and stayed put. I am upset because I'm traveling on the road with my family.  I just don't understand... was it pure laziness or them not wanting me to get the warranty I paid for??? There is no way they checked twice. I wonder what else they overlook or pretend to do?  I waited there 3 hours for poor service.",1.2
6,"February 27, 2019",I have worked mostly with Jon but I dealt with Robert last weekend & they are both top notch with customer care.  They are both so accommodating it makes the pain of taking your car in for service a whole lot easier & more convenient.  Highly recommend working with these guys.,4.4
7,"February 25, 2019",Really enjoyed working with Dana and James.  They spent lots of time with me reviewing the various vehicles and options.  Clear cost and price transparency.  Ended up buying with them over all other Audi dealerships and also over Infiniti and Lexus.,5.0

10,"February 04, 2019","3rd Time - Same Review - Don't ask me again - shows incompetence

Kevin, I don’t do FB or Twitter unless I’m extremely pleased or very ticked off. This 1st experience with Audi was poor. I always drive top line vehicles, and this is my 1st new Audi. As I advised the service department in my request, I had a bad tire (losing pressure every 6 weeks). I arrived at my 1:30 appointment at 1:20 on 1/21/19. I met with my advisor, Scott who was very polite, and I advised him that whatever the cause or cost I wanted at a minimum a new tire. He said they had one in stock and that he would advise me of the situation in ±45 min. I waited at Audi, as I thought I could get a new tire relative fast, particularly if I’m paying for it.  At ±2:30 he advised I had a nail and I would have to buy the tire to which I said fine. He said it would take approximately 45 min. Around 3:15 he introduced me to a new advisor (don’t know name) because he had a doctor appointment.  No problem, I assumed the car would be out shortly. So, I sat there and a little before 4:00 I saw a white Q7 w/blackout parked in the 3rd parking spot in front of the service entrance. (Just thinking, I don’t have the only Q7 like that). Eventually the new service rep came over about 4:15 and said my gold Q7 was ready. I said I don’t have a gold Q7. Looking surprised, he went off and at 4:30, he said my car was ready and to my surprise it was the one setting outside in the lot the past 30-45 min. Anyway I consider it very poor performance to have an appointment to buy a new tire and it take 3 hours.

The only reason I didn’t bring my tire in early for replacement is that my granddaughter has a Q3 and my daughter has a Q5 and they both have problems with the with tire low pressure going off. Anyway, that is my feedback I hope Audi can improve.  ",2.6
11,"January 29, 2019",Professional and thorough.  The service was timely and complete.  Everyone did their job and the problems were corrected 100 percent.  Defects that existed prior were also fixed.,5.0
12,"January 24, 2019","I brought my Q5 in for it's first service.  Very good reminders and follow up regarding my appointment.  When there was immediately welcomed.  My service rep, Jon Dakus, noticed I had some dings on my door and informed my that he had a 3rd party provider there that could take care of this with only pass through costs.  Excellent job they did.  Since Top Golf was closed for maintenance I stayed at the dealer's shop.  The 1.5 hours went by quickly with the way they are set up in the waiting area with fresh coffee, snacks and water.  These guys do a great job and I would highly recommend them.  Great job Jon!",5.0

14,"January 14, 2019","Loyalty at this dealership means nothing. New salesmen that will lie and haggle you to get the deal. Make sure to get everything they promise in writing and read everything. They try to act nice, friendly, and polite to get you business. Once they have you signature on the dotted line everything they promised to do for the trade or lease goes out the window. ",1.8

Best service department I have been to and highly recommended.",5.0
16,"January 08, 2019","As I suspected, we were told that we would be provided a loaner car when buying from Audi west Houston just like their competition provides at Sewell and of course, our first 2 visits went without any loaner.  Also, we have reported 2 times an issue with the trunk not latching and our technician saying he could not duplicate the issue.

Both times after leaving the dealership, the issue happened within an hour.  After the second visit, we video taped the problem and sent it to our technician.  To date it has been over a month and no attempts to help us resolve.

I recommend taking your audi to a Sewell dealership, their service is impeccable.  All of my future service appointments will be made at Sewell.

17,"January 05, 2019","I purchased an Audi A-8 and love the car.  However, I have been to the dealership on 3 occasions and 2 of them have been very disappointing.  I purchased the tire replacement and maintenance program with the initial purchase.  I hit a pot hole and bent the wheel.  I was out of town, had another dealership replace the tire but had to have W. Houston order the wheel.  They kept the car over a week and would not return phone calls when I would call to get an update.  They did not give me a loner.  the 2nd experience was better.  The 3rd went the same way for an oil change.  I called the service mgr and he hasn't returned my call, nor has Keith the General Mgr.  I cannot believe they rate high with customer service.  I have two other very nice cars but will never buy from these guys.  They have failed to see the value in letting the owner know what the status is of a vehicle in their possession and owned by someone that trusted them.  My bff owns the same car as me and we both refuse to go back there",1.5

Once you go in they quickly claim the price as ‘a mistake’ and try to entice you with some garbage (much higher) offer.

29,"August 29, 2018","On August 27 called and spoke with Robert to make appointment for service on next day, August 28 at 10:00 for oil and filter change.  Told it would take one hour.  When I arrived on August 28th, Robert went to different employees asking if they had time to handle my account. Asked me to sit and wait while he found someone to help me.  He disappeared and  after waiting 10 minutes, I began to ask for help again.  He finally appeared and asked Reggie if he would help me.  He was kind enough to do so.  I asked again if this work would be finished within the promised one hour and Robert assured me it would be okay.  Well past the hour, Robert told me my car was in the car wash and would be finished soon.  Ten minutes later found Reggie and asked if my car was ready.  He said I had to pay my bill.  I told him I never got the bill.  When Reggie produced it, I paid it and left.  Later, received a voicemail from Robert apologizing he missed seeing me before I left.  I’m sorry to write this type of review, in the past I’ve always had excellent service.  ",3.0

I called Audi, was transferred around and after spending 20 minutes on the phone explaining several times that the price was 'Base Price' and I had been overcharged, I got frustrated and told the person I felt I was being cheated just like Audi cheated on emissions. This prompted the person to immediately agree to send me a refund in 4 to 6 weeks. Why the dealership could not resolve this matter is beyond me. My previous car was a Lexus and frankly I was at the point of returning the car for a full refund and going back to Lexus. My wife still has her Lexus and I can assure you the dealership would have taken care of the matter quickly. 
This experience has left a 'bad taste' and I cannot envision purchasing another Audi again.

However, my salesperson, Amadou Niang, was very helpful in explaining car and options.  I was driving a BMW X4 and trying to decide if I should stay with BMW or go back to Audi (drove A4 in the past).

76,"May 24, 2017",I purchased my Q5 from this dealership and their service department is the only people to work on the car. I purchased tires from them after the original ones wore out. About a month later I had a nail in the tire and took it to the dealership and was told I would be getting a new tire as I was under warranty. A year later I started having tire pressure issues. Took the car to the dealership and was told to go to discount tire as the dealership doesn't repair tires. Discount immediately noticed the problem and said they couldn't do anything as there was a non certified rope plug in the tire. Took it back to the dealership and they denied it was a plug and wanted to replace the tire right there at half off plus dealership fees which pushed it back to full price. Feeling something was off I went back to discount and bought a tire from them. When they replaced the tire it was confirmed to be a plug. When i showed the picture of the plug to the dealership they just responded we don't plug and we don't know what you do with the car when it's not here. Never mind my service history showed I had come to them for every tire rotation and any other minor issue. This is the second incident I've had with this dealership.

From my latest service report:  ""left broken bolts"", ""coolant hose was mounted incorrectly"", ""engine control module holder was not installed back correctly"", ""broken bolt to the holder"", and ""pinch (sic) wires in the harness""

Of course, Audi WH claims that because the warranty on that repair had expired, they won't do anything. Nevermind that they were the only ones to ever service the car, and of course it would have never been discovered as long as the one's who did the shoddy work to begin with were the ones checking the vehicle. The car was purchased CPO from them, and they showed me maintenance records that they had been maintaining the car before I bought it.

To recap, no one touched the car to do work on it except for Audi West Houston staff either before or after I bought the car until I moved across the country and the new dealer found all the mess AWH left behind.

I've been taking my car to a independent shop for the past year and half and they keep finding things that make me wonder how any car that comes out of Audi WH's shop stays on the road.

No...""Well you better hurry up because we can't hold these cars!...or anything to that effect to make us feel like we needed to buy.

The Manager said, ""What would it take to sell you this Q5 today""...or a facsimile thereof.  Again I told him I had to think on it and I would be back with an answer within a week.

131,"November 30, 2013","I've always wanted an Audi, but I can't afford a new one, so I finally treated myself to a gently used A4. There is no need to buy a new one, since they hold up so well. My car looks brand new!    

My salesman, Daren, met me right away.  He found the perfect car for me, and I definitely got the royal treatment.  I've purchased cars in the past, and it had always taken way too long.  At Audi West Houston used cars, it didn't take long at all, and I was made so comfortable while the paperwork was done.  

 I'm hooked on Audis now, and I'll never go anywhere but Audi West Houston used cars to buy one. ",5.0
132,"November 28, 2013","I have a 2004 MDX and have loved it.  With the miles creeping up, I decided it was time to start a new chapter in my car life.  I went to Momentum Luxury Cars/Porsche Audi West Houston and met Tri.  He was really easy going but knew what he was talking about.  I usually dread the experience, but this one was different.   He put me at ease, offered me coffee right away, answered all of my questions with patience. By the time I left, I was happy in my 2013 MDX.  He even said he would personally wash my car when I came in!  Now that is customer service.

139,"September 02, 2013","My wife & I were looking for a new Audi and had been to another dealership inside the loop and were not satisfied with the service we were receiving, so we decided to go to the West Houston dealership.  When we drove up, we met Ken Simon and were instantly won over.  He was friendly, personable, knowledgeable, and incredibly customer service oriented.  He asked us what we were looking for and immediately showed us different options.  He thoroughly explained the features of the car, took us on a test drive and made sure we were happy with the purchase.  He showed us the A6 and A8 and we decided to go with the A8 because of the additional space, the performance and the overall more luxuriousness of the car. Once we decided on he car we wanted he did not beat around the bush about price, he told us what sort of deal we would receive and was completely up front and honest with us. Frankly, I am not one to typically take the time to write a review, but the overall customer experience is the reason I have chosen to do so.

- Pre-owned Sales Manager - Sam Seddiki was NOT helpful
- Met with Greg Chapman (Sales Manager) and Alan Stubs (General Manager)

        - got my car fixed @ Momemtum BWM (total cost of approx $4500)
        - gave me an Audi loaner during the repair

146,"April 10, 2013","I purchased a used car from Audi West Houston. This is the first time that I purchased a car without actually seeing it first because I live in Florida. I purchased a 2009 Acura RL and it was priced well. My experience with the sales person was less than pleasant as he always made excuses that he was busy and almost acted like I was hassling him because I wanted to purchase this car. It took almost 3 days just to establish the final purchase agreement with the correct numbers. It was then another week before I could get the car shipped to me with continued excuses. I am sorry that I keep saying excuses, but they were just that. I am not very tolerant of excuses when I know they are just that. I am a manager of a busy local mortgage company and well understand the angle of customer service while under pressure. This salesman kept trying to feed me lines like I was clueless. Needless to say I finally got the car....I was pleased overall in receiving the car, BUT the car was shipped without being detailed at all and looked like it had been either sitting on the lot for 3 months without being touched other than the occasional test drive. I mean come on I am buying a LUXURY car and you would think I would at least get a detail??? Within 1 week of getting the car I had to pay for a decent detail ($120), buy a new battery ($100), new windshield wipers ($20) and an oil change ($40). So I had to come out of pocket $280 within a week of getting the car and most of these things should have been done at the dealership prior to shipping this car to me. I am a reasonable person and was disappointed by these extra expenses and called to speak with the manager or GM. After I was shuffled around about 8 different calls to numerous different full voice mailboxes I finally got the so-called GM on the phone. I explained my frustration and he was very calm and explained to me that he was just about to go into a meeting with the manager of the used car division and he assured me he would personally make sure I was called back to find a happy resolution Well here we are almost a week later and do you think I have received a call back??? You guessed it!!!! If you have to buy a car from here becasue the price is too good to pass I understand, but for any other reason I would highly recommend AVOIDING this dealership, it's sales people, management and any other advertising from them because I would not believe a thing they said.....dirty car dealers and I hate to say that because one of my best friends is in the business.",1.6
147,"October 09, 2012","This dealership is a huge RIP OFF, do not and I repeat DO NOT buy a vehicle here.  We shopped around for a vehicle at a few Audi dealers, this dealership offered a price $250 less than any other, decided to purchase here on a Sunday.  Time to sign papers, there is a $500 DEALER SERVICE CHARGE attached to bill, when inquired was first told it is a $500 fee on all foreign vehicles required to be collected as a tax, when inquired more, was told it was a fee approved by Texas DMV that the dealership must collect.

I informed finance guy that I will be calling Texas DMV to verify this, he said go ahead as he is 100% sure they can legally collect this $500.  Monday, called Texas DMV, they are shocked, they said there is no approval by their office for this dealership to collect a $500 fee on any foreign owned vehicle.  Texas DMV requested I file a complaint with their office.

I called this dealership after talking to Texas DMV, the finance guy said ""oh, I was not aware that Texas DMV did not approve this, that is what I was told in training to say, you must talk to manager"".  Spoke with manager, told him what Texas DMV said - his answer was ""well check with our corporate office, they have filed all the paper work allowing me to collect this $500"".  Called Audi's corporate office, they are shocked to hear about this - never filed any paper work for this dealership to collect this $500.  Corporate office requested dealer give a refund, dealer is refusing.  When pressed by Corporate as to what this $500 fee is for - manager finally admitted it's a fee for a loaner vehicle when servicing""

There were two other fees that we insisted be removed before signing papers.  I wished I had waited one more day, called Texas DMV first but please do not let the same thing happen to you.  DO NOT BUY A VEHICLE at AUDI West HOUSTON.",1.2
148,"October 06, 2012","My wife has an A4 coming off a lease. We were interested in a new Q5 because we are expecting our first child.

My wife made an appointment for Wednesday at noon. The dealership called and rescheduled to Saturday. When we arrived we were greeted very rudely and informed that we would have to wait for an unspecified amount of time to meet with Greg the Sales Manager. At the time we observed Greg sitting in his office with another sales associate. They did not appear to be very busy.

After waiting for a time we inquired how much longer the wait would be. Greg came out and explained that ""Audi is the hottest car in the world right now"" and that they ""do not normally take appointments on the weekends"". I explained we had a confirmed appointment. Greg said we would just have to wait in a very condescending manner.

After considering our discussion I thanked Greg for making our car buying decision easier and we headed to a competitors lot.

151,"December 09, 2011","Went to this dealer ready to purchase a Q5 they had on the lot.  First, they lo-balled us on our trade in offer on our A4(no surprise). Their explanation for that is that they have to sell it as Certified Pre-owned and that costs money.  Sorry, but that's your expense, not mine.  Also, when you BUY a CPO car, you pay more, so they are double dipping there.  We had gotten an offer from Carmax for $2500 more, so that was not an issue, we were going to proceed with the purchase.  When we were presented with the invoice, there were additional charges that are pure profit and not charged by other dealers: $500 for their ""Dealer Service"" program, which is a fee they charge each customer to pay for their loaner cars.  $297 for etching the VIN # on the glass, which is already done.  Their admin/doc fees are also inflated, making the total price almost $1000 more.  We left, and went to North Houston Audi, owned by Sewell, and ordered our Q5 from them.  Audi West and Momentum Audi are both owned by the same company.  Obviously business is good since they didn't seem to work with us to earn our business and didn't seem to care we went elsewhere.

154,"December 23, 2009","Summary: 
Absolutely abysmal experience with sales.  Played the classic bait and switch game on us, wasted our time.  Do not expect a transparent deal, and don't bother trying to deal with them via phone or internet.  There is a REASON why the reviews of the Sonic Automotive dealerships (including Momentum) are consistently rotten.  Their behavior may be legal, but it's far from ethical.

Be sure you check their rating with the BBB before you decide to do business.

Details:
I contacted Dana, the internet director at the dealership via email to arrange a test drive of a new A4.  After being stood up, without any excuse, I was helped helped by someone who was marginally uninformed about the product. I contacted Dana the next day and was able to successfully negotiate (I thought) a deal on a specific car; we confirmed the numbers via telephone and discussed financing -- I was assured that they could beat my bank's rate.  I told them the deal was acceptable and that I would be there within the hour to finish the paperwork.  At this point I was informed that someone else was interested in the car and it was being test driven, so I ""should hurry if I was interested.""

Upon arriving, I was allowed to test drive the car, and Vern demonstrated its features, because the other buyer's ""deal wasn't firm.""  After being assured that the car was ours, suddenly, it was sold again, but miraculously, another vehicle at a significantly higher price was still available.  When I assured them that there were no other vehicles on the lot that met both my price and feature requirements, the original car (again miraculously) became available.

When the paperwork arrived, the price was NOT what was agreed to, the payment was over 100$/month higher than I had calculated, and the salesman ""didn't know"" what interest rate was used. (I had advised them prior to this that I had outside financing at ~4%; I later calculated their rate to be in excess of 7%).  They feigned poor communication with my original contact at the dealership as the reason for these ""errors.""

During this time, I observed 2 other sets of people test drive the car that was promised to me.  I can only imagine that they'd been given the same bait-and-switch treatment.  At this point I demanded the keys to my trade in, and the Vern and Joe (sales manager) both had the audacity to appear shocked.  The only thing I can say good about this dealership is they gave me back the keys quickly, probably because they thought I was about to blow a gasket in the middle of the showroom.

I had owned the car 3 weeks, the car was still under factory warranty.

156,"June 20, 2007","I had the most horrible experience.  I have an 2001 Audi TT convertible.  When I brought the car in for warning lights that appeared, I informed them of a leak in the top and was ASSURED the car would be kept in a dry place.

Three weeks later, I picked my car up which was parked outside in the pouring rain.  They'd removed my fuel door button (was not able to gas up) and my dash lights did not work (they work now).  My turbo was out, check engine light was on, there was no gas in the car and my cd changer didn't work.  

I just want my car in the same condition as when I dropped it off.  I spoke with the service manager, Dusty, who disrespectfully informed me that it was all my fault for bringing in a car with a leak.  When I told him I was assured it would be kept dry, he once again rudely told me it was my fault even though they left my car in the rain knowing it had a leak.  

I am not upset that they will not return my car to the original condition.  I am incredibly upset at the disrespect I have received.  An apology is all I am asking for.

I called Audi Customer Care who contacted Dusty.  He is exercising his right to refuse service to me.  My only option is to contact the BBB and let people know how horribly I was treated.

I am in the process of moving overseas.  If the issue is resolved before I leave, I will gladly remove all negative reviews.",1.0
