18,"May 19, 2020","I just purchased a new Toyota Tacoma today and was beyond pleased with the experience. I used the Costco Auto Program and was contacted by Ruben Puente quickly. He provided me the Costco price (which was great btw) and provided me trade in figures quickly via email. This was super helpful as I leave 2 hours away and wanted to make sure all the numbers were buttoned up before I made the trip down.

Unfortunately Ruben was off today but answered his cell phone and arranged for his peer Lee Makarwich to help me when I arrived. They coordinated well and Lee had the Tacoma cleaned up and ready for me to check out upon my arrival. Lee went to bat for me with a discrepancy with the value of one of my trade ins and made sure I got the deal I was expecting. He was very professional and took great care to make sure everything was explained properly and that I was taken care of. 

Kevin Tran, the Finance Manager, listened to my needs and offered a great solution for my long term ownership satisfaction. We settled on a short term/high mileage warranty and gap protection to protect me from any unforeseen expenses that may occur in the future. He was friendly, professional and a pleasure dealing with.

Overall from the being to the end, this was a wonderful experience and highly recommend checking out the great staff at Toyota of Fort Worth for any automobile purchase.",5.0

They were efficient and took care of the inspection quickly and even washed the truck for me before I left. Many signs up around the building urging social distancing, but few employees actually followed the guidelines. The seemingly cavalier attitude toward healthy distancing was a bit disturbing. ",4.0

29,"February 03, 2020","BUYER BEWARE:  
After being referred by previous Toyota of Fort Worth customers (herein Toyota) I purchased my vehicle from Toyota on January 20th. I have come to realize that there are some SERIOUS MATTERS that need to be addressed, as I am VERY UPSET with this outcome! 
We were at Toyota from 11am-7pm on this day!! During the financial end of the purchase with Oscar Vargas, we were given the opportunity to purchase a Fidelity warranty which could only be purchased that day. HOWEVER, Mr. Vargas did state that this warranty could be canceled at ANY TIME. Since it was only able to be purchased then AND canceled at any time, I decided to go ahead and add the warranty. 
Next, Mr. Vargas informed me that Toyota provided the JM&A DataDot for ALL of their vehicles and that there is NO CHARGE for their customers as it is provided. 
Unfortunately, a couple day later, I noticed that there was a fee of $295 added for the JM&A DataDot AND that the Fidelity Warranty was FAR MUCH MORE than expected!!!! I was VERY puzzled considering the fact that I was told by Mr. Vargas that the JM& DataDot was PROVIDED to Toyota Customers. I was also SHOCKED with the amount of the Fidelity Warranty. 
On January 23rd, I went to Toyota and signed a cancellation form. A couple days later I was informed by Mr. Vargas that Toyota is UNWILLING to refund the JM&A DataDot amount of $295 when I was initially told by Mr. Vargas that it was provided! He then explained that the cancellation process would take 5-7 weeks as “the Bank” is the one who has to initiate the refund AND I would be responsible paying interest during that time while “the Bank” refunds the amount of the Fidelity Warranty!!!! 
Today, I spoke with “the Bank” loan representative and was informed that there is NOTHING that can be done on their end and that they are waiting for Toyota to refund the Fidelity Warranty amount, NOT the other way around. 
As being highly recommend to Toyota by past LOYAL customers who informed me that Toyota is the best dealership that will take good care of their customers, I must admit that I am VERY DISAPPOINTED. I feel that I was manipulated and taken advantage of!!!!",1.0

31,"December 15, 2019","Julian was a great salesman.  Gave me some off on the price, and gave me some extra on the trade-in we had, so I got to the price I was looking for.  Genuinely nice dude who was great to work with!  I bought a 2019 Ford Explorer because I found their website and it was the best price.",5.0
32,"February 28, 2019","I want to put out a great thanks to service advisor Jeff McDowell. He has went above and beyond to give us the most exceptional extraordinary automotive service we have ever had. After receiving a bad oil change from Walmart my Toyota Prius engine blew. It was an 07' but only had about 70k miles on it. Getting Walmart to finance the repair was the worst, they did so many maneuvers and tacktets to avoid financing the repair, despite fault, but we were so blessed to have Jeff McDowell advocate for us and it was his persistence that really made it possible to get everything we needed to be safe on the road. When Walmart tried to short us by providing only partial payment for the damage they did to our car Jeff McDowell and the service director Jeff McGarr of Toyota of Fort Worth looked out for us and were even kind enough to waive much of the labor cost to get us rolling again. My Prius is an 07' so they ended up replacing the engine, hybrid battery, brakes, some oxygen sensors, hoses, and even a faulty headlight to restore it to perfect condition. It runs like brand new now and I am pleased to pass it down to our teen student as reliable transportation. I am so impressed by the service of our advisor Jeff McDowell, he made the process so simple and easy for us, we were so lucky to have him managing our case,  by the end of it all he literally had our cell number memorized from putting in so much time and effort on our case so he deserves a trophy for that alone and truly everyone on service Director Jeff McGarr's whole team were amazing. Toyota of Fort Worth is like no other. They are an honest caring group that go above and beyond to satisfy their customers. Everyone from repair techs, management, administration, and everyone in between, from start to finish were so professional, did a wonderful job, and they all worked so hard for us. We were treated like family and I know I can trust them to be honest, work hard, and do great work at fair prices. Even if there are better prices out there I will never again waste my time trusting anyone else but Toyota of Fort Worth for all my car maintenance and repair needs. Toyota of Fort Worth from the Barnes Family to yours, Thank You all so much!!! In us you have customers for life.",5.0
33,"December 19, 2018","BEWARE OF DECEPTIVE ONLINE PRICES FROM THIS DEALERSHIP!  Every car REQUIRES an additional ""inspection"" prior to sale, which with the doc fee is over $1,200 added to the price of every car.  The prices shown online ARE NOT THE ACTUAL SALE PRICE!",3.0
34,"November 25, 2018","I did my interest rate research before I went in...was given a high rate with my excellent credit score.  I questioned him and game on.... he got rude, disrespectful, and very defensive.. I left and went and got financing elsewhere at a rate he told me was not even available ... I checked the bank  he said he was using and on line  saw a rate posted way lower than the one he offered.  Did not trust him at all after that.   Went in to pick my vehicle up the next day and I have never been talked to like that!   I have bought many, many vehicles in my time and have never been so disrespected.    Toyota has a great product, but maybe drive further west to Weatherford ...Financing Deptartment was a bad experience!!

They could not remove the window tint and the door guard which I got with the car. Be very careful before signing your checkbook.",1.6

IF YOU ARE PLANNING ON PURCHASING A VEHICLE FROM TOYOTA OF FORT WORTH, READ THIS BEFORE YOU EVER PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM THEM!!!! This is the most unprofessional slimy sales experience that you can possibly imagine. The sales members are clueless and the manager (JOSH) that I had spoke with could care less about screwing you over or providing any type of quality customer service. After working with a sales member for two days and agree upon a deal to purchase a car and take out money to buy it, I come to find out that they went ahead and sold the car to someone else way before we even finished our deal. I then called and talked to JOSH a sales manager, who could honestly care less about the customer or how bad they get screwed over. The manager wouldn’t even acknowledge that they had done anything wrong and wouldn’t even offer any alternative solution. IF YOU WANT TO WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY WITH A COMPANY FULL OF SLIMY UNPROFESSIONAL SALES MEMNBERS, RIDE ON DOWN TO TOYOTA OF FORT WORTH FOR THE FULL EXPERIENCE!!!!

49,"June 05, 2017","I just came into get a oil change , a hour and half later finish then they tell me I need a new battery.they tell me don't worry it under warranty so they went ahead and change it. My question is why do I need a new battery the car is only 4 months old?. I NEVER had any problems with my car starting , NEVER a light come on stating check battery. I did not buy my car here. I think they change battery to make up for the free oil change cause when dealership do warranty work they get paid for it.

51,"May 29, 2017","Toyota of Fort Worth has been servicing my cars for more than 20 years.  The service has always met or exceeded my expectation.

The used car sales force is a disappointment.  A friend was looking for a vehicle & was interested in a Highlander shown on the site; after being assured by two different people that it was on the lot, he got to the dealership to be told it had been sold three weeks before.

The effort to kick smokers to the curb isn't particularly endearing either.  The outside smoking area has effectively been eliminated.  

Great service, but the rest of the dealership seems intent on chasing away customers.",4.5

60,"May 12, 2017"," Buying our Sienna from Toyota of Fort Worth was excellent. I typically HATE buying a car. I do as much research online as I can prior to visiting dealership, because I have just never had a great experience. This was very different. 

From the time our sales person Aaron Ball met us at the door to the time we drove out of the lot with our new Sienna was under two hours. That includes searching the available vehicles on the lot, test driving the Sienna we wanted and signing the paper work. I had spent a longer time than that with other dealers that I had not purchased from that day. It was all really smooth and no pressure. 

I also got  survey in the mail a couple of days later asking me about my experience and for how they could make their process better. Aaron also emailed me thanking me for my business and told me to let him know if I ever need anything. I have never received customer care follow ups from a dealer after I drove off the lot. 

I got a really great deal on my Sienna and the customer service and ongoing Toyota Care is excellent! ",5.0

They were very detailed about appraising my trade and I ended up getting exactly what i wanted for my trade.  I bought a new camry at basically a  used car price.  AMAZING deal!  Josh, the sales manager was available but never hounded me or pressured me at all.  The trade process was flawless, the new car deal was perfect, financing, everything was smooth and easy.  I see other negative reviews and I'll just say this, if you are a REASONABLE buyer and have realistic expectations, the process should be very easy.  Not every dealership will be perfect every time so keep that in mind.  For me, I couldn't be happier with my new car and I can recommend these guys without hesitation.  Give Ashley and Josh a chance and I'm sure you'll be treated professionally.  Thanks guys! ",5.0

We also looked at the 2017 models. Since the price was close between usef and new I decided to go with the new 2017 Camry SE. We did the paper work to start the paper work. I was told my credit report showef mo history. I asked if that would present a problem in finance. Since it was late in the evening I was told that he didn't see any problem to get the finance but it had to be done the next day. Ashley said he was off but he would come in to rap up the paper work. On the next day at 11:00 am I called and text but got no response. I finally recieved responce at 1:00 pm that he didn't come in but someone at the office was working on the paper work. Ashley said would he contact me or another coworker later with further information. Ashley then said the finance director wad in so he couldn't finish up the paper work. I was told to come in the next day an appointment was set for 11:00 am. I showed up withy daughter and nothing had been processed. We sat there waiting for him but got nowhere. We sete given another sales agent Eric Fiscus who requested from us to do all paper work again

67,"January 19, 2017","I just bought a truck from this dealership and used the previously recommended trio (see 12/30/16 post) of Kenneth Cook (sales consultant), Dustin Johnston (sales manager) and Chase Rutlidge (finance). I already new what truck I wanted and so was really only negotiating the price of that particular truck. Kenneth Cook is friendly and gives good advice. However, he is pretty popular so I would recommend making an appointment. I did not do that and he still was able to assist me while working with other clients. He did not hassle me while I was deciding between his truck and another in DFW which I really appreciated. I spoke with Dustin for only a short while and appreciated his input on different ways for me to get the deal I was wanting. Chase worked me just during financing of my truck purchase. There was a discrepancy in the final price he showed me and the one I was offered. He immediately looked into it and had it corrected. Overall, the whole process was relaxed and pleasant.

At this point I told the service rep I needed a vehicle that evening to pick up my kids and would come by in a few hours to pick only up. I showed up at 2pm to pick it up and still no one had looked at my vehicle. Why ask me to leave my vehicle overnight if your not going to take the time to look at it. I was not even offered a loner car. He said I could get a rental but it would probably be 4-5 days repair because they would need to order the part. Absolutely poor customer service.

She declined as there was nothing wrong with her windshield, and this ‘representative’ of a Toyota dealership sheepishly erased his magic marker circles.  I spoke to the service manager, before she left the dealership, incensed that an insurance fraud was emanating from his shop.  He was indignant claiming that this was a 'service'.  After she returned home I did a full inspection of her windshield and it was flawless.  Here is the real kicker though, I contacted James Lentz, CEO North America and Akio Toyoda, CEO Japan to alert them of the ethical erosion happening at their dealerships, only after I was told this by executive analysts, regional managers, and Gulf States managers as well that U.S. dealerships are independently owned and operated and Toyota Motor Corporation has little to no authority over their practices.  Even though appalled, and they were, they have no teeth. This has been a three-month ordeal. So, my only recourse after trying to be a gentleman and warning the corporation is to now warn others and to stay away completely myself.  I hope my efforts can enlighten you as I have been educated mightily.  Oh, and the upselling and snake oil additives that are being offered at Toyota dealerships have also been well documented but cannot be eradicated by TMC.  The dealerships are free to make as much as they can in whatever way that they can.  Buyers beware and consumers can rightfully be appalled of these practices.",1.7
74,"March 27, 2015","I went to multiple dealerships when looking to buy a 2015 4Runner Trail. Every other dealership treated me so poorly that I was beyond frustrated with the entire car buying experience. Being a female, I cannot tell you the number of times I was treated as though I knew nothing about the vehicle I was purchasing. I didn't want the vehicle to be ""pretty"" I wanted it to be off road capable, rugged and dependable. 

I went to Toyota of FW at 6 o'clock on a Thursday and walked out by 7:30 with the exact vehicle I wanted at a great price. 

Chase was wonderful and worked hard to get me the price I wanted. He treated me with respect and listened to what I wanted on the vehicle without arguing or trying to sell me on something ""better."" He ended up matching the lowest quote I received from any other dealer and honestly I felt good about my purchase because of the way I was treated.

I look forward to working with this dealership in the future and would HIGHLY recommend them to anyone looking for a HONEST, STRAIGHTFORWARD and FAIR dealership. No hassle. No gimmicks.

The day prior to picking up the car, the customer asked if they could simply wire transfer the money; the entire amount.  This would be the fastest way, ***AND*** most secure method to transfer funds. The customer was told that it would be very complicated.  Not the answer I would expect.

In the end, we ended up paying cash.  That's those funny green things with dead presidents on them right?  We informed the dealership the day prior to picking the vehicle up that we would pay cash.  The end result; they had to count - and recount (5x times!!) the money and they had to make us wait while they got change?!?  

In summary, the deal itself was what motivated us to purchase the vehicle there - if you want a higher level of customer service and you don't want to spend all day waiting on things to happen, look elsewhere.",2.8

119,"April 30, 2014","First, let me explain that I walked into Toyota of Fort Worth  ready to purchase a car on their lot, which was within my price point. What happened after I entered the dealership made me walk away cash in hand. 

 I made an appointment for a test drive, which went very well.  I was greeted by a kind older man who knew little about the car but was nice enough to take me on a test drive. This salesman soon lost control of the sale, as Bryan Abbassi stepped in. I let Mr. Addassi know that I came back to Toyota of Fort Worth because this is the place I bought my trade-in.  He acted too busy to listen to anyone but himself talking. He made an offer on my trade-in that was so low I realized, if that was his offer, we could not do business. I picked up my keys, readying myself to leave. Mr. Abbassi got upset and proclaimed, ""that is not the way you negotiate."" I agreed. Normally you make a decent offer and not insult folks by patronizing them. what followed shocked me. As I am walking across the showroom floor, he proclaimed for everyone with in ear shot to hear, ""we will not be doing business on your trade-in, do not bother to come back."" He said this for everyone to hear, as I am walking across the showroom floor. Nice.   So that's the way to negotiate?  Is this the way Toyota of Fort Worth treats people now?  Please understand, I bought my vehicle from Toyota of Fort Wort less than two years ago.  I registered on line to receive a coupon at this dealership for ""Black Book"" value on my trade, which Mr. Addassi was aware of.It was he who invited me to bring the coupon in via email but then proceeded to offer much, much, much less than the ""Black Book"" value. Third, all other dealers I visited offered me $3,000 more and in one case $4,000 more. My vehicle was clean with no dents, ran perfect, great interior, flawless maintenance record and with top grade tires and rims. 

 I don't ever recommend that anyone go to Toyota of Fort Worth. The experience was harsh and unprofessional.

Then I was told their service department had looked over the vehicle before it had been put on the lot and that it was in excellent condition.

Found an SUV, he got the keys, it wouldn't start, just clicking. Great! So he jumps it and off we go. It's a great SUV in looks, very clean, very nicely equipped and we got it for about 3 grand less than KBB. We wanted to come back on Tuesday to pick it up because couldn't get monies until Monday. Was ready to go home and he takes us to financing- we have a check waiting for us at the bank, our bank. He says they are willing to let us take it home for a few days to try it out. OK, great. They were taking forever so we decided to leave. Came back on Wednesday, asked that all paperwork be ready for us to sign, it was an hour and half drive home and hubby can't drive in the dark. No paperwork done, asked if we wanted Lo-jack, then find out they won't come out to our area, too far away, but we paid for it! So now have to meet in a Wal Mart parking lot for them to install, not cool!Vanderputt assured us that the service people checked the battery and all was well, in great shape, no problem.

Had disabled vet plates to put on it, no one gave us paper plates, was told we could put them on. This is THEIR line of work they are the experts at the paperwork! I was driving illegally!

Before going in, I looked through their online inventory, and chose my ""dream car"", a fully loaded and upgraded 2011 Camry Hybrid with an MSRP that was not within my price range. Meghan and I discussed the car I originally asked about, and then she asked me if I wanted to drive my ""dream car"". We went for a test drive and the car performed beyond my wildest expectations. She asked me if I wanted her to run the numbers with various incentives and discounts calculated in, and she showed me her work and explained in great detail what she was doing and where she was getting her numbers. By the time she was through, my ""dream car"" was well within my reach, not very much more than the 4 year old used car I had been looking at! I was flabbergasted. We filled out all the paperwork, and then Meghan turned me over to Brian Thompson in Finance, who treated me with uncommon dignity and respect, and carefully explained all the financial nuances of my purchase to my complete satisfaction. I left this dealership driving the car that I have always wanted at an incredible bargain price that I was more than willing to pay, knowing that I had received outstanding service from two individuals who acted in my very best interests and were dedicated to making me happy. This was not only the best car dealership I've ever worked with, but one of the best businesses of any kind! I would not hesitate to recommend my new friends at Toyota of Fort Worth to my oldest and dearest friends. FIVE STARS!",5.0
132,"September 08, 2010","I contacted multiple Toyota dealerships in the area via email asking for their best price on a new 2008 FJ Cruiser with very specific information about options and color that we wanted.  I got replies from most, include Toyota of Ft. Worth, and this dealership offered the best price.  I had done my homework before starting this process and paid to get the dealer wholesale pricing information (forgot what service I used) and knew that the quote I got was a realistic one.  Interestingly enough, Toyota of Plano insisted to me that I was being low-balled and would not match ToFW's price.  I concluded negotiations over the phone as we were on an out-of-town trip during all of this.  Reached a verbal agreement with Mr. Bolin and had to wait, if memory serves me correctly, about 2 weeks for them to receive the truck from Houston.

The day came and we went to buy the vehicle.  Met Mr. Bolin, he gave us the keys, pointed out the vehicle and let us take it for a test drive.  It was equipped exactly as we requested.  Not a single thing wrong.  Maybe 2 miles on the ODO before our test drive.  We then sat down and signed the paperwork, paid the price and were out of there within an hour.  No surprises, no crap, everything exactly as we verbally agreed.  I could not be happier with this buying experience.  These guys really know what they are doing with internet sales.  I would recommend them to anyone.  My only advice is to know what the dealer costs really are before negotiating.",4.8
133,"July 21, 2010","Mr. Bolin is a crook.  He told me not to worry about mileage on a leased Tacoma and when I brought it back 3 years later he went ballistic about the number of miles on the truck.  He then proceeded to screw me on a Tundra.  Mr. Bolin is a liar.  Don't walk away from this dealership, RUN!",1.0
134,"December 22, 2009","this is the respond that I have received from the internet manager. It is impossible to negotiate the price and not willing to work with the future customer, instead they look down at me and telling to look at other alternative. 

********************************************************************************
I am not quite sure I understand your point. Our internet department is the #1 Toyota Internet Department in the country. We offer the most aggressive pricing possible. If you are looking for the best deal, then you've contacted the best dealer. But, I expect that since you have not yet purchased, you have not found any other dealer that will beat my pricing. If you want a NEW 2010 Toyota Camry XLE 4 cylinder in Silver with QG, then I have identified and quoted you the very best vehicle match in our 5 state region and the very best possible price. If the vehicle you desire does not fit within your budget (or expectations), then the only thing I can suggest is to go with a vehicle with less equipment - an LE.  

As it seems that we are at an impass at this point, we thank you for the opportunity and wish you the best in your search for a new vehicle.

135,"April 21, 2008","After this recent hail storm, we decided that we should check out the “deals” that Toyota of Fort Worth was having.  We had visited before and had an overall positive experience.  The sales associate that had assisted us was busy with another customer and had another sales associate assist us in the mean time.  The car we were interested had slight hail damaged and we asked for the sales associate to see what the hail discount would be.  As we were looking around the lot at other vehicles, we decided if the sales associate had the numbers.  As soon as we were walking toward the building, we saw him drive off.  Didn’t know where he was going, we went to the receptionist’s desk and asked for him to be paged.  She located him and she stated he went to go get some food.  We thought, surely not.  He sure did, he walked in with a bag of fast food and we asked for a manager right then.  No manager ever came, once we calmed down and had spoken with the original sales associate, only giving $1,000 off this hail damaged vehicle.   IT IS A WASTE OF TIME, YOU CAN HAGGLE AND GET MORE OFF.  SAVE TIME AND GO TO ANOTHER TOYOTA DEALERSHIP.  ",1.0
136,"April 14, 2008","We found the vehicle we liked online, called Denise and set an appointment with her.  When we got there she was ready with the vehicle pulled out and waiting.  The vehicle was just as described and when we went in to finalize price they were great to work with.  A week later we had a dead battery.  We called the manager Craig (figuring he would tell us it was ""AS IS"") and he told us to bring it in and he would put in a new battery.  He even gave us as free wash and our next oil change for free.  You will not be disappointed with this dealership.",5.0
137,"June 18, 2004","I visited this dealership twice; once in January of 2004 and then again in June of 2004. Jan. - I spent 20 minutes outside in 20 degree weather looking at their car selection and not one salesperson came to greet me. I went inside and asked why no one chose to offer me assitance and I was told by a young lady that it was simply too cold. I immediately left.June - I returned to this dealership hoping to test drive the Toyota Echo. I didn't like my first experience with them, but hey, if they had the car I wanted to test drive, why not, right?WRONG. I spoke to a salesguy and he seemed pretty uninterested in helping me out when I told him that I was looking for an Echo. He tried to tell me they couldn't get them at all. Instead he offered to sell my a Scion. Sorry, I wanted an Echo. I left and won't return.The internet department contacted me with a low quote on an Echo, but I am afraid this is just another bait-and-switch scam. Maybe, maybe not. Nonetheless, I won't return.",1.5
