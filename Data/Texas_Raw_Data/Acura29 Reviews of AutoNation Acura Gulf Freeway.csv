0,"October 11, 2018","Autonation Acura has been my go to car dealership forr the past five years. The costumer service there is always amazing. The associates were willing to work with me and ensured that I left in the vehicle of my choice.
At times I fluxuated and changed my mind and the service and finance departments were very supportive. 
I just purchased a 2019 RDX off the showroom floor and I couldnt be more excited!
Thank you Autonation Acura for all your help!",5.0
1,"February 21, 2018","Purchased an Acura TL with extended warranty a few years ago. Everytime to go back with a problem, they argue that it is not covered. Then they try to upsell me to buy a new car.  They are not interested in solving customer problems; it all about them making more money off your back.   Bud Peung was service writer and when I complained about the blue tooth covered under warranty, he just made excuses and said his car was loud also.  It wasn't loud with background noise when I bought ir!!!  and they won't fix it!!!!
Went to the Manager, Traci Hendsricks who talked about how good their warranty was.. but didn't care about my problems and even try to come up with a amicable solution.   Complete waste of my time. ",1.0
2,"January 08, 2018",Dustin Daughenbaugh was amazing and is the true example of what an sales experience should be like.  He didn't badger me and answered every email I had in a timely manner-most of the time within minutes.  I've never had this type of customer service and he even offered to bring the vehicle to my office for my test drive.  It doesn't get any better than it did with this gentleman.  We even had a family emergency and he followed up with me to see how everything was going.  I'm impressed beyond belief and being in the finance and customer service industry myself for 20 years-I understand how important that first impression is.  I'd definitely recommend Dustin to anyone who's looking for a vehicle and top notch service! ,5.0

4,"March 28, 2017","Me and my wife have been car shopping for months and talking to all of the dealerships and sales people in the Houston, Austin and Dallas area and this place blew us away! Everyone knows how hard buying a car can be and how mean salespeople can be. This place was great from the beginning. Our fist experience was with one of their sales guys Conor who did a great job Showing us around and Tripp was the second sales guy we spoke to because Conor was out of the office. Tripp really stepped up and helped us get an amazing deal. ABSOLUTELY no pressure to buy and gave us the deal we felt was beyond fair. He spent extra time after we already bought  to make sure me and my wife knew how to work the electronics. Tracy in finance was extremely helpful and had us in and out. I highly recommend this place. Don't spend hours/weeks shopping around! Come here and save yourself some time and MONEY! 

Thank you so much!

5,"July 25, 2016","We really do not like car shopping, but Roger Rodems treated us professionally and was very knowledgeable with our many questions.  We have owned the car now for almost a year, and it has been reliable and fun to drive!  First routine service visit was excellent.  Great customer service!  Thank you all!",5.0
6,"July 07, 2016",I really appreciate the great customer service my husband was given when he was in AutoNation Acura due to our 2014 Acura TL breaking down due to a clogged MAF. The clogged MAF was due to Sterling Acura of Austin not putting my air filter back in my vehicle after a routine oil change.  They were understanding and attentive. We were on vacation when this occurred.  Thank you for assisting for an error made by another Acura dealerships service department.,5.0
7,"March 26, 2016","Sales consultants are quick to push you to fill out a credit application, which can often be detrimental for your credit. The business manager, while running some numbers for me, took personal phone calls in front of me as he worked on the computer (unprofessional). Sales consultant gave me some attitude about me refusing to allow them to do a credit pull before we agreed on a negotiable price. On the day I returned with my checkbook in hand to make a final offer (ready to buy on the spot), the business manager (same as above) was off and asked me to come back two days later (they had other business managers available, one of whom was the used car sales manager, who ended up covering for the new vehicle manager; he was impressive with his service and customer-friendly ways). I sensed a perceived arrogance from the new car business manager, who tried to convince me to come back days later and asked me is I would compromise on color of the car because the color I wanted was hard to find. The sales consultant did follow up with me after the purchase. I got a good deal and cannot deny it, but their customer service needs improvement.",2.0
8,"February 02, 2016","All around 5 star service from the GM, Brian Wilson to our salesman, Collin. I would highly recommend this dealership. They make you feel welcome and you can tell they appreciate your business. From the test drive down to signing I was only there for 2 hours max, they did not waste my time and I appreciate that.",5.0
9,"January 21, 2016",I called to see if they had a car that my son and I wanted to see if they had it available and Conner was very friendly over the phone and we set up an appointment and he had the car ready for us to test drive it and we we ended with a different car and Conner Okeefe made so easy for us and provides Outstanding Custer service!,5.0
10,"January 02, 2016","Just finished the buy of a 2015 TLX.  The whole crew at Acura Gulf Freeway were great.  They know their product and allowed me time to make my decision.  I'm expecting the post-buy experience to be the same, as this will be my go-to dealer for service.  If you're going Acura in the Clear Lake area, these guys are the ones to visit.",5.0
11,"August 03, 2015","I recently purchased a vehicle from AutoNation Acura Gulf Freeway and was truly impressed! I had the pleasure of working with Roger Rodems, who practically had me in and out of there all while remaining professional and informative. Best car buying experience yet!",5.0
12,"June 04, 2015","I bought a certified RDX from AutoNation - The service was excellent and the Salesman, Morris, was a pleasure to work with.  We finally worked out a deal and I have a wonderful new ride, at a great price. Did I mention great customer service which is rare these days,  even after the sale of the vehicle.  Thanks Morris and Acura AutoNation - Keep up the good work!!!  CeCe",5.0

17,"November 07, 2014","I will discribe this as a good deal gone bad. 

1. I found the car I was looking for online. Was instantly contacted by the General Manager Brian.
2. I was out of town so Holly the internet manager took a $250.00 payment over the phone after explaining to me that the payment was refundable if I decided not to purchase the car. 
3. Went in and was treated very well. Worked with Dustin and even put $750.00 more with the $250.00 as a down payment just because.
4. As soon as I mentioned changing my mind due to a potential transmission issue on the car the customer service stopped. Imagine that!!
5. The new finance manager refunded the $750.00 but would not refund the $250.00. He said he will have to talk to Holly first and call me back later that day. Never received any call. But was hung up on by Dustin. I was lied to once again.
6. The old finance manager was no longer working there so when I asked to speak to Holly or Brian neither of them have been available. Dustin explained right before he hung up that he does not handle these issues and will be calling the other customers who want to buy the car. Which I was fine with because it seemed to have a transmition issue. Nothing has been resolved. 

I think the $250.00 was a good price to pay because if its all about the sell God forbid what id had to deal with if I had to take my car in for service. Highly disappointed and would not recommend to am ememy.

Decided to buy from Gillman Acura and they had it together. No back and forth, no lies, professional and knowledgeable. ",2.0
18,"October 14, 2014","If you want an awesome experience in a dealership, visit Gulf freeway AutoNation Acura. You will wish you went there for your first car, and go back for the next one while bringing your friends along. My visit to AutoNation began with a few questions I raised to Holly over the phone and her willingness to organize my visit, and arrange for someone to attend to my needs upon the visit. We met Dwayne at the door who escorted us to Hayley who in turn introduced us to Dwayne as our sales rep. The respect they upheld for each other during the visit was awesome. The transactions ran so smooth, that I did not notice how much time I spend with each one of them. Dwayne walked us through each step of the transaction with a lot of patience. He ensured we understood not only the transaction, but also the functionality of the vehicle. I have never had such a high end and extensive education on a car; I just fell in love with the car after Dwayne was done. He met us at the door and escorted us throughout the process until we were ready to leave. Thanks Dwayne, thanks Michael, and thank you Holly for setting up an awesome experience. I will recommend all of you to my friends and will see you on my next purchase.",4.8
19,"August 18, 2014","Was referred to Derrick Moss from a woman I met at work who had dealt with him previously and highly recommended him because he is efficient, knowledgeable, professional, and didn't try to get over on her like many salesmen do to women.  I was sick and tired of my Cadillac and thought I'd trust her on this and boy I'm so glad I did!  At first, I really didn't think I would be able to afford an Acura with my credit, but he was so patient and thorough in explaining the prices and what I could afford to buy.  Turned out that I was able to get a brand new 2014 Acura TL with my trade-in! While I waited, he made my feel comfortable and at ease with the whole process and even went out of his way to personally wash the car.  He had me in and out in no time with my keys in hand:))

A month later, I accidentally scraped the side of my car (yes I was UPSET needless to say) and all I had to do was give him a call about it. I brought my car in and he handled all the details with the repair with no problems at all.  He even calls me to follow up and schedule my regular oil changes which is great because I'm terrible about remembering that kind of thing. Derrick gave me a true luxury car experience and I continue to look forward to his professionalism and efficiency! ",5.0
20,"December 03, 2013","Went to buy a Honda Accord, the sales was great but the finance manager run my Credit although I told NOT TO. I mentioned to him 3 times I am not interested in his Financing and have my own. Now I have 3-5 inquiries on my credit report that i do not need. be aware of these tactics because they do not care.

21,"May 23, 2013","I could not have asked for a more pleasant car buying experience than the recent one at Auto Nation Acura.  I was looking for inexpensive transportation for my step-daughter, and went to the dealership to see a Nissan Altima I had noticed in an on-line ad.  Through my clothing had me looking anything but prosperous, and I was just looking for an inexpensive vehicle, everyone was friendly, and respectful.

I was quite surprised with the extent of my salesman's, ""Tripp Vail, knowledge of the Altima, and I felt well informed before deciding to purchase the vehicle.  ""Tripp"" was very easy to work with throughout the entire process, and he has done an excellent job or follow-up to show his appreciation of my business, though the sale was a small one.

My experiences with the sales, and finance managers were pleasant as well.

Without hesitation I feel I can recommend Auto Nation Acura, and ""Tripp Vail, with every confidence that you too will have a pleasant car shopping/buying experience.",5.0
22,"April 25, 2013","We just bought our new 2013 Acura MDX from Jeremy Pratt and it was a pleasure dealing with him.  I dealt with all 4 dealers in town (and while I liked one other dealer) he was the most responsive and straight forward sales person I dealt with.  In the end, although we had a little bit lower price from another dealer, I was more confident buying from him.  I knew if there were any issues, he would make it right.  He went the extra mile on the price, response, and installation of accessories.  I have a coworker who also bought from him and said ""it was the easiest car buying experience I have had"".  I can also say it was easy buying from him and Autonation Acura, i have no doubt we got a good deal and will continue to receive excellent customer service.",5.0

24,"January 16, 2013","My visit to Service Department of Champion Acura League City was wonderful. I have had my cars serviced here all the time and every time the service was great and wonderful.  They have website that you can order service in advance and set appointment time to fit your schedule.  You never have to wait here. The place is clean, top-notch dealership with professional people. I bought 2 cars here (a 2010 MDX and a 2010 TSX). My preferred service advisor is Ms. Linh Ngo. She knows her cars and took really good care of her customers. I did not have to explain my problems with the cars. She knows what was going on.  On several occasions I got brand-new 2013 loaner car to drive while waiting for my car to be serviced. Even though I work in Galleria area (45 minutes away) I've always tried to take my car here for service. The service really worths the long drive. Ask for Ms. Linh Ngo. She will take care of you and make you feel proud as an Acura owner.  JC",5.0
25,"January 06, 2013","My spouse, daughter and I were extremely pleased with the professional salesmanship displayed by Albert Merrel.  He was courteous, helpful, and friendly.  He exceeded our expectations.  His no presssure sales approach were welcomed.  We will do business again with dealership because of Albert.  I must also compliment the entire staff including Ruben the Business Manager.  He made the sales process easy.  The service department were very helpful as well.  All in all, a great purchasing experience.  Wish more dealerships could emulate Champion Acura.  ",5.0
26,"July 28, 2011","When we decided to lease a new Acura TL we shopped multiple dealers in person and via the internet.  Some dealers never sent anything, some sent something eventually and some responded right away.  Of those that responded right away, Jeremy at Champion Acura was hands down the most honest, straight-talking salesperson we dealt with.  While others struggled to explain the leases (with responses ranging from ""they can be so complicated"" to ""the way Acura writes their offers is misleading"" we weren't sure if we didn't understand things of if THEY didn't understand things!), Jeremy had no problem explaining things in simple terms and answering every question logically and efficiently.  So we drove 250 miles to League City, Texas, even getting a one way car rental (which Jeremy helped us return when the rental agency wouldn't come pick us up!) and staying the night in a nice hotel to buy from Champion (that's how good the deal was - we could afford that and still saved a ton of money!)  Honestly it almost felt too good and too easy to be true, but it wasn't - everything was fast, and no-nonsense.   We got exactly what were were promised over the phone/email and were in and out in less than an hour with the exact car we wanted at a great price.   It is the way EVERY car dealer should be (and we've bought ALOT of cars so we've dealt with ALOT of dealers).  We I can talk my husband into a new MDX, we will head straight back to Jeremy for sure :)",5.0
27,"December 03, 2010","Deal negotiated over phone with Joe Q.  Best price of all the Houston dealers.   No surprises when I visited the dealership -- all went very quickly, dealer was friendly and honest!  Purchased quite a few additional accessories and all were installed quickly by the service department.",5.0
28,"May 14, 2010","We bought new Acura TL in Jan. We have no problems and are completely satisfied with the service they provided to get us the new car. 

But that day when we were at the dealer that night someone hit our old car and we haven't noticed untill we were home that day. Its so worse that the rear bumper had broken. When we called them to complain regarding this they mentioned they have no surveillance cameras outside to track who hit our car. 

Ofcourse we have got a new good car but also got problems with old one now! Just beware of where you are parking your car!!",4.2
