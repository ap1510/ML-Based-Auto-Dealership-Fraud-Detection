0,"April 10, 2020","Humble Hyundai is not trustworthy. I love the car but can't trust them to perform maintenance services. My engine qualified for a recall. I was expecting a new engine as recalls replace the defective part with a new part. I was told it would take two weeks. It took four. The dealer informed me I received a ""refurbished"" engine. I asked for documentation as to how many miles the ""refurbished"" engine had. They refused to provide that. For all I know I exchanged an engine with 100,000 miles with one that has 200,000. Worse, they may have just ""fixed"" the first engine hoping that would ""solve"" the issue. The point is I don't know and they won't say. Imagine the conversation I will have with another dealer or buyer when it comes time to sell or trade in my vehicle. My odometer says 106,000 miles but since this isn't the original engine I don't know the true mileage. I don't see a buyer giving me any value for my car after that conversation.

I heard from the dealership with 15 minutes of writing a negative Facebook review. I was promised documentation from them stating I received a new engine within 24 hours. Five months later I still haven't received anything. And to kick me while I was down, they installed two new tires because they ran over nails during a test drive. Ok, good service there. Except one of the new tires developed a bulge on the side on my way home. Instead of taking it back, I went to my regular mechanic and paid for a new tire for $115. I'd rather pay than trust them with ""free"" warranty work.",1.0

17,"November 01, 2018","I have looked online for a month on what kind of car I wanted, I had done a lot of research, and got on websites. Right car, family car with lots of space and safety features and what color, You know what you want and it should be what you get.  Albert Prisco got in touch with me, via email and then on the phone.  I drove 100 miles to the Humble Hyundai dealership, and Al greeted me and my son.  I have a special needs son so safety was the main reason I chose to get a 2019 Hyundai Santa Fe SEL Plus in Stormy Sea Blue.   Al was very friendly and answered my questions and I liked that there was no pressure, we looked at the one I had been looking for online, and he gave me a tour of the features, and we took it for a test drive.  The car drove wonderfully, and Al was telling me about the safety features, we checked out the lane assist, and keep lane feature.  Those are really great things to have in a new car, and happy to say we did buy the car at a great price  and picked it up the next day.  We had also meet the other friendly people, from the financing, the nice lady at the front booth, to the people at the service department at Humble Hyundai, and I think I will be seeing them again in the future.",5.0
18,"October 30, 2018","The first person who greeted us was Mr. John ""Coach"" Montgomery; he allowed us to feel comfortable looking around. He let us mention what type of vehicle we were looking for and what was important for us and; then, Mr. Montgomery provided us with very detailed information of the vehicles that we were interested on, paying close attention to what we mentioned to be important for us, specially in terms of security, warranties, economy and performance. The test drive was great, specially since we were able to verify the security features of the vehicle, such as the visual and sound alerts for blind spots. Upon returning to the dealership, we were given some other suggestions of vehicles that could match with our points of interest. Once we decided on the model, we asked him for the price and financial details; he immediately took action and got his manager involved; the agreement was really quick and smooth, there was no need for the typical back and forth ""negotiation"" since we were very clear form the first moment on what we were looking for and our car buying budget; neither the manager nor Mr. Montgomery made us feel under pressure, they both were actually very kind and made us feel comfortable at all times. The person who handled the financial part of the agreement was as kind and nice as them; he answered all of our questions to the very detail. The vehicle was clean and ready for pick up at the previously agreed time. Mr. Montgomery didn't let us leave the dealership until our seats and mirrors were set to our comfort and our cell paired to the car. He also made sure that we know in advance when the first service will be due. We highly recommend Humble Hyundai and their staff as THE PLACE to have an excellent car buying experience.",5.0
19,"October 06, 2018","I wanted the Hyundai Ioniq.  The dealership asked for the sale but did not pressure me.  I committed to buying a car but would not buy the vehicle that day.  The dealership gave me time to think about the purchase and I decided to buy the Elantra instead.  This car just made economic sense for the time being.  John Montgomery did an excellent job as the Salesman and showing me the features of the car.  Overall, I would highly recommend the Humble Hyundai dealership.",5.0
20,"October 02, 2018","This was definitely one of the best experiences we've had at a car dealership. Upon arriving at the dealership, we were greeted by Nolan (salesman). We explained what we were looking for in a car. Nolan directed us to vehicles that would accommodate our needs. We appreciated the 'no pressure attitude'. Nolan gave us plenty of time to consider styles, color, etc. Upon finding a Hyundai we were interested in, Nolan asked if we would like to take a test drive. Before the test drive, he explained features of the car. The outstanding warranty sold us on the car, as well as the comfort, gas mileage, and 'creature features', usually only seen on more expensive cars. We returned a few days after purchasing the car to ask a few questions. Nolan happened to be working that day, and greeted us as we drove up. This was a great car buying experience! Definitely would recommend Humble Hyundai and Nolan to anyone.",5.0

56,"March 03, 2018","Turning 52 years old this year, both kids in college, driving a 10 year old Accent.  It was time for a new car and to hand off the Accent to my daughter.  I had my eye on a Veloster for a year or two.  Danny, et al., at Humble Hyundai made sure this happened and in a very reasonable fashion.  I was skeptical that they would come through on a pretty old trade-in that we had, but they made it work and I was out the door in a couple of hours with the car I wanted.  

Danny took the time to make sure all of our questions were answered and went over, in detail, the multimedia system on the vehicle - which definitely takes some getting used to if this is one's first experience with it.  

All-in-all, they were courteous and professional.  We've also had servicing done on our Sonata at this dealership, and they've taken care of us very well.  We look forward to working with them again soon, as our son will be looking for a car as he gets ready to graduate from college in another year or so. ",5.0

The day I came to purchase the car, everything was done just as he said it would be.  All I had to do was sign about 6 or 7 pieces of paper, write out a check for the price he had quoted me and walked out to my new car. That was the best feeling, Brett was true to his words.",5.0

87,"December 12, 2017","in the last week On November 30th, I walked into Humble Hyundai just to browse.  I really had no intention of purchasing anything that day.  I was greeted by the very friendly (and not at all pushy) Clarence.  When he asked me what it was I was looking for that day, I relayed to him that I was in need of a new car, but didn't necessarily need the latest and greatest.  He assured me that no matter what, I would ""walk out with a smile"" that day.  And, boy, was he ever right!    We discussed and looked at a few different models, including the bright blue car right there on the showroom floor.  He suggested a test drive.   And I kid you not, two minutes into that test drive, I was sold.  It was everything I was looking for and more.  Even though I was nervous, it became very clear to me that Clarence was very good at his job.  He made me feel comfortable, while working quickly and efficiently and less than two hours later... I drove away with a brand new 2018 Hyundai Sonata Limited!  I could not be happier with my new car or with the excellent service that I received from Clarence and the team at Humble Hyundai!

an appointment in 15 minutes I needed to get to so I needed my car back. Its at that point Jessica tells me they can't get my car to pass inspection and asks if they can give me a loaner car so I can get to my appointment. I agreed, she said they would detail and clean the car for all my trouble, and I left thinking I would get my car back the next day, Friday. I waited with no word till It was Tues 5 DAYS! I called to check on my car since I still had not heard a word from the dealership! Jessica says she they got the part in and  would ""try"" to have it done tomorrow, Wednesday. I was angry at how long this is taking and no one bothered to call and tell me what was going on. So I asked her, please CALL me and let me know, keep me posted! She apologized and assured me she would do that. Wednesday came and went, no call, Thursday came and went, still no call, Friday afternoon still no call!! I had my secretary call and tell them I'm coming to get my car NOW!  Oh its done, they tell her. ITS DONE? GGGRRRRR Of course NOBODY called. And when I picked up my car do you think it was detailed..... NOPE! Not one thing that girl said to me was the truth! NOT one thing!
This place used to be great for service till they hired her!! And on a side not that brand new car has something wrong with it, when your in the car 30 minutes you begin to taste something in your mouth and nose. Its like a oil taste, or something. After about an hour especially with the AC running the headache will start pounding in both temples. After about an hour and a half you have to get out of the car! Maybe I'm allergic to some chemical they use in new cars and maybe not. I did have other people in the car and never said a word about this and yet they started commenting about the funny taste they suddenly had in there mouth. One person blamed it on their breakfast. It's not your breakfast I explained, its this car.",2.8

I reviewed some other cars Accord and Optima, but I returned to Hyundai Humble and worked out a no money down 36 mon lease on the Sonata SE. Very straight forward pricing no haggling at all. I ended up getting 15k miles vs standard 12k miles / year for about $13 extra per mo. It's a lot better to prepay the miles instead of paying extra when returning the car ($13x36 = $468 vs 9000 miles x $0.20 = $1,800).  I had the car for 3 mo now and I'm very happy with it.

I liked everything about it, except for the poor visibility out the back right window, which is a big deal to me.

He told me about the blind spot detection and lane change assist features offered on newer Tucson and Santa Fe models, but I could not afford to spend that much money.  Aware that I wanted a Hyundai because of your great warranty program, Will showed me and let me test drive the 2017 Elantra equipped with the blind spot detection and lane change assist features, which got me to thinking about buying another sedan, and a new vs. certified pre-owned vehicle at that.

This is refreshing and honest. The customer recognizes that a dealer who will do a deal by phone and internet is not interested in the ""Old fashioned"" methods of presenting the numbers, but is more interested in presenting the number information straightforwardly. This encourages the buyer because he is in his home where he is more comfortable and not in the dealership where he may experience different pressures.

I was not planning on going through a car buying process that involved sleazy sales tactics and having to fight of all the options that they are trying to sell to you once you get to the finance guy…I have been there..done that…
Well I’m glad that I found Humble Hyundai!
First of all their BBB rating is A+,  where the rest are all between  B and F…go figure..anything to lure you to their dealership and then the BS begins…
I wanted a plain and simple transaction…give me your best price and a good offer on my trade in….no schemes.  Brandon returned my email request with all the detail I wanted and he even followed up with a phone call. When I arrived at the dealership, the vehicle was ready for me to test drive. I was very impressed with the Sonata and all the standard features that came with it.  Brandon’s quote was way below the TMV value and I had to remind Tim in finance that I want to have at least one option on the Sonata!! This was the first time ever that the finance guy didn’t start negotiating on all the options and hidden fees…it was plain and simple….great price plus TTL period!
If you do your research…it’s a no braining at Humble Hyundai is the place to go. I’m looking forward to see the people at Humble Hyundai when I’m going back to get my windows tinted.
If you are looking for a no BS Hyundai dealer get hold of Brandon and Tim at Humble Hyundai!!!  These guys are awesome!!

1006,"January 17, 2011","I just wanted to add an update to my initial review.  Humble Hyundai's service department has to be the worst service dept ever.  I had taken my car in for routine maintenance to abide by the warranty and apparently the only service these supposed techs are capable of is an oil change.  The trouble started at 14,000 miles, I had the anti-freeze flushed/replaced and that day my car started to make a squeaking noise.  Ironic right after servicing, after I took it back to them they stated that the water pump was faulty.  Another 1000 miles later it starts squeaking again, they say the water pump is faulty ... again.  I tell the wonderful service adviser that it is a little odd that another faulty water pump was to blame, mind you I only have 15,000 miles on the car.  So I take their advise and have them replace it a second time, then the car went down hill bad.  My car was in the shop there for a week (for a water pump change), they said ""there is a malfunctioning bolt on the engine"".  At first I thought he was joking but gave the benefit of the doubt.

After they put the second water pump in I notice the car is hesitating on the highway and stumbling, the accelerator would depress on it's on and lose power for about 5-10 seconds randomly.  The fuel economy was shot as well, so I take it back to them and they 'look' at it for a day and tell me there is nothing wrong with it.  I was not happy and requested to test drive it with the service rep and the tech in the car.  On the test drive the service rep stated that he felt it as well but noticed it seemed to happen when 'driving over bumps or depressions' in the road.  So I though we had an understanding, that the problem was noted and they would correct what was wrong.  I leave the car with them another day (and find out they didn't look at it all, it sat in the parking lot with out moving) only to be told the next day that there is nothing wrong with it, they stated that they had a Engineer from North-side Hyundai look at it and again that nothing is wrong. 

I tried to get a second opinion from other shops only to be told that since the car was at 16,000 and still under factory warranty that I should have it serviced at the dealership.  I am a single woman with a young child and this was the first new car I have ever had, I had missed time from work running back and forth to the service department at the Hyundai Humble dealership and didn't have the heart to keep on with these negligent fools at Humble Hyundai and continue to miss time from work only to be told that nothing is wrong so I gave up.  My car ran horribly from 16,000 miles up to 40,000 miles and then finally started leaking oil.  This time I took my car to Hub Hyundai and they found the problem.  Where to start .... the water pump had been put on backwards I kid you not.  The water pump was rubbing against the timing chain to boot.  Now the malfunctioning bolt was a bolt they broke off of the engine putting the water pump on backwards, which fell into the oil pump.  To compensate for the bolt inside my oil pump they had tweaked it by drilling inside the oil pump to make more space for the bolt.  Hub Hyundai replaced the engine block, the water pump and the timing chain.  The car was still under warranty so the money for the work ($6,000) was charged to Hyundai which I am sure was charged back to Humble Hyundai.  Now I am very grateful to Hub Hyundai, my car runs as it should.  Their techs are very competent and knowledgeable, I would recommend Hub Hyundai to anyone for servicing.  These guys are on the ball and efficient.  

Humble Hyundai broke my engine and did not correct their faulty work and were more than happy to let it run that way without acknowledging what they did.  They caused me to miss time from work and lie to me knowing all along there was a bolt in the oil pump and leave me to deal with it.  It all started with a anti-freeze flush at Humble Hyundai.  

I take my car to Hub Hyundai for servicing now and cringe every time I pass Humble Hyundai.  There are no words to describe how horrible they are, including the Northside Hyundai.  

The next new car I get will be from Hub Hyundai, I am 100% percent confident taking my car to Hub Hyundai for servicing, they saved me from unnecessary expenses and gave me piece of mind on the road.

1007,"February 11, 2010","I went into this dealership with the hope of purchasing a new vehicle and was greatly disappointed. I talked to one of the sales guys who stated that they didn't have vehicle that I was looking for and he directed me to another sales guy in another building and stated that he would help me. I spoke to the guy (whose name I never got) and he showed me 2 vehicles. I notified him that I didn't want to spend no more than a certain amount and told him that I would like to get something taken care of ASAP, after about 2 hours there and test driving 2 vehicles we went in to discuss the pricing. On the better of the 2 vehicles it was still out of my range and I told him that he wasted my time. I told him that he knew I upfront what my budget was and that I was not going to go above it and he continued to show me vehicles out of my range without disclosing the price AFTER I asked several times about the pricing while I was driving them. He obviously became upset as well at my response and retorted back stating that I wasted his time as well. After that I got up and left. I will NEVER go there again nor will I ever recommend them.

1008,"January 20, 2010","Bought new car (demo, 5K miles).  They did not disclose car had scratches before sale, only that it was a demo driven by the Gen. Mgr, and ""taken care off"".I asked salesperson before signing documents if dealership would touch up few chips on the car.  He said they would take care of it.  Found a scratch after they took car for tinting and retouching the pre-existing chips.  Dealership general manager claims scratch may have been there all along, but I missed it, or perhaps it was scratched after I took car (I have pictures that don't show scratch).  I told them the car was scratched when they serviced it, but general manager said I could not prove it.  Dealership did pay for a body shop to buff the hood, but they were unable to remove the scratch.  General manager now refuses to repaint hood, even after I offered to contribute small amount towards repainting job.  He said that dealership won't repaint the hood ""on a demo""; he offered to pay $100, but I was responsible to get hood repainted (which will cost at least $300).",1.4
