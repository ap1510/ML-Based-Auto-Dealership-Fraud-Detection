Scammy practices, unreliable vehicle, terrible financing!

My tags are days from expiring and I have yet to be able to get the tags they claim were in their office over a week ago! Save yourself the aggravation and shop elsewhere. ",1.0

2,"November 08, 2019","The staff here is absolutely amazing! They're so kind, knowledgeable, and professional. They really make sure to make you feel like family whether you're servicing or buying a new car, which it was my time to upgrade! I will recommend this dealership to any and everyone looking for a new chevy!",5.0
3,"October 10, 2019","Romeo was my salesman and he went above and beyond his duties to make sure I was taken care of and made me feel at home., before during and after my purchase of my new 2019 chevy sonic. I love my car! Thanks Romeo! I will definitely recommend him to everyone. And even today with me getting service to my car he is making sure I am well taken care of.",5.0
4,"January 22, 2018","Worst experience i've ever had with a GM dealer ever! The lack of follow up on simple emails or phone calls is unbelievable to me. Told my salesperson from the beginning i wanted to buy the car today. Spent the day waiting on him and then when i'm getting ready to drive over there he emails me saying they sold the car?! really! Maybe if Juan would have answered the phone when my credit union called they could have sent over the drafting instructions at the end of the day, had them rushing because of his lack of follow up.",1.0
5,"May 24, 2017",My experience here was great! Andre the rep was especially helpful and answered all my questions and offered helpful tips. I am thinking of returning.,4.6
6,"May 24, 2017",When I walked in I was immediately helped by a sales representative. He immediately helped me through the car buying process. Andre was very helpful and could answer all my questions. I highly recommend him if you choose to go to Young Chevrolet. I had a great experience and would easily recommend this place to family and friends. If you come here you will not regret your purchase and I feel like they have the the best deal possible on my new car ,5.0
7,"May 21, 2017","This place is a JOKE! Do not waste ur time with the service department....Steve Ellason (the so called Service director) is the biggest xxxxxxxx I have ever encountered! I made an online appointment 2 weeks prior to the planned service repairs, I listed all over that appointment a loaner vehicle would be required. When my husband arrives at 10:15am for a 10:30am appointment-all the loaners are gone! I call Darrell, had a few choice words for him and he promises one that AFTERNOON when one came in! At 4:00pm I still had not heard from Darrell so I called to follow up since their department closed at 6pm-he was ""busy"" so I held for him and conveniently he was just about to call me b/c someone had just returned the loaner....my husband picks up the loaner (let me mind u, it only had 6 miles on it-which tells me whoever had that vehicle before us didn't go very far!! LOL) He lied to me-he straight up forgot about us! I let that slide....went to pick up our vehicle the next day, met with the cashier informed her what I was there for. When I reviewed the print out of services completed I noticed the coupon we presented was not applied to the charges-I asked the associate if she could handle that while I return the vehicle to the loaner Dept. she said Steve would have to do it-I suggested she could handle that and I will try and locate the loaner guy. I walked all around that place looking for the ""loaner guy"" to return the vehicle-found him: he said our vehicle showed that it was already checked in-explained to him that I went to the cashier first (maybe she did it) he said ""No! That isn't her department"" Ok, well I don't know what to tell ya-he looks in a file cabinet and says ""Why didn't u sign a contact?"" I informed him my husband dropped the vehicle off, not sure if he did or not. He asked ""who gave us that vehicle?"" I informed him Darrell did....needless to say we did the walk around-done with that! Walked BACK TO THE CASHIER only to discover my coupon will not be applied b/c the services rendered at the dealership are already discontinued!!! Bahaha ðŸ˜‚ I ask to speak with Steve b/c I don't see on BLACK AND WHITE where these discounts are located. After multiple overhead pages and phone call attempts (a good 10-15min) I kindly explain to him the ordeal and just asked to see where my savings are exactly....he is condescending, rude, and appeared completely on the defense when I asked (which leads me to believe he is a scam artist, robbing consumers BLIND and Lord for bid, u ask to use a coupon for 10% off services that HE admitted he put on their website himself) he will attempt to bully u into believing that using a coupon would be combining the discount with other special offers! Haha This dude was comical!!! It gets better, he applied my 10% coupon off my total of $1,726.00 (which should have been about $130-$170-for the MECHANICAL repairs) but he only agreed to $79.00, but I was charged an additional $15.00 for ""supplies"" when that coupon was applied!!! SCAM, SCAM, SCAM!!! Never again! Don't do it! ",1.4
8,"January 14, 2017","First time taking my Corvette to this dealership for an oil change. They honored my coupons and finished the job. I paid and received my receipt and right before I drove off, I went and asked a question about my in-cabin air filter that I installed earlier that morning. I popped my hood open and my hydraulic hood struts NO LONGER WORKED! They never bothered to tell me which angered me! You can't finish an oil change and not notice that!! They made me pay for the parts (I had to argue some more to get them to lower the price!) and they installed them right then and there. Never going back again!! I understand about wear and tear, but to not tell someone about a problem is wrong. They worked fine when I installed my in-cabin air filter a few hours before...Very shady.",1.4
9,"March 29, 2009","Mr. Sibrizi was right on when I showed up after our over the phone coversations. We drove the LTZ Avalanche, he worked me through all the controls, and had my pregnant wife and I out of there in less then 2 hours. Best car buying experience I had ever had.",4.8
10,"March 19, 2009","HORRIBLE! Purchased a used Toyota Sequoia from them in February 2009. They didn't even clean the vehicle for pick up, left the gas tank on empty, had trash inside, didn't fill the tires with air even though the TPMS alert was on and offered me a freaking CHEVY HAT when I complained about all of this. Great Car - HORRIBLE DEALERSHIP - STAY AWAY!!!",1.8
