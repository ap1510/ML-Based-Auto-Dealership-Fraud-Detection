1,"April 26, 2016","I was a interested, and potential buyer. 
On Saturday I spoke with a guy from sales by the name of Kenny. Kenny was very polite over the phone. I showed interest in a 2007 Volkswagen Jetta, and assured that I would purchase. I asked if he could hold, and he said that he couldn't that its first come first serve, and so I ask if I could put a deposit down on it, with me coming from Shreveport, LA I didn't want to make a blank trip. And again he told me that he couldn't hold it that it would be first come, first serve. I contacted the sales department this morning and again I got Mr. Kenny, I asked Kenny if the 2007 Volkswagen Jetta was still available and his reply was that he is going to wait and see if this guy is going to come purchase it today, and after he see if he is going to or not purchase that he would contact me after. Now I called at straight up 8 a.m. the time that Lade Ford open, and this is what Kenny told me after he told me on Saturday that you all don't, and can't hold anything for anybody. But on this morning April 25, 2016 I am as well as my sister is listening being told that he the salesman kenny is holding the 2007 Volkswagen Jetta for a guy. Now sounds to me that he just contradict his self. Any who I don't appreciate the fact that I was lied to, and made felt like my business, and money was not welcome on your Lott. I don't believe in that any place of  business should run like this. 
And for those reasons I am not interested. Thank you, and may God continue to bless your business.
