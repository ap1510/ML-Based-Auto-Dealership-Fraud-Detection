0,"August 06, 2019"," Horrific 4hr experience... do yourself a favor and don't waste your time with these lying, conniving high pressure thiefs. I dropped in to look at a $82K Ford F350 truck that I had found advertised on the internet. I showed them a printed copy of another dealers deal which was $4500 dollars less than theirs and asked them to beat or match it because there truck had a spray in bedliner other than that the trucks were identical.. well they ended up being $7500 more which was 3k less for my trade and $4500 more for their truck all along they said they would match my other deal if I would just sign the form giving them permission to run my credit. Well after the fourth time insisting to run my credit and promising to beat the other deal they got me approved to purchase there truck and did not keep their promise to beat or even match my other offer... begging me to sign the contract with Ford Motor Credit I walked out of the finance office... they would not even honor their own advertised internet price which I had also provided a printed copy.... I was so upset that after driving Ford truck for the last 18 years I went and bought a Chevrolet 3500 four days later. Not only did I trade my 2017  F-350 in but I also traded my 2017 Mustang GT in on the Chevy. I also sold my 2016 Mustang GT-350 on the internet.... so upset I got rid of all 3 of my Ford vehicles and will never go back due to the way I was treated at Auto Nation Ford.... I hope nobody ever has to endure the lying and horrific way I was treated and I also hope the salesman and the sales manager both lose their jobs.................................. ",1.0
1,"June 06, 2019","Just bought our vehicle from this dealership, and our experience with their staff was fantastic!  Chris Purtell, our sales associate, was simply the best. He facilitated an introduction for an ongoing direct relationship with an Asst. Service Mgr. and also made direct introductions to the Service Dir. and Sales Mgr. Gary Anderson, our Financial Service Mgr., stayed several hours after closing with Chris to accommodate our schedule and ensure our deal was done with optimal promotional incentives. Loved the personal touch  i.e., ensured our Loaner had a full tank of gas as well as our purchase when picked up.",5.0
2,"September 11, 2018","Brought vehicle in to address loud, reproducible, and acknowledged noise under truck. Service contact was able to hear noise and reproduce. Was told that there is a diagnostic process that would take place upon drop off. Was contacted shortly after drop off and informed nothing will be done for my issue. Was told that sometimes on other trucks, he has been able to repair noise and sometimes the repairs do not address the noise, but that for me, nothing will be done. Was told that all Ford trucks make this noise and that I need to deal with it as Autonation will not be addressing noise. At check-out received bill for diagnostic time of under warranty visit. Check-out attempted to call service contact to front and he never appeared. She agreed to not charge me for diagnostic time that was billed to me. I no longer enjoy my vehicle and feel that it is unsaleable for no one surely would be satisfied with an ever present knocking sound that I am told is unrepairable and told that every Ford truck has. I have not been able to find another Ford truck or speak with another Ford truck owner that has this noise present.",1.0
3,"April 18, 2018","I've been dealing with AutoNation for 6 weeks now. I went in with an approved application and it still took 7 hours to complete the sale, without getting my car cleaned. I bought a 2017 certified pre-owned  which you would think would not have issues out the door, I was wrong. Trying to get them to address the issues was a nightmare. I finally had to go to their corporate headquarters to force them to address the issues. I picked up my car late at night so I didn't see the damage that was done to my car while it was in the shop. They only shrugged when I brought it up. Now finance, 6 weeks after the fact, is coming back to me requesting information. Once again, it's back to corporate headquarters I go because I'm sick to death of them not being able to manage their own business. ",1.4
4,"January 23, 2018","The dealership and staff lack in committing a service experience worth returning. The advisor failed to call in and claim a extended warranty claim and told us it was a non covered item charging us over $2000.00 in repairs. After further research and a call into the extended warranty company myself, I find out that the repairs should have been covered. I did call to speak with the service manager with no resolution or explanation and the general manger and has not returned my phone call. 
DO NOT GO TO AUTONATION",1.0

6,"August 11, 2017","Bought a used Ford Excursion, paid cash- paid to have leather put in it- All of this was done at about 3 pm on Thursday, August 3rd, 2017. I was promised delivery of my vehicle on the following Wednesday, August 9th, 2017. C. Smith- the sales person lied through his teeth. I had to call on the way to the dealership on Wednesday to find out the Truck wasn't ready. I was told at that point by Mr. Smith it would be done Thursday by end of day...  Long story short it wasn't... So Again Mr. Smith the Sales person at AutoNation Ford in Fort Worth assured me- ""It'll be done by  Friday, August 11th, 2017. Now I'm being told it won't be done until Monday, August 14th. THAT'S AN 11 DAY SALES PROCESS???? I will not ever do business with Mr. Smith or AutoNation again. Total disgrace to the car buying process. ",1.2
7,"July 19, 2017","I love this dealership.  My wife and I have purchased 2 vehicles from them this year!  Their sales team and financing are great.  In the past we have been a Chevy family and it has been so stressful and a terrible experience across the board.  We are now a Ford Family with a New Expedition and F150.   AutoNation Fort Worth is Fun, Professional and Accommodating.  Go see Christine Caselli.  She is great to work with and easy going.  We never felt pushed into anything.  She is a great Salesperson.  Also, my wife has hated taking her vehicles in for service.  She has always had bad experiences.  She took her new Expedition in the AutoNation Fort Worth for its first service recently and went out of her way to let me know how great and nice they were.  She set an appointment and was done in about an hour.       ",5.0
8,"July 16, 2017",Kris the sales manager was awesome! He beat a competitors price significantly and helped to get me in the ride I wanted. Christine Caselli was a great sales both at the dealership and since I've had the vehicle. Very straight forward and helpful! I would absolutely buy here again. ,5.0
9,"June 08, 2017",So impressed with Collin the used car sales manager!!! Never thought the day would come that I could truely say I was impressed with a car dealership! He has gone above and beyond and wouldn't ever trust anyone like I have come to trust him. Truely cares about the customer. ,5.0

11,"April 22, 2017","Christine Caselli is awesome & our buying experience was great.She gave us all the vehicle info up front, no tricks or no haggle. She answered our email, made an appt & 2 hours later I drove my new vehicle home. Easy & smooth sailing throughout the whole deal. Go see Christine, she's the BEST!!!",5.0
12,"March 09, 2017",Service Center (and Manager) claimed there was no way to repair the portion of the bumper guard that continues to come loose and that it is caused by driving habit instead of manufacturing design. Our Explorer is still under Ford warranty.  We will never buy another car from Ford AutoNation nor will we recommend it to any of our friends.,1.5
13,"February 16, 2017",They have a great staff. Process is quick . I recommend you ask for Christine caselli. She was friendly found me the car I wanted quickly and answered every question you can think of when purchasing a vehicle. ,5.0
14,"January 03, 2017","Demetrius Oliphant was the guy who sold my family our car. What an amazing guy. I walked in he greeted my daughter and I, I told him what I was looking for. He said no problem, I can find what you need. And in no time he found it! It was not in the lot but he got it delivered within a day so that I can test drive it. He made all the paper work easy and didn't take up much of my time or my families time. We love our car. Demetrius will be someone
I always recommend.",5.0
15,"January 03, 2017","The staff at this dealership are awesome! They stayed on Christmas Eve to help us find the perfect truck. Mr. Stovall was a pleasure to work with. Mr. McLain made the finance fast and easy. The manager, Gil, made sure that we left happy. Thank you all!",5.0
16,"January 01, 2017",I would like to say this was one of the easiest buying experiences I have ever had. I would recommend Kristopher Stovall to anyone interested in buying a new auto. I was upfront about not wanting to be frequently and I would call when I was ready to talk seriously. Kris honored my wishes and after months we made the decision to purchase and glad I stayed with Kris.,4.4
17,"December 31, 2016",My experience at Autonation Mazda was just awesome. I got a very nice trade in appraisal online which they honored and their low cost CPO Mazda was also a no haggle price. David Aldred was an amazing 0 pressure sales guy who got me on an 8 mile test drive in all sorts of road conditions. I was in and out in 2 and half hours which is pretty amazing when buying a car. Gary the finance guy was a bit pushy on the extended warranties but that's the only con. Really recommend this place and David.,4.8
18,"December 31, 2016",Great experience with Kris. He was very helpful and I could tell he genuinely cared about my wife and I. I searched all over the metroplex and am very happy I ultimately decided to work with Kris. ,5.0
19,"December 30, 2016",Arlene was fantastic to work with on our puchase. We worked on email and the phone since I was driving over four hours to get there. she had everything ready and it was the  quickest I have ever made a purchase. Beautiful Car and a great price. Thank You,4.8
20,"December 28, 2016",Every time I go in for service I take my lunch. I enjoy my lunch and the next thing I know my car is ready. Such a cheerful group of people. ,5.0
21,"December 26, 2016","From the first conversation with Christine to selecting the right vehicle online and to arriving at the dealership, Christine has been amazing. The process of buying a vehicle was stress and worry free. Really felt like i was talking to a friend, rather than a sales person. She really made sure i was happy and well taken cared of.
If you are in the market of purchasing a vehile, please come down and speak to Christine. ",5.0
22,"August 11, 2016", I drove 40 miles for a car that was already sold. I had it with Arlene Kress  he told me that the car was there she has even later her hands on. Next day and when I got there she wasn't even working.  What really makes me mad is I called before I came and the receptionist did not tell me that she wasn't there.   I could've saved a trip if she would just told me that the car was sold the previous day. It's the same old bait and switch.  Run from this dealership. ,1.0
23,"December 28, 2015","Everyone knows how painful and time consuming buying a new car can be. First contact was established online with the dealership's internet department. They answered all my questions and provided all details I needed to do my research prior to my dealership visit. As promised, the vehicle we were communicating about was on site and all previously provided details were correct. After agreeing on the financials we were even provided lunch by our point of contact Yahya while the paperwork was being prepared. Based on this experience I can recommend this dealership and our salesman Yahya.",5.0
24,"October 15, 2015","Christine Harris made my vehicle buying experience fantastic. She was very knowledgeable and brought a very refreshing and energetic attitude. If I could afford buying a vehicle every week, I would do so - just for the exceptional customer service.",5.0
25,"August 03, 2015","I made an appoint a week ahead of time because I told them need my truck for work. After taking my truck in at the appointed time it took THREE DAYS for them to put it on the rack to look at. The service manager, Kevin Larson, gave me his ""Direct Number"" which I called several times over the days and he did not return my messages.",1.6
26,"May 12, 2015","I bought my car in 2014, this company is the WORST company I have ever worked with.  I would not recommend anyone to go there.  
I also get oil changes every 6 or so months with take a mini of 3 hours.  Worst service ever",1.0
27,"January 06, 2015","Initial inquiry was quickly responded to by Chris S at the dealership.  Dealer would not move on the price at all but figured it would be worth it if the service was first rate.  Was told service records and inspection report were available with used cars - never saw them.  For some reason they insisted on sending the car to the Scottsdale dealer for pickup which complicated things greatly.  I have purchased a number of cars out of state and they were simply put on a truck and delivered to me - not here.  Car arrived (finally) in good shape but local auto nation sister company in Scottsdale was as confused as I was about what needed to be done with tax, license, etc.  Once sale was made communication and response dropped off quickly (shocker).  Once I got car home noticed windshield washer tank was leaking all over the floor.  Sent a note to salesman requesting reimbursement for the issue and was promptly ignored.  All in all I would say pass on doing any business with this dealership until they can see past the sale and orient toward long term and solid customer relationships.",1.6
28,"December 22, 2014","Please do not do business with these guys.  The finance department sells things that are not delivered.  I bought an extended 80,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty for my 2014 Mazda 6 that had 25,000 miles on it.  With the warranty, the vehicle was about as much as a new one, but I thought ok that makes up for it...but after 4-6 emails and about that many phone conversations, it is nowhere to be found.  All I can guess is that it was just a theft of a way to relieve me of about $1500 and then there was the maintenence agreement.  I was sold one of those that I finally got.  I was told all my maintenence for 5 years was covered.  Well when I finally got it, it said I had up to 10 oil changes for up to 5 years.  That was for $550.  Of course, nobody in their right mind would buy 10 oil changes that far in advance at that price and especially if you lived far from the dealer, as I do.  Finally, I also purchased the interior and exterior package since I am planning a move near the Texas coast.  Now, I still do not have any kind of warranty on that, just a box with a wax or something like that for the exterior.  I am not even sure at this point if they did in fact coat the exterior and interior with any kind of protection since they have lied about all else.
Ok.  I have now completed 4 reviews.  If I get a full refund for my vehicle tomorrow, I will post that, otherwise it is off to the attorney general's office and the lawyer.  I have already given them way too many chances.
If you have been ripped off by these people, do not sit down and take it.  Go to the AGs office and file a complaint.  This is clearly criminal.  The Uniform Commerical Code clearly states that a consumer merely must have the capacity to be deceived to be award triple damages.  If these guys have done this to 1,000 people like they did me, or 2,000 half as much as me, they have stolen $2million.  That is a lot of incentive to a thief.
Please check the Better Business Bureau.  There have been  a large number of complaints on this company.  For every one that is reported there are many, many unreported ones.",1.7
29,"April 01, 2014","After doing a complete diagnostic due to engine light being on, I was promised it could be completely repaired for a cost of about $1300.00.  Being the car was a 2004 Tribute with 150,000 miles, I was hesitant about putting that large sum of money into it.   I was assured the car will be fine after repairs.  Being 1300 miles from home I said OK.  Two days later and less that 300 miles, the car had to be towed back to Auto Nation Ford in Fort Worth Tx..  A day later they told me it would cost over $ 7000.00 to repair.  I said NO and asked for a refund of the $1300.00 for the work they did which they guaranteed would fix my car 3 days earlier.  They refused.  Due to this dealership, I not only lost $1300.00 but also the car which was not drivable. I had to leave the car there and get a rental car to get back home in Illinois.",1.6
30,"March 05, 2013","My wife & I wanted the best truck for the best price that we would be using for transporting horses. AutoNation asked us what we were looking for and the target price we were trying to deal with. Jason Applegate and the folks there were very professional, accommodating, friendly and worked very well together. When we wanted something a little different from what was on the lot, they had exactly what we asked for transported in at the price that we agreed upon with the requested upgrades.
Jason Applegate and his associates that we dealt with were most interested in our satisfaction.
We will recommend AutoNation to our friends and associates that they should go to this dealership.",5.0
31,"June 29, 2012","I went in expecting Xplan pricing which I qualify for with my employer. The salesman offerred me three different prices, all higher then the Xplan pricing I am supposed to get and higher than even their website advertised that exact car (I verified the stock number). It took me telling them I was leaving for them to supposedly give me their best deal and it was still higher than it should be and their website. The whole point of the Xplan pricing is to remove the haggling. The price is published on the Ford partner website and that is the price I am supposed to get plus any ""dealer additions to the model"". I sent an email pointing what the cost should be and am waiting for an answer.  I don't appreciate the haggling and the time wasted trying to get the pricing I qualify for.",2.0
32,"June 13, 2012","Ben Sornet made my buying experience very pleasent and was pressure free.  I was treated nice and got a fair deal on my purchase.
The other dealerships I have been at need to take lessons from Bankston and their sales persons.",5.0
33,"October 25, 2011","Short Version: We were treated extremely rudely here for absolutely no reason and would never buy a car from these people. If the sales staff behaves like this I hate to imagine how the service department would treat you if you had a complaint.

Long version: I'm going to tell the entire story, it's very long but you should read it if you're considering buying a car from them (or in Fort Worth in general). 

I am helping my mother shop for a new vehicle. Some people hate car shopping but I'm not one of them, I get excited going from place to place looking at vehicles, doing test drives, and narrowing down the search. I'm a very positive and easy to get along with car shopper, I don't approach car salesmen as bad guys and I don't have unreasonable expectations on price movement. 

I had taken my mother to look at some CPO (certified pre-owned) Lexus, BMW, and Toyota sedans and SUVs, as well as a Toyota pickup. My mother wanted to stop at the Ford dealership too, I agreed we could but reminded her we had an appointment with the Audi dealer to test drive a CPO A6 in downtown Fort Worth. We stopped anyway because even though she was leaning toward a sedan at this point, she still wanted to drive the F-150 (she had had a 1997 F-150 about 10 years ago and loved it). The salesman (John something, said to call him JB), came out into the parking lot and was immediately off-putting. Telling us what we should buy instead of listening to what I was telling him we were interested in, but he convinced us to take a test drive. During the test drive one of the other dealers we had gone to see called us back about financing and I took the call and told him I'd get back to him after our test drive.

Flash forward to the end of the test drive, we return to the Bankston lot and everything is fine, I ask the salesman to give us a minute to discuss what we think about the truck and to return the call to the other dealer, I suggest to JB (the salesman) ""Maybe you could get a price quote for us while we discuss what we think real quick."" he says ""Sure! I'll be inside, ask the receptionist if you can't see my office from the door!"" and leaves us to talk. My mother loves the truck, much to my surprise because I thought the ride was very rough compared to the Tundra we had driven, though the options for price were better. My mother has decided she wants to get a price from JB and that she might buy this truck instead of a sedan. I insist we at least make it to our appointment at the Audi dealer for our test drive, I want her to experience all the various options in vehicles before buying anything.

It is currently 5:30 and we are about a 30 minute drive away from the Audi dealership that closes at 7. 

We go inside and find JB milling around the front desk talking to another salesman. JB waves us over and we go into his office and sit down, I tell him (and I'm quoting myself directly here and I said it with a smile and politely):

""Hey JB, we've got about 15 or 20 minutes for you to give us your best price on this F-150 because apparently the Audi dealership closes at 7pm and this is our last day of test drives before we make a decision so we need to squeeze that in.""

JB stops what he is doing, takes his hands away from the keyboard, stops smiling, and looks directly at me and says ""Well then you can go. Maybe you can come back when you have time to buy a car."" in a very austere tone.

I was a little shocked and a lot pissed, his tone was completely inappropriate, even if the statement was only mildly rude. My mother stuttered a bit in surprise and said ""You don't want to sell me this truck?"".

JB: ""Well I'm not going to be rushed. If you don't have time to buy a car then you can go. You're welcome to come back when you do have time."" 

Me: ""Ok thanks for your time."" (I'm angry now but I smile and keep my voice pleasent.)

My mother: (still clearly shocked and confused) ""I don't understand, you don't want to give me a price on this truck before we go?""

JB: ""If you want to give me your time, I can give you a price but I'm not going to sit here and have you tell me I have to do it in 15 minutes or less.""

At this point I am standing up and outside his office telling my mom to come on and we'll leave. My mother gets up and follows me out looking very shocked that this guy who is supposed to be selling us a truck, who we have spent the last 30 minutes on a test drive with talking about vehicles and our families, is now being so openly hostile in tone, body language, and general attitude and refusing to even give her a price quote on a brand new truck he talked her into buying (when we came in we were asking about CPO). We get to the door and she turns around and says to JB, who is standing cross-armed across the room staring daggers at us, ""You really are going to run me out of here instead of selling me a truck?"" and JB simply turns his back on us and walks out of sight. My mother looks at another employee (I think a salesman, same shirt as JB) and says ""I was going to buy a truck! He's running me off!"" the other guy just stared at us looking bewildered so we left.

About 15 minutes later my mother had gone from confused to offended and angry and so I called information and got the number for the Bankston Ford and Mazda dealership and called back and ask to speak to the sales manager. I told him the story, exactly as I have told it to you. The sales manager said he didn't understand what had happened or why and that he would talk to JB and call me back. I told him if he wanted to have a different salesman come up with a price and call us back, we were still interested. The sales manager took my name and cell phone number and said he'd get back to me soon. No one ever called me back to explain anything, much less to offer an apology and a price on that truck.

I would strongly encourage you to look elsewhere for your car needs. I own a vehicle from a nearby Frank Kent dealership and my experience with them, while not perfect, was much much better than at this Bankston.

We also spent a lot of time at a Sewell pre-owned Lexus lot looking at their offerings and were treated exceedingly well by them. I have never been treated better by anyone than I was by the people at Sewell Lexus Pre-Owned (our sales associate was Scott H. and I fully encourage you to ask for him). We also visited Autobahn BMW and were treated very well by Ben there and we went across the street from them to Fort Worth Audi where Jeff and Collin and Mitch all helped us decide that we're probably going to buy that CPO Audi A6 we drove. We also dealt with Daniel at Toyota of Fort Worth and were very pleased with our experience there.

I hope I've give you enough information and enough options that you never feel the need to stop foot on a Bankston lot. Good luck in your car search.

34,"July 30, 2011","This dealership has done nothing but disappoint me from the start.  First, the high-pressure finance department attempts to sell and pressure you into all types of useless warranties.  The service department is the worst I have every seen.  After a blow-out tire at 70+ MPH, I investigated my remaining tires to find uneven tire wear.  Next, I reviewed my oil change receipts to ensure my tires were being properly inflated.  This is where I found the dealership was under-inflating my tires by 5 psi on each oil change!
The next issue I had with the dealership: I picked my car up from a routine oil change to find that it had dents all down the driver side door and rear door.  The dealership refused that they did it and accused me of trying to get a repair for free.  After much haggling, they finally repaired the door, but you can still see ""waves"" in the door.  I refuse to ever set foot in this dealership again.",1.6
