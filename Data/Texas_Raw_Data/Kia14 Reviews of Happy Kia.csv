They had me sign 2 contracts still not getting my vehicle financed nor did they give my down payment back. They sold a vehicle without the title. They blocked me in & called the cops on me when they were in the wrong! In which I was FREE to leave. They have offered me money to bring the vehicle back. They lied about going to finance the vehicle in house. Happy kia is just PLAIN OLD PATHETIC & NEEDS TO bE OUT OF BUSINESS!",1.0

3,"December 02, 2019","If I could give a lower score I would. I purchased my new 2019 Kia Sportage in March 2019. I called and asked if they price matched because they had the same vehicle listed for 19,999 at Classic Kia, I was told yes they do. I traded in my vehicle as a down payment. Which they tried to screw me on the price and then the Sales manager Ryan came over and tried to act like they were doing me a favor. After being there for over 2 and 1/2 hours we finally agreed on a car note amount. I went in to see the finance guy. He had the contract folded over to where you couldn't see anything and told me to sign. They were just going to send this in for now since the finance company was closed and he would try to get me a better interest rate when he gets back on Wednesday, since he was over Tuesday. I was not able to leave with a copy of the contract. They finally mailed me a copy of the contract a week later. They did not give me the vehicle at the price match of 19,999, but at 24, 000. I called and spoke to Honda finance people and told them what they did. The finance people called and spoke to Ryan about it. Who in turn called me and left me a voicemail yelling and cussing at me. He asked me to come in so we could talk about it. He told me they would give a free 3 year full maintenance on my vehicle and a spare tire with kit. Which brings me to my next problem. I brought my vehicle in for a routine oil change on 11/22/19 and to have my driver side tire looked at because I had to keep putting air in it. The service guy tells my dad after waiting over 2 hours for my car that there was a nail in the tire and it would cost $25 to fix. He calls me at work and spoke to tech and told him it should be covered in my service contract. He looks and they can't find any record of it. I speak to the general manager Art. He tells me that the previous gm was no longer there. I explain to him what happened when I bought the vehicle he then proceeds to tell me that they don't offer those contracts and basically that I was lying. I told him to speak to Ryan and Mike the finance guy. He said he would and get back to me. It is now Dec 2nd and I still haven't heard from him. But the thing that ticks me off the most is they never fixed my tire. I drove 2 hours to my family's house for Thanksgiving and could have ended up stranded or stuck on the side of the ride in Houston with my kids trying to put on my donut.  I will never to business with these LYING, CHEATING snakes every again!!!! ",1.0
4,"October 29, 2019", Me and My Husband Purchased A Car From Here And We Are Not Happy With This Car We Have! They are not working with us either to put us in something better for all our troubles we have gone through since getting this vehicle!! Vehicle was in the shop 4 days after purchasing it!! Plus their not even accredited by the better business bureau! This has been a very Stressful process for us and all we want is another vehicle that works!! But seems to us all they want to  do is give us a hard time! So We Are Truly Not Happy Customers!!,1.0
