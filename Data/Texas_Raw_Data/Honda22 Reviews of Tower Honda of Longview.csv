0,"March 08, 2020","The purchasing experience was pretty typical. But after making your purchase you're pretty much given the cold shoulder when you spot out safety flaws on tires. Apparently having chunks of rubber missing from low profiles tires is not a ""SAFETY ISSUE"" IM pretty sure staff at tower Honda wouldn't dare let their loved ones go out on the highway with rubber missing from the sides of their tires. It's pretty sad because I have other family members looking for vehicles as well. This dealership may have just lost more potential customers over tires. What a pity!

I love recommending businesses that do right.  Not just from initial purchase but after as well
What's the point in having a 3 month 3,000 mile warranty?

I drove 5 hours from my another state to only find out after purchasing nothing else matters.ü§¶",2.0
1,"February 18, 2020","Danny Benage, General Manager,Ken Bachus, Service Manager  and Shannon Gonzalez, Service Advisor have all managed to show me that all this dealership is interested in is sales. After sales servicing has been shoddy and slipshod, often being met with ""can't duplicate, can't fix, not covered or just plain old slapshod maintenance, requiring multiple trips to have repaired properly. Danny Benage's latest ""cure"" is to trade in my 2019 Insight for a new vehicle ""that I might like better"". He totally misses out that what I would like better is quality service, not excuses and blowoffs. ",1.2
2,"September 26, 2019","I will be buying a Honda CR-V tomorrow from Honda of Fort Worth.
I started negotiating with several dealerships but Tower Honda was completely uninterested in negotiating the price.
I ended up buying the vehicle from Honda of Fort Worth for a few thousand less than the lowest offer from Tower Honda.
The offer from Tower Honda was basically MSRP.",1.0
3,"May 02, 2019","I bought a Honda because they are affordable, stylish vehicles that get great gas mileage.  This dealership has been wonderful and fair.  The service department is the best that I have ever dealt with.  I feel like they are trustworthy and not trying to stick me with unnecessary maintenance or repairs.  They do what they say they will do and there are no surprise charges.",5.0

5,"November 22, 2017","Get ready because this is about to be a very bad and long review. PLEASE READ UNTIL THE END. IT WILL CHANGE YOUR MIND ABOUT THIS DEALERSHIP I HOPE. I have purchased 2 vehicles from this dealership. The first one was when it was Fenton Honda and the second was when it became Tower. First purchase with Fenton went very well. In 2016 I went into Tower to purchase a new 2016 Accord. It was TERRIBLE. It was literally about a 6 hour process. There were times we stood up and was going to walk out. Finally it was over‚Ä¶I drove off in my 2016 Accord. On Friday November 10th my husband and I went out and about all day in Longview. I wanted to drop by Tower and see if the 2018 accords had arrived since I knew the body style was going to change and I was curious as to what they would look like. I wasn‚Äôt going to put names out there but I really feel like I should only because if I was reading reviews (which I did) I would want to know who to deal with and not to deal with. We got out and was met by Jerrard. We started talking a little about the cars and I started explaining my situation. I told him that I was satisfied with my accord but I liked the new body style on the 2018. The whole 20 minute conversation, he was very dry with us and didn‚Äôt seem interested in our business. We told him ahead of time that we had our own financing and we said what I would pay for the car and what I would take for MY car. We told him up front that we WAS NOT going to play the back and forth game. If they couldn‚Äôt give what we asked, then so be it. It was no big deal. We left and he called my husband about 30 minutes later and of course‚Ä¶.he started playing numbers. They literally talked for 1 minute. The following Monday, November 13th, I received an email from a lady named Casey asking me to call her to give my feedback on my visit. So I did. I explained to her that it was very different. That Jerrard was very dry and didn‚Äôt seem interested in dealing with us. She apologized and said she would speak with him. She stated that Jerrard had called my husband earlier that morning. She stated she would let me know something shortly. Later that afternoon at 1pm, my husband received a phone call. Same thing‚Ä¶the number playing game and they said they would call us back. Our bank at this time had received a quote and I was talking with them. I went home and started looking at my paperwork on my 2016 accord and had a line item I was concerned about. I called Tower and spoke with Brian. He was nice on the phone and answered my question. He started looking at my notes I guess and was questioning me why I was looking elsewhere instead of dealing with them. I told him that there was another car exactly like I wanted for less. He said he didn‚Äôt understand why they would let me leave for just a few thousand dollars. I ended the conversation and asked my husband to tell Jerrard to call me bc I wanted to know some of the numbers they had down. He called and said ‚Äúit‚Äôs a good thing you called bc they were done with you until you talked to Brian.‚Äù He discussed numbers and he said he would call me the next day. The next day, Tuesday, I received a call from our bank and they stated that they were given the wrong VIN number TWICE. So I called Casey. She said she didn‚Äôt know what was going on and said she would call me back shortly.  WELL‚Ä¶.. that was TUESDAY and I didn‚Äôt hear from anyone until SATURDAY. Jerrard called my husband to let us know that the car I liked was delivered. My husband told him that he needed to call me because I was very upset with the customer service. When I got on the phone with him, I told him I was upset with how things were going. I told him it was Saturday and our bank was closed so there was nothing I could do until Monday. He said OK and hung up. On Monday November 20th, I spoke with our bank and they finally had the correct VIN number. We got the numbers right with everything. I sent Jerrard a text to let him know that my husband and I would be in the following morning. He said ‚ÄúOk.‚Äù After all of this, I‚Äôm still stupid enough to go up there. So Tuesday we got to the dealership at 12:30pm. I parked my car and NOBODY EVEN DROVE IT OR LOOKED AT IT. I drove the NEW car with Jerrard and he didn‚Äôt explain much of anything. We all sit down and start going over the paperwork so it can be submitted to our bank. We get back in a finance office with Lenny. He starts printing out the odometer papers on both vehicles. They had my mileage wrong on my 2016. My husband corrected him and Lenny said he would change it. Even with the mileage going up, the numbers on the car didn‚Äôt change. (We told Jerrard numerous times the correct mileage and he obviously didn‚Äôt care.) So‚Ä¶..the papers got faxed to our bank. My husband left and I waited in the lobby until my new car was finished with the detail and all. I waited from 1:45pm-3:30pm. The WHOLE ENTIRE TIME I sat and listened to the General Manager (DannyBenage) talk with other people. (Employees and some other guy that I think they did trades with or something.) He obviously started looking at my paperwork and didn‚Äôt seem too happy about it. He realized he wasn‚Äôt going to make anything off of us. I heard the word ‚ÄúF**k‚Äù come out of his mouth about 100 times. It made me so uncomfortable that I literally had to get up and walk around and even just go outside. My new car finally came around and I got everything inside it. Jerrard was already dealing with another couple that he was having trouble with as well. (The same older couple that I overheard the general manager talking bad about.) I had to interrupt and tell Jerrard that my new car was on EMPTY. He asked another employee to please let me follow him and fill my car up. That employee was Cornelius. As I was getting ready to leave‚Ä¶.I got no excitement out of Jerrard. It‚Äôs like he didn‚Äôt even care that he just sold me a BRAND new car. So I left and went to the gas station. There is when Cornelius I guess realized that I was looking around at the car and didn‚Äôt seem to know much about it. He asked me if anyone explained or showed me any of the features. I told him no. He asked me to pull around and he would show me everything I wanted to know. He was so nice and answered any question I had. I left and was on my way. As I was driving, I just had this bad gut feeling and knew I made the wrong decision. I just traded my 2016 that had sooooooo many more features on it than the new one did. I got home and told my husband that I was unhappy and I explained everything that happened at the dealership after he left. Let‚Äôs just say he wasn‚Äôt happy. At this point, we haven‚Äôt even signed papers with our bank yet‚Ä¶..that‚Äôs where we got so LUCKY. THANK GOODNESS. My husband called the dealership at 5:50pm and asked to speak with the general manager Danny. When Danny got on the phone, my husband told him that we was bringing the new car back at that moment and was getting my 2016 back. Danny said he would be there waiting for us. When we arrived shortly after 6pm, there was about 5 men standing around like cattle LOL. My husband saw Cornelius first and THANKED him for being the ONLY person that would help me that day.  We walked in and it was immediately attacking everyone. My husband was of course putting his opinions and thoughts on the table and explaining how he felt. He told Danny that he didn‚Äôt appreciate him cussing in front of me as much as he did. My husband told him that they all needed customer service and that we had purchased 2 vehicles in the past and was about to have 3 but they would never have our business in the future. They bickered back and forth for a second and then my husband went and got my car. I walked out and all the men followed. I tried to explain to Danny what all the issues were since my husband was upset and not saying what all needed to actually be said. My husband then started telling Danny that he would never cuss in front of Danny‚Äôs wife and he didn‚Äôt appreciate the fact that he did it so much in front of me. Danny‚Äôs reply was ‚Äúpoint taken.‚Äù My husband then in a sentence dropped the ‚ÄúF‚Äù word. Danny then said, ‚Äúso it‚Äôs ok for you to cuss in front of your wife but it‚Äôs not ok for me?‚Äù I told my husband to just get in the car and we drove off. Bottom line, the overall experience was so unbelievably horrible. I will never in my life go back to Tower Honda in Longview. They are all the most disrespectful people ever. To just sit and hear the general manager talk so bad about people is just horrible. The only thing good I want to come out of this LONG review is Cornelius. I feel like he should be credited for his kindness. If you go to Tower Honda, just know you are going to be possibly treated like I was and not feel welcomed. I will ALWAYS own a honda accord however, MY business is now elsewhere from here on out.  ",1.0
6,"September 27, 2017","I have owned 3 previous Hondas, so I knew exactly what I wanted and what I expected to pay for a new CR-V, less my trade in of a 2012 CR-Z. I spoke with Carlos Gonzalez before I went to the dealership and told him what I wanted to trade in and which new Honda I was interested in purchasing. I am a female accountant who knows what she wants and I have high expectations on the type of service I want from a dealership. I have purchased new Hondas in Phoenix, AZ and Dallas, TX so I have some experience with other Honda dealerships. 

Tower Honda, my salesman, Carlos, and the sales manager, Chris not only met my expectations, they exceeded them. I got there at 10:45 and drove out at 1PM with the exact model and color of CR-V that I wanted at a fair price. Plus, a two seat, standard shift CR-Z is not a popular car, especially in E Texas. They gave me a very fair trade in for my old Honda.

7,"September 22, 2017","First impressions are everything.  When I contacted Tower Honda last year, I spoke to Brian and Carlos in the Internet Sales Department.  Both of them are the best salesmen I've ever dealt with.  They are aggressive enough to show interest in helping you but not pushy.  They give you the best deal possible and do not try to undermine or mislead you.  My husband and I drive from Louisiana to Longview to invest into Tower Honda's dealership because of the kind treatment we have received.  In fact, we just bought our second vehicle from them because of our first experience.  I recommend this dealership to anyone that wants to be treated fairly and deal with good hearted honest people.

8,"September 11, 2017","The staff in this dealership were very unfriendly, and there is no communication in this place.  The gentlemen that is from finance and worked up the numbers on the vehicle had the worst personality and was very rude.  He acted very unprofessional and seemed very unconcerned with what I had to say.  Then to top it all off, I had to take my car back to have the windows tinted, and it was the worst job I have ever seen.  All I got was excuses as to why it looked like it did.  The person that did the tinting confronted by son and threatened him and had to be called down by other workers in the service department.  This place is a joke.  All you get is excuse after excuse, but no one would just own up to the fact that they really did not know what they were doing.  I will never recommend Tower Honda to anyone.  There needs to be consequences for this type of behavior.  Excuses just do not work for me as a customer.  If they would spend more time providing a service instead of worrying about completing their survey and giving them a excellent score they would probably gain more business and their customer review would improve!

9,"July 20, 2017","My wife & I recently purchase a Honda Pilot touring edition from Tower Honda. We always try to buy local and Tower did not disappoint. We took the offer we received from Tower Honda and shopped around to a few other Honda dealers and all 3 told us what a great deal Tower Honda was giving us!! That's not something you hear very often from competitive dealerships. 

I would HIGHLY recommend our salesman Jeff Smith. Very friendly and knowledgeable about the cars and very responsive. We also worked with the GM Danny and the finance manager Brian. All 3 were very professional and friendly. I would definitely recommend Tower Honda to friends and family. ",5.0
10,"April 19, 2017","I want to give a very heart felt thank you to Robbie Duck and Brian Duck for going above and beyond to help me find the 2017 Honda Accord Touring I was wanting. My salesman Robbie Duck not only located it but also took the time to go over every feature the Accord has and made sure I knew how it all worked. Their sales manager Brian Duck was extremely helpful with the purchasing of my Accord and explained their Car Doc package-which is a great deal, haven't had that offered on any other car I bought from other dealerships, along with extra warranty information. He made sure I was 100% happy with my Accord and even went over add on accessories for my Accord. I can honestly say I have never had such a fun time buying a car. No pressure at all!!! In fact it was such a great experience that my son bought a car from Robbie Duck a couple days later. If you want hassle free buying and a great salesman go to tower Honda and ask for Robbie Duck and Brian Duck, they are an amazing team, you will not be disappointed!!!!",5.0
11,"April 09, 2017","When I asked for a quote closer to NADA, all I got was a long drawn out windy sermon from Brian.  My advice is to know NADA before you go in and to be prepared for a long siege.  Not at all a pleasant experience.  
Thank you to Danny at JO Williams Ford in Gladewater, who took a lot of time finding something that would work and coming in far under book.",1.4
12,"March 27, 2017","Sent an email seeking a price quote on a 2017 Honda Accord I had spec'd out with the options I wanted.  Dealer never responded by phone or by email.  Obtained several quotes from other dealers with the best and most prompt quote from a Honda dealer just east of the DFW area.  Took my family to Tower Honda to look at colors and accessories; of course the sales staff was like a pack of hungry dogs and would not let us look at colors and options.  Sales manager came out to talk to me and I told him I was in the process of getting a new Accord and had several price quotes.  He told me that he'd like to have me as a Tower customer and would meet the best price quote I had.  I gave him the price and he was agreeable.  I called a couple days later to talk to him and have him search/obtain the vehicle; he never responded.  I sent and email; he never replied.  I called asking the receptionist if he was still employed there and why he would not return my calls.  She promised to get him to call me..........he never did.  He did have his receptionist call me however and tell me that he no longer wanted to sell the car for what he had agreed to.  The sales manager never did call me or contact me.  I went with the dealer who provided the best price quote and prompt service.........could not be happier that I did not buy from Tower Honda.

I did try to buy from the dealership when it was Fenton Honda a couple years prior and it was a miserable experience.  I felt like I was dealing with ""snake oil"" sales personnel.  Tower Honda has turned me against them with their poor service and lack of follow up.  I'll take all my Honda business to the DFW area where I can obtain professional service and best prices.  No more dealing with Tower Honda.  They do have a beautiful new dealership; but the personnel are rude and unprofessional.........I will not buy from a person I cannot trust or one who does not follow through on commitment.",1.3

15,"September 26, 2016","Ok I had a great car buying experience, Purchased a certified used 2010 Honda CR-V LX 4WD clean one owner vehicle. The sales team and finance manager were awesome. The service department a different story, aside from the friendly service lady, I had a bad experience with the techs and service manager. I brought my car in the first time for an airbag light, they fixed it. The second time was for my powersteering making noise and air bubbles in the reservoir, they said air was getting in through the rack somewhere so I left it. They wrote it up and i left it over the weekend, called monday to check on it and they said it needs a new rack&pinion and some time to be approved for warranty to cover it, I said ok I need a loaner vehicle, we dont have one available at the moment, great. Have to call out of work again cause i have no wheels. Call tuesday morning and got a loaner, sweet. They gave me a beautiful 2016 accord sport had only 13 thousand miles on it, it was nice, the whole 2 weeks i had it i washed and detailed it, vaccuum, spay wax, shamooed the seats, wiped the dash, pressure washed the engine, armor all the tires, heck i even ran shell 93 premium in the dam thing and put it in my garage, its not even my car. So 2 weeks later i get a call saying my cars done and i roll up to the dealer talk to the service advisor she bring my car around and i give a look around and its just dirty, they didnt even wash it for me, whatever, i drive it home and notice the steering feels loose it feels funny, park it pop the hood, and i was pissed off, someone took my car offroading there was mud and sand everywhere in the engine under the car in the wheel wells, and they didnt even use a genuine honda rack&pinion for the replacement it was a remanufacture from autozone or something and it pops when you turn fast, the tech also opened my door while on the lift in the service bay and put a big xxx dent in my door on both sides, he dropped a tool on the front bumper and took a chunk of paint off scratched up my injector harness stay plastic thing resting his tools all over my engine and switched out my oil dip stick cause it has oil burn marks on it and the original did not. Theres also a rock chip in the window from who ever test drove it tailing behind a big rig. I called them up and took it back and said hey none of this was like this before, i even showed him pictures i took the first day i brought it home, i told him im very meticulous this is my 20th vehicle iv owned Roush mustangs, mazdaspeed 3s, turbo supras, rx7s, subbies, sr20 240s, z28 camaros, z06 corvettes, silverados, wranglers, straight axle toyotas, hondas, 4x4 nissan hardboddies, 720s, fords, chevys, yamaha r1s, you name it i had it or i drove it. And i am very very anal with cars, and been in a lot of trouble with them, now iv grown up a bit and thats why i bought a low key non flashy honda crv and not a 6 inch lifted truck cause i wish i was 6 inches. All i want is ma xxxx fixed yall hear. The way it was before i brought it to your honda tech ""professionals"" that probably dont care about peoples xxxx cause they dont take pride in there work. And he said well write it up and take a look at the play and popping noise in the rack, and wash it, thats it, so thats my rant on the whole deal. I wasnt too happy, if i would of known i would have bought a genuine honda rack&pinion and did the work myself, covered under warranty or not.",2.4
16,"September 13, 2016","I was in the market for a new car because my previous one began to cost more than it's value. I dreaded this day but it was upon me. I knew which make of cars I was interested in, Honda being the main one. So I decided to visit Tower Honda after shopping online I found a sweet 2016, with 6k miles for 26k. I was open to newer used, that seemed to be right in my price range. Watched it for a whole week. Finally went to look at it and test drive it on a Friday and I fell in love!! I knew then a Honda was for me!! So we began to talk numbers... I wanted to see what they would say, what they could offer for my car..This is where things went all the way bad. The price of the car on the internet was 26k, on the vehicle itself, 26k...I even told them I wanted to look at the car they were selling for 26k, the 2016 with 6k miles...So when they brought over the paper work, theylisted the MRSP for 31k....PROBLEM! That pretty much did it for me. I already wasn't too happy that I had to get a new car. I loved my previous one, sooooooooo that didn't help. They said it was listed wrong as their corporate office changed the price and didn't notify them. I decided to try ANOTHER Honda dealership in East Texas and walked away with a 2017, listed at 28k, same model....A used car for 31 or a brand new one for 28, same model, ZERO miles........I'll take the new 2017, please, so I did!",2.0

That will definitely be the last vehicle I buy there and I tell everyone else about it too.  Everyone in the service department acted like it didn't even matter. Commitment means nothing to Tower Honda. This is just wrong!",1.2

20,"August 03, 2015","This use to be Brew Honda and they stood behind their commitment to service. Now they have a flashy new property to pay far and seem to not value their old customers. I have paid over $3000 in service there for a 2005 Odyssey and for the last $500 expense for 6 areas, I checked 4 of the 6 and 3 were done wrong or not at all, even when reminded to do them. I was told the power steering reservoir replacement with the flush would be included in the $90 cost from two advisers and then charged $20 for it.  When questioned about it twice, they acknowledged they told me it was included but refused to hold to their agreement.
I change my own oil now and wouldn't recommend this dealership to put air in a tire unless you have your own pressure gauge.

I can't say this dealer is any worse than the average car dealer, but they sure aren't any better. They may be friendly, but I don't visit dealerships to make friends. I go there to purchase a new vehicle at a fair price.",3.0
