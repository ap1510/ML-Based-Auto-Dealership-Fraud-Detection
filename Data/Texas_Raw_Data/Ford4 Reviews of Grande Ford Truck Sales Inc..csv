0,"December 17, 2016","I purchased a new F250 from Grande Ford on 12/9/16 and the salesman I was dealing with ((Rocky) was not going to be there the day my truck came in so he set everything up with Brian,  When I got there everything went just right.   They had the truck detailed and I was in and out of the dealer 
with in 45 minutes.   I think the guys name was Alex I asked him if he could sync my phone into my new truck and he not only did that but he went over all the different things in the truck.   Everyone at the dealership was very professional and I will be buying the truck from Grande from now on.

1,"October 27, 2015","Searched for a very specific vehicle for 6 weeks. Found Grande Ford in Texas (we live in Ohio) who had the exact vehicle we were looking for. Initial email along with all the following questions we had were answered immediately. I had direct contact with Anthony at all times of the day. In a crazy, busy, sometimes unkind world I had no worries through the whole transaction. Anthony was patient, kind, and most of all a man of his word. Honest & trustworthy. He arranged to have the vehicle shipped to us. I had direct contact with everyone involved, even the car hauler driver. Documents that had to be signed were sent by over night mail with paid return postage to send documents back. We purchase, signed, and paid all from Ohio without any problems. I could not ask for a more respectable dealership or salesman than Anthony and Grande Ford and would not hesitate to buy from again. As for the Expedition... .WOW. Its perfect! Thanks to Anthony for providing such great customer service and helping us purchase the vehicle that will keep our family safe for many years. We sure appreciate you. ",5.0

3,"July 20, 2007","Dropped off my vehicle for fuel filter change(30k mls.), left it all day then spent an hour calling at closing because they couldn't locate it. When I got home my steering wheel tilt lever was laying on the floor?  Why it was broken for a fuel filter change is beyond me, filter is outside under vehicle. To sum up, this is a dirty, unorganized dealership. Think Fleet is all they care about.
I would recommend driving a little further to New Braunfels and visit Blue Bonnett ford, very nice honest folks. STAY AWAY FROM GRANDE FORD!!!!",1.0
