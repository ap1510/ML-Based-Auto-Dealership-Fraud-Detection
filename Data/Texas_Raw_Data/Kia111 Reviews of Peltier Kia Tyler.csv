1,"March 13, 2020","Brittany made this easy and with some slight assistance from Josh & Broch they were all excellent at getting me in and out in the F-150 I purchased. Both friendly and courteous, they made the experience pleasant. In less than one hour... 
that's ""ONE HOUR"" It was a done deal and I was on my way. 
This will be the first dealership I will return to for future purchases because of the speed and efficiency these folks produced.
I strongly recommend you contact these people for any purchase you are considering",5.0

29,"March 15, 2018","Ryan Davenport is hands down the best car salesman I have ever had and I have owned quite a few cars. I recently purchased the Yellow Limited Edition Stinger GT. The thing I liked most was no haggle, games, or run around. He was very funny and it came natural but serious and straight forward at the same time. He actually listened to me and didn't push me for something I didn't want or need. He was patient while I called insurance to see what it would be and used that time to visit with my family and check with finance to see the status to make sure if numbers were good could quickly move over to finance. 

What can I say about finance??  Josh Randle  made it happen!! He too didn't mess around, answered all of the 50 questions I threw at him, gave me some solid suggestions on best way to cover car for long haul all while telling my wife and son embarrassing stories from our younger days!!

Oh did I mention they went to bat for me and got me more than I was expecting for my trade. They didn't just pop their head in and look at it and go yeah it's a car they actually took the time to find a manager and asked him to please take a moment to check my car out and well that resulted in them paying off my car completely!! So if your in the market for a loaded charger R/T  call Ryan and go check it out.

There is not much more I can say besides thanks again for making this a seamless transition to my new car. You guys were a pleasure to deal with and I will most definitely be back in 2-3 years for the next Stinger.

Thanks so much,

32,"February 22, 2018",This is the third car I have purchased from Crown.  My newest care is a Kia Forte.  My previous car was a Kia Optima.  I enjoy the handling of the Forte even more than I did my Optima.  My Kia purchase was handled by Shaun Jeffrey.  Shaun also was the salesman who helped  with the purchase of my Optima.  Shaun was very concerned on both purchases with getting what I wanted and what I needed.  He helped me to get the best deal on both cars.  Every time I bring my car in for servicing I am always greeted by Shaun with a great big smile on his face and a hug.  ,4.4

69,"September 08, 2017","I bought my 1st Kia (Sportage) in 2007 as a post graduate  graduation present to myself. I named her Hunnibun and we would go through teenage kids, foster kids, and one ex-husband. She never complained; meaning she never broke down or quit and gave up. She would crank for 10 years except when the timing went out on her way to get a new one. That wasn't her fault, I read the manual and it said change at 200,000 well I went 200,009 and it was 12 degrees going up a mountain and she said I am tired. I got it replaced and she was happy four or five more years. 
She began to leak oil and slow down over time and she kept going. I tear up thinking about it as anyone with a good heart would. 
Labor Day I seen Clay's post to come in and buy a new Kia and I decided that it would be a good time. He called asked my information and the next day I told him I am very sentimental, his reply ""I understand "" I cried even harder. He was so awesome and professional yet very friendly with a great sense or humor.  I love my new car. Right now she is the girl with no name. I'm as proud of her as I was of Hunnibun.

Shaun worked hard to get the payments in our price range and showed us all the safety features of the new Sorentos as well.

77,"January 26, 2017","This is after taking my 2016 Kia Optima 4 different times to service - nobody could tell me problem or fix the problem. So DPSM of Crown Kia, diagnosed my car with off-gassing - which I agree with, but with a little to the extreme, def a hazard while driving! Said it was totally normally even at that extent, washing it every 3-4 days and wiping as I drive to keep it clear is normal. He told me there were no chemicals in the car. And no chemicals that would be harmful to me by inhaling or absorption. Said there was plenty of ventilation and I wouldn't be breathing this stuff in. The off gassing will def cause a thick coat on windows but there is no way it's harmful to me and there are no chemicals in the car causing this. He told me if it's still doing it in a few months bring it back and he'll replace the car. So it's not harmful to me now, not a hazard to drive now - mind you this has been 4 months and counting.....but if it's doing this in a few months he'll replace it??? Sounds like someone should have replaced it yesterday!!!! A person can tell when a dealership is just passing time to make things hard on the customer.......not good business. ",1.2

I have been to Crown Motor Company on Troup Highway, Tyler Texas 3 times now, mind you is an hour away from where I live. The first time I came up there to buy a car, they gave us the run around saying we had to show $5000.00 in our account to get a new car. So we could not prove that at that time so we went home. 2nd time was a year later and we go up there again trying to get a new car and yet again got the run around said that they couldn't get us financed. So in April I go all the way to Conroe, Tx which is about 3hrs away from me and I bring home my brand new 2016 Kia sportage. I made appointment to get my car serviced, you know the first oil change and tires rotated. Get up to the Tyler Crown Motors and they tell me that they are fixing to close but will go ahead and do the service since I had appointment! They tell me that it is done and that I owe $49.95, now I was told from Cowboy Kia in Conroe, Tx that because of it being brand new I could go to any Kia to get my car serviced. So why was I charged?????? So now to the kicker that really has me major PISSED!!!! I get all the way home again mind you I live an hour away but I get home and I found out I was charged to have my tires rotated but that they was never rotated to begin with. How do I know you asked???? Well I have a nail in my passenger back tire and guess where it still is..... on the same side on the back!!!!!!!! I want to know why was I charged and what do I need to do to get good service from your company?????? Now I have to take off of my job yet again to drive all the way there to get my tires rotated, and I'm now concerned that maybe my oil didn't really get changed!!!!!! ",1.8

80,"November 04, 2016","I would never recommend this dealership to anyone! They were awful to me and tried to rip me off in several ways! They say they are giving you a ""free trial"" off something and then charge an extra $1000.00 dollars for it! Then they promise to replace something on the car and try everything in their power not to do it. They will also tell you that you can get your car worked on for free at any dealership in the country and then you try to get them to fix it and they try to fight you about it even though it's supposed to be done free at any dealership. I thought this was especially ridiculous being that this was the dealership the car came from! They would also make appointments for my car to be serviced and not get to it. This is an innconvience for me as I lived in a different town.  This place is the biggest joke and is full of nothing but crooks! If you think you must buy a car from here be very very careful and read your paperwork before you sign it!!",1.0

82,"September 05, 2016","The staff at Crown Kia of Tyler were frendly and helpful which I appreciate. The service department however was far below par. After running over a deer a couple months ago, I noticed loss of oil and rough engine noise. I paid Crown Kia's service department nearly $1000 between a diagnostic and then repairs. They did replace the oil pan and oil feed to my turbo which fixed the oil leak. However they completely neglected my badly damaged exhaust, which had a torn flex section in the downpipe and multiple missing bolts and damaged gaskets down the main pipe. I have spent countless hours and dollars trying to diagnose and fix this problem myself, something that I paid them to do. This week I tried to change my oil and filter only to find I could not remove the filter, even with a breaker bar, they had cranked it on there so tightly. This has me frustrated and angry to no end. I paid top dollar to this company expecting professionalism and results, and was highly disappointed.",2.0
83,"March 06, 2016",I had such a wonderful experience with Crown Kia! Clay Walker made everything so easy. I am still amazed that I walked in and 2 hours later I left with my first ever brand new car!!! Clay was so helpful and Travis Tague also! ,5.0
84,"March 01, 2016","This Excellent rating is based on the respect and awesome service I received during this most important and frightening shopping experience, I was put at ease and educated.  I have learned that Kia has worked very hard over the years to produce safe and  economically sound vehicles for all tastes in style, budget and need. As a home care nurse  I require a vehicle that can keep me safe on the rural roads of East Texas;  I am also amazed of all the bells and whistles that come with my Kia Sorento, Matilda is an intelligent vehicle.  This is my third vehicle purchase over the years from this dealership but my first Kia!!! I am thankful for all the hard work the sales team was able to accomplish to get me into my first Kia; I am Kiamazed!  Look around as you go about daily business and take note how many Kias 
are on the road.... You too will be Kiamazed !! Visit Clay at Crown Kia in Tyler, Texas, tell him Melissa Isham and  Matilda sent you.",5.0

90,"December 31, 2015","Based on past experiences, I rate the process of buying a new car right up there with having a root canal.  I find the task of dealing with a pushy car salesman akin to the sting of the needle and the incessant drone of the dental drill buzzing in my skull.  However, that was not the case when I walked into Crown Kia in Tyler to check out their year-end special.  The salesperson who waited on me, Aaron Dunn, was not only knowledgeable, affable, and low-key, but, most importantly, extremely professional.  He made me feel so at ease that I purchased three Kia Souls that night; one for each member of the family!  I highly recommend Crown Kia and encourage those reading this to ask for Aaron's assistance.  Well Dunn, Aaron!",5.0
91,"December 11, 2015","I went and bought my first car pretty much by myself (a little moral support from the boyfriend). I was scared about it because you always hear how rough car salesmen are, but I'm hear to tell you that Aaron Dunn is amazing! He made the process unbelievably easy and fun for us. He got me a great car at an even better price!! He is just a super incredible businessman who really cares about not only his job and the sale, but the people who he's selling too. If you are looking for a new car, see Aaron Dunn at Crown and make it a #Dunndeal! ",5.0

96,"December 06, 2015","I found Crown Kia while searching online for a dealership at the Kia website. I was already in a vehicle that did not suit mine or my family's needs. On top of that I was upside down on my SUV in terms of trade in value. 

The employees worked hard to make a deal that I felt comfortable with. At the end of the day I walked out with a new car that fulfilled my needs and got rid of the SUV. I cannot thank them enough for all of their hard work and listening to me and what I wanted. This is the only dealership I will buy any car from. I finally found a place I will go back to for another vehicle!

108,"April 29, 2014","Heard this dealers radio commercial for a MONTH, OVER AND OVER, ""We will buy your car for 120% of Kelly Blue Book whether you buy from us or not"". Went and looked at their vehicles and after a week or so decided to go back with a Ford. When first there they gave me a number that would've paid off my car. After MANY EMAILS back and forth, I made an appointment to bring my car in to sell to them. THEN the man I was dealing with, Eric Whitney, comes back telling me they will only give me almost $2000 LESS for my car!!! Told him that is not what you told me and that's not what was agreed on!! Then the manager Chris Blanchard comes to the desk and has an attitude with ME!! I told him he needed to not get nasty with me and he says ""I will write you a check for $19000 and not any more""!! Big drop from $20883!! BEWARE!!!!!!!",1.0
109,"March 11, 2012","Pathetic dealership.  DO NOT GO THERE FOR USED CARS.  They sell nothing but crap, then when they need to fix things, they take the vehicle to mom and pop places to do the cheapest job possible, then make you ride around in a stinky old kia for weeks and can't give you a single update on what's up with your vehicle repairs.  I'm so glad I said keep the freaking vehicle and give me my money back.  The best thing I can say about them is they did and I got the heck out of there and went straight to dallas to purchase my next vehicle.
GO ANYWHERE ELSE FOR A USED DEALERSHIP.",1.8
110,"December 20, 2010","Bought a car from this dealer and the service was great when I was buying the car but after-wards it went down hill fast.  I bought a used Mercedes SLK55 which I'm glad I had it checked out before I made the purchase as it needed brakes and suspension work.  After getting there I found that the car had no manual and and buttons on the navigation didn't work.  I thought it was because of the copied navigation disk(wrong)  turns out someone had spilled something on the radio so I called Clark and Steve 15 times was told they would get back to me they never did.  Finally talked to Steve which said to take it to a Mercedes dealership, did so and told Clark which told me he will get back to me again........ never did.  This dealership does NOT stand behind you after you buy the car I did get the car at a good price and I'm glad I had it checked out before I bought it but I am disappointed with this dealership.  Alley is the only one at this dealership that tries to help and calls back.",2.3
