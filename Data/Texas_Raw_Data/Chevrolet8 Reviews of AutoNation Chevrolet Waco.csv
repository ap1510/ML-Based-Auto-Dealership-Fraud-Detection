1,"March 26, 2020","Recently purchased Chevy 1500 RST 2020 and within the first 3538 the first electronic issue occurred. Braked module programming failed fortunately it occurred at low speed and not in traffic or otherwise this could have been a very bad situation as the vehicle essentially had little to no brakes at the time. You had to pump the brakes to build pressure or that's the way it appeared. The indication from the service department was that it was a programming issue, this leaves me very uncomfortable regarding the braking system of this unit. I'm a safety manager for a very large operation, and these types of situations are unacceptable in the workplace. Much less in the public spectrum, and my understanding is that this is not the only instance of this type of situation regarding the braking module. Bear in mind I did get and OnStar notification immediately following the incident to service my vehicle within 7 days however that doesn't help if your involved in an auto collision. Notification time Monday 2:09PM. Does this shake your confidence yes somewhat! This has nothing to do with the dealership or individual I worked with as they were very professional. ",5.0

7,"August 31, 2017","I did have a decent experience at this dealership. Nonetheless as a woman of color I felt kinda of taken back at a few things. Make no mistake, I can handle myself. Overall, I suggest take someone with you if car shopping. Have a plan and stick to it. Service Dept so far has not impressed me at all. I am trying to be honest so don't shoot the messenger:)",2.3
