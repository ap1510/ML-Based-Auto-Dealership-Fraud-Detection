0,"June 20, 2020","I recently purchased a new Subaru Forester at Subaru of Georgetown. I can‚Äôt express enough what a pleasant experience it was. My salesman, Ihab Reda, was great. First of all, I had just come from one of the Toyota dealerships where I had a stressful and disappointing experience. The Subaru dealership was the complete opposite. Very calm, no pressure whatsoever, friendly staff, and Ihab gave me his undivided attention. I feel appreciated as a customer and I love my car!",5.0
1,"June 09, 2020","From the beginning to the end of the car buying process, this dealership made the experience pleasant & efficient. Ihab Reda was my salesperson. He went the extra mile to make sure I got what I wanted. Ihab's relaxed attitude paired with his motivation that WASN'T influenced by receiving a commission was refreshing.
Michael ""Hogge"" was a thorough finance officer with a no-nonsense, keep-it-real, fun-loving demeanor. The finance stage of the game is usually an anxiety inducing experience for me, but not this time!
Jason, the new car sales manager, approached me while I was waiting for my new car to be ready. I got the feeling that he's a cool guy who appreciates his co-workers & actually cares about the customers who make the long trek from south Austin to Georgetown for a good deal & a good experience.
I'm referring my sister & a friend to Subaru of Georgetown. I'm very happy with my new ride!

No pressure- committed to customer first- dealership and brand loyalty- yet perhaps the best buying experience i have had in 60+ years- yes I overpaid and knew it- hoping in these trying times Ken will get a share- and yes i Love my 2020 Forester - Touring - i now call it my sports car with room for luggage",4.6

4,"May 28, 2020","Spencer worked with my wife and me expertly as we decided which new Subaru we wanted to buy. His efforts went far beyond any other car salesman we have dealt with in over 30 years. As an example, when we were called away to complete paperwork from going over the car, Spencer offered and did put in our favorite locations in the GPS. Outstanding.  Pat and Jim Mc",5.0

7,"May 01, 2020","If you want a great deal and great people to work with go with Subaru of Georgetown.  My salesperson Yohanna made the experience easy and safe.  She is super knowledgeable and was on top of all the things I asked for.  I appreciate not being pushed into things I don't want or need. Most things were all done online! I had car picked out and pre-approved. Also had a very relaxed safe signing of documents with Mr. Hogge in finance.  No pressure, just facts.  Thanks Subaru of Georgetown.  You have my business for life!",5.0
8,"April 30, 2020",Recently purchased a Forester Limited FROM Georgetown Subaru! Great Experience! Kris Tippens went above and beyond to ensure that I became familiar with all the Bells and Whistles on the vehicle. Kris was not your pushey type of salesperson. He allowed me to contemplate my decision at a leisurely pace. Kris is knowledgable and confident in in the car business. Georgetown Subaru has a KEEPER in MR. TIPPENS,4.6

18,"February 11, 2020",After checking other local dealers we opted to drive 30 miles to Georgetown to buy our new Subaru. Largely in part of Ken Bell. He made the whole experience worth the trip. He is a great raconteur and made the waiting time pass pleasantly.,5.0
19,"January 23, 2020","I love my new Subaru Crosstrek! My husband literally turned to me during the purchase process saying, ‚ÄúI think this is the best car buying experience I‚Äôve ever had!‚Äù And it was. Steve was a dynamic, friendly, helpful, and genuinely nice salesperson during the entire process. He secretly conspired with my husband to get me the orange color I dreamed of. I totally believed my Crosstrek coming from Houston was going to be blue and that the orange was too difficult and to get and so much more expensive. I still loved the blue color.  But Steve worked really hard (and quite stealthy) with my husband to get me my Sun Orange Subaru Crosstrek that was on my Bucket List. Boy was I surprised when he pulled up in an orange Crosstrek! Not only did Steve work hard to get me my dream car, but also he spent quality time with me on every button, system, bell, and whistle this automobile has. I have had it nearly two weeks and know how to use all the modern (and fancy) technology. I plan to keep this car forever. It really was my dream car. Steve made the experience simple and enjoyable. He‚Äôs honest and knowledgeable. I highly recommend buying a Subaru at Georgetown Subaru. No hesitation. 5 Star service. Amazing experience. ",5.0

23,"September 23, 2019",the most comprehensive review and demonstration of a new car with numerous safety devises that I have ever had.  Roy is the best and most knowledgeable salesman I have dealt with-a pure pleasure!,5.0
24,"August 20, 2019","We bought a used Audi from Kennedy Christopher and he was great!  He found the perfect balance of being helpful and assertive (i.e. not letting me fall off his radar), while not being a cheesy, pushy sales guy.  Our whole experience was very smooth from beginning to end.  They also had a very FAST process once we'd decided to move forward with the sale.  The finance people were helpful too. ",5.0
25,"July 30, 2019","Had a wonderful experience working with Steve Paul on the purchase of our new Ascent. Would recommend him to anyone looking to buy a new car. He was courteous and truly works to get the buyer the best deal possible. Would have liked to get more for our trade but it's part of the business I guess.

We got a better offer in San Antonio but chose to stay close to home due to the experience at Subaru of Georgetown.",5.0
26,"May 14, 2019","I knew what I wanted and I knew they had it. They never tried to talk me into to something more expensive or different.

Kennedy was polite, helpful and he was very honest. No hard sell - a good guy helping me buy a car. I really appreciated it since I was by myself.

I did not care for the woman who tired to sell me extended warranty - I did not feel like she was being honest and she was a little rude but everyone has bad days.

I will recommend them to everyone I know. And I LOVE my new (pre-owned CrossTrek)!!

27,"May 09, 2019","Of all the dealerships I visited Georgetown Subaru ranks # 1!
I walked in the door and was fortunate to have Inelda Badillo
As my salesperson. I explained that my number one priority 
was to get a car that fit which I defined as ease of entering and
exiting as well as comfort in the driver‚Äôs seat. She suggested 
an OutBack which proved to be a perfect solution. It was my 
intention to pay cash but she proposed that I consider a lease 
which turned out to be the best financial arrangement for me. 
They did not have a car in stock with the exterior color I wanted 
and on the initial order I forgot to stipulate which interior color 
but Inelda handled this hiccup in stride and found exactly what
I was looking for. 

Thank you Georgetown Subaru and Inelda Badillo.

35,"January 31, 2019","Me and my wife have driven suburu's our entire young adult lives. We are trying to have a baby and decided we wanted to trade our small brz coup for a WRX STI so we have space. I called the San Antonio suburu and was really amazed with there lack of knowledge reguarding there inventory which was false advertised online. I then called Austin suburu and decided quickly I had no desire to support there dealership if there sales were unwilling to answer any of my questions over the phone. I called this Georgetown location. And while I can say not everyone's experience will be the same as ours I can tell you what to expect based on what we experienced. We got ahold of Zack in a call who stayed on the line a while answering all of my questions ( I had many !!!) Never losing patience and keeping a super positive,  upbeat and professional attitude. I never felt like I was a nuisance or holding him up. We didnt plan on going in for a while since ita a long drive but that call really made us want to check it out. He cracked jokes and immediately cleared the air by not using any pushy or intimidating tactics and being honest. At the end of the day he really wanted to sell a car that night but I wasn't buying unless it was a steal ! him and his management really made it happen by giving me an absolute phenomenal deal I couldn't refuse beating the price offered at Austin suburu for the same car almost 3 thousand dollars less. But the best part is the entire time we were there everyone we met was so cool ! The finance guy is freaking hilarious he will offer you a warranty. If you finance through chase suburu it will literally be the most insane deal you have ever seen and I highly suggest getting it since it is literally free since it comes out of your Intrest rate. This is where the tone usually shifts because you already bought the car. But not at this dealer ship ! The next day we realized we forgot an after market part we wanted back that was on our trade In. THE MANAGER OF THIS PLACE  literally got tools went out in his dress clothes and removed the part for us smiling and conversating the whole time . He even thanked me for my service while he was elbows deep In my vehicle never acting the least bit bothered by having to do this for us.( which he absolutely didnt have to do since our deal was already done and I had no rights to this part) If that's not customer service I don't know what is . I have had several questions since purchasing reguarding insurance and inspection. Zack has answered my calls on first ring all 6 times I have bothered him and answered my questions keeping the exact same attitude he had after we purchased as he did before we purchased.  This is a really good place to buy a car man not just because suburu makes the best cars but honestly  because there willingness to go above and beyond for a customer made me want to support them as a business. Big shout out to zack ! Shout out to finance guy ( so cool) and thank you so much to Doug for what you did getting that part out of our old car. These are some really good guys and they will really work with you to get you in the car you want. And you can have peace of mind they will make things right with there customers.
Zack also has a 15 month old baby yall go support him!!!!¬∞",5.0
36,"November 11, 2018","I've heard great things about Subaru and have wanted to buy one for a long time, but today's experience has made me rethink everything!  Upon walking in, the sales rep we spoke to made us feel like we were inconveniencing her immediately. She asked for our license and proof of insurance before we really even talked about the cars much. This made us feel like we were being rushed into a test drive instead of being made to feel like a valued customer. She then made us sign a car loaner agreement even though we were just wanting to test drive. I've never had to do this step, so I asked if it was the right form... she told us that we had to in order to be covered in case we got into an accident and if the sales people don't make you sign it, then they didn't do their job properly!  We had our 10 month old with us, which isn't normal I'll admit, but we were interested in fitting the car seat in the car for the test drive. The Sales Rep asked us if our car seat was clean before we could do so... very disrespectful and rude!  We stuck it out for a little bit longer and, after seeing the car, I asked a question about the radios and wanting to hear the differences. This was met with ""well I was trying to do that before we came out here.""  After that, I thanked her for her time and we walked out. I was pretty set on purchasing a Subaru today, but this Sales Rep totally drove us away!  I'm really hopeful that this experience is not a fitting example of Subaru as a whole, so tomorrow we are going to try a different location. Hopefully Subaru Austin will live up to Subaru's reputation...",1.0
37,"October 22, 2018","As we all know buying a car can be an experience good or bad depends on how well they understand your needs and try to address them. Making it as painless as possible.

The salesman was a joy to work with and made us feel good when answering questions we had.",5.0
38,"March 10, 2018","I recently purchased a 2018 sti from Austin Subaru, which was excellent all around. My first choice was Subaru of Georgetown. I had a true car price for Subaru of Georgetown and had seen the sti I wanted. However, I was treated so poorly by the sales associate that I left and went to Austin Subaru. The customer service was so poor that I will not take my car there to be serviced unless there are no other choices",1.4
39,"September 01, 2017","My sales person Amber Ashy was amazing. She taught me all the ins and out of both the Outback and the Forester. She was super patient with me as I jumped back and forth between the two models to decide which model felt more like home. She also stood out in the parking lot with me, and did not rush, as I decided between the red and the blue. I have NEVER had a more enjoyable car shopping experience. Even after the sale the staff continues to be awesome. Thank you Amber Ashy and Subaru of Georgetown

SHE IS FAIRMINDED! for someone who LOATHES the car-buying process, I LOVED MY TIME AT GEOTWN SUBARU ... the dealership has ***amber*** to thank for that. cheers!",5.0
41,"June 23, 2017","I hate buying new cars...except at Georgetown Subaru. I came back to Subaru after my minivan (another make) had been totalled, and I was expecting a long, drawn out process of negotiations, paperwork, and lots and lots of waiting around. My experience was exactly the opposite. I was only shown cars I had expressed interest in and no one tried to upsell me on different models or upgrades. I felt like Ron Amper truly cared about taking care of our family and getting me back on the road with a safe and reliable (and stylish) car. Quintin in the finance department had us in and out in a snap and was very efficient and friendly. 


Thank you, Subaru. I'm never going anywhere else to buy a car.",5.0
42,"May 10, 2017",Took a test drive of the 2017 Forester in October 2016 with Ron Amper and told him I needed to wait. He gave me space and in late April 2017 I contacted him to begin which trim level I wanted in the Forester. After my attending a military reunion I returned home and bought my Forester. All went smoothly. My neighbor had also bought her Forester at Subaru of Georgetown a couple of years ago and sings their praises. Looking forward to getting it serviced there as well since it is close to Sun City and again my neighbor has been very happy with them.,5.0
43,"April 23, 2017","We had a dead battery on a 2 year old outback. after keeping the vehicle for 3 days they concluded the issue was a cargo light switched to always on, which caused battery to discharge. We have driven this vehicle at night and have not entered the cargo area for several weeks.  Basically they were not going to replace this batter that has failed 3 times to start. This would expose us to the batter fail at any time since it has failed and was discharged 3 times over 3 days. So, we were forced to complain to a manager since service advisor made his decision. The manager finally  reluctantly had a new battery installed and called it a One time approval since they claim it was the owner's fault.  Upon driving the vehicle home I noticed the window buttons were not working properly. In fact the driver side would not open passenger window.  So, I called Austin Subaru and they said the window operation was NOT reset after the battery was discharged.  So, If I was in an accident and needed to open the window, I could not.
For this reason and a few other experiences in the past, I can not recommend this dealership for service.  My strong recommendation is to go to Austin Subaru on Burnet road.  They reset the window system and I have had nothing but excellent service there....

44,"March 25, 2017",Bought a used car from here my experience was great! Upon arriving at the dealership Jerry the used car sales manager and our sales rep Ben Mitchell gave me a great deal!

45,"March 22, 2017","I recently purchased a new 2017 Subaru Outback from Austin Subaru. I seriously had intended to give my business to Subaru of Georgetown, but after 4 visits, I had only talked to a new car sales person 1 time, and he told me we would have to ""do some paperwork"" for me to test drive a vehicle, to which I replied, ""OK, let's do it,"" then he sighed and changed the subject - I did not take a test drive. On 2 occasions, even though we walked around the lot looking at vehicles and even went inside, sat in a vehicle and expressed definite interest - not one sales person approached us. On the final occasion, a pre-owned sales person approached us upon arrival as we exited our vehicle, but when he found out we were looking for new vehicles, went to get someone in that department to help us - no one came out. I might mention that I complained on the website after the first 2 visits and received a response from several managers explaining how they prefer to ""not pressure"" potential buyers but evidently went too far in that direction.  So, your loss, Subaru of Georgetown - you just lost several sales, as we're telling everyone we know about our lousy experiences at Subaru of Georgetown and encouraging them to go to Austin Subaru for great service and sales people who actually want to sell cars.",1.0

From the beginning Ron made the process of replacing my 2010 Outback as painless as possible. I wasn't expecting to replace my car so I hadn't done my research. He had an answer to all my questions. He didn't pressure me to make a decision. And when my husband and I finally decided on what we wanted he moved quickly to find us our Outback.

Most importantly he didn't treat me like I was money in hand. He treated me like a friend who needed help. I couldn't ask for better service.",5.0

Did his inspection around the vehicle, went inside and signed maintenance papers, and then sat in the waiting area for about an hour. I was working so the hour went by extremely quick, and to be honest, I thought it would have been a couple hours. Glad it was quick and easy.

We stood around for 20 minutes thinking he would surely come back.  He didn't.  He was busy working with another customer and never came back to tell us he was tied up.  Finally, we stopped another salesman who was walking through the dealership and asked him to help us.  His name was Quinten.  He appeared very irritated with salesman Mike and was rude and unhelpful.   We left and will never come back.",1.2

I did lots of internet research beforehand so I knew what I wanted in a car.  The Subura salesman (Ron Ampre) was super in sending me emails with answers to my questions.  When we went in to test drive a vehicle he was very knowledgeable, very friendly, and extremely patient.  After driving the new Forester we were very pleased with it,  and told him it was time to talk ""business"".  
He gave me a price within a few minutes, and the wife and I talked about it, and decided to accept it.

54,"October 13, 2016","There is no better place to buy a Subaru. I leased a 2016 Subaru WRX and Don Upton (Salesman) was stellar. I live and work in South Austin but he even picked me to test drive the car and took me to the dealership to sign the paperwork. My personal credit is subpar but after providing the right income documents the finance team called Chase Bank and I was quickly approved. No one else would do this for me especially NOT Austin Subaru. 

Later when requiring maintenance the service team was understanding and had my repairs covered under warranty when other Dealerships (Austin Subaru) would not . Abel (Service manager) was easily reachable and explain the whole process . Great guy leading a great team!

I can't speak any more highly of the sales, finance, and service department at Georgetown Subaru. They are quick, respectful, and really care.

It took awhile, but we finally found the Outback we wanted.  Throughout the process Ron was so helpful, so attentive, so willing to change course if needed.  We never felt any pressure.  He carefully answered our questions and made the whole experience smooth and easy.  He responded to our phone calls or emails and made himself available when we wanted to come by the dealership to look at different models.

I'd ask the price of the car and the Hyundai salesman would keep coming back with ""How much do you want to pay each month?"" We couldn't get straight answers about anything and they kept going in the back and leave us cooling our jets. Finally, I got loud and we walked out, knowing we would never be back.

When we first started looking at a Forester, then the 2014, Ron was so polite and respectful, it was like a totally different experience. So, when were recently ready to buy, we sought him out and the whole process was easy, low pressure and helpful. Totally NOT what I've thought about car dealers. Robin, the finance person,... well, wow. My wife said it was the first time she felt like they were really there to help us, not take us.

I would highly recommend Ron Amper and Subaru of Georgetown to anyone. You will be just as pleased as we were that buying a car does not have to be an ordeal. It can be a great experience.

We had started with a dealership nearer to us and found an Outback there that we really liked, but they would not get serious with price, using the old '$200 above invoice' ploy. As a result, I contacted several other Subaru dealerships in our area and got the quickest and best response from Ron at Subaru of Georgetown and, he had product that matched the equipment that was on the one we had liked. So, after Ron had gotten down to a price range in the vicinity of what I was willing to pay, we decided to visit Ron Amper and pursue the possibility of making a deal.Good choice -- we arrived at a price I could agree to and Ron even got the car we had looked at from the recalcitrant dealer, brought it to Georgetown, and sold it to me for much less than they were willing to.

90,"March 06, 2014","I like to compare details and try to find the best I can especially when spending a lot of money.  For me this involved shopping around to find my 2014 Subaru WRX STI wagon, but it also meant purchasing from the best dealership I could find.  I‚Äôm sure there a plenty of good experiences to be had at other Central Texas dealerships, but for a reliably good showroom and purchasing experience (hoping to experience the same with Service) I recommend Subaru of Georgetown.  Initially I stopped by for a visit to take a look at Subaru‚Äôs great BRZ model and go for a test drive.  Which I was able to do without feeling uncomfortable for being a young buyer and without being pressured to buy or prove my ability to purchase.  The salesperson that worked with me was Ron Amper, Ron is very friendly, he remembers you, and is a laid back salesperson.  The BRZ was everything that I expected it to be including a little less power than I really wanted. Ron then recommended we go for a test drive in a WRX STI, which I was surprised we were able to do after a local Subaru dealer would not even let me test drive a BRZ without buying the vehicle.  Before the release of the BRZ I was interested in the WRX line and that test drive sparked my re-interest in the plausibility of purchasing an STI.  The STI had all the dial-able performance I was looking for plus the, hatchback/wagon-space/roof rack/and 5 door layout I needed, and AWD.  I waited for a few months to hear that Subaru would discontinue the wagon for the 2015 redesign and then quickly contacted Ron again about an STI purchase.  There were two cars with the specs I wanted left in the state, one sold that day and the other was in transit for another month.  Ron assured me that the car would be reserved for me with no problems, which I was concerned about over the course of the month waiting period, but the car arrived as promised with my name on it. I was able to secure a great deal with no hassle using an online car buying service and Subaru Georgetown offered to pay part of the cost of the flatbed transfer of my car.  They respected my concerns and reserves in the delivery and handling of the vehicle (I requested the vehicle not be driven of the lot at all not even to be filled with gas, so instead they took the free tank of gas off the price of purchase).  Another concern arose when Ron let me know he would be out of the country when the vehicle was delivered and papers were signed, but another stellar salesperson, Graham Rice, stepped in to help close the deal.  My experience with Ron, Graham, and their sales manager Daniel was a 10/10; they answered (frequent) questions in emails and over the phone, they were all approachable and reachable even over text messaging.  Graham was happy to show the car the night before after I couldn‚Äôt stand not seeing it (even started paperwork after closing time), and the day of purchase was a breeze (seriously it can‚Äôt be this easy to buy a car anywhere else; I had more trouble buying a motorcycle that cost a quarter of the price).  I left feeling like a valued customer and it did not feel as though that relationship would end the day I drove off the lot.  Ron and Graham have shown that they are still available as contacts for Subaru Georgetown well into the future. In my opinion this is an A+ dealership do yourself a favor and check them out.",5.0

He provided all the information we needed to make the 3-hour drive to Georgetown from Fort Worth, and then spent most of the day with us while we test drove different cars and eventually decided on an Outback instead.  We were aware that he had plans for the evening, but he stayed over and never made us feel rushed or pressured.  We were very pleased with the price we paid for the vehicle, and highly recommend this dealership and Ron.",5.0
92,"February 07, 2014","Purchasing a car from Ellen Stringham has been my best buying experience (among over 10 vehicle purchases in the past)! When I found out I was being stationed at Ft Hood, I figured i should start shopping around months in advance so when I landed I already had a car picked out and a great price to match. Using USAA's  Car Buying Service, I was provided with contact information for 3 local dealers. From there I attempted to start a bidding war between them for my business.

It was no contest, from the START Ellen had given me the absolute lowest price on my 2014 Subaru WRX. Also, I have 50+ email and text correspondences with her over the months leading up to the purchase, it was perfect for how busy I was getting ready to move and what not. What eventually happened with the other 2 dealers? Communication eventually ceased and I kept getting their stupid automated emails asking for my business that I had to unsubscribe from.

Upon signing, she brought to my attention that I was getting an even deeper discount due to me being military and something changing with their policy. This not only reflects on the integrity of the salesperson, but the integrity of the dealership. Ellen is also very knowledgeable when it comes to the Subaru product and if there's ever a time she doesn't know the answer to a question, she has no problem finding out for you and returning with an answer in a very timely manner. Her customer service, rapport building, and innate problem solving skills are second to none.

You probably don't even need to read this, look at the dealer's overall rating. Just do us all a favor and give Ellen Stringham a chance at earning your business. 

NOTE AS A HUGE PLUS - I'm not sure if this is all circumstances but my purchase came with unlimited courtesy HAND washes and if your vehicle includes maintenance throughout its new warranty and you get all 4 oil changes at the dealer, you'll receive oil changes for life through the dealer (again, this was with my vehicle, make sure to ask if it would be applicable toward your purchase before getting your hopes up!).

As a result of my research, I knew the exact vehicle & options I wanted and the precise amount I was willing to pay. Ron sent me a detailed quote with the MSRP, the Invoice price, and a great offer. Ron‚Äôs offer, in fact, was lower than my rock-bottom price! I made an appointment for a test drive right away.

100,"July 25, 2013","It had been a few years since I visited a dealership, or bought a car.  After deciding to purchase either a Subaru Forester or Outback, I ventured off to the local dealership to finalize my decision and look further into the final purchase.  

I went in fully prepared to beat off salesmen with a stick and forcefully tell them I'm not ready to buy today.  Instead I was politely greeted, allowed to freely walk around their lot checking out the different vehicles with no salesmen pestering me, and when I had questions they were answered accurately and in a non-pushy way.  When I wanted to test drive the two models to compare, there was again no pressure and they let me take my time with each.  I left feeling more informed and trusting of this dealership and it's staff.

I visited another Subaru dealership in the area to test drive a different trim level that Subaru Georgetown was out of at the time.  The experience was completely different, very pushy, and not at all pleasant.  

I returned to Subaru Georgetown for a final test drive and placed my order for a new Forester.  The sales associate I worked with is Steve Paul, Steve was knowledgeable and had the perfect balance of ""laid back but still engaging"" for me.  His no-pressure approach certainly won me over, and we both benefited from it in the end.

I experienced this level of service with the finance department as well during the final paperwork.  No pressure, here are your options, these are the numbers, take your time and ask us questions.  The final price was right what I was looking for, and their initial bid at me for the car was within $500 of my target.  I've NEVER had a dealership offer me a fair price on the opening bid; very impressed.

Even the parts department was friendly and non-pushy.  I called in for a quote on a few add on pieces, and got no run-around or attitude at all.

For the first time in my life, I can honestly recommend a dealership.  Subaru Georgetown impressed me on all levels, and treated me right.  I give them a glowing recommendation.  I also highly recommend you ask for Steve Paul by name when you go in, he is by far the best salesman I have ever worked with.",5.0

-negotiated everything over the phone and it was honored-including the trade-in
-great facilities
-Generally friendly,
-Price was great-better than anywhere else and I had called about 4-5 dealers
-Quality of work I gave a 4 because I had a pretty simple aftermarket product installed that I had to fix when I got home-not a big deal.
However, they did everything I asked and bent over backwards-Normally when a dealer acts like that it is because they are getting all they can out of you (ie screwing you over), not with these guys-fantastic customer service.

The only thing I did not like-and it is the standard with every car dealer, is when you think the deal is done, and you go to finalize the paperwork you get all the warranty sales stuff. I would like to see these things be pre-negotiated with the salesman so when you are done, you are done-

I would absolutely recommend this dealership to anyone-

105,"February 23, 2013","Graham Rice is an outstanding salesman at Georgetown Subaru. I visited the dealership at least 4 times, took 3 test drives in 3 different cars, and called Graham several more times with questions about the vehicle (Subaru Forester). Graham was always waiting for me when I arrived at the dealership, and either knew the answers to my questions or called the maintenance supervisor and got an answer. He was also very friendly, laughed at my jokes, told a few of his own, and made visiting the dealership a very pleasant and fun experience. In the end, I did not end up buying a Subaru, but this was no fault of Graham or the dealership. I wanted a 6 speed transmission for fuel economy, and the Forester only came with a 4 speed (remedied with the 2014 model). When it's time for a new vehicle for me or my wife, Georgetown Subaru will again be my first choice, and I'll be asking for Graham.",4.8

108,"September 15, 2012","Overall, my experience was great, and I would have no problem recommending this dealership to my friends and family. My wife and I were looking to replace one of our cars with a 2012 Outback. I don't live near Georgetown, TX, so my initial contact with the dealership came after I requested an eprice for one of the 2012 Outbacks listed on their web site. The sales rep who responded, Steve Paul, first confirmed that the vehicle was still available, and then sent a very attractive quote. After a few email exchanges and a phone call, I knew the exact mileage on the vehicle, had pictures of the vehicle and had an out-the-door quote signed by both Steve and his sales manager. My wife and I made a Saturday morning appointment to complete the purchase of the vehicle and were able to do so without any problems.

I read the other reviews of this dealership on this site, after I requested the eprice. While most of the reviews were positive, there was an outlier that listed 10 reasons to avoid this dealership. One of the reasons caused me concern. Specifically, MTNester wrote:

""2. They deceived us by tacking a $1600 ""loan fee"" on top or our loan (I didn't catch until I got the loan papers from the bank).""

I asked Steve about this comment, and he said that the dealership did not charge loan fees. In fact, he said it is illegal for dealerships to do so. We financed a portion of our purchase, and I can confirm that there was no ""loan fee"" charged. It isn't clear what MTNester might have meant.

We've had our Outback for less than a week, so this review is meant to cover only our purchase experience. In a few weeks or months, I'll update this review with further comments.

109,"September 15, 2012","Factory ordered an Outback 2.5 Limited from Ron. Two painless visits.  Prompt emails from both Joleen and Ron. The finance manager knew what to expect as Ron informed her I did not want add ons and the like.  SOA also performed like the stellar company it is by having the vehicle delivered in exactly 4 weeks and...the car did not have the expanding hatch in direct sunlight problem...apparently the recent Subaru service bulletin corrective action was deployed and implemented at the factory before mine rolled off the line. I will pick one small nit with the finance manager as I do not think she was upfront on the extended warranty plan. Wrote up the paperwork as a 100$ deductible when I thought the quote was for 0 $ deductible and then when I called her on it said the 0$ deductible wouldn't be worth the extra hundreds it would cost me.  Well really I think the 0$ deductible should have only cost 350$ more (1550 going rate) but apparently she was not keen on selling it--probably thinking the dealer will get a bunch of 100$ repairs between 3 and 7 years...whereas I am crossing my fingers Subie lives up to its rep and, like my 02, will have few problems.  All in all 10/10 because I want Ron to get kudos and the car got here quickly and was what I wanted, and while I didn't get a huge price break I feel I wasn't taken advantage of on the car sale.  The finance lady though--meh--maybe a 6 or 7.",5.0
110,"July 04, 2012",I had a great experience with the purchase of my new Subaru.  I worked with Ron Amper and I greatly appreciated his straight forward professional business manner; no hassles or hidden costs.  I drove from Houston as I could not find a comparable deal.  I recommend anyone looking for a new Subaru to contact Ron.,5.0
111,"June 28, 2012","Love my Subaru... Hate the Dealership.  

First, we had pre-negotiated a special corporate deal on the Subaru by phone ... it was just a matter of signing loan papers and picking it up... or so we thought.

When we got there, Ron Amper left us sitting in his cubicle for no less than an hour... and then every time we asked a question, he would disappear again for a while.  When we finally decided that we had chose the wrong dealership and was getting ready to leave, suddenly all our paperwork was ready.  So much for only taking a few minutes.  This was obviously a game -- and an insult.

We had negotiated the trade-in on our old car... which this dealership tacked the EXACT amount the gave as a Sales Fee.  FURTHER, the woman who handles the paperwork spent most her time while we were supposed to be signing papers talking to her daughter on the phone.

Next, the tag was sent to the dealership, and they did not call us.  When it had been a month, we called them and was told they weren't in... so we contacted DPS to find that they had been mailed a weeks ago to the dealership.  So we FINALLY got our tags after 6 weeks going in-person to the dealership and demanding they find our license tags.

The final straw came today when I found out that the 3 year / 36,000 mile everything warranty (including oil and maintenance) is entered in their system as 2 year / 24,000 mile!

112,"May 31, 2012","Ron Amper helped me with the purchase of my new Subaru Outback. He was super helpful, infinitely patient, knows Subarus, uses no high-pressure techniques, isn't afraid to make suggestions (yeah, that turbo Forester was a little too much car for me--I almost had us in a ditch), and is a genuinely nice guy. This was my first new car in a long time. I was looking forward to the car, but dreading the dealer experience.  Ron is the anti-salesman. He is the opposite of any bad experience you have ever had and doesn't fit the stereotype.  Ask for him, you'll be pleasantly surprised.  My grown son went with me to this dealership, but looking back, I would have been okay by myself.  Yep, even if you're a single gal, you will be treated with respect, get a great vehicle and a great deal!",5.0
113,"April 12, 2012","Very smooth buying experience. Very fair no-hassle no-haggle price, good financing. They also offered a reasonable price for my trade-in. The only 2 small issues are 1) it might take a while to get the car you want as they are sold quickly 2) sometimes you need to bug people a lot to get your answers as they seem to be very busy and understaffed. Other than that everything has been great. Ron Amper has been very helpful and detailed when explaining to me how everything works.",5.0

I did not buy, o went to the Internet & started shopping all of the local dealers, that's when I found Chance & Subaru Georgetown.  I called him, gave Jim my vehicle info, told him what I wanted & we made the deal over the phone.  He brought the car in from another dealer because it was exactly what I wanted.  He even had the front windows tinted so that it would be ready for delivery that day.  The deal was great & exactly as we discussed on the phone.  The entire experience was professional & pleasant.

Kelly, with financing, was fun to talk to and I felt had my best interests at heart.  I cannot speak highly enough about Chance.

127,"March 31, 2010","Ten Reasons Not To Buy From Georgetown Subaru

1. In spite of pre-negotiating price, financing and terms, it still took almost 4 hours to buy our new Forester.  
2. They deceived us by tacking a $1600 ""loan fee"" on top or our loan (I didn't catch until I got the loan papers from the bank).
3. They ran my credit without my permission and still refused to put my name on the car title.  After the purchase was complete, we asked the bank to add my name to the title, they said only by refinancing - which, of course they wouldn't give us as good a rate as we currently have.  BTW - Chase Bank OWNS Subaru.
4. We had not purchased a car in TX, and didn't know the DMV process; we were expecting to receive our tags in the mail.  SIX weeks later, we went to the dealership to find out when they had filed the paperwork.  In TX, tags are mailed to the dealership and ours had been sitting in the receptionist desk the whole six weeks.  
5. The receptionist has a seriously crappy attitude, which I reported to the manager.  Yet for some reason still has a job.  
6. We have somehow ended up on the Roger Beasely mailing list and get junk mail from them that has NOTHING to do with our car.
7. The car came with carwashes for life...they barely vacuum, they don't dust at all, and sometimes the bottom part of the car doesn't get washed at all.  FREE...CRAPPY, I guess you get what you pay for.
8. The car also came with free oil change and maintenance for 3 years...they are supposed to send reminders.  We were taken off the reminder system when I asked that they stop sending us junk mail.  So, if you want them to remind you when maintenance is due, you also have to accept their junk mail.
9. The salesman, Ron Amper, has NEVER followed up with us on our purchase.
10. What is most upsetting is that this dealership has a great reputation, so why did they treat us so poorly?",2.0
128,"March 30, 2010","I purchased my previous car from Chance three years ago, so when I went shopping for a new car several weeks ago I was sad to discover he no longer worked at the dealership where I purchased my Legacy GT. He was still selling cars, though, just a little ways up the road, so I called him up about a new WRX. One test drive and offer sheet later, I bought another car from him. Both purchases were a breeze. Chance was available at a moment's notice, had all the information a body could want, and worked out great deals for me on both occasions. He's quite personable, and probably the most low pressure sales person on the planet. Then again, his offer sheets have stunned me on two occasions now, so it's probably easy for him to be so laid back. If you're looking for the so-called ""no hassle"" approach to car sale, but you actually want a good deal in the process, dealing with Chance is the man to see. Chance has my endorsement as the best care salesperson with whom I've ever had the pleasure (and that's not usually a word I associate with car salespeople) of dealing. ",5.0
