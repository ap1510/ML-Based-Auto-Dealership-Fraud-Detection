1,"July 24, 2018","From our first contact with Kriss Asbury the process of buying our beautiful Mercedes was enjoyable.  Everyone at the dealership was helpful, friendly and made us feel appreciated.  We drove over 200 miles (From Dallas to Houston) to buy the car we were looking for.  The service we received made the drive worth the distance.  Kriss answered all of our questions and acted very professional.  Once we completed the purchase, Paula Alpha prepared all of the documents.  Paula was courteous and made this part of the transaction very helpful.  Before we left the dealership we were given the opportunity to ask question.  We were very impressed with the Mercedes-Benz of The Woodlands dealership.",5.0
