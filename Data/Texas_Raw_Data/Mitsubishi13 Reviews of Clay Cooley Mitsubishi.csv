0,"May 26, 2020","I was totally disrespected I was told one thing by AJ the director of Internet sales saying she could help me get into a vehicle even though I had been on my job for a short time  I Ubered up there because my current car transmission went out and I needed a new reliable car to get me back and forth to work and to drive my kids back and forth to daycare I was told I could be helped I have $1,500 to put down I needed a midsize SUV that would have low miles and was very reliable when I got there I was told AJ was not there I spoke with Ahmad Rashad let me test drive a 2019 Chevy equinox the car is beautiful I love the the way it drove very smoothly but then the bank came back I was told that I would have to put 2500 down and pay $580 to $590 a month way too expensive for a single mom of three I then asked if there are any cars I could get in and pay for 450 to 500 a month for and I was told I need a co-signer to get anything on their lot then to add insult to injury they showed me a 2014 Chevy Impala 126000 miles on it the complete opposite of what I was looking for I feel so disrespected I wasted my time and my money going out there I don't recommend anybody who is a single mother  to come to Clay Cooley especially if your credit is below 600
He even had the Audacity to laugh as I walked out the door I was upset I wanted to cry sent back out the door in the rain empty handed now I have three inquiries on my credit and specifically asked them not to check my credit if they can't help me now this will my credit score to go down even further

1,"April 27, 2020","I looked online before going to this dealership.  A young man assisted us with looking at vehicles.  I told him I was looking for something around $10,000.  He showed me a couple of vehicles but I asked to see one of the larger SUVs. He told me it was a former lease and selling for $16,000.  Since it was a 2019 I thought that was a great deal.  It seemed to take a long time for paper work and he asked for my debit card to prove that I would be able to pay the down payment.  Unbeknownst to me they ran my card. When the paper work was done he started me signing the piddly paperwork like for the license tags,etc.  To this point he had not shown me the financing.  It was the last piece of paper and it showed the car was over $25,000!!!  The little sneak had been lying the whole time and wasted our whole day.  When I told him I had not agreed to buy a $25,000 car he said ""oh I don't know about the financing"" plus there is tax.  To top it all off the one of the managers was awful to my husband when my husband tore up the paperwork and asked for my debit card and told him we were leaving.  It was not until we got home that we realized they had charged my card for $6,500 without permission.  DO NOT SHOP AT CLAY COOLEY DEALERSHIP IN ARLINGTON.  THEY ARE A BUNCH OF CROOKS.",1.0
2,"November 15, 2019","Today I conducted an internet search for a vehicle. I was contacted by an internet sales agent, but declined to go further due to getting news of an unexpected death of my family, and needed to prepare to assist my family with arrangements.  A few hours later, I received a call again, which I hit the decline button.  A minute later I received a text message from an internet sales agent (Alexis).  I kindly texted back, please do not contact me again.  She then proceeded to send another text, I felt she was being disrespectful by contacting me regardless to my wishes, so I called her, and told her when I say stop contacting me, that's what the f**xx I mean.  I shouldn't have to resort to that language or make a call after I've politely told her not to contact me, as I was dealing with enough with the death of a family member.  She proceeded to contact me again though text telling me. Not to put inquires in if I don't want anyone calling my disrespectful xxx, God bless me and my foul mouth.  I did contact the Manager, who addressed my complaint with respect, however at the end of the day, had she respected my request, things wouldn't had gotten this far. I do not appreciate being harassed by their employee, who in my  opinion represents the business and sets the tone for everyone who works there.  If you can't conduct yourself professionally on the phone, I definitely don't think anyone in their establishment can be trusted or conduct themselves honestly. They never have to worry about me again in life. After burying my family member I was going to continue my search for a vehicle, but it won't be with them.  You never know what someone is going through on the other end of the phone, and ALEXIS has no right to continue her contact, before or after I called and had to get nasty.  I hope not everyone has a nasty attitude like ALEXIS, and treat customers like crap.  I have posted screen shots of our text exchange, along with my review on Yelp.  I hope Mr. Cooley sees this review and handles this situation as appropriate, thank you Carter and Sammie for listening to my complaint, and your respectful response for the actions of your employee.

4,"October 10, 2019","I will never be going back. Dianna Gallardo is the rudest cashier in the service department I have ever met. Never smiling, never in a good mood, rude EVERY-TIME I would go in. She should consider a new job because she clearly doesn’t know she’s in the CUSTOMER SERVICE industry. The sales men are absolute JOKES. I could see right through their fake smiles and smoke being blown around. Mike (service manager) and Gary (mechanic) attempted to save the day to no avail. I will never bring my business back to Clay Cooley. I feel completely taken advantage of in a time of uncertainty. If you have any respect for yourself I wouldn’t give your business to this dealership. Oh, and expect a minute long voicemail after your service where they will beg you for a 5 star review.",2.0

7,"July 23, 2019",The staff here is very kind. I came in looking and told them up front that I would not be purchasing today and they still treated me as if I was family. I may have to come back when I'm ready to buy.,5.0
8,"April 28, 2019","Well, I have bought many cars over my 44 years but I have never experienced what happen to me at Clay Cooley Mitsubishi on Friday.
We were on our way to drivers select to look at a car but my wife saw a Nissan sentra with 700 miles and a great price. I explained to her that I had a bad experience with Clay Cooley Dodge earlier and I didn't want to go down that road, but I eventually caved and we stopped by. 
When we arrived the car they were trying to show us was not the car we saw online. We finally found the right car and it looked to be a good car at a good price.
On the test drive the salesman was talking with his girlfriend in the back on the phone and was very unprofessional. I should have left but the price made me stay.
I went in and told the salesman no games, give me the final out the door cash price.
His manager came out and the price was $5000 more than the internet price. This was on a $11000 internet price on the car. The final price with TTL was $17k and some change!!!!!!
After the shock wore off I asked him WHY? He said it was some sort of reconditioning fee.
This is false advertisement and car dealership games.
I laughed and walked out.
I went to driver select and got a better car at a good price

9,"April 23, 2019","Went to this dealership because they advertised 2 Mitsubishi Outlander SEL's at $20245. They also had a 2019 advertised at $24,500. When we got there, they said they couldn't find either of the 2018's but they could work the same deal with a 2019. When the car was brought around, it was an ES model. Sales woman had asked about what color would be preferred and I said Gray first, then white or Silver followed by black or maybe dark blue. Of course, she brought dark blue and an ES. 

Not an SEL and not the color I asked for. They have more than enough cars to find both and SEL and in Gray. The issue was, they were trying to sell what they wanted to sell not what I wanted to buy. 

After driving the car anyway thinking we could sort those things our after, I told her the car wasn't going to work. I went over what I came for. I was irritated because they said they sold them. Then it changed to the sales woman going to look for it. From there, she said she would look for it. 

Magically, we found ""the car."" Stock number matched the website, but of course it was NOT an SEL. Sales woman tried to say the leather was just accents on the console etc, not necessarily the seats. She didn't even know what she was selling.  

We didn't bother to look for the other one because when I went back through the pictures, there was no SEL designation on the back of the car and the interior clearly did not match that of the SEL's leather seats. 

The same thing was discovered of the Gray 2019. NOT an SEL as advertised. 

After all of that, I left and decided I was not in the right place. I have pictures to prove their misleading adds. Sad part is, this all took place on Friday and the adds are still unchanged 5 days later. Just dishonest business! Bait and Switch is exactly their mission.

Unbelievable!!

Ended up at Don Herring Mitsubishi, which is where I should have gone to begin with. Great experience! Brought the exact car out on the first try and we completed the purchase with ease!

10,"December 19, 2015","My experience was smooth and hassle free! I had the pleasure of working with O.J. as my sales associate. He was efficient, direct, and reassuring.  He was able to put me in something I wanted,  that was also affordable, and he didn't take all day either! Shop them first; Shop there last, whatever you do go see O.J. at Clay Cooley for all your car buying needs.",5.0
11,"January 29, 2015","I went to Clay Cooley Mitsubishi of Arlington after my parents told me to go after they got a car from there. They told me to go see Edgar Chavez and that he would figure out a way to get me into a vehicle. I went with only a little bit of money down and my credit is shot so I had my doubts, but he was able to get into my dodge avenger r/t and I am happy. If you are looking for great service and just down right respect go and see Edgar.",5.0
12,"December 20, 2014","I'll be brief. I went online looking for a car that was reasonable and had low payments. Clay Cooley Mitsubishi popped up. I was contacted immediately by Francisco V. He was very polite, spoke very well over the phone, and assured me that he could get me a car despite my credit. I was sold on his knowledge, manners, and kindness. So we went through the process, I gave him everything he needed, and he assured me that He would get me approved. And he did!! He also told me that the only thing I would have to do when I finally went in was sign and leave!! Again he kept his word. Thank you Francisco V. for making things easy for me.
