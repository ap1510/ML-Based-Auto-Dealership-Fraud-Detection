2,"March 03, 2020","I want to start by saying that I never leave reviews. I am here to commend Kaitlyn and the employees at the shop that did the repairs on my F-150 recently. My insurance company made this a nightmare for me and Kaitlyn and crew provided me with absolute 5 star service. My vehicle was not only repaired, but in even better condition that it was before it came in. I couldn’t be more pleased and will definitely recommend your business to everyone I know. Again, thank you so much to everyone who was a part of repairing my vehicle. Such a great and professional team. They all deserve raises!!!",5.0
3,"February 18, 2020",Alberto  in the oil change department needs a class in customer service. 1st time visit for me. Dude you are downright rude. Didn't even want to acknowledge my presence when I walked up to the counter. Your attitude reflects on the dealership reputation. Remember customers have a choice where they want to get their vehicles serviced. For me a very awkward and uncomfortable situation.  Hope you have a better day tomorrow.,2.0

5,"February 05, 2020",Great experience.... found the perfect preowned vehicle at a great price... low mileage and wonderful low pressure sales experience I would tell all my friends and family about.  Definitely the place to shop for your next vehicle.  Ask for James Satterfield for your sales consultant  and enjoy and great sales experience.   The finance department will find you great loan options and help keep you within your budget. All around wonderful purchase experience.  ,5.0

7,"January 01, 2020","Service Manager -Tim Allen- will not return any form of communication. (Multiple phone calls, voicemails, emails) 19 Escape purchased new has been in service for 31 days and not a single follow up from advisor after initial diagnosis.  Purchased new, but has a manufacturing defect with engine block and must replace engine.  Called Ford and was told to speak to dealer about buyback program.  Dealer says speak with Ford.  Complete runaround with no one accepting blame for selling a defective product.  When I call and ask for Tim, 
“he is not in right now”, completely dissatisfied with McCree Ford.  They sold a bad product and instead of at least trying to make it right they just pass the blame and hope you will just give up trying. Totally unacceptable to be shut out by dealership.  I really expected more from a local dealer, my fault for not going with a nationwide dealership.",1.0

9,"September 08, 2019","I'm not gonna lie. I didn't think I would ever be giving a dealership a 5 star review but this place really is different. Zero, I mean zero pressure. They don't come running into the parking lot before you even get out of your car. They didn't try to sell me something I didn't want. They didn't even try to sell me the tint and running boards that were already on the vehicle, they were already included in the price like they should have been.

They really did a great job. I was very pleased with the experience and I got a great deal. They gave me what I wanted for my trade and their price was fair. This place is not like average dealerships, I will definitely return for my next vehicle.",5.0

12,"August 29, 2019",Just moved back to Texas from California and purchase a F150 today from McRee Ford. We are a Ford family and have purchased vehicles from McRee back on the late 90’s and then the worlds largest dealership Galpin Ford in CA when we lived there. I can honestly say the McRee experience exceeded my expectations and was better than my past Galpin purchases. Carl set us up with Salesman Don Gartman. He was very patient in showing us multiple vehicles and answered all our questions. Best car buying experience ever! I highly recommend McRee and Don!!,5.0
13,"August 01, 2019","McRee Ford has provided normal servicing as well as warranty repairs/service for my car since I purchased it in 2014.  Without exception, their service has been courteous, competent, and complete.  In addition, their ""Loaners for Owners"" practice makes the service almost painless.  

Of particular note, Samuel Perez, who handled my latest visit, stands out above the rest.  While all the service reps I have encountered have been excellent representatives for the dealership, Mr. Perez provides the extra focus on my specific problems that produces results that will keep me coming back to McRee Ford.  

From the initial sales and sales management personnel through my last visit (picked up my car today), McRee employees have been uniformly excellent.  Again, let me emphasize that Samuel Perez stands out as clearly superior over a field of excellent people.",5.0
14,"July 29, 2019","I have purchased 4 vehicles from McRee Ford in Dickinson, Texas. My previous experience is what brought me back to purchase another vehicle for my daughter. Needless to say I wasn't disappointed.  Rick Neadom was my salesman. He made the buying experience great. He was a no pressure salesman who delivered what we felt was a great deal both my trade and my purchase. He was a no nonsense salesman. He had everything ready for us when we were ready for delivery and the entire process took less than 30 minutes. Oscar in finance ensured all of our paperwork was squared away and we were out the door. 
We will most assuredly be a customer of McRee in the future and Rick is going to be the man I call to make it happen.",5.0

Hurricane Harvey hit at the end of August so this issue was pushed back until November. I called and sent several emails to the service manager about this and finally was asked to bring the truck to the body shop manager and he would take care of it for me. All he did was look and take pictures. Again, I called and emailed both managers several times and finally at the end of December, I received a phone call from the body shop manager that McRee would not fix the truck. I know that the truck is out of warranty and I expected to maybe share in the expense. The issue I have is I was told several times that Ford/McRee Ford would take care of it and it took five months to be told no. Now, in one of the spots, my truck is rusting.",1.0

43,"November 04, 2017","Today after a 4 hour marathon with your sales staff, I left your dealership without a vehicle and wondering why I ever came. After making an appointment with a specific Sales Rep for a specific time I was shuffled off to an obviously poorly trained replacement. To make a long story short the ability of your staff to close a deal lost you a sale and a customer. I will never shop McCree again as I don’t trust your honesty but mostly your ability to understand basic sales concepts.


So for a better price, a better vehicle and a more competent staff I bought my first non-Ford vehicle in 20 years. I will recommend to all of my peers who are  to considering McCree as their choice of dealership, to run in the other direction.

So…avery nicely appointed, fairly priced and intelligently sold Nissan Murano will be cleaned, fueled and ready for me to pick up on Monday morning.

A very disappointed long time Ford customer.

46,"October 12, 2017","To All,
I recently bought a 2015 F-250 with 33,500 miles from Katy Auto Nation Ford on Aug 5th 2017. I purchased this truck @ auto nation because it was exact trim/color I was looking for. However after driving it for 13 days the low fuel pressure light came on. So I then called Auto Nation and explained where I was in League City and service technician said its under warranty take the truck any where. So I had the truck towed to Mcree Ford in Dickinson, TX where I was greeted by Brian Mobley. Brian was very customer service oriented and checked the truck in and got me into a comparable rental. A few days later Mr. Mobley called to notify me that they had replaced my fuel pump and to tell me that there was a blockage in the fuel line. At this time Brian told me if the contamination in the line is not related to the truck in any way that this would not be a warranty case. Makes perfect sense to most! Again I had just bought the truck so I was beginning to become frustrated with the situation. I asked Mr. Mobley to continue the service to find out what the foreign matter was. We later found out it was a cylinder shaped piece of cardboard from a fuel additive most likely injector cleaner. So I called auto nation and replayed the story to the sales manager Sam, who was unfavorable of my situation. Brian Was understanding and helpful through out the entire service of my truck. So I was very frustrated at auto nation at this point. I went to pick up my truck from Mcree, met Brian and while I was waiting I asked to speak with the service manager Tim Allen. Tim had heard of my issue and was overly understanding and covered Mcree's Cost to not tarnish Ford's name and to take care of the customer. This helped my in more ways than one. I can not thank Brian, and Tim enough for their customer support. After my experience at Mcree I will only give them my business when it comes to my truck service, or even another purchase.",5.0
47,"October 04, 2017","Update: 10/1/2017. Got a letter from Zurich Insurance which is representing McRee. In short, we are not covering your loss of a car. TDL: You are out of a car and money because we are greedy, tough luck. 

I bought my car from McRee last year. I had my 2016 Ford Edge Sport at McRee Ford two (2) weeks prior to Hurricane Harvey due to a safety recall and an adaptive steering fault (2nd failure). McRee had possession of car during this time as they did not feel getting parts in a timely manner mattered. Long story short, my car flooded while in their possession and is now totaled. McRee told me to take a hike and that I had to file under my own insurance for damages.  They are backdating my loaner turned ""rental car"" with a week of charges because the flooding occurred a week ago....  McRee then had the nerve to say they would be happy to sell me a new car at a small discount due to my loss.... 

Now I have NO CAR and a bill that I still have to pay. If one anyone does read this review, please don't buy your car here. They don't care about you, they just want your money.",1.0

50,"August 12, 2017","We are ""Ford drivers.""  Years ago we purchased an F-150 from McRee and later a Mustang in 2000. When we purchased other Ford vehicles after 2000, we went through other dealers-trying to stay closer to our neighborhood. 
We are now back to McCree Ford as we found NONE of the others dealerships compared. The service we received at McCree from the moment we stepped in was remarkable. Our salesman, RICK NEADOM, was awesome. He was friendly, knowledgeable and accommodating.  Rick made sure all our questions were answered and that we were completely satisfied. We are confident that we made the right decision by returning to McRee. We are looking forward to quality service while enjoying our Explorer.

79,"November 22, 2016","Justin Harmon, my salesman, has definitely changed my perspective on the car buying experience. I was prepared to ensure the long stressful process, but was absolutely shocked to have been led through the process by Justin with such ease. I am not an easy customer to deal with, and I have often times had sales reps hand off my accounts to others because of the hardships they were incapable of enduring with me. Justin did not once show any signs of stress or irritation and when I made a request, he simply made it happen. I have been in sales for 17 years and this is the very first time I have made a purchase and walked away more than happy, only to realize I had been outsmarted by my saleman. And I mean that in the absolute best way possible! As a saleswoman, that is the ultimate compliment and I sincerely hope McRee Ford takes care of Mr. Harmon, because I can guarantee you, I, along with my counterparts at the Sprint Corporate Office, will continue to diligently pursue salesmen such as Justin to join our teams in executive sales. You must be doing something right to retain such talent, and that speaks volumes!

We gave him a maximum price we could pay and he did everything possible to come as close to that price as possible and I must say it was very close so if you’re looking for a new or pre-owned car go to McRee Ford and ask for Larry Hayes.

128,"August 23, 2015","Mcree Ford was unable to perform basic services, such as measure battery amperage and tire depth, which was the main reason for bringing in the vehicle.  In addition, they damaged the tailpipe in such a manner, it made the car unable to be driven.  Then the McRee Ford technician and service consultant (Craig Decker) lied about it, falsely accusing my son of riding over a curb and causing the damage prior to bringing in the Vehicle and harassing my wife and son in the service center as they were told to come pick up the car because nothing we asked them to check was wrong.  The shop foreman (Brian Callahan) finally admitted to damaging the pipe, but roadblocked us by only willing to pay for labor ($110) and making me pay for the part ($140), I accepted just to get my car back after a week in the shop so I don't ever have to see Mcree Ford again.  
In addition to damaging the vehicle, the technician was so poor, he was unable to even measure the tire depth properly on our car and it took the shop foreman to verify that we in fact do need tires.  However, I will not be getting them there.  The service consultant (Craig Decker) even had to be told 3 times that he was to check the battery amperage, tread depth and bumper clips.  He put wrong information on the service records and stated the battery needed to be jumped and we installed bumper clips that needed to be inspected.  The truth was McRee Ford told us the clips may have fallen off and I needed them to verify.  Additionally, we were previously told by Mcree Ford at our prior appointment the battery needed immediate service, but that proved to be wrong.
The worst part is they never even attempted to contact my wife and son to apologize for harassing them and lying about the damage or falsely accusing them of causing the damage.",1.2

James Tillman sent me a quote, an out-the-door price, and never wavered from it.  Because of his non-pressure style and being honorable to his word, I bought from him even though it meant flying from Dallas to Houston to seal the deal and pick up the vehicle.  When I arrived, James went above and beyond by picking me up at the airport.  We arrived at the dealership and he had already given my papers to the finance department to speed up the process as I needed to drive back to Dallas that evening.  I inspected the vehicle and noticed that there was a door ding and a small scratch on the wheel well, both of which James had expediently fixed.  No one there pressured me to purchase additional items and the finance part went smooth.  When the deal was sealed, James took me to my new car and noticed there were dirty marks on the inside ceiling.  He immediately had a crew clean it.  Throughout the whole process, James was professional and very personable.  I've done business with many car dealerships and salesmen in the past, and I can honestly say my experience with James at McRee Ford was a pleasant, refreshing change, and ultimately rewarding as I got everything that we had agreed upon as well as first-class service.

154,"June 18, 2012","I have bought my last 3 cars from McRee Ford. I found a car I loved and they made it so simple to trade in my old car and buy the new one. I love the ""loaners for owners"" program. It makes getting repairs on my car stress free. I was even able to test drive a new car before i bought it by requesting it as a loaner when I was having some minor work done on my old car.",5.0

157,"April 12, 2012","I have purchased 6 trucks over the past 15 years from Mc Ree Ford. I have always been treated fairly. In recent times, my saler person has been Ben Niebauer. Ben is a huge asset to Mc Ree Ford and is now the main reason I deal with Mc Ree. Additionally, Donnie Veret is the other reason that I enjoy buying from Mc Ree Ford. Donnie is the Service Manager and is very professional and makes bringing my vehicle in a pleasurable experience. I give Mc Ree Ford the very highest ratings and refer business there on a regular basis.",5.0
