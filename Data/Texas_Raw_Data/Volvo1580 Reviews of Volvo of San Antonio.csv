0,"May 20, 2020","I am totally pleased with my new Volvo purchase and the sales support I received from Billy Havlik. His background in the Volvo Service Department was very informative and helpful in making my final decision. He was able to answer all my questions clearly and honestly, which I greatly appreciated. He didn't try to talk around anything I asked him about the car I was interested in or the warranty and service support provided by the dealership. He has also been very helpful in keeping me informed about some good used cars for my granddaughter that have come in there, which I had asked him to do, if possible. I recommended him to a friend of mine who is in the market for a new car. I wouldn't do that unless I truly thought he was an outstanding salesman AND person. I just hope he is still working there when I purchase my next Volvo. ",5.0

Ricco has handled our sales process for years and he provides top quality advice and assistance.  Highly recommend this location and asking for the best when you want to commit to a purchase on a Volvo.   My husband and I have been customers for over ten years and always walk away smiling after our purchase.  Make sure you see Ricco when in the market for fair, honest, candid feedback regarding shopping requirements.  I will continue to be an avid Volvo customer due to the reliability, safety and overall quality. ",5.0

5,"May 31, 2019","My husband and I intended to make a short visit a take our first look at new Volvos.
After driving Cadillacs for many years we were surprised to be so impressed by the smooth, quiet  ride, 
beautiful interiors, impressive electronics , and new styling.  Our visit resulted in the purchase of a new
XC90.  We are extremely happy with our choice.

6,"May 01, 2019","Brought my vehicle in for a 20K Service Maintenance.  Also, expressed a concern that on occasion when accelerating, my vehicle would hesitate which would not be normal for a 2017 car.  The service agent ""Jim"" made every attempt to assure me that a thorough inspection of the issue would be resolved.  Was provided a loaner (which was awesome) and had been told that the part correcting the issue would not be in for several business. Once my car was ready for pick-up, there was no wait time because it was waiting for me and all the need to be done was to exchange keys and off I went.  Great Job Volvo of San Antonio!   ",5.0

13,"April 24, 2019",Purchased a vehicle from this Dealership via long distance.  Drove into town and was in and out in no more than an hour and a half.  The salesperson was FANTASTIC and the Finance Manager was equally FANTASTIC!!!  This vehicle is probably the 10 vehicle I’ve purchased over the years from different Dealers but it is by far the most pleasant experience O have ever had.  This Dealership has spoiled me rotten and I know where my next vehicle purchase will be from.,5.0

16,"April 22, 2019","I had an appointment for oil change and car wash.  The oil change alone took nearly 2 hours.  I got my vehicle back with oily finger prints on the driver door and no car wash.  Was told my vehicle was clean inside and out.  I also found that to drive my vehicle from the service portico to the service area, my seat, radio, a/c and rear view mirror had all been ""adjusted"".  ",2.6
17,"April 21, 2019","I had never thought in my life time I could go in a Volvo dealership to buy a new care and receive a welcome greeting from the sales people I was somewhat nervous. It took less than 3 hours to buy my vehicle from walking to walking out with a purchase. I was happy to get the Volvo I picked and was available to take home right away. I did talk to my family about my experience and now my nephew is in the market to get his own Volvo. Thank you for the best customer service.

22,"April 17, 2019","Erik Juarez is a great asset for Volvo. The guy takes the time to listen to the client's concerns and offers options to come up with a solution. I love that! It was a huge disappointment in service before because they did not care about the opinion of the client. They would give me a huge invoice without the options of breaking down what needed to be done. I have been driving Volvo for more than 20 years and couldn't be happier how the San Antonio Volvo is evolving for the best!

26,"April 16, 2019","From the moment I got on the phone with Billy about the vehicle to having him explain the details of the car to my wife, the experience was comfortable. Of course trying to negotiate a final price is part of the process and this can become a tough experience but with this dealership it went well.",4.8
27,"April 15, 2019","I can not say enough about the service I received at the dealership. I had to have my car towed because I live completely out of the area. Jim called me as soon as it arrived and went above and beyond to make sure my needs were met. He continued searching for my extended warranty to make sure parts were covered and kept me up to speed on each process of the cars repairs and their cost. Jim had my cars repaired completed before the scheduled date and it drives like a dream. When you have a  service team who goes out of their way to make sure you are satisfied and that continues through the life of your car you guarantee a returning customer. Volvo is a great car, the service that goes along with the car matches equally!   ",4.8
28,"April 11, 2019","As always I was treated very well.  My service adviser Jim kept me informed throughout the whole process.  Jim had also provided me with a quote on what the out of pocket cost was going to be on my vehicle and when it came time to pay the quote was spot on, very nice.  I was provided with a loaner vehicle while my vehicle was in the service department getting worked on and as always the loaner vehicles are well kept and pleasant to drive.",4.8
29,"April 11, 2019",I already did my home work on the car that i purchased. Daniel Garza made it very easy and help me get the car home.  That was a personal touch.,4.8
30,"April 09, 2019","Reported smelling gasoline vapors for two years during routine maintenance.  Finally requested  a more thorough investigation.  According to the service dept., a ""smoke test"" revealed a defective O-ring seal at the gas tank.  Returned the XC-90 two months later, for same problem.  This time a cracked transmitted was reported.  Research on the internet revealed that this model had experienced many fuel leaks but Volvo refused to pay for any of hte repairs because they said it was normal wear.
Having never had a problem with any other vehicle, I feel like they have taken advantage of me by not finding the problem earlier and for requiring me to pay $900 for this repair.  ",2.8
31,"April 07, 2019","San Antonio Volvo has repaired 2 check-engine lights (replaced hybrid battery thermostat and gas tank piping), a fried air suspension and an airbag malfunction in the first 5000 miles of the XC90 we bought from them.  The car may be a lemon, but the service center is great.  They have always taken care of me quickly, put me in a good loaner and kept me in the loop as work progressed.  My car comes back with quality repair work (all under warranty) and a fresh wash.",5.0

Volvo is a wonderful company and has great customer service as we were greeted by several of the staff as we traded in our 2015 Volvo. Love the people that work there and the great customer service each and every time we visit!,5.0
35,"April 03, 2019","When I set up an appointment and a loaner well in advance, I expect things to go smoothly and quickly.  This is my second service appointment with this dealership and each time, especially the last one on April 2, it has been an unremarkable experience.  From checking in to getting the loaner and driving out, it is 1 hour.  The latest experience took about an hour an a half after the dealership sent me to Enterprise for my loaner.  Understaffed and busy!   Total frustration!  

I must have unrealistic expectations for a quick in and out service experience.  I’m acting like I own a high dollar Volvo or something!  Oh, I do!  

Pick up your game VOLVO!",4.2
36,"April 03, 2019","I have bought 3 cars from Principal Volvo and each time they have been a pleasure to work with!  I've been driving Volvo's for over 40 years and I trust Principal Volvo not only in their sales, but also their wonderful service department.  Since I live over 80 miles from the dealership, they have made sure that I had a car that was dependable for the entire time they were working on my car.  I wouldn't go anywhere else to purchase a Volvo other than Principal Volvo! ",5.0
37,"April 03, 2019","The Dealership was super to work with!  Everyone went the extra mile to help me get into the XC90 I wanted.  It was a pleasure to work with Joel Lozano as my Sales Associate.

If you go to Volvo of SA make sure to ask for Joel Lozano...absolutely the BEST!!!!!",5.0
38,"April 01, 2019","I scheduled my regular maintainer 10,000 mile! I didn’t know I needed to request a loaner car.  By the time my car was picked up I had been waiting on service 3 days till it was finished!  My car was not cleaned when I got it either!  ",3.8

43,"March 29, 2019",I made and appointment online and asked for a loaner.  Check in went very smoothly and I was on my way in the loaner XC60 very quickly.  Erik Juarez was very efficient and personable. I was kept appraised of my service via text and when notified my rear brake pads needed replacing gave the go ahead.  They honored a coupon and advertised brake special from the dealership without hesitation.  Very satisfied with the Principle dealership and service department.,5.0
44,"March 28, 2019","When I purchased my Volvo it was explained that I would be provided a service (dealership would come get my car in Boerne and either leave loaner car or return my vehicle same day of service). I had a 2pm March 25, 2019 appointment but was informed that day it would be 3pm before they would arrive.  I was then told I would have my car returned that same day ( however, around 5pm that same day, I received call saying car compute still updating so my car would be returned early next day).  on March 26 I waited until 1pm(after lunch) to call and find out status of my vehicle, since I had heard nothing from Volvo.  I feel there may be some issues in the service department.  My technicians and porter were helpful but the service agreement itself was unacceptable in promptness and communication.  I’m hopeful that this improves before I am due for maintenance again in 2020.",3.2

48,"March 25, 2019","We found this vehicle online and immediately contacted the dealership. They responded very quickly and we started asking a lot of questions. Each was answered thoroughly and we decided to make the 3 hour trip to the dealership for this particular vehicle. They had all the paperwork ready to go and even had a bow placed on the vehicle. This was the clincher for my wife who would be the one to drive the car off the lot. Rico was professional, courteous and extremely helpful (This is our first Volvo!) Something tells me this won't be our last Volvo.  Thanks for the helpful and easy experience!, I'm sure we'll be seeing them again.    ",5.0

67,"March 01, 2019","Living in San Marcos, I had a choice between Volvo of Austin and Volvo of San Antonio. I chose the latter when it came to buying my new car, not only because it is easier to get to, but because the customer service and respect I receive as a female customer is excellent!

78,"February 21, 2019","I bring my vehicle to Volvo because I feel better have it serviced by Volvo technicians. The last few times I’ve brought in my car there have been minor things that I feel should not have happened. I spent $3,500.00 for a catalytic converter and when I picked up my car there was tape on the windshield and the fill washer fluid light was on. Also the car wash was nice, but the car must have been dried with a dirt towel because the windows were grimy. I bright in my car a few weeks ago for new brakes and rotars and a windshield seal, which became a replacement because it was cracked in the process. Thank you for the new windshield, but when I picked up my car, again dirty windows from the wash, no windshield fluid, and the sit was so low and so far back i nearly hurt myself getting in the car. 

We spend good money keeping up the maintenance on our vehicles and when they are returned to us in such conditions, it’s reallt disappointing and no one at the company seems to care, as I’ve made these, and other comments, to no avail. 

I would like to mention Connor. When I picked up the loaner car it was a chilly day and he had the seat warmers on. It was a small thing, but it made a great impression. I only wish he returned my car to me.",3.2

88,"February 02, 2019","Had a seal repaired that a competitor had said needed to be replaced. Then Philip worked with me on pricing to keep it in the ballpark I had been quoted over the phone. Finally, Philip took the extra time to show me where the leak had been so we could watch for any issues going forward. Only minor complaint was the timing of status updates. I was a little slow to hear the price estimate (although I was quoted an estimate over the phone) and general timing status.  Still, they got me in and out on the same day. Much appreciated.",5.0

This is my 4th Volvo, and my second time purchasing or leasing from Volvo San Antonio. I cannot say enough complementary things about Joel Lozano. Joel has gone out of his way to make the car buying process easy and ensured I was going to be satisfied with my purchase.   I make a trip from Austin to San Antonio specifically to do business with this Volvo dealership because of the people and service. It is true what they say, once you own a Volvo you will never want to drive another manufacturer’s vehicle - This certainly rings true for me.

I've been patient and optimistic as I know things happen. But to constantly return time and time again for the exact same issue has become extremely upsetting. I've owned 4 Volvo's and have had issues with the one I've purchased from your location from day 1. What is so upsetting is this seems as though it should be a relatively easy fix. First visit my front rotors and brakes where replaced as there was extreme shaking on braking and noise. This issue was resolved but I still had a grinding noise when braking and a roughness when driving. Techs believed it to be the dust covers, which wasn't the issue. We did this dance a couple of times, vehicle was left again where they were able to duplicate grinding noise on braking. Which resulted in rear brakes and rotors being replaced. Upon picking the vehicle up it does in fact ride smoother and there's no grinding, but now when braking I have a whistling noise coming from the rear. ",2.8

Miguel Hernandez took time to explain the features, talk about what different vehicles could possibly fit our needs, and answered a ton of questions from us.  No nonsense, no run around, just complete professionalism and he was extremely knowledgeable about the specifications on the different models and packages.  We also worked with their service department and were treated great by Philip Carroll.  Honest and straightforward the entire way! 

That professionalism extended to the entire staff and we felt very comfortable at Volvo of San Antonio.  We came back after visiting multiple other Volvo and Chevrolet dealerships because we liked the Volvo XC90 and the awesome experience we had there.  Overall they had more options, better service, and we had a better experience there.  

I have always owned Chevrolet vehicles and it was hard to make the switch at first.  After our first visit and seeing all of the features and pricing we compared apples to apples at the Chevrolet dealership with a 2019 Traverse High Country trim level.  The T6AWD XC90 blew it out of the water on interior/exterior design, engine performance, safety, and better features.  

Between the service we received and the amazing vehicle, we decided to use Volvo of San Antonio specifically for our purchase of the 2019 XC90.  Would do it again and recommend to family and friends anytime.

174,"December 08, 2018","I’ve owned Volvo cars for over 10 years and have always loved them. We recently traded in our XC60 for a XC90 this year. We’ve been using this particular Volvo service center for about 3 years. This most recent service appointment was a HUGE disappointment. I scheduled the appointment with a loaner vehicle. This is one of the perks of buying a Volvo. For me having two small children (under age 2) while working full time and being able to drop off my car and use a loner vehicle while I wait is crucial to me. This appointment I was told there was no loaner car available but I could go through the rental company or wait in the lobby (with my two month old child). I explained I had scheduled the appointment with a loaner and the reply was “we run out of loaners all of the time.” Though this may be true, I have been coming here for 3 years and always received a loaner. So I went through the rental company which the Volvo technician saw my disappointment and offered to ride with me so I wouldn’t have to take a shuttle with my baby. Then about 1 hour later I was leaving the rental car company in a car substandard to what I’m used to driving. When I check on the car I’m told it will be ready end of day (peak traffic time) and I explained that will not work. I’m glad I didn’t wait the 7 hours in the lobby with my baby. I told my service rep what time I would be by to pick up my car whether it was done or not and would return if needed at a later time. My car was rushed and completed by the time I arrived but not washed and it smelled of gas which I had to wash out when I got home but not after driving my two children around with the smell. I expressed my complaints and was told the General Manager would be notified and requested he call me. But alas I received no call. I’m not sure why the significant change in customer service. Previously I gave consistently positive feedback.

Tech said probably needs a new engine, cost to confirm that $600 before repairs!!!

I appreciate his level of professionalism in the workplace, and even more when he is working with customers. I have never had a negative encounter when visiting the Volvo service department; however, Libby the loaner car manager quickly changed my perception during my previous appointment. She was rude, condescending and displayed passive aggressive behavior towards Phillip when he simply asked her was my loaner vehicle ready. She unnecessarily snapped at him, and the sad part is that she did that in front of me the customer. Her behavior was not enough to keep me from coming back to Volvo of San Antonio; however, I recommend that leadership speaks to her about her attitude towards her coworkers especially in front of customers.

I was confused, because I was able to find a few across the country. Bud Pratt and Volvo of San Antonio made me realize that not all dealerships are run the same. They truly look out for the best customer experience. I never stepped foot in the door, but was taken care of like a King.

He kept me informed of expected delivery dates and on the evening the first one came in he sent me photos and information on the SUV.

415,"November 29, 2017","We have leased 5 cars previously and have to say the experience we had working with Lauren Dennis at Volvo of San Antonio, TX was hands down the most easy and enjoyable experience leasing a vehicle.  After visiting a Volvo dealership in Austin and doing some test driving, my heart was set on the XC90 Inscription.  My husband loved the vehicle as well but thought it wouldn’t fit the budget and was pushing for a cheaper make and model but he knew I loved the Volvo so he humored me when I said, “let me see if I can get them to make it work.”  After some time I became frustrated with the email communication and lack of detail from that dealership.  My husband saw how frustrated I was and suggested I just contact another dealership like I have done in the past and after google searching Volvo dealerships within 100 miles of our home, I chose Volvo of San Antonio, who is part of the Principle Auto Group, based upon all their positive reviews and inventory.  Lauren Dennis answered my call and I told her exactly what vehicle I wanted, term of the lease, miles per year, payment that could fit into our budget and briefly explained to her my frustration.  Lauren simply said, “let me see what we can do, I am sure we can work something out to get you into the car you want”.  Later that day I received an email from Lauren that was detailed, clear and the figures were in the ballpark of where we were willing to go but still beyond our maximum.  She said, “let me see if we can bring it down a tad more” and continued to work on improving the figures.  An hour later, I received a text from Lauren offering slightly better figures and although he had been pushing for the cheaper make and model, he knew the offer was too good to pass up.  He couldn’t believe the terms Volvo of San Antonio offered and how quickly they got them there and we hadn’t even stepped foot in their dealership yet!  
I can’t recommend Volvo of San Antonio more.  Lauren was awesome from the start with her completely transparent, no BS approach that made us feel extremely comfortable and confident in our decision. When we drove down to sign the paperwork a few days later we found the rest of the staff we met to be as pleasant and easy to work with.  No matter where you are in central Texas (or further), do yourself a favor and get your next vehicle from Volvo of San Antonio!

443,"August 24, 2017","When my fiance was involved in a horrible three car accident, his 2002 S40 Volvo was totalled.  Fortunately, because of his S40 Volvo, he walked away with nothing more than some neck pain and a headache.

As to be expected with a vehicle of this age, we only had liability on this vehicle.  Furthermore, we have had a bad run of things the last three years and had just started to pick ourselves up again when the wreck happened.  Our credit and finances are but a shadow of what they once were.  So when we went to Volvo of San Antonio, we expected to leave with a list of things we needed to work on before they could help us.  But we were pleasantly surprised.

Salesman Delwyn Franklin met us at the door.  He listened carefully to our financial challenges, NEVER ONCE showing any sort of annoyance or upset with the fact we were not there to purchase a high priced new vehicle.  Matter of fact, he kept us apprised of every step of the process and made sure every single one of our needs were met while we waited.  He made us feel like we were purchasing the most expensive car in the show room, rather than a lower end used car.  

Once the finance folks came back with some options, Delwyn found two vehicles that fit our needs.  We selected a vehicle, test drove it, and were in and out of finance in no time flat.  No stress, no crowds, no walking in the hot sun.  We have never spent so little effort, and time, buying a car.

We love our new car.  It is everything we were looking for and more.  But we love how Delwyn made us feel, even more.  It is hard enough not to have the resources you once had, to only have sales person treat you badly, because they are not going to make ""bank"" on your sale.  However, Delwyn Franklin made us feel like we were the most important clients in the show room. 

My family and I have purchased 10 vehicles from a local Toyota dealership in the last 12 years.  I myself drive a new Rav4.  However, going forward, we will purchase our cars ONLY from Principle Volvo/Volvo of San Antonio and our salesperson will always be Delwyn Franklin.",4.5

For three years the vehicle was non-drivable.  I decided to tow the vehicle to San Antonio, Texas from Houston, Texas in March 2017 (I year after my mom’s death).  I purchased the white 2001 Volvo V70 Turbo in 2007 (pre-owned) in San Antonio and through the years no major problems.  I expected some mechanical issues but not more than one major issue. On 7 April 2017, I was informed by Service Advisor, Kevin Nichols that I needed a throttle body installed.  During the installation, the mechanic broke a screw (fail to replace it). More than 10 days later, the mechanic couldn’t detect any issue with the ECM.  I informed Kevin that my mechanic had the vehicle running for 3 days prior to having it towed to Principle Volvo.  The mechanic tried both ECMs, the original one and the one I bought online at a Foreign Part store. The mechanic claimed not reading any codes on the 1st ECM (it wasn’t the original ECM) and no codes from the original ECM.  The replacement ECM just needed software download per advice from my mechanic Larry.  I was charged $1,416.16 for a car that was running for less than 2 hours.  Just enough time to drive to the Department of Motor Vehicle to register for license plate and to my home.  The next day, the vehicle wouldn’t start.  
Since I had to drive to Houston to see my older brother (dying of cancer), I decided to contact Kevin on 10 April 2017.  I left a voicemail on his office phone.  I received no call back from Kevin. Since I was too busy to return the vehicle within the month due to other obligations in Houston with my brother, I decided to wait until I had free time to do so.  I was driving to Houston on a weekly basis and sometimes twice a week prior to the death of my brother on 25 May 2017.  While sorting out his estate, I was overwhelmed with stress and anxiety.  
On 4 August 2017, I stopped by Principle Volvo to speak to the General Manager, Bill Baker.  I explained to him my reasons for visiting 4 months after I had the 2001 Volvo in the Service Department.  Prior to leaving, he indicated that he will pay for a courtesy tow (no obligation to me) for Monday, 7 April 2017 evening pickup. Both the Tow truck driver and AAA requested for my credit card.  I indicated the General Manager stated he would pay the cost for the tow.  I never imagined after my lengthy conversation with Bill, I would be lied to about the payment for the tow.  If I had known I would be expected to pay for the tow, I would have used my AAA membership that allows up to 4 tows per year.  On 10 April 2017, I was told the vehicle was ready for pickup after I declined having the mechanic replace the cylinder head and resetting the timing.  Also, the mechanic indicated debris was found underneath the vehicle.  The same vehicle that was driven off the premise on 7 April 2017 where there’s no debris in my driveway.  I honestly believed that my vehicle was tampered with.  After 7 April 2017, my mechanic started the vehicle 2-3 times.  After turning off the vehicle, it wouldn’t restart.  Not once did Larry state a problem with any belts or the engine.  My only observation, the mechanic had to check two ECMs and later decided it was something else instead of the throttle body (just to charge me with a costly part and be done with me quickly) or was tired of dealing with my vehicle.  The vehicle was at the Service department more than 10 days from March-April 2017.  I felt mislead and assumed no one wanted to own up to their mistake.  Before leaving Volvo, I had to pay $274.06.  I was charged $78.00 for the tow that was promised by the General Manager.  As a woman, my word is my bond. I was also charged for an unrelated charge of $11.06. What could possibly cost $11.06? Of course, the labor was $158.00.  I really don’t believe the vehicle was inspected.  
On 4 April 2017 after leaving Volvo, I decided I would one-day trade-in my 2008 Hummer and become an owner again of a 2017-2018 XC-90.  I was an owner of a 2005 XC-90 before purchasing my Hummer.  There’s no way I would want to purchase a Volvo and have it serviced at the only Volvo dealership in San Antonio, Texas.  My treatment during this time was incomprehensible and disrespectful.  When I had my 2005 Volvo serviced at the Volvo Service Department, I received nothing but excellent service.  If I had to rate both services regarding my vehicle on a scale from 1 to 5, my rating would be 1.

She told me my service guy was Jim but I never really met him.  After Brianna took down all my information, she  said my service guy would contact me when car was ready.  I had told Brianna that I needed to be at work by 1:00pm.  No one had called me by noon, so I called and person answering phone did say car was ready.  He arranged for a pickup and low and behold, cheerful Brianna showed promptly.   When I arrived at the dealer, Jim gave me my paperwork and invoice.  I spend more time with Brianna so for me, she was my service coordinator.  If she hasn't been promoted to that position, she certainly should!

471,"August 02, 2017","I initially asked my sales rep. Meredith to have the AM radio and/or antenna looked at over a month ago. Her reply to me was that there was nothing wrong with it that the technician could find. I returned to have my car's regular maintenance taken care of and asked if they could check the AM radio and antenna. They did and told me they would have to order a new antenna and an modulator/isolator, not sure what they called it, and that it would be in a few days. Well, my advisor, who is no longer an advisor, failed to call me after over two weeks so I decided to call and check on my parts. I was told that the antenna was in and that it would be another three days on the modulator/Isolator part to arrive from Sweden. Two weeks later, after no update from my Volvo dealership, I decided to call again to check on the parts. I was told that they were in. I finally received an appointment to get my car fixed and I asked the person who checked me in, evidently I didn't have a service writer assigned to me and I was made fully aware of the situation as though I had control over it, to also check the truck liner and grip to close the trunk. (They seemed very ""loose and flimsy"" to me unlike the craftsmanship of car). Three hours later my car was ready and my radio worked magnificently. I went over the truck with the person checking me out and I told him it still seemed flimsy and I said to him, ""is that how it is supposed to be?'' and he said, ""yes"" with a shrug. I left because I had to get to an appointment, but the first chance I had I opened the trunk and pulled on the grip to close the trunk and the grip came out and I turned it over and could plainly see that it was broken. While I was at the dealership I inquired about my VIN number and if someone could print out or tell me what features that my car came with. (I bought a CPO car and didn't get a window sticker and I have been trying to figure out all the features on my  car versus the information in the manual). I was never given the information and no one has bothered to follow up. In light of all this I still Love my S60 and tell anyone who will listen that it is a ""Beautiful car that drives Beautifully."" Before I bought my Volvo I was a ""car"" person.

485,"July 24, 2017","My car wouldn't start. I had a friend jump-start it, so I took my S80 in to this location due to a possible bad battery. I get a call after dropping off the car and confirmed that the battery does need to be replaced, so I'm thinking okay the usual $300-400. But then the service rep, Derek Starnes explains that the top engine pad needs to be replaced. I'm told this is part of the bracket that holds the engine block. I understand that labor is significant for a job like that, and I am convinced by this rep that the bottom should be done as well. He quotes me a grand total of $830 and I decide to go ahead and approve the work. But then this Derek calls me back again and says that the drivers side window has intermittent electrical problems. I decide to wait for a later time for that repair, as that would cost an additional $400-600. This is Friday when the completed the work; I told them I would be in on Saturday to pick up the car. So when I picked up the car, I didn't even think to roll down any of the windows in this hot Texas weather. Fast forward. This Monday morning, as I arrive for work, at the main security gate I attempt to roll down the window to swipe my access badge, but the window doesn't even work! I called Derek Starnes to call me back. It's a pain in the xxx to drive all the way from New Braunfels and fight the San Antonio rush-hour traffic (both ends, morning, evening). I can't help but feel I'm getting ripped off.

They're very courteous. But that can only carry so far, if the primary purpose of this transaction is to provide a basic service.  All I asked was for my car to start. Right now, if it were possible I would give it negative zero reviews in terms of this location's service.

516,"July 04, 2017","I called about a used car.  I don't like to talking to car sales people, but it looked like a good deal.  I spoke to Daniel, asked him about the car, and asked him about fees and taxes.  He instantly offered a final quote on the phone, which was WELL within reason.  I asked, ""So, I pay you X dollars, and you give me the car?""  ""Yes.""  I was really stunned at how straight forward he was with the price.  Another dealer I saw (Red McCombs) strung me along for over a week.  Then after I asked about fees, the sales person told me about a $1985 dealer fee.  What?!!  Anyway, I got the payment method a little confused, but Volvo was really cool about it, and I ended up having the car for about three days before I paid them a penny (but I didn't do this on purpose.)  And about warranties, it was totally no-pressure.",5.0
517,"July 04, 2017","Great Salesman (Billy Havlic). We started this process about nine months ago when we rented a Volvo XC60 in Atlanta Georgia. The vehicle was great and we decided to look into Volvo once we returned home to Texas. I stopped by San Antonio Volvo dealership and met Billy. It took a few months for us to decide to finalize our purchase but we couldn't be any happier. Billy was our primary salesman, Rico was there when Billy was away and Meredith handled our final paperwork. These three individuals did a great job getting us into the vehicle we desired. We also got to chat with several staff members during our process and all were awesome. Great experience with no pressure. ",5.0

Took it back the next day and was told there is a 3rd issue that will cost over $600+.   Disappointed this issue was not noted before and concerned the latest work performed on the vehicle may have created this 3rd repair issue.  This vehicle is a 2004, so we expect to have to replace and/or repair components.   Our Volvos has always been dealer-maintained and taken in for service at the recommended intervals.

559,"June 10, 2017","I had been satisfied with them for several years which is why I  was so disappointed with my last encounter with them.  I needed to replace the battery.  So I removed the various covers as well as the bracket and replaced the battery.  

I was having difficulty getting the bracket back in place because it required an extension to my ratchet that I had not yet purchased.   I called and asked them what they would charge to simply ratchet the bolt in place and snap the covers back in place.  I was told $85.00.  

I explained that everything was already disassembled and it was just a matter of screwing down the bracket.  I added that I would think that after a few years as a customer that a more reasonable price could be offered.   She said unfortunately that was their policy and their price.  

I have my 100,000 miles service due and will be finding another business to have that done.   These guys are definitely not Lincoln.  And though I love this car,  I think I will be returning to Lincoln for my next vehicle.",3.0

I was told my front upholstery would be replaced due to the wear not holding up as it should have.  I was very happy to hear this, however, I was scheduled an appointment, but after driving 18 miles to the dealership, I was told only one of the seat covers was in, and so was scheduled another appointment.  Total 36 miles round trip waisted time, and gas.  Upon my second visit, both seats were covered.  No one walked to the car with me, nor did they take out the taped number on the windshield, or the paper floor mat.  When I got home and looked at the seats, they appeared puckered.  I called the following day to ask about it, and was set yet another appointment.  When I went in this morning, the service manager, after looking at the seats, told me the puckering was normal and that they should smooth out over some time (about a month).  Had one of the service reps inquired whe. I called I could have saved the trip.  If the puckering does not straighten out in a month or so, I will be returning to rectify the situation.  In total I drove a total of 108 miles, three visits.  Two of which could have been avoided.  In the 5 years I have been with Volvo the service has been great, with the exception of this last situation.  Very disappointing.",2.5

Working toward a resolution involved dealing with a 3rd party warranty provider and also initiating a technical ticket with Volvo to troubleshoot. They provided me a loaner car for transportation as it took over a week to work through this. I picked up our car yesterday with their assurance that the issue has been resolved and the work done was covered under warranty.

640,"April 25, 2017","I had a flat tire on the way into work Tuesday morning. The experience over the phone with Volvo Roadside assistance was great. The service center was very small so my tow truck driver had a very hard time dropping my vehicle off. Once the car was released, I had a pleasant experience getting my loaner vehicle. I asked for routine maintenance including an oil change since it had been a few months since I first purchased the vehicle. I was told my car would be done by 2 pm that same day. Around 1pm I received a phone call about the price of my tire and agreed to payment. I was told again that my car would be complete between 2pm - 3 pm and that I would receive a call once it was done. I never received a call. In fact the next day around 10 am I stepped outside of my office to give the young lady a call who was assisting me in this process and who had called me advising of the previous stated comments. She asked what my name was which I thought was crazy after she had spoken to me multiple times the day before and I told her immediately after she answered the phone that I was checking on my specific vehicle. She paused for a moment and said ""oh...I thought...can I place you on hold?"" I said sure and she came back stating that my car was finished yesterday. Not once did she apologize for not calling me back before leaving the office the night before. I told her I would be in after work. So, I pulled up and she brings me my bill which was incorrect. She then said she would get it fixed and have the technician change the air filter because all he did was an oil change and my warranty only covers at 100% if the full service was provided. Please keep in mind, that I worked in customer service for 3 years during college and even when a customer suggests they want/need a specific item/service I always tell them their benefits immediately. She goes on to tell me because all I asked for yesterday was an oil change that's what I was given. I told her that also mentioned that when I purchased the vehicle I was told my oil changes at this location were covered under warranty. Without apologizing she said that it would be a few moments to get the technician out to pull the filter into my car. She walks away. I then asks this very nice cashier if my children and I could have a seat in the waiting room because of course the young lady who was servicing me did not suggest that I do so before running off. It took about 5 to 10 minutes for the filter to be added. I paid and proceeded to my vehicle. Immediately after attempting to sit in my car, I noticed my seats memory had been modified and when I started my vehicle my gas light was on. The radio had been reprogrammed as well. Even if the battery was disconnected there would not be any programmed seating arrangements, mirror arrangements and/or radio stations. This led me to believe that someone who was much shorter than I was had been driving my vehicle. Lastly, I was supposed to get a new set of rugs at the time of purchase. Not once did I receive a call in reference to this so I mentioned it the day I dropped the vehicle off. The young lady in service said to me that she had given me a complete set because they come in a set of 4. I assumed they were similar mats to what I previously had since she only put one in my car. The set was a totally different mat and instead of her having all four replaced she put one mat in the passenger side. I previously owned a Mercedes before purchasing my Volvo and I never had any issues with reprogramming, my gas being driven out or when anything was replaced and did not match they went ahead and replaced all four. I had to come home and have my husband take the remaining 3 mats out of the trunk to put in himself. Overall, this experience was not the best. Please advise your service center reps to go beyond the basic for customers in the future and to not drive the vehicles like they belong to them when they are dropped off for service. ",2.6

662,"April 11, 2017","I had a 50,000 mile service done and while there I asked the service staff to have a look at a few other things; the digital screen display seemed to be sliding down into the console. The left front panel was not fully seated just behind the headlamp, and from a previous visit the console below the gear shift on the driver's side was not properly reinstalled after a warranty repair.
For the display I was told the housing frame shifted, it was not the digital screen that could be re-centered, so they wanted me to buy a new housing frame. I did not.
The left front panel seems to be properly in place now. Tool marks were left on the panel that indicate it was worked on.
The console below the gearshift knob query was not relayed appropriately from the staff to the service technician, as a result the service tech thought there was a problem with the gear shift knob and advised to buy a new one. The service tech explanation was the knob had a lighting problem which is most certainly does not. I did not purchase a new gearshift knob. So, after I restated my original request to look at and properly seat the console BELOW the gearshift knob it was done.
Additionally the service staff recommended a front brake job, rotors and pads, saying they were worn out of limits. When I asked the staff how much wear was on the pads to see if I needed them that day or could wait a little longer the staff person said she misunderstood the technician and that the pads were fine after all.
All in all, I assume the 50,000 mile service was completed without any problems, the car is running fine since the service, but I went in expecting to receive and pay for the service and have a couple of minor issues corrected that occurred during my previous visit to this service center. I was disappointed at the additional $1000 I was inappropriately (in my view) ""advised"" to spend for unnecessary parts and who knows how much more in labor. When I brought up my concern to the staff person I could sense a change in her demeanor.
I will not take my car back for service at this location, I don't think they have my best interest in mind. I will go to Georgetown, TX where I purchased this car and have always had great service.",2.6

666,"April 10, 2017","Where to begin?! My vehicle had maintenance issues that required tow service and I remembered my vehicle was under warranty so I called the 1-800 number and picked up my car within an hour at my work. I'm really skeptical about warranties and I was expecting excuses as to why I wasn't under warranty but the opposite actually happened. They covered most of my repairs and maintenance, changed my oil, washed my car and had it delivered to my home. I'm happy to say my vehicle is running like new. I'm writing this review because previous to this experience I had a very bad experience where I felt cheated and taken advantage of by the service department. Ever since the change in ownership I've noticed a positive change and ""I like it!""

We added air to the tire but with in 20 miles it was low again. We turned back and returned to our home. We contacted Philip Carroll, Volvo of San Antonio service manager and asked that he return our call. When we got home, after several inflation stops, I took the tire off the car and found a nail. I plugged the hole. Next morning we left for San Antonio bright and early. Philip called us soon after getting into work and asked us to bring the car in to have the tire checked. It turned out that the puncture was to close to the edge of the tire for it to be fixed properly and the technician' s assessment indicated that the tire had to be replaced. A new tire was available in town but would not be at the store until the next day. Philip made all the arrangements, our car was fixed with minimal inconvenience and the situation was successfully resolved.

The problem with the service is that on more than one occasion very soon after having the recommended service maintenance completed, something mysteriously goes wrong with the vehicle that requires additional (and usually) expensive work.  When questioning the service advisor this last time the response received was that working under the hood while completing maintenance will sometimes cause other things to subsequently happen that require additional work.  I understand that sometimes parts do need to be replaced - it's simply the timing that has me baffled.  Additionally, having the same service advisor (as I did for 15 years) really helps in establishing a strong relationship and building trust factor.  Over the last 3 years, it's been whomever is available and I, unfortunately, feel that the trust is gone.  After owning Volvo's for 18 1/2 years I think it may be time to consider another make. ",1.0

The added cost of changing oil and basic service is irrelevant compared to the added value obtained.

Because we could not take emergency brake off or take the vehicle's transmission out of parking and disconnect the charge cable the tow truck driver suggested jump starting it. I told him that I tried before and was not able. He assured me that with the jump start equipment he had we would succeed and we did after about 10 minutes trying to figure out things. Right after I called the roadside asst. I called Kevin in the service department and he made sure that a loaner was available and ready for me. After we started the vehicle I decided to take it to the dealer to make sure nothing was wrong. There were a couple of gentlemen waiting for me after the service dept and dealership had closed who tokk my vehicle and secured it and provided me with the loaner that Kevin Nichols had arranged for me and I was on my way home after signing a couple of papers. This is what I call real customer service and assistance going out of their way. I have never had this kind of service before in my entire life and I can tell you that I have had many different new vehicles to backup what I'm saying. Almos forgot to thank my salesman Ray Aguilar who guided me in the right direction.",5.0

When presented with the bill it was $60 higher (+30%) than the agreed work.  When called on it, they corrected the ""mistake"".  I expected a higher level of accuracy and integrity.

Have had good service from them in the past - so we will return.  Hopefully this was just a one-off bad experience.  ",3.6

It was found that the satellite radio was taking power when the car was not being used and could be be fixed by reprogramming the software.  This was performed and my granddaughter and I drove away with a sparkling clean car which worked perfectly.

810,"January 11, 2017","Around Thanksgiving I took my car in for its 40K maintenance.  It was the first one I had to pay for and it was about $500.  Around Christmas, my rear brakes started making a grinding sound.  i took the car in and was told that the brake pads and rotors would need to be replaced to the tune of ~$600.  Oh, and, there was a puncture in my tire, did my indicator go off?  They can fix it for $50.
I asked why the brake pad issue was not caught at the 40K maintenance and was put on hold.  An embarrassed sales rep told me that the maintenance technician did not complete all the work and they were sorry and would not charge me for labor.  Also, it turned out that the tire was not actually punctured, they pulled a very short screw out of my tire.
Up until now i had loved the service depart.  A few bumps, but mostly polite, great service.  This one has me wondering if I will ever go back.  I have to wonder if they had done the expensive 40K maintenance correctly, would I have paid for new rotors now?  Also, $50 is a ludicrous amount to charge for a tire patch.  I can get it done for free at Discount Tire, but I had my kids with me at pick up and did I want to risk being on the side of a road with a flat?  Why didn't they pull the screw out before telling me my tire was punctured and making me wonder if my low tire pressure indicator was broken.
I don't know if I will return.  ",3.2

I took the car home and the same two engine lights came on and the car rumbled again as if it wanted to turn off. They recommended that the ""carbon build-up"" in the motor be cleaned for $289 to see if that was the problem. I did not feel comfortable with the performance of the service team so I took it to a different automotive repair place. They examined the car after we informed them of the recommendations from the Volvo service center. They stated there was not enough carbon build-up to warrant a cleaning which would have cost us $180 by them. $100 later they ended up cleaning the master sensor switch (which a neighbor and friend had initially thought it might be and did not understand why the service center had not checked that in the first place) and since then the car has run smoothly. I don't know if it was ignorance or incompetence by the Volvo mechanics or if they were attempting to charge for work which was unnecessary.

The last time I took it in for some minor repairs, one issue was left unrepaired which caused me to have to go back for it to be completed. This time was the 40,000 mile service. When I took my car in,  it ran perfectly. When I picked it up, the engine had a different and additional sound, and the right rear tire felt like it was unbalanced and made a hum on the road. Sure enough, after a 10 Hour  road trip for the holidays (2 days after the service), I arrived at my destination, and the tire was flat the next day.  The affected tire was so badly damaged, it had to be replaced. Since the car is all-wheel-drive, I had to replace the other three tires also. I was stuck with a bill for over $600 while visiting family. My patience has run out with this dealership.

989,"September 12, 2016","I was at the time for my annual warranty check and oil change. I was looking for a good day but had not decided yet. I was on my way to work for my 3:00PM shift on a Friday afternoon, cruising down 410 Loop when my low tire warning came on. I thought no problem, when I get home I would check my tire.I was in the inside lane. Next thing I heard about a mile later was a blowout of my back rear tire! I had 2 miles to the next exit, and pulled on over to the outside lane but did not want to stop on the freeway shoulder with a bad tire. I took the exit and pulled into a strip shopping center. I changed my rear tire and placed the spacer tire in place. I noted a ""no more than 50mph"" warning sticker. That would hinder me getting home since I am highway nearly all the way home. I called the dealership on my way to work, and spoke to Kelli in Service. She listened to my woes and agreed to provide me a service car to use while my car was in shop. She got my information, I sent a picture of license & insurance texted to phone. She set u an employee to bring the service car to my work location, and pick up my car needing new tire and warranty work. The employee arrived in Kelli's estimated time and we traded cars. Kelli told me Mr. Breitler would be handling my service on the weekend and would call me. He called about an hour later to tell me the cost of a new tire and get approval. Next morning, Saturday, Mr. Breitler called to tell me my car was ready, and although he called at 9:00AM, I could pick my car up anytime till 3:00PM at my convenience. I arrived at the dealership at 11:30AM, was greeted cheerfully. Mr. Breitler shook hands, showed me the work done on my car, walked me over to the cashier. I paid for my tire, oil change and warranty was no charge,keys were in my hand and I was ready to return home in my washed and cleaned car. After I returned home, I noticed the replace the space-saver tire, jack & tools back in the bag in my trunk.
I feel like I was a very important client to be treated with such specialized attention and care, especially when I have only seen them once a year for annual warranty work twice before. Kelli was so polite and helpful, finding a service car while I was still on the phone in just 1 minute, and setting up an employee to meet me at my work. I have never received such polite service and helpful response with any other car my wife, kids or myself have ever had, especially on a Friday afternoon at 3:00PM!

1001,"September 06, 2016","I emailed several San Antonio car dealers looking for a used car with comfort. less than 100,000 miles and a 60 month loan for less than $200 and no money down. Cadillac Devilles, Lincoln Town cars and Mercury Grand Marques seemed to meet my requirements. Principle had the Cadlillac. David Mora responded that day that that car had been sold the day before. Would I be interested in a 2007 Volvo S60? My last Volvo was a new 144S purchased for $12,000 in 1972. I really enjoyed that car for several years but the purchase price for a another new Volvo grew faster than my wallet. 

Before I saw the 2007, David sensed the price pressure point and teamed with Stephen Arters to craft a loan with Wells Fargo which required no down payment, $200 monthly for 48 months at a  competitive interest rate. I test drove the car the next morning and we closed the sale. A mountain of paperwork climbed, the car was prepped with services at the 100,000 mile mark even though the car had 97,000. A very nice gesture by David and Principle. I had a loaner for the day of servicing and David helped me install the Magellan GPS. The chocolate cookies were a nice finshing touch.

My 200+ mile drive from Rockport to San Antonio for professional Volvo service has always been worth the effort.  

During my four hour wait, I did not have the privilege of getting to meet any of the senior service staff; however, I was fortunate enough to have Ms. Kaley Adams, an Assistant Service Manager, as my contact person.  Ms. Adams, was not only knowledgeable and proficient; but was polite, well dressed and communicative.   Kaley not only kept me informed, but went to great lengths to insure that the needs of my Volvo was being met.  Thank you, Kaley.

1138,"July 01, 2016","My 2007 XC90 was purchased by the original owner from this dealership, so in order to maintain continuity I decided to keep having it serviced here despite the outrageous prices. That however all changed yesterday, I made an appointment online which was a pretty simple process, when I arrived at the dealership I was quoted ""Around $118"" by the female service advisor for the oil change - I know how much 5 quarts of full synthetic cost but I went with it anyway, she then passed me off to Jim B. (who I believe is the Assistant Service Manager) who looks at my paperwork and says ""Well based on the mileage you're overdue for the '82,000 mile Service'"" -- I inquired as to what additional services are rendered beyond the oil change... Jim stated that in addition to the oil change they ""do a multipoint inspection, rotate tires and complete an onboard diagnostic check for trouble codes."" I asked Jim how much this ""82,000 Service"" was and he flipped through his laminated sheets and said ""$379.00"" - so let's break that down, $379 - $118 = $261!! $261 to rotate my tires, rapidly look over the vehicle during the ""multipoint inspection"" and plug an OBDII reader into the port to ""look for trouble codes""?? What a bunch of crap! I have spent over $5,000 at this place since purchasing my XC90 since it is the only service center in San Antonio, and if you are not in a business suit and arrive in the a 2016 fully loaded XC90 every one of these employees looks at you like you are wasting their time, three additional customers (dressed nicer than myself since I was coming from the gym) were offered coffee and water while they waited and I had to ASK the cashier to ring me up because she was too busy to even acknowledge my presence. So despite the absurd pricing and rude customer service every time I've been here I was also blessed with an incompetent technician who almost completed my oil change yesterday. After paying and departing the dealership, with about 30 minutes before I was supposed to be at work, I got 1.7 miles away when I notice the ""Low Oil"" light illuminate on the dash! I immediately exited the highway and returned to the dealership. After explaining what happened Jim and a tech came outside to look at the truck and tell me ""There's no lights on"" -- which was correct, luckily I was able to capture the warning with my iPhone and prove to them that something was not correct. They then pull my truck back into the bay at which point I explained I was going to be late to work, they were able to get me a loaner vehicle quickly and I was on my way. I received a voicemail from Jim several hours later in which he apologized for the mistake but explained that the technician only put enough oil for the V6 model and they added an additional quart as required for my vehicle's V8. So in summary, I will not be returning to the overpriced, commission based service advisor's, incapable of doing a proper oil change and rude employee having ""Authorized Volvo Service Center"" -- Principle Auto Group needs to take a hard look at what they could do to ensure these things are corrected or they will be losing more customers. Oh wait! No they won't, there's no other options in San Antonio.......",1.4

They had a great selection of autos to look at and they were all clean and we recieved a Carfax report on the cars we looked at. Just can't say enough about how well we were treated. I would recommend these folks to anyone wanting an auto. Go see my friends at Volvo of San Antonio. ,5.0
1141,"June 30, 2016",Service agents at the dealer are always courteous and efficient. They handle claims with service and warranty plans and explain what your car needs. I feel at ease knowing they are handling my car service needs. ,5.0
1142,"June 30, 2016","Thank you to Joel Lozano, for the excellent service and attention that went into making the purchase of my ""new to me"" 2010 xc90 as smoothe as possible. 
  When making a large and important purchase, it takes a village to get things done right. It takes time to build rapport with the numerous people involved in such a purchase, and this can be exhausting.  This is why I am pleased that after finding an excellent pre-owned vehicle through Principle Volvo and agreeing to purchase it, sight unseen - Joel Lozano, Peter Shalk, and the amazing team at Principle Volvo, have taken necessary measures to make sure that I am happy and confident in my purchase. I am currently using a loaned vehicle from Volvo as my 2010 xc90 is receiving the attention it requires to get into ""Principle Auto"" condition. 

I am so grateful; more than an excellent pre-owned family vehicle, I have confidence in folks at Principle Volvo for servicing my vehicle and I would enthusiastically refer  family and friends to Principle Volvo San Antonio.

Originally hesitant as I did not relish having to fight for a good price along with any of the usual drama I have come to know and dread.

They allowed me to used their offices as my own as I had arranged for my own financing and they even faxed off copies of documents for me. Daniel Garza and Fred Villarreal were great to deal with and made the process very painless. No additional sales pushes, or hidden fees, just a straight honest business deal.  ",4.8

David worked with us until we found exactly what fit us!  Thru this entire process, Mr. Mora was always patient, respectful and a very NICE person to deal with.  He NEVER was pushy thru this entire process.

We can't say the same about the sales person at Roger Beasley in Austin, Linda Lilley.  Linda was more worried about her commission than anything else.  She never offered for us to test drive the vehicle.  She never offered us anything to drink like water, coffee, etc.  She SOLD the vehicle that we had put a Down Payment on.  She was NOT personable at ALL!  ",5.0
1389,"February 23, 2016","Kudos to Volvo of San Antonio, Service Department.

Last Friday, I visited for routine maintenance on my 2016 Volvo XC 90.  Needed to reset the Maintenance Due sensor, as it was incorrectly requesting Maintenance at less than 6000 miles(due every 10000 miles).
Worked with Kevin(Service Advisor) who recorded all of the issues that I was experiencing, and provided a loaner of an 2016 XC 90, to accommodate me while the vehicle was in for the Service.  I was extremely pleased by the courtesies extended to me by Kevin, and the staff of this Service Department.  The staff there is always friendly, and go out of their way to greet me, and make me feel comfortable .  I have worked with Steve(Service Advisor)  before, and he is always available to answer and resolve any issues that may present itself.  Mr Anthony Beraga, Service Manager, never fails to seek me out whenever I am in the Department, to answer any issues that needs resolving.  Issac, The Technology Genius (Yes!, this is a real title), was very helpful, in explaining the Apple Car Play, how it is activated, and its various functions.  There were a few scratches that appeared on the Sensus screen, that I was uncomfortable with, and he was able to provide a screen saver, free of charge, and installed it as well.  Now the scratches are no longer visible, and the touch appears to be more sensitive as well.  

All in all, I am satisfied with the Service provided by the Volvo of San Antonio, Service department, and the quality of work  provided by the Staff there.  Looking forward to many happy years of Service.",5.0
1390,"February 22, 2016","Every adviser is very thoughtful and attentive.  Steve and Jim have always been very professional and easy to work with.  
However, I am skeptical about the service technicians who perform the work.
I had my car in 3 times several months ago because my low battery light kept coming on. 
This month I will take my car in twice to fix the auto lock and unlock door handles. It worked one day. All door handles were replaced.
I was given a quote for new tires that was outrageous! Was able to get better tire for much better price with complementary tire rotations for life of tire. I have to pay $50 to Volvo before.
When I bought the car in 2012 the finance person recommended tire protection because the car had run-flat tires. Funny- the technician and service guy said I didn't have that kind of tire. So now I will have to fight with you to get that tire protection refunded- what a fraud!",3.2

1395,"February 17, 2016",I took time out of my busy schedule to have a couple of things addressed with my car. Unfortunately the main reason I took my car in was because the AM radio has very poor reception (a lot of static.) It was reported to me that they did not find any issues with it! I informed them it is an issue and asked they review it again. Second time I was told the same thing (no issues found). As soon as I drove away from the dealership the static began! And continues as I drive throughout the city. My opinion is that as a customer I am not making this up. It is a very expensive car to have such a poor AM radio connection; I do not feel like this was handled very professionally.  I have owned many cars including other Volvo's and have never had this kind of issue with the AM radio. Most unhappy!,2.5
1396,"February 17, 2016","I took in my Volvo on 2/16 due to a faulty no start and unusual noise. After being greeted I was told that the diagnostic test would be done to assess and figure out the problem. After two hours I was told that the noise was coming from the compressor and may or may not be the cause of the problem. I was told that the tech would need more time to assess and I would have to pay again for another diagnostic test. The rep then showed me a list of other non related repairs to my car, maybe if the tech had focused on the no start issue primarily instead of looking at things like suspension and non related repairs maybe the tech could of found the root of the problem. I am very displeased with service I received and will not be going there again since the service team seemed to be concerned about fixing other non related repairs that I was already aware of just to charge me more.

The quoted price was far more than I was willing to pay so I purchased tires elsewhere. The ""road noise"" has not stopped.

1433,"January 29, 2016","My 2016 XC60 required the right rear window trim to be replaced as it was not laying flush with the rear fender body panel. What both the service advisor and I thought to be a simple matter was quite the opposite. The window required removal to access the seal and trim attachment clips and there was an issue over the correct part numbers - even Volvo Sweden was contacted. Once this issue was solved, Alamo Auto Glass nicked the surrounding paint while installing the window which required further delay and repair. To the service advisors' credit, he was not satisfied with the initial paint repair and sent it back to be corrected. I received my vehicle back after 15 days which was acceptable as long as the repairs/paint were satisfactory. During this time I was driving the dealerships' courtesy loaner car.

The positives |
The renovated dealership is beautiful and comfortable.  Everyone is dressed well and friendly.  On first impression, it feels like a great place to buy a car.  Before driving down from Austin, I did over a month’s worth of research on cars in the same class as the Volvo XC60 as well as studied pricing on all XC60 models available within a 100-mile radius.  Volvo of San Antonio consistently had the fairest pricing.  After finding close to exactly the model I wanted and a virtually painless negotiation on the price of the car and the trade-in value of my old Audi, I was feeling better than I ever have in a dealership … and then the fun started.

The negatives | 
Financing -- On a pretty quiet, rainy Saturday, I waited an hour to see the Finance Manager.  No explanation for the delay was given (it felt like a psychological ploy).  I was then presented with a FICO score 50 points lower than the score I looked up 48 hours earlier.  I was at a loss for what my options were, so I did nothing (my fault for not preparing for this scenario).  My low reported score continued to bug me long after I closed financing on my car and that night I paid $40+ in fees to get more scores.  Two of the three scores were 50 and 60 points higher than the score used by the Finance Manager and they were up-to-date; including the loan I had closed that day in the calculation.  Volvo of San Antonio used the lowest of the three scores available.  I don’t know if this is standard industry practice, but I will be refinancing shortly.

Dent and paint -- Purchasing a 2013 model, I expected there to be some minor dents and scratches.  The salesperson assured me that all dents would be removed and all scratches would be touched-up.  A week later (more on this to follow) when I came to pick up my car, the dents had been removed, but the scratches were still there. There was an acknowledgement and an apology, but their solution was to hand me a paint pen kit to do the touch-up myself.  Never having done this before (and the way it was presented by the salesperson) I assumed this was easy.  I came home and did some online research.  Turns out it is time-consuming, challenging to get right and the paint is highly toxic. 

Detailing -- The cleaning of the car was atrocious.  Again, this was a used car and it had been “loved” by the family that had owned it.  The car was filthy.  There was dirt or food in just about every crevice of the car.  I was assured by my salesperson that the car would be delivered, “like new”.  When I inspected it at pick-up, there was still dirt and or food in every crevice of the car.  There was less of it than before the detailing, but it was still there.  When I pointed this out to my salesperson, he said, “I know … our detailing guys are not good”.   He sent it back to detailing.  I expected to wait an hour+ for the job to be done correctly, but miraculously, my car was back in 10 minutes.  The detailers had simply cleaned the sticky stuff out of the front cup holder and were done.  I gave a sigh of frustration and made a mental note that I would be spending $200 to have the car detailed in Austin.  

Delivery -- My home, in Austin, is an hour from the dealership.  Before I left the dealership in the loaner car (I should add, it was a very nice, new S60) I made a point of stressing that I was an hour away.  I respectfully asked that the dealership call or email me in advance on the progress of having my car ready for pick up so I could plan my work week.  I was assured that they would do that and that the latest my car would be ready was Wednesday.  Mentally, I planned to pick up the car either Thursday or Friday morning and intentionally cleared my work schedule to make that easier.  No one from the dealership proactively contacted me that week.  I had to initiate all communication.  And the flawed body work and detailing (+ the programming of a missing second key) took five days, not two-to-three to complete.  The explanation given was that my salesperson was on vacation. It was only a minor irritant to be in a loaner car for a week and to have cleared my schedule for no good reason.  It was a major irritant to have the sinking feeling that because someone was on vacation that the whole process had broken down.

I have intentionally withheld the names of the people who worked with me at Volvo of San Antonio.  While they could be significantly better at what they do, they could not have been nicer.  I don’t blame them.  I blame the senior leadership that instructs, evaluates and rewards them for customer service that is mostly flash with little substance.

We had specifically said what was wrong before the appt was set. So we come back a few days later and they were so nice, they offered me a rental so I wouldn't be stuck there with all the kids and made sure we had snacks and drinks. The people are excellent! So we set up shop to wait (we didn't take the rental-didn't want to move car seats) and the kids iPad stations don't work. Neither will turn on. We ask for help, again very nice, they go get someone who says she's getting the key. 2 hours later- they never work. Never heard back on it.

1475,"January 12, 2016","I started with buying used 2011 Volvo C 70. Wow what a car. I was told it was a dealers car. This was 2012 when I purchased car. A year passed the car still running great. As a few months pass by I noticed some of the paint was getting dull and flaky on p/side and rear bumper doing same.  I called Geico to renew policy. They asked me if I was the first owner I told them yes it was a dealer demo.  I asked them why they asked question. They asked me if I knew car was involved in accident in Detroit and it was owned by Enterprise. My heart jumped out of my chest. I was pissed off. I called Victor the one who sold me the car. They said he was fired. I asked to talk to a manager to complain about situation.  They put me thru to Ray Aguilar.  I told him I was very upset. I told him Victor screwed me up. And I wanted them to get me another Better C70. When I got there from Alice Texas.  They had an awesome 2013 C70 under 20 miles.  I wanted a better deal for the inconvenience. I talked and pleaded with Rays boss. He did not give me a better discount I wanted I was tired I gave up and took the 2013 C70.

I lost my 120,000 yr. job due to oilfield layoffs in March of 2015.  I came to reality that I needed help. I took my 2013 Volvo in for a service on Jan 8, 2016. I did not trust any salesman. I zeroed in on Ben Yancelson.  I told him the story I'm telling you. I told Ben I felt embarrassed I would have had my 2011 Volvo close to being paid off. But now I need to get rid of 2013 Volvo due to my new 40000 dollar income. He told me Volvo changed new management. I was able to talk to his boss about situation. Even though I didn't get everything I wanted. I felt Benjamin was the best salesman I ever dealt with. I was able to make a great deal on a Kia Soul. Working with Ben made my wife and my experience very helpful. With the deal I came out with I will get my credit back in order.  I would recommend Ben and the new management at Principle Volvo. Ben deserves a great 100% approval.

I had some throttle (ETM) problems and the S70 went into a ""safe mode"" due to faulty electronics (used code reader). After cleaning the Throttle Module with no success, I knew the part was dead.  I usually take it to an independent Volvo mechanic but knew the dealer would be the only place that could download and install required software for the new part. I called the service department and asked if they would diagnosis and if new part was necessary could I bring in my own part ($270 savings buying online) and have it installed (less dealer guarantee).  The service department was accommodating and 3-days later after diagnosing, the S70 was back on the road. Jim in service kept me updated at least twice a day to provide a status.

Well, gas is cheap these days, they got the cheaper WeatherTech mats, not the ""liners"" I had wanted, the chip was obviously not filled and Miguel was insistent that it had been filled, and they cleaned just the one heavily soiled area I had pointed out on the interior, not a detail.

From the time that I entered the service area, I was greeted by someone within 1 minute, who asked how they could help me.  I described my issues, they listened, asked appropriate diagnostic questions, listened to my responses, and indicated that we need to seek further guidance. I was introduced to a service Tech who followed the same listening and response process.  The Tech indicated the need to check the issue on the computer and introduced me to Richard, one of the Service staff members.  Richard took my information, he car was taken to service, and we were offered a ride to the closest restaurant while the issues was diagnosed.  We were returned to the dealership and told a part was required to fix the car.  The part was ordered and appointment set to have the part installed.  We returned to the dealership for the repair, which took about one hour, as stated at the time we made the appointment.  This dealership knows and understands customer service and the specific need to manage customer expectations.  Richard did a fantastic job providing us with relevant facts concerning the repair, the ordering of the part, coverage by Volvo, time for the repair, and concern for our overall satisfaction.

1570,"August 18, 2015","No stars on this review.  My wife and kids have been driving Volvos for the past twenty plus years. The wife likes her Volvo and has been commuting to work for the past forty years in the worst traffic zones in the country.... Seattle/Chicago/Denver and San Antonio as a service trainer/manager for a couple of major companies. For the past month she has been complaining of an increasing noise coming from the back end. Checking I found the inside corners of both back tires worn to almost the cords which means the camber/toe alignments were out of wack. Called Volvo to set up an appointment for an alignment and was told by a service writer that I could bring it in and it would take about an hour. Showed up the next morning and the service writer noted the wear on the back tires and I was told I would have to buy new tires before they could preform the alignment. And that in itself is a complete crock of bull. I told them to take the front tires which had an even wear pattern and put them on the back for their alignment which they did. In their alignment they found the rear wheels toed way out and hopefully they corrected that. Unfortunately, myself, 3rd and 4th parties found the lug nuts completely trashed. Checking the torque values on those lug nuts with my old (snap-on) torque wrench that only goes to 150 ft/lbs I found the torques to exceed way over 150 ft/lbs. It took a two ft breaker bar and three ft cheater to get those lug nuts off. Aside of any safety issues involved there is a 99% chance those brake rotors are warped which ruins pads also. Cost to replace all that may constitute a felony.....",1.0

I made it very clear this was a preliminary visit as I had other financing options available. They took my keys to inspect the car and we started going over facts, figures, credit, etc. I thanked my representative for his help. I then asked for my keys and prepared to leave. The next thing I knew, the finance manager (I assume that's who he was) appears to tell me they have paid off the lease and were grounding my car until I financed the car through them. They refused to return the keys and did not allow me to leave with my car until I signed their deal. It was especially troubling to me to be bullied that way as I am a 72 year old widow and was there alone. I should have gone in there with a lawyer and a linebacker!

They dress like sales people, which is not common for the service area unless you're servicing higher end vehicles.  And if you are going to staff half of your service dept. with ladies that are dressed up like models, at least make sure they know what they are talking about when I want to discuss the mechanical workings of my Volvo!

I hope the new Principal Volvo has enough sense to realize that a fresh remodel of the building and eye candy employees are not going to win the sensible minds of the average Volvo owner....maybe the younger S40 owners, but not the ones that hold on to a Volvo for 8-10+yrs...we know where the value is!

Per www.volvocars.com dealers MAY ""perform a preliminary diagnosis and give you a written estimate of what’s needed at no charge and without obligation.""

Clearly, the moral fiber of this dealership is lacking and they do not take the advice and suggestions from the Corporate office. The fact that Principle Volvo has a monopoly on certified Volvo service is alarming in and of itself and that as a Volvo owner you are forced to use them if you need any major service done on your car.  What is also disturbing is Principle Volvo's extreme lack of regard for customer care and satisfaction.

The reception, attentiveness, professionalism and service in Houston was always at its best, bar none, and I was concerned with this upon moving to the San Antonio area. 

When I first walked into this San Antonio dealership to get one of our Volvos serviced, I met Greg B. After chatting for a bit, the vehicle needs were discussed and written-up. 

Greg then took me to the refreshment bar, for a cup of coffee, and from there to introduce me around to the Service Dept manager, the cashier and the dealership GM. 

My vehicle was returned a bit later, washed and dried, the vehicle situation was taken of and off I went.

I was very impressed, have told a number of people about this aspect of the Volvo dealership and remain quite pleased for any servicing our Volvos require.

Several months later, we were in the market for the new 2012 S-60. We were introduced to Greg L, sales, and allow me to tell you, a remarkable experience. 

We knew what we wanted; Joel worked with us (my wife mostly) in mixing and matching the various options she wanted. Easy, smooth, no pressure, most patient and, seamless.

1578,"December 23, 2010","Volvo for life, at least that is what the motto says.  That is until you take your car in for oil changes that vary in price when you take the car in.  One time it was in the $30, the next time in the $40s the next time in the $50 - when we said ""we payed $30 in the past.""  The standard reply is ""the prices are set"" and when we show them what we paid - then  they clear their throat and adjust the ""standard"" price.  

Yes, ladies and gentlemen - the service department is also on commission.  So when you go, be ready to negotiate.  

Last time I took my car there (it will also be the last) the standard XYZ needs to be fixed next.....and yup you guessed it.  Not too long after I took the car home XYZ broke.  So I took it back and paid a ridiculous amount of money to fix it.  Well, only to have something else break after they ""fix"" the car.  

I am not saying that the Volvo service department breaks cars - but I do question what they don't fix or what gets damaged in the process of fixing something.
