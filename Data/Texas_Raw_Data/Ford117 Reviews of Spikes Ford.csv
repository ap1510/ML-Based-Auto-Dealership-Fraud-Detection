41,"February 24, 2020","I have a Ford company car.  In 2017, there was a recall on the door latch possibly coming open in an accident.  I took it in for that and some other minor things.  When I picked the car up, the door latch would open and stay open.  I had to pop it closed in order to shut the door.  I ended up with pinched fingers all the time.  I took it back 2 more times and reported the issue.  It was not taken car of.  On the 4th visit, I was at the Quick Lane as I needed an oil change, new rear windshield wiper, and fix that door once and for all.  After sitting for 3 days waiting for approval from the leasing company, I asked why they hadn't fixed the door.  Their response was ""There is no recall info in our system.""  They then proceed to charge the leasing company over $600 to fix what was essentially a paid recall (when I left with the vehicle, the door latch did exactly what it did before I took it in the 4th time.)  Nothing was fixed.  I found the original receipt and the most recent one.  3 years apart.  The lady in service, instead of keying in my vin number to see when I brought it in, she just starts accusing of ""waiting 3 years to bring it back.""  

I haven't taken it back.  That whole service department is a clusterfrack.  Over 3 hour wait times for an oil change at ""Quick Lane.""  Their too busy trying to charge my leasing company for things I really don't need, so that is what takes up most of the time.    I'm in the process of getting a new Chevy Malibu, so I hope I have better luck with a Chevy dealer.",1.2

By the time i took my f150 out i was working out of state but got my vehicle back in pieces. It literally looked like it had been at a junk yard.  Front lights and fog lights uninstalled and everything in the bed of my truck. Days later when my mechanic went through it we found out they kept my engine block. We called dealership and sure enough, they had it. Once my vehicle got fixed with my mechanic he found out the air compressor was also missing. I called spikes and sure enough they claimed that the mechanic had forgotten to send it in. And then also my magnum battery was missing so the manager offered to send it in the following day in the morning and my mechanic got the missing parts after 5pm.

106,"August 08, 2019","The rating is because of the service that was provided by Michelle on my vehicle.  I appreciate good service and that I received.  I had previously take my truck in for a recall and service.  The recall was done, but the service was not.  That included not doing the Multi check of the vehicle.   I complained, and I received several calls from Michelle until we finally connected.  She asked me to bring my vehicle back to Spike Ford and give her a chance to make things right for me and she did.  The fact that she researched my file and saw that my vehicle had been serviced before for the same issue.  The Throttle Body was replaced at N/C because it was still under warranty.  The whole time my vehicle was there she kept me informed of what was being done by the Tech.  I appreciate her way of dealing with customers and I will certainly have my vehicle serviced there in the future.

108,"June 20, 2017","From start to finish I have received extremely bad service from spikes ford. They promised me they would fix a title issue I was having that I was on the way to get fixed in order to get me to come in. 4 days later they couldn't fix it and just wasted my time. I, like an idiot,  took care of it myself and gave them a second chance to sell me a car and trade in my old one. they made so many mistakes with the finances promising me rates and payments then changing everything because they messed up. When I finally got the truck it had a couple minor issues they promised to repair. Took 3 days to get them to tell me when to bring it in, they said it should take an hour to fix, 5 days later I'm still without a vehicle. Looks like they are only gonna fix half of the stuff they said as well. Who takes 5 days to add some freon???",1.4
109,"December 15, 2016",I took my f150 2013 for low oil pressure warning. So they tell me its ready as soon I drove away message came back on. Worst of all came out with another problem had problems accelerating shuts off and all they said low oil pressure causes the body throttle malfunction. When I took it in there was nothing wrong with the acceleration. Look under neath and seems it has the same switch on. And the extended warranty doesn't cover crap whats the point of motor transmission suspension  for but there real good on charging $. Seriously thinking of Start buying somewhere else.,1.0

111,"January 16, 2015","All the employees are very friendly, and the location is very clean. The sales Rep who sold me my vehicle was amazing. He was not pushy, and it really felt like he tried to get the best deal possible for me. I recommend anybody in the market and buy a new vehicle needs to speak with my Sales Rep first .I am 100% satisfied with my decision on buying a new vehicle at spikes.",5.0
112,"November 06, 2014","i have a 2012 explorer which I purchased here with a leak problem 1st time it took two weeks now it's been over a month same problem not happy with service because of the leak my carpets have been replaced but only where the problem is so the carpet looks different two the smell in the truck is awful and they can't take it off at this rate the only thing that would make me happy is a new truck being that the truck only has 20,000 miles it doesn't get driven often and spends more time in the shop. There is no costumer service it seems like no one knows anything it's always by Friday but Friday's come and go. Just want a good truck not one where after my warranty is up and still have this problem it's ridicules. ",1.2

114,"June 27, 2014","My car's emission's light was on and I was under a time crunch since the next day I had jury duty and my regular mechanic is very busy.  So I took it the dealership.   I was shocked when told that it was going to be almost 400 dollars!!!   The price of the part was only $30 ( They told me that at Auto Zone)  Also I was told the  whole thing would take 3-4 hours.   IT TOOK 7 HOURS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I feel that the price was jacked up - dealerships are notorious for doing this and I was taken advantage of, but due to my NEEDING to get it fixed - I had NO choice.

I will not be taking it back there!!!!",2.8
115,"July 28, 2008","I believe this dealership defrauded me on an extended warrenty.  I bought the warrenty from Reliance Honda, owned at that time by spikes ford.  They claimed a 100% money back guarentee after the warrenty period if not  used  A few  months later they are out of business, sold to somemone else who will not honor such an agreement.  I believe they knew they were leaving this market when they sold me this warrenty.   Mike Potts",1.0
116,"January 03, 2005","The dealership doesn't haggle, but I did take their ""One Low Price"" and checked the price on the Internet. The price was about $100.00 or so less than what most places said the vehicle I bought should sell for after the final deal.Do not go here if you enjoy the challenge of haggling. They won't budge one inch and WILL stick to their guns and let you walk off the lot.",3.8
