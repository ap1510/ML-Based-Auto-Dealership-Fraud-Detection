0,"April 30, 2020","My car basically died during the quarantine at home days so I needed to get a replacement without a lot of face time and hassle. Two friends recommended Hub Hyundai of Katy so I called on the phone. I was so lucky to be connected with Leonard Moore. I told him I was looking for a used small SUV, no more than 2 model years old, low mileage and had a maximum of $20K, all in including TTL. He went out to the lot and called me back the same day saying he had 3 options for me. When I got there, he had (as promised) 3 vehicles (1 Hyundai and 2 Mitsubishi's - the Hub dealerships are side by side and share resources. Mileages ranged from 12K to 37K but The Hyundai Kona had lots of options in addition to having the lowest mileage so we moved forward with that one. The ""all in"" price was under my limit so we struck a deal. Leonard did a great job locating a vehicle I am very happy with and took the time to explain all the features, helped to pre-set warning systems, radio stations, etc. Great guy, knowledgeable about his inventory and vehicle features, and easy to work with...that is a winner in my book.

19,"August 14, 2019","Chris Butcher was amazing to deal with.  I had a unique situation as I had a very strict budget that I needed to adhere to.  Chris, first of all most importantly listened to my situation and what was most important for me.  Chris stayed late on a Friday night (after closing) still working so we could get a deal that was a win-win for everyone.  Chris stayed in touch with me via text (which I very much appreciated given my very busy work schedule) all through the following Saturday.  Finally, on Saturday afternoon after much work on Chris's part, he called and said we were able to find a vehicle that matched my needs and was able to get it in under my budget.  Chris was awesome to deal with and I would not hesitate to buy from him again.

52,"April 22, 2018","I bought a car from this dealership on 4/10/18. It was a preowned car. The salesperson did not informed me about the defects of the car while in the process of buying the car.  I am the one who discovered the scratches on the exterior of the car. I informed the salesperson about the scratches. He said if I will purchase the car his boss the Sales Manager will take care of it. The salesperson advised to bring back the car on Friday and they will buff and touch up the scratches.I agreed on their promises and purchased the car on the same day. Next morning when I’m driving the car. I’ve seen damages on the headliner and stains on the interior. It has safety issues as well on brakes and when accelerating. Im not happy with the car and returned it on 4/14 in the same condition I got the car. The salesperson yelled at me telling me I cannot return the car. i did not like confrontations so I leave  the dealership. I came back on 4/16 to turned over the key to the Sales Manager. He is accusing me that I damaged the car. Then he threatened me if I did not sign the paper containing “I made damages on the car” he will file a repossession on my credit, he will force the car key to take it back to me and the contract will remains on my name, If I sign the paper in return he will void the contract, paid the bank and report on my credit that the car is paid off and my name will be cleared on any liabilities and thier will be no repossession on my credit. The salesperson and the Sales Manager pressured me to sign the paper. I feel that I am trapped on the situation and no choice but to  sign it. I signed that paper under duress. He also took my entire downpayment of $1600. He promised after I signed the paper he will “buy back the contract” I don’t know what it means and send the check to the financer to buy the car by them. He also said I am not liable to the car anymore and it will  help to build my credit because it will show paid off on my credit report. Today  4/20 he said he send the check to the bank to pay the car off. I believe he have a dark plan and I am afraid of what will happened next. I also called the car financier and they said my paperworks are not processed yet and they void the contract as return. These people lied from the beginning and I believe they are a fraud.  I need help to resolved this issue and advice before they do anything that will damage my credit and squander all my savings. I am already broke because I bought another car to  a dealership in order to use it for going to work daily. I have photos, evidence and 2 witnesses to prove that i did not made the damages on the car. ",1.2

54,"March 08, 2018","My daughter's Hyundai 2011 Tucson's gear was not engaging when she was going forward and tried to back up - and vice versa. She did not see this as a problem, she just stuck something in the little hole by the gears and eventually it would do as she wanted. I saw it as dangerous. I called Hub Hyundai of Katy about the recall. There was ease of appointment time and Daniel took care of the problem. I thought there would be a big charge to fix this as it did not seem to be what the recall was for. Daniel called and said the recall will fix the gear problem. It has worked wonderfully today. There was no charge at Hub Hyundai and they even washed the Tucson!! I have already told several people about this wonderful dealership and Daniel.

I just want to let you know, I am very disappointed in your dealership with your customer experience delivery. I will bullet point each item:      I had to have the sales person email me the dealer addons because the pricing did not add up on my invoice     Once I reviewed the dealer addon paperwork, I found I had paid for pin stripping that had not been installed not on my car     I also have paid for window etching but have not received the documentation on this service     My car does not an inspection sticker. I was pull over by the police but luckily I did not receive a citation     I have not received my $30 for taking a test drive. I gave the paperwork to George Sanchez but no followup has occurred     The assistant Sales Manager also promise me a oil change. I have not received any follow up on this promise     One of my tail pipes sticks out about 2 inches further than the other one does. I feel this should have been caught before the car was delivered  I did call Sales Person about the pin stripping and I have an appointment on May 24th at 10am for the install of the pin stripping.  My job is a service manager for healthcare equipment manufacturer in hospitals. I know how important honest customer feedback is. Most feedback these days have been tainted by the sales asking for a good rating.  I wanted to let you know about my poor customer experience.

Chris was a very pleasant individual to deal with - very amiable as well as knowledgeable!  He made sure we were introduced to all areas of the dealership.
Unfortunately, when I had to return with the new car a few days later, Chris was unable to meet with me due to a family emergency.  He made arrangements to have other staff assist with window tinting and finding and installing wheel locks, as well as answering some general questions I still had about operating the vehicle.

At 11:15am I entered the building to ask if my car was done and why it had been sitting for 10 minutes at the car wash. The porter quickly moved and apologized and said he would run it through real quick. I apologized and said I wasn't trying to rush him and that I just wanted to know what was going on and thanked him.
At 11:20am the porter parked my car and returned to the office. I held the door open for him and thanked him again. He gave my key and paperwork to one of the service writers.
At 11:21am the cashier asked the service writer for my paperwork. He said he was working on it.
At 11:40am the service writer brings my paperwork to the cashier.
At 11:42am I pass the porter who apologizes for the long wait and then I arrive at my vehicle to find it boxed in by another vehicle. The porter sprang into action to help.

203,"April 15, 2017","I pretty much knew what I was looking for. This was my second purchase from HUB actually. The first was from their sister dealer Subaru. I had seen tv commercials for the Tucson and felt it was the vehicle for me. I was only looking for information on leasing but my salesman Marquixx and I hit it off right away. I told him about myself and my history with vehicles. He instinctively knew where to guide me and took me almost immediately to my absolutely favorite color - burnt orange/pumpkin 2017 Tucson. He was super patient and I test drove it, an Elantra and even a brand new hybrid, name I've forgotten. We looked at colors and packages of the different cars, sat in a Sonata which I opted not to test drive. When I didn't like the numbers, the sales manager came over. When they still weren't what I wanted, the COO/GM, Mark Odat came over. Marquis told him what I was looking for and he came back with the price I wanted for my lease. So, next thing I knew, I was in with Octavio in Finance closing the lease deal on my new vehicle. Octavio was very thorough explaining the options for extras and going through the paperwork - I read everything and ask a lot of questions. I came back a week later to ask Marquixx about the Bluetooth and I was greeted like an old friend. And very surprised that Mark knew exactly who I was. I look forward to continuing my relationship with Hub Hyundai West.",4.8

I also let him know that if the price is right, then I am ready to buy today. The salesperson showed me various models with various features, and even showed me other vehicle makes, but it didn't take long for me to decide which car I wanted. I spent the entire afternoon at Hub Hyundai ironing out the financial details. We all eventually reached an agreement, and I left in the new car that I wanted that day! I am very thankful for the amazing service, time, and effort to meet my needs. There was a small dent on the fender, which I hope they didn't notice while detailing the car and just hoped I wouldn't notice... but they were able to get that taken care of for me within the first week of ownership. I never had much of an opinion or interest in Hyundai prior to this visit, but this team has now gained a loyal Hyundai customer.",5.0

To begin with  the finance department ran my credit without my signature or permission, I came with my own bank financing and expressed this from the beginning of my transaction. When I explained this I was basically given an ""Oops"".
Next, The vehicle was not thoroughly checked out prior to selling it to me. On the day of purchase, 15 minutes after I left the lot several lights came on in the instrument cluster including the check engine light. The car was returned for repairs and stayed in the shop for greater than 1 week. Invalid plates that did not belong to my vehicle  (Not even the same make or model) were attached to the vehicle by someone at the dealership on 3/16. The vehicle was also sold to me without a clear Title and took 5 months to get plates. The only thing I've been offered for numerous trips to the dealership and inconvenience was 1 single tank of gas, which I had to drive 30 miles to get. I have purchased many cars and this was the worst car buying experience.I am beyond dissatisfied with the entire experience with HUB Hyundai West-Katy.",1.4

One day I used Hub out of convenience, and my service rep, Nate, totally turned me around to trust this dealership. He was sharp, friendly and knew his stuff. I had also dealt with Avi, the sales manager, a few times on my service visits to Hub, so it just felt natural when it came time to trade in my Veloster for something safer, bigger and higher. On the day I leased my Tucson, I had no idea I would be doing it that day. The sales rep assigned to me, Travis, was so easy to work with. No pressure, no nonsense, and he allowed the vehicle to sell itself, which is honestly the only way to deal with me.

We promptly took a test ride. My wife and I both quickly fail in love with the Veloster. The car’s road experience and features were outstanding. During this time, Travis explained the various features and made reference to the Quick Guide and the manuals.

Closing the deal was just a matter of Travis making us a deal we could not refuse. The car was made ready, the brief financial discussion was held, and we were on our way home with our new Veloster. We continue to very much enjoy the Veloster experience.

In fact I was usually directed to Hyundai's service garage after the other side, Mitsubishi, didn't answer. Explanation, only one person in service at Mitsubishi.

I had them change my oil. 3,000 miles later and after many unanswered calls to schedule my next oil change I called the dealer in Cypress, Texas and scheduled my oil change in one call. And for the next morning. Great service there. The only issue was the mechanic told me my oil pan and plug were stripped. He recommended I take it back to the Katy HUB dealer but I couldn't get an answer. Gordon, the service manager at Katy was called several times but never called me back. In the end I paid $400 for a new pan, plus my oil change. The Cypress dealer was wonderful. I wouldn't give a ""plug"" nickel for the HUB dealer in Katy.

I had compared several vehicles online and knew what I was looking for in a car. When we arrived at Hub Hyundai we were greeted by Corey Weisenstein, he asked us several questions about what we were interested in and knew right away which car to show us.

429,"September 14, 2015","The finance individual made an error in calculation of the lease payment. The person involved called (after about 2 weeks of vehicle delivery) and wanted me to come in right away to re-sign all the paper work - insisting that this needs to be done right away (same day).  He was unwilling to give out the new payment over the phone, and lied that the new payment is going to be substantially lower than the current one (falsely implying that he has been able to get me a better deal). Upon asking 4 times he confessed that the new payment is only $1.40 lower.  This attitude is utterly non-professional and completely dishonest. It shows complete disregard for customer's concerns and time. I am a loyal Hyundai customer and love the brand.  I replaced my old genesis with a new one and if all goes well will probably do so again after three years. However I am not going to go back to this dealership, nor am I going to recommend this to anyone.  Regardless of whatever deal they can offer.

430,"September 12, 2015","When we started our new car search, we compared quite a few cars in the compact car segment and zeroed in on Civic, Elantra and Mazda 3.  Little did we know that handling a dealership is a monstrous experience on its own.  Irrespective of the make, every car salesman we came across was either nonchalant or pushy until we met Eric.  First, he greeted us enthusiastically and asked questions about what we are looking for in a car, our price range, color choices, if we qualify for any rebates etc and then he explained in detail about Hyundai and Elantra.  Then he got us a Venetian Red Elantra with grey interiors to do the test drive.  Most other salesman wouldn't let us drive more than couple of miles around the block but Eric is different.  He said, ""If you buy it's going to be your car - so go ahead and drive on the highway and around the block and as long as you want - just get me back to the dealership in one piece.""  Great attitude!  After the test drive, he opened the hood and explained about Hyundai's innovation on impact features, went through the details about the car interiors.  When we wanted to check a beige interior, he went back to the inventory and got us a Venetian Red car with beige interior.  After he made sure that we got every possible detail about the car, like every typical car salesman explained the exhaustive list of dealer add-ons but he never pushed them as a ""must have"" which sets him apart from other salesmen.  Sales commissions are dependent on how many add-on a salesman sells to the customers - so I will definitely excuse Eric for bringing the dealer add-ons couple more times during our price negotiations but the best part is he never felt pushy.  We highly recommend Eric for his enthusiasm and customer-centric attitude.",4.8

I have been calling and arguing with these people for 2 months now. Now that the time allotted for the refund has passed, I will be contacting my lawyer. The finance department is a complete joke. When speaking to Greg from finance, my new finance company was told that ""he didn't deserve any complaint or tone, because he doesn't handle this s---."" Cute, huh? When trying to get the manager on the phone, she conveniently doesn't answer...any time of the day. Customer service training obviously lacks at this dealership.

467,"July 08, 2015","Wasn't sure what to expect as I have never been to the Hyundai dealership before, but there is no negotiation on price-it is sticker minus rebates and that's it.  I'm used to getting money off of sticker besides just rebates.  I was a loyal Toyota consumer for the last 15 years, we'll see how this relationship works out.  I usually trade in every 2 years because of the mileage I put on a vehicle.  This really wasn't he vehicle that I wanted, the car was at a dealership in Louisiana and they went back on the agreement of picking up the vehicle, so I took a second choice.  I don't believe this was the salesman's fault, but the other dealership shouldn't have told Jorge on Friday that the car could be picked up on Monday and on Monday when Jorge called to confirm, they said the car flooded.  How did they not know this on Friday and call back either Saturday or Monday and let Jorge know he couldn't get the vehicle-I had already signed all the paperwork and everything on this vehicle when it was taken back and I had to start all over again looking.  My car was totaled in an accident that wasn't my fault and had to pay a rental until I got a new vehicle, so I didn't want to wait a week or two, I needed something quickly, so I settled.  I realize the 2016'sjust came out, but Hyundai should have more color and styles available.  Couldn't find blue with beige interior anywhere, why do all cars have black interior?? they show all the dirt and have to be vacuumed constantly and they are HOT in Texas heat!",4.8

We truly enjoyed our car buying experience and will be sure to recommend our friends and family.,5.0
472,"May 13, 2015","The sales is the one of the heart of the company but if you don't know the featurs and product what they are selling doesn't make any sense to buy from there they know only the price of the Vechicle . We ask many question regarding for the Santafee that sales associates don't know!!!! The sales manager that guy is stupid because when customer asking question regarding for the product he should be answerable otherwise don't try to argue with customer and say you don't have power to ask question .if the sales associates don't the product the sales manager should know the product and featurs .also the important thing which they offering price and the other dealership price is very different.

473,"April 30, 2015","I received a recall notice and went to the dealership to get it scheduled.  The gentleman that I dealt with was very pleasant, checked the paperwork I received for the recall, wrote the vin # down and scheduled my appointment.

I arrived for my appointment, waited about 30 min to check on the status and was told they had to order the part.  Why the parts weren't ordered when the appointment was made remains a mystery.
Another appointment was made for the following day, the parts were installed (I think) and I asked the service dept employee that set all this up if he would put some gas in the vehicle for the trouble and mileage wasted to return and he ignored me.  I never received any paper work for my records to attest to the work performed.  That is why the (I think) was stated above.

I think the service desk employee should have showed me the work that was performed and reimbursed me for the extra trip I made because he did not order the parts at the time the work was scheduled.

Little things like that would have made for a better experience.",3.0

The vehicle drives great and I love it. Everyone compliments on my car everyday.

477,"July 12, 2014","I am a 63 year old Army retiree and this was my 21st vehicle purchase. Using USAA car buying services, I had four Hyundai dealerships to work with. Travis Parker was the first to contact me and when I told him what I was looking for and what my bottom price was, he assured me he could meet or exceed the lowest dealer price offered. Our phone conversation convinced me he and his dealership were worth a visit.  We coordinated a time and the Santa Fe Sport with all the options I submitted was ready for a test drive. The set back was  no SUV with my chosen red color was available on the lot. Nevertheless, I test drove the SUV and immediately noticed the improved difference in ride and steering versus my four year old Toyota Venza. Not to mention the the great options in the selected package (blind spot detection is a great feature for Houston traffic). Travis made arrangements for one three vehicles in red in a 300 mile radius; mine was located at McKinney, north of Dallas. 
The agreed upon price was locked in before the vehicle was picked up. Unfortunately, the SUV was not ready the next workday due to the pickup and return distance, When my wife and I went to pick up the vehicle and complete the documentation, I found that accessories I hadn't ordered were included with this vehicle. The dealership, however, honored the original negotiated price and I made the best purchase on this vehicle ever! The Consumer Reports 2014 Best Cars magazine identifies the Santa Fe Sport as ""Easy on the wallet"" as the least expensive mid sized SUV's. With my Performance Package I've saved thousands of dollars to the rivals (by the way, the top rated SUV in this class is the larger Santa Fe) yet at the same time have a great vehicle that exceeds my needs. It has the unbelievable 60,000/5 year basic warranty and 100,000/10 year power train warranty. Yes!
Again, thanks goes to Travis, whose salesman style is friendly, knowledgeable, absolutely pressure free, and focused on getting what is needed and Octavio Cancel who patiently ensured I was completely satisfied with all the numbers. This was a tremendous experience",5.0
478,"May 17, 2014","At first glance, everything seemed great.  We found a vehicle we really liked, even though it was filthy (had bird poop and dirt all over it), we decided we wanted it.  Went through finance, and since it was so late, not many banks were open to give the best rate.  Finance made a call to the GM who approved us taking the vehicle and coming back the next day to finish signing the papers.  Agreements were made for the sale price, and since the vehicle did not come with floor mats, they agreed to give us a check for $100 to cover/offset the cost of replacing them.  
When my husband went back to sign the papers and get the car detailed since it was not done the night before, he was extremely tired after working midnight to 8am, they did not fully explain all details regarding everything that was on there.   When he got home, he noticed yellow scratches of the top of the roof.  He called and spoke to the Pre Owned manager who requested we bring the vehicle back and he would have his ""detailer"" take care of those.  My husband asked I look over all the information with the contract.  First thing I noticed was the sales price was wrong.  After I told the sales person the price and he still wrote it down wrong, I scratched it out and wrote it for him, even after all that, they still got the sales price wrong.  So I continued going through and came across a ""HUB VALUE PACKAGE"" for $795.  When I questioned my husband, he said it was the GAP insurance.  I informed him no, GAP was on the finance page, not the contract page.  He did not know what it was for.  Since I looked this over on Sunday, I had to wait until Monday to contact them.
I contacted them at 9am on Monday morning, only to find out the persons I needed to speak to regarding my concerns, did not come in until noon.  I waited until noon, called and spoke to the finance gentleman who we were working with.  I informed him of the sales price issue and the ""Value Package"".  He informed me the sales price could be resolved, but we would need to re-sign all the documents.  In regards to the ""Value Package"" he stated that had to deal with a ""Tire Package"" they offered.  I stated we were never informed of any type of package and that it needed to be removed.  He asked I come back in and go over the paperwork.  I said I would be in around 6:30pm that evening.  
After we showed up, he tried offering me cash instead of changing the contract, to which I refused, I informed him I did not want to pay finance charges on the difference.  He removed the ""Value Package"" by having us sign a cancel document that would go to the lender and they would remove that from the principal.  I requested he keep the cash and add the difference to that page and have them remove that from the principal as well.  After dealing with the finance gentleman, we went to speak to our Sales Rep who talked to us regarding the issues and my husband also brought up the fact the windshield wipers were dilapidated and had to be replaced, and brought the receipt showing the purchase of the new ones and asked this be reimbursed.  He stated he would talk to his manager and let us know.
When he showed up later that week to have the detailer remove the scratches, he requested they not wash it to avoid further mishaps.  (My husband is very meticulous and prefers to wash/detail his own vehicles)  After they were complete, he looked over the roof to insure all scratches were removed.  When he arrived home, he decided to give it a thorough washing and noticed several more scratches that were not on the vehicle previously. 
When I placed a call to Pre Owned manager, I asked him for a corporate number, to which I was given the run around and never received the number.  I also brought up the $100 check we were still waiting on, to which he replied he had no recollection of this and asked I fax over proof.  I also asked about the windshield wiper reimbursement, and he again informed me he did not know anything about this.  Stated he would speak to his Sales rep and check his desk since he had been out and let us know.  When I brought us the additional scratches, he informed me they did take out all the scratches and he was sure there were no issues regarding them.   When I again asked for corporate number, he said I could call the main line and ask for him and if he could not help me, he would connect me with his boss.  I asked for his boss's name to which he told me, then promptly stated ok, thanks for calling, click.  Dial tone....really?  You hang up on customers before they finish speaking?  Not very professional....car buying should be a fun experience, not a hassle.  Will NEVER buy another vehicle here, nor will I recommend.  I will be blasting my experience all over Social Media and hopefully I will get some answers.  If not, at least I can warn others.  ",2.6

I called Austin and we set up a time for a test drive of the vehicles.  When I got to Hub Hyundai in Katy, Austin was there waiting for me;he was attentive and friendly he answered my questions thoroughly.  I test drove both cars, then he parked them side-by-side and went over the bells and whistles of each car; after that review I felt confident with my choice of my Sonata.

He doesn't give you a chance to talk, and sounds like he has had way too much caffeine.

498,"May 09, 2011","After settling on a sale price of $23588 for a 2011 Hyundai Tucson GLS with navigation package, I drove from Austin to Houston to pick-up the vehicle. I had specifically requested my drive out price and was e-mailed $25400. When I arrived in Houston, the salesmen was very nice, but as soon as I sat down with the finance manager to sign the paperwork, I noticed that they had tacked on an additional $1200 in fees making my drive out price $26728.18. They claimed that they add two packages to all of their vehicles which are non-negotiable: simonize (5 year paint and fabric protection) and UUG Anti-theft ($5000 toward purchase of new vehicle if car is stolen in the first 5 years). We negotiated those fees down but still ended up paying the same price as we were quoted in Austin. They will underbid and lie on the base price and make up their money in the end with additional fees. You would be better off calling them and negotiating a good deal over the phone and then use that as leverage with a more reputable dealership. When the dealership won't match the price, but will get down to invoice, take their deal! You will be sorry if you trust HUB.",1.0
