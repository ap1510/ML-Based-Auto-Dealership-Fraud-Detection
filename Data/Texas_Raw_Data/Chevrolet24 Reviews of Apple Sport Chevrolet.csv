2,"March 16, 2020","We were able to come to an agreed price on the vehicle I was looking at. The purchase process was relatively painless. The used car make ready dept. could do a better job when cleaning the interior of the vehicles they are offering for sale. Exterior was fine. This is our second purchase from Apple, New Ford in November, used 2019 Ford in March. I would definitely do business with them again.",4.6

7,"October 15, 2019",Bought my car at Apple and pretty much did everything over the phone which was what I wanted. Told them what I was looking for and what I was trading in and went and signed papers. And the dealership continues with the great service as I went back for oil change and was still in great hands. ,5.0

Have a seat in lounge, --- was clean, quiet with TV if you wish.  Job completed in timely fashion and was asked if we would like them to give a car wash at no charge.  They completed quickly and a great job was done.  Glad I did and do business at Apple-Sport.  ",5.0
9,"October 07, 2019",I purchased a 2017 Chevy Bolt recently and the purchasing process was unexpectedly smooth.  There was no hassle and the dealership made every effort to ensure I made my 200 mile return trip safely (since this is an electric car and 200 miles is on the edge of its range).  I made the trip back with no problems and my visit there was very relaxed and hospitable.   I would certainly recommend this place and Todd to my friends and family.   I would also point out they had among the best price in the nation for this vehicle.  Excellent value!,5.0

20,"April 22, 2019","When it comes to getting my car serviced, the same man is usually there but he is very kind and friendly. He’s honestly the reason I will keep going back to get my car serviced. In regards to sales, I had a pretty good experience. The lady the helped get me into a new car with my terrible credit might not be there anymore but she was amazing. I don’t think I would have gotten a car without her and the managers that work behind the scenes to get customers approved. 10/10 would recommend!",5.0

23,"December 31, 2015",I went in to purchase a vehicle.  They did not honor their internet pricing.  They wasted my time by stringing me along.   They were confused about what inventory they had.  I would never return to this horrible dealership.  They are what gives car dealerships a bad reputation!,1.0
