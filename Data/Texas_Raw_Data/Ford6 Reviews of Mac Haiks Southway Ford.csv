0,"February 29, 2020",No good!! My daughter bought a car from Mac Haik southway ford on sw military location in San Antonio TX and the salesman named Nick promised to fix and clean the car up.  Well they didn't do it.  Nick manager just wanted to throw some water on the stained dirty seats and wipe with a rag.  Once you make the deal they don't care about you. ,1.0

4,"October 10, 2017","I unfortunately am not a stranger to having to have my car repaired.  The other people at these other places were always rude and seemed annoyed with any of my questions or concerns, Edgar and the ladies up front were always very helpful and I was kept informed throughout the whole process.  My car looks brand new! Not only would I go back to SouthWay Ford if I ever need,  I would also recommend SouthWay Ford to my family and friends.  ",5.0
5,"August 23, 2017","I had a decent experience at the dealership with the sales person Brian Vasquez ,but when you get to see the finance officer be careful. The finance officer said that we would get 2 years worth of service because we were good people; I reviewed my contract few days later and I was charged 370 dollars for 2 years of oil changes. That was my fault for not catching that, so for those of you who hear that song and dance from your loan officer ;beware and read your contract.
