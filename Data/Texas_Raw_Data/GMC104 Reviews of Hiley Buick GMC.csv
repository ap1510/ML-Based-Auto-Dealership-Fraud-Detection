2,"May 09, 2020","We had a great experience purchasing a new GMC truck from Hiley Buick GMC in Fort Worth.  Our salesman was Brady Sharp.  He was fair and honest throughout the trade in and buying process, making it as seamless as possible.  It's difficult to find a dealership and salesman who makes the buying process this simple and stress-free.  Brady did a fantastic job and I highly recommend him and Hiley GMC to anyone looking for a quality vehicle and stellar service.  Thanks Brady!",5.0

5,"March 31, 2020",They have no interest in doing business at this time. Sent them everything to get a deal done today but never called back or respond back to me. Last day of the month and everyone on lock down and still poor response time.  ,1.0
6,"March 10, 2020","I brought my 2014 Corvette in due to rodent damage to the air intake and coolant reservoir. The service department failed to check the reservoir, tole me that they did a pressure check and checked the entire cooling system. Upon driving home, the car began to overheat. I brought it back to be fixed. They let me know that the part plus 2 hours of labor would be $540, and that they would take either 15% or $100 off whichever was more. When I went to get the car, they charged me $431 for 2.5 hours of labor and only took 15% off. The part was $116. Overall, the service department failed to complete the repair as needed, was dishonest they they ""checked the entire system and did a pressure check"", overcharged from the verbal labor quote and failed to keep their word on the discount offer due to their inept initial repair. I lost access to my vehicle for 3 weeks due to their lack of available scheduling after they failed the first time, was told that ""it wasn't their fault"", and, on top of all of this, my vehicle smelled horribly when I finally got it back.",1.4

10,"February 25, 2020","Hiley GMC is great!! Ask for Marshall
Gilbreath. The sales process was quick and easy due to their no hassle pricing. I know I’m getting the best deal possible, even did my research within the market. Finance was quick and easy, no pressure sales. ",5.0

14,"January 31, 2020",I worked with Taylor and would have to say that I have NEVER had this quality of customer service and care. He heard me out and meet all of my Truck needs. I would have given a 100 star if possible.,5.0
15,"December 26, 2019","Consumers beware this place is going to rip you off!  I was ready to buy a new GMC truck but realized that they were not honoring the advertised price from their own website.   When I asked for the explanation I was told by the sales girl that that was the offer from ""them"" (sales manager).  They will also try and undervalue your trade - example, they only wanted to give me $7,500 for my vehicle so I went to Car Max where they gave me $13,000.  Good luck with these morons....they are trying to prey on stupid people.  How do they stay in Business?  Don't worry I will be filing a consumer complaint with the Attorney General's office.",1.0
16,"December 16, 2019","Thos dealership just ripped me off for $1600.00 Dollars on an extended warranty refund. I traded in the vehicle BEFORE the factory warranty EXPIRED..... So they decided to refund 21 percent of a COMPLETLY UNUSED UNACTIVATED extended warranty.
DO NOT BUY HERE.",1.0
17,"July 25, 2019","I agreed on a truck and price.  While we were working on the financing with the finance department and filling out the credit forms two days later, we were told that the vehicle had been sold to someone else.   On telling me that the truck had been sold and offering another vehicle in its place, Kylie told me that we had not put a deposit on the truck but in fact it had not been offered.  And furthermore she stated that they could not hold the truck on my ""word"". In my business your ""word"" is your credibility. This is not so at Hiley GMC.

The lines of competition are drawn by ""customer service"", Hiley GMC has missed the mark.

18,"May 29, 2019","Cheated me on my trade-in, unsuccessfully tried to trick me into 14,000.00 of extended warranty which I cancelled after I found out that I had a standard 36,000 factory warranty. It is partly my fault for falling for their smooth talk. If they can cheat a 45 yr. retired GM employee, they will cheat anyone off the street. Buyer beware!",1.8
19,"January 13, 2019"," When into the dealership to look for a specific car process took less than a couple of hours which included a test drive. They did everything I asked them to do they have the car ready when they said they were going to have it ready and I sailed through the process with no issues mainly because of Randy. Ask for Randy he’s really good and does a great job.
Also I traded my 2013 Yukon in on the used vehicle and I’ve had it serviced there for six years without an issue done quickly done on time what more can you ask for?",5.0
20,"March 04, 2018","This dealership advertised a new Buick Encore 2 days in row at lower than sales price. Went in to dealership the 1st day and the Salesman blamed it on a internet glitch, basically blamed it on GM. Checked the internet the next day and the prices where lowered again, I called and the same excuse. Felt like I got shamed just to get me into the dealership. Should have made them honor there pricing, but I won’t be back.",1.4
21,"January 02, 2018",I purchased my 2014 GMC Sierra truck new from Hiley and had it serviced their ever since.  The customer service and attention to detail are bar none the best.  Its been so good that I would not consider getting another vehicle anywhere else or having my truck serviced anywhere else.  Problems that I have experienced have been corrected the 1st time with out having to do any follow-up.,5.0
22,"November 20, 2017","I took my truck in for a scheduled oil change and added additional services including a fuel injector cleaning, tire rotation, and air filter replacement. I had no problem with the work done on those services BUT I did have a repair needed for my brake system which is warranty work on my truck. I was told the part was not in stock but would be ordered and available on the Monday following my visit (Saturday). It's been two weeks and I still haven't heard from the dealership. I was hoping for better service.",3.2

They even detailed my car.. 
Thank you",5.0
25,"October 26, 2017",This dealership is an awesome atmosphere.  It’s so open & clean & the personal are very knowledgeable at their job.  Quick service & they act like they care.  Customer service at its best at this dealership.  You completely miss the boat going any other place.,4.8
26,"October 23, 2017","I will use them in the future and have recommended them to others!  I really appreciate the quickness with which my purchase was handled. We were in and out in 2.5 hours, including two test drives. Efficient!",5.0
27,"October 21, 2017","Very satisfied. They offered a shuttle service. Service done in timely manner. Truck was washed before pickup. Waiting area was comfortable with TV, coffee and vending machines. ",4.4
28,"October 16, 2017","Vehicle wasn't there to look at like promised on the phone. Expected me to make a deal on a vehicle not there, then after i agree to the vehicle doesn't show up the next day as promised again. Im told to come back Monday to get it and they would have it all detailed and ready to go. I show up and have to wait an hour for what they called a detail which was they spraying it with a water house and not even touching the inside. If it wasn't for the decent price i would have walked away. ",2.4
29,"October 12, 2017","Bought a new Terrain, salesman was awesome! Quick and easy purchase, told him what I wanted and he made it happen, all under an hour. Have been in twice for routine maintenance, been in and out of there in less than 30 minutes both times! I was informed up front about the guy who washes/details cars regarding his laziness so I always tell them not to wash my vehicle. Other than that, all around great! ",5.0
30,"October 12, 2017","I scheduled an appointment for an oil change, and I arrived on time. While checking in, I was informam d it would be at least 2 hours before they even started on my car. What good does scheduling an appointment due?  I understand having to wait a few minutes, but 2 hours?  Learn to schedule better or not allow walk-in service to disrupt previously scheduled clients. I left, and I will not be back. ",1.2
31,"October 10, 2017","My husband and I purchased a 2015 GMC Sierra Denali 2 years ago from Hiley Buick GMC and every time we take it in for an issue or to get serviced, it is always a HUGE disappointment. They never have the same service staff, which is a HUGE red flag, such a high turnover rate when it comes to service staff. Service is absolutely horrible!!! They sign forms stating they fix the problem but do not even look at the problem nor fix it. We took it in for an issue and our brand new truck came home with scratches. We took it in for an alignment and the tires were only rotated, no alignment was performed. We took it in for a leakage and they stated it was fixed, a year down the road, leakage is still there and they now state it is not covered. Every single time we have taken our vehicle in, it has been the biggest headache and disappointment. Please save yourself some time and money. Do not purchase a vehicle from this dealership. They care about the sale but then you are on your own after that. Excuse after excuse! They are in desperate need of customer service training and loyal employees!",1.0
32,"October 08, 2017","I was looking for a Yukon XL Denali and found what I was looking for at Hiley.  Darian Marcus was great to work with as he was low pressure and very responsive.  Other dealers I spoke with were a lot closer to my location, but they were not as competitive as Hiley.   It was worth the drive over to Ft. Worth to buy the car.  ",4.8
33,"October 06, 2017","I would recommend this dealership for any service.  I had bought my first GMC Terrain in 2012, 3 months later I was T-Boned by an 18 wheeler on the drivers side door.  As soon as I called Hiley GMC on 820 the manager was on top of everything and located me a car just like the obe I had just purchased 3 months before, he kept the car sitting there until everything was settled with my insurance  company and all I had to do was go in and sign the papers for my other new Terrain 30 days later.  Service Department is excellent, they get me right in out.",4.6
34,"September 26, 2017","My husband and myself had started looking for an new suv. We went online, found dealerships and compared the prices and features.  We decided on Hiley Buick GMC because they were the most competitive. We  asked for Darien, because we had been looking online. He was  a little new, had not been working there very long, but he answered every question we had.  Took us for a test drive and explained all the gadgets that car had.  We have been very pleased with the car and the service Darien gave us.  We were not in the dealership for hours as in the past.  We were in and out within a couple of hours. Great job Darien.",4.0
35,"September 24, 2017","Yesterday I went with family members, they bought a New Denali !  Sales and everyone were friendly and made us all feel welcomed. Darian Marcus and staff were awesome. Business went smooth! 
No hassles. Too all I recommend this car Dealership
Thanks",5.0
36,"September 19, 2017","The service representative I spoke with, Justin, took ownership of the service work that my truck required. He assessed the situation and listened to my frustrations in a polite and attenative manner. Justin went above and beyond to make sure I was leaving a happy customer by providing a shuttle home, a loaner and service work that was just outside of a standard warranty. He understood the value of a happy customer and for that I am grateful. I will be returning to Hiley for my next car/truck. Thank you Justin!

38,"August 28, 2017",The work was completed in the amount of time that was quoted and my car came back clean! The man who cleaned it did leave his rags in my back seat though.,4.8
39,"August 22, 2017","Today was the last straw with this place. Since when is it acceptable to have an appointment, leave your car there all day, and then be told they didn't even look at it. It was apparent that they could care less that they wasted my entire day by just letting my car sit there. And this was the second time in two weeks! I will never buy another Buick because my Lacrosse has more issues than a magazine and after the way I have been treated by Buick, I would never recommend anyone buy one. This service department should be investigated, stay away!",1.0
40,"August 18, 2017",Enjoyed the buying experience and the treatment I received from Robert and Scott. Also Zak in  Finance was instrumental in getting us a great interest rate. ,4.6
41,"August 11, 2017",Had a very pleasant experience with this dealership was in and out of there in less than 2 hours my sales rep Jenna was very helpful and friendly she helps set everything up on my car and my phone. Would definitely recommend this dealership to anyone,5.0
42,"August 09, 2017","The way you're treated at any place makes a big difference in how you perceive the services provided. 
I would have given 5 stars but a certain service person there (for whatever reason he's always assigned to our service appointments) is the rudest person there can be. A complete smart xxx.. we went and paid $1000 to have new tires put on my vehicle, when we get there to pick it up, we obviously want to check out what we just paid a grand for!! He makes a smart xxx remark saying ""Well I can assure you they are Black and Round"" NOT THE WAY TO TREAT A CUSTOMER THAT JUST DROPPED A $1000 TO CONTRIBUTE TO YOUR PAY! ",2.4
43,"August 02, 2017","After buying a CPO Sierra, the sales side was giving me trouble about replacing the torn driver seat. After talking with Jerry in Service, they took my truck in the next week, fixed it for zero cost, and gave me a super nice 2017 Acadia SLT as a loaner for the day. I'll definitely bring it back to them for service ",5.0
44,"August 02, 2017",Most of the reviews I have read on here are from people complaining about not getting their way.  I bought 2 trucks at different times.  1st one was a cash purchase and I was in and out within 30 minutes.  The second one I financed and was done in about 45 minutes.  Very professional people that I worked with.  Ask for John Cantu.,5.0
45,"May 31, 2017","They failed me on my inspection because of gas cap test. My car is only 6 years old with no wear or tear. I took my car to Jiffy Lube and it passed. I was told by the guys at your dealership that the only way my car would pass , I would have to buy a GM gas cap for $60 and $50 for installation. Seriously??? The nerve of these guys trying to scam a female.",1.0

47,"May 13, 2017","I recently purchased a used vehicle and extended warranty from them.  Within a month I experienced problems.  I called them up they brought it in and checked it out and of course it stopped acting up.  A week later the problems resumed, they were able to diagnose the problem this time and work with the warranty company to get it repaired with nothing out of pocket.  They went above and beyond  by providing me with a loaner vehicle and keeping me informed every step of the way.  Jerry Jackson and his service department are really squared away.  Justin the service person kept me informed about everything.  I will never go anywhere else.",5.0
48,"January 17, 2017","MY CAR CAME WITH 24,000 2 YEAR SERVICE ON OIL CHANGE AND TIREE ROTATION.  I BOUGHT THE CAR IN MAY 2015.  ITS JAN 2017 WITH 20,000 MILES.  I WENT IN FOR MY REGULAR OIL CHANGE AND THEY TOLD ME THE SERVICE HAD EXPIRED.  THEY WERE BRING9NG ME IN EVERY 5000 MILES.  THEY SAID I ONLY GET FOUR OIL CHANGES REGARDLESS.  THATS NOT WHAT MY CONTRACT SAYS.  EVEN THE SERVICE MANAGER WAS AGAINS ME.  I ALSO BROUGHT THE CAR IN FOR AIR BAG RECALL.  THEY WOULDN'T GIVE ME PAPER WORK THAT THE JOB WAS COMPLETED.  THIS IS THE WORST SERVICE I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED ANYWHERE.",1.0
49,"October 05, 2016","The finance department at Hiley Buick GMC is completely unprofessional. The only individual working in that department that knows how to professionally deal with customers, is Tim Chapman. Marcell Baily and Ron Hughes are unprofessional, they do not return calls, and they talk to customers as if they are xxxx. My husband and I drove 200+ miles to purchase a vehicle at this dealership, and the only thing pleasant about the experience was the salesman, Matthew Hissam. I would never recommend this dealership to anyone, even if you are able to purchase a vehicle for a great price, pay a little extra somewhere else and get much better service and respect. I would recommend that the General Manager get a grip on the unprofessional people handling the most important aspect of purchasing a vehicle. ",1.4
50,"March 31, 2016","I decided to give Hiley Buick a second try AND WHAT A MISTAKE that was was, after sitting there for almost for over an hour (short handed) anyway I was interested in trading my car for a new car, And was lowballed so bad i just walked out.  I had gotten three estimates (2 from ford & 1from a dodge dealership) they was 5k lower than any of the 3 previous bids don't waste your time with dealership. DO NOT LET THEM RIP YOU OFF

The Sales Guy was Nice. Drew",1.0
51,"November 03, 2015","Bad attitude of defensiveness and nothing we can do. Never again Hiley or GM !!!  I Bought a new 4WD GMC Sierra 1500 about a month ago.  At about 3000 miles the windshield cracked starting at the center top edge then going down about 10 inches then 90 degree turn thru passenger side.  Absolutely nothing hit the windshield.  Sight unseen when I made the appointment the service people denied anything was faulty.  After looking at it they tried to convince me that something had hit it.  NOT!  I've certainly seen what a rock chip looks like and nothing hit it.  After a frustrating debate, they said they would see what they could do and promised to call before then end of the day.  Should be no surprise that they failed to call.  I also noted in writing at delivery a defect/blemish in the front grill chrome.  They assured me they would fix it when I brought it back.  I'm sure they won't be able to find the delivery form I signed with the defect noted.",1.0
52,"July 09, 2015","Car Buying Experience Excellent, Service Department Ruined the Experience 3 times and counting...

I brought my Equinox into the service station on Tuesday morning (11:00am). I called the day before and was placed on hold after speaking to an associate (5:40-6:10pm), then it cut me off and when I call back service is closed. So, the next day I bring it in because the check engine light is on etc..., the first person that greets me/helps me says give us a few minutes and we will have someone come up with a scanner and see what is going on. Then (Randy) comes to ask what is wrong and says if I do not have an appointment then he can't do anything until the following day or later. I call Wednesday morning to check on the status and still no updates, call at 11am and I am told it is in the bay they are diagnosing it (we will call you back in 15-20min), well at 2:30pm I still have not heard anything. When I call I am told the same story as before. Finally about 4:30 I get a call and they say they have to order parts and it will be Thursday evening or Friday before they will be done. I explain again as I had the first day that I have to have a car because I have to work and my wife has to have a car because we have twin newborns at home. I am told that all loaner cars are booked more than a week out... I had my car in service a month or so back and they had it for 3.5 days and I got the same story.

I have to have a car to go to work, and I am not sure why it took almost 2 days to plug a code scanner in and call me. I had already used a code reader and told them the codes and issue upon arriving.",1.6
53,"December 24, 2014",we just purchased a used Chevrolet Cruz for our son.  We worked with John Micheal he was friendly and answered all our questions.  He didn't pressure us in anyway and was a professional.  he took very good care  of us.,5.0
54,"November 12, 2014","Service department is absolutely worthless. If you need to speak with someone you should probably just go ahead and drive over because they do not like to return phone calls. I guess they think everyone is a xxxxxxx and has no idea of how an engine works. After being raised GM and spending over $150,000 on GM vehicles in the last 10 years it is so sad to see such bad quality in their product and service centers. I felt ashamed to tell my dad that I had officially switched to Ford until he told me he would be doing the same with all of his bad luck in the last 5 years with GM products.",1.0
55,"July 03, 2014","The worst car buying experience ever!!  I asked lots of questions and John Kagiorgis told me the SUV was a good reliable vehicle and I wouldn't have any trouble with it, 6 weeks into owning the vehicle I had to replace the air shocks(that had been bad for months) which costs me 100.00's of dollars. There was a chip in the windshield that Hiley was suppose to fix but they didn't, I had to file against my insurance to get it fixed. It's been almost 2 months since I bought the vehicle and they still haven't gotten me my tags or license plates because they can't get the title transferred out of the previous owners name. I called to talk to Eric the GM of Hiley and he was very rude and not helpful at all, all he wanted to do is cover his behind and make Hiley look like they did nothing wrong.

60,"October 10, 2013","Didn't give me my brother in-laws discount.  Three people made me feel bad about my salesman Jr. Wood loosing money because I used his discount.  Then they didn't even give it to me and it is on the original paperwork.  I got two additional packages, so did not realize the mistake until I compared both sheets side by side.  My standard cargo cover was missing when I got home, then Chris made it out like he was doing me a favor by getting me one.  Then Jason tells me my package for paint and interior is for 6 yrs.  A six year check is even written on the paper.  Cris says he he will honor the 6 years, but when I get there he brings another gun out to tell me there's no such thing.  So I had to drive back out.  I gave them 3 days to fix the $1,379.00 mistake and I have heard from nobody.  Jason never once told me there was all ready a year paint coverage on the SUV.  So me paying for  yrs. plus that would make it 6 years.  Then Jason tries to sell me another package for road side assistance that already comes standard with the Terrain.  They are nothing more than highly paid scam artist.  Car tag only listed Power Train warranty.  Nothing else.  The GMC company in total has left me down.  Even with them knowing I was a disabled Veteran, they still did me this way.   I spoke with a lady on chat who said someone would get back with me within a couple of days and I also left a email for somebody concerning this.",1.8
61,"February 02, 2013","John is a super busy guy. After our first contact with him slowed, we contacted two other dealerships,ut neither wanted to work for us. Had follow up contact with Cantu, again we let him know we were REALLY serious buyers. He found us two cars, told us one was a NO GO, the other perfect. We went to the dealer within @24 hours, signed paperwork--- he made it easy to understand & very comfortable. Gave us EXACTLY what we wanted & agreed on. Car was ready 48 hours later(had to come from out of state). Only negatives, finance guy almost made my hubby & I back out of the deal while he told us how TERRIBLE & SUPER EXPENSIVE electronic & car issues could be in the future (trying to sell warranties). We agreed that he gave us the impression that GMC's were not a good long term investment. Loud & pounding were his techniques. Nice guy. Just giving wrong impression.

We probably could have negotiated a little better prices, but we felt like we got a good car for a good price from quaility dealership.  We made the final sale contigent our mechanic looking at it and he said it needed two new tires so Hiley went ahead and replaced the two tires after the sale for no charge.

66,"July 19, 2011","Speaking strictly on the sales/dealer experience, ours at Hiley Subaru was one of the better car buying experiences we've had. We went in for an initial test drive in the 2011 Outback and let our salesman Paul know that we were still in the early stages of the buying process. Paul didn't try to pressure us into buying anything and gave us enough info to help make our eventual decision. The dealership had very limited inventory (due to the tsunami in Japan they said), so we test drove one of the few Outbacks they had. Early the next week, Paul called to let us know a few more Outbacks came in and they had an offer of $500 below invoice. We decided to go back and test drive one of the new ones. Again, Paul didn't try to pressure us or try to sell us anything we didn't want. We liked one of the two new Outbacks they had and we decided to take it. They worked with us on our trade in and we came to a mutual agreement on the price and we drove away in our new Outback shortly thereafter. We never felt like our arms were being twisted and both me and my wife felt comfortable the whole time. I would recommend this dealership (hopefully they can get their inventory levels up soon).",5.0

71,"July 07, 2011","I had a warranty issue on my vehicle and went to the dealer.  John in service greeted me with a smile and took the time to listen and understand my car's issue.  He escorted me to the waiting room, (as opposed to just pointing). He came by the waiting area a little later to updated me, and then shortly afterwards told me that he was going to put me into a vehicle to use because the part my car needed was not available locally.  It is John's easy-going nature and attentiveness and concern that will insure that my cars are only serviced at Hiley Buick GMC.",5.0
72,"July 06, 2011","Best auto purchasing experience I've ever had.  Salesman and Finance officer both were very personable and worked with us to reach a deal we couldn't refuse.  I've bought cars for over 40 years and don't recall ever thinking it was a positive experience.  But, I left your lot smiling and will most likely return for another purchase in the future.",5.0
73,"June 30, 2011","I am completley staisfied with the service I received from the moment I drove into the parking lot, got out of my car, and was greeted by Jackson.  He was very polite and pleasant to work with.  From there, I sat down with Trey and went through the complete process of reviewing what I needed and how to get it when buying a new car.  I did the test drive on an Outback and a Forester.  I loved both cars, but felt the Outback better met my needs.  Once the decision was made and I picked the one I wanted, the paperwork was completed and I was taken over to finance.  that usually makes me very nervous, but the young man that handled my financing was genuinely friendly and courteous.  He made me feel very comfortable.  The complete experience was painless and I will come back if I ever decide I need another vehicle.",5.0

80,"June 09, 2011",This dealership was a delight to work with. I live out of town and bought this vehicle while visiting family. My sister was familiar with the dealership but I had never heard of them being froma different state. They treated me like family and everyone at the dealership was more than accomodating. They bent over backwards to make this a great experience for me. I wish I lived in the area. Would love to use them for service too!,5.0
81,"June 07, 2011","The customer service I received from this dealership was the best I have ever received on a domestic vehicle.  I originally took my Tahoe to Moritz Chevrolet (because I drive a Chevy Tahoe) and the Service Manager was the worst!  I called Hiley GMC to ask if they would work on a chevy and they said ""No Problem, we will take care of it"".  Wade Shipman is an outstanding service manger, I highly recommend them for any of your service needs.

83,"May 29, 2011","I was searching online for a newer pre-owned vehicle with low miles, and saw an ad for a 2009 Toyota RAV4 at Hiley. I called to make an appointment to see the vehicle, and was able to meet with Jonathan Clark within an hour. I made it clear that I was just scouting, and that any test drive would come the following day, when my wife would be along. There was never any undue pressure on Jonathan's part, just the typical discussion that is a natural part of buying a vehicle at any dealership. He just went with the flow, rather than trying to ""herd"" me.

I react very negatively to any high-pressure tactics when making a major purchase, and Jonathan worked easily within my comfort level, just answering any questions that came up along the way. His manner is genuine, friendly and easy-going, and he made both me and (the next day) my wife feel very comfortable. When the negotiations began, the process was strictly business, but professional, low-key and non-confrontational. For us, it was the perfect style.

When the deal had been agreed upon, we went through paperwork with Raleigh. He also had a pleasant, easy-going manner and showed a great deal of patience with questions we had along the way.

Jonathan, Raleigh and everyone we met at Hiley made it one of the best sales experiences we have had at any dealership over the years.",5.0
84,"May 20, 2011","This was by far the BEST car dealership experience that my husband and I have had! Not once did we feel pressured or overwhelmed. We had a great experience from dealing with Glenn Christopher our Sales Associate, to the Sales Manager, Sam, to the Finance Representative Raleigh. They all made us feel right at home, and I can honestly say they all worked hard to provide us with the best service and biggest savings. I have already recommended the Hiley Dealership to my co-workers! Sincerely, Clarissa Lopez

85,"May 17, 2011","Even though I had to bring my vehicle back for service three different times for the same problem, I was treated with great care.  John assisted me the other times and did a wonderful job explaining what they had done to my vehicle up to that point.  However, when I brought my vehicle back in on Friday, 05/13/11, he was off and David Mills stepped in and earned my trust that he was going to have my vehicled looked at thoroughly.  David called me shortly after I dropped off my vehicle and told me that they did not want to leave me without a vehicle so they arranged for me to have a rental car. David continued to update me throughout Friday, and even on Saturday.  Then again on Monday to let me know they found the problem and were going to thoroughly test it after the part was replaced.  Vehicle was ready Monday afternoon and they told I could drop the rental at the dealership and they would take care of returning it.  I have never been to a dealership where the service was outstanding.  Yes, I may have been inconvenienced, but I was definitely taken care of.  When I buy another vehicle, I definitely want to consider the service department first.  Hiley's Service Department is outstanding!  I could not thank everyone there enough.  It may be too soon to say, but I feel my vehicle problem has been taken care of, but if it is not, I know the service department will do another fine job taking care of me.  ",5.0
86,"May 05, 2011",We had gone to a few other dealerships who obviously did not put in enough effort for us. Our family didn't have much to work with.

Everyone was really nice and we didn't feel like another sale. Thanks!,5.0

Jack and Seth , finance mgrs, did just that WITHOUT being pushy. Out of all dealerships of Toyota and chevy I went too Hiley GM got me into a TRUCK with more looks, options, and accessories at a lower price compared to other dealerships and co.'s I went to especially on a more accessorized vehicle compared to a basic model the other dealers were trying to work a deal on.

I also had my 7month old and 3 year old boys with me and the entire staff entertained them which made it easy for me. AWESOME STAFF AND MANAGEMENT, VERY VERY FRIENDLY, AND NOT PUSHY.  ",5.0

I have a hybrid Saturn that needed a new ignition.  I got insurance coverage - bumper to bumper - back in '07 when I bought the VUE new.  For three days we talked to Hiley about bringing out the hybrid to them.  The minute they got it, Scott, the service writer said he was not going to put ""his mechanics in danger,"" and they did not have the right ""tools.""  In fact, the only voltage through the column and ignition system at all is exactly 12 volts according to a GMC master mechanic.  They just didn't seem want to have to do insurance work.  Apparently the service writer runs the shop.  Too bad he's clueless.",1.0

But if I follow the oil life monitor the oil may only be changed once per year and between 10,000 to 12,000 thousand miles. I plan on keeping my vehicle and perfer to take care of my vehicle. scott was very nice and took time to explain all my options. they really seem to care about me and taking care of my vehicle.

92,"December 10, 2010","Beware when you take your car to a shop for service, and educate yourself! Not all dealers are the same, and many have your best interest in mind, unfortunately Hiley GMC is not one of them. I was told by the service consultant Scott that my vehicle needed services that had been recently performed, and their prices were well above average. They made me feel like I was neglecting my vehicle, despite the fact that I service it regularly (oil changes every 5k, services every 15k), and they act friendly but are condescending. I even tried talking to the service manager Tracy, and when several phone calls went unanswered, finally talked to him in person when picking up my vehicle. He was clearly disinterested, and did not act as if any action would be taken to prevent other customers from having the poor experience that I did. In general, Hiley did not seem interested in anything more that selling me services I did not need at exorbitant prices. Avoid them and go around the corner for service. ",2.8

We searched for another Pontiac dealership and found Hiley, right away we spoke with Scott, he said to just drop on by and he would have it looked at, took about 30 min.  He said the stereo would have to be replaced.  He phoned right away when it arrived and said to just drop by at my convenience, it took about an hour.  I was very impressed with the friendliness and efficiency of the work.

I was originally in for service on my 06 Hyundai, when I found out the cost of repair was way out of my budget they took the time to go over all my options.

I left with my new vehicle and was so happy, after returning home my boyfriend was shocked at what I had done and looked over the paperwork, he was so happy to see that I picked the right place to go.  I now have a reliable vehicle that I love and they call me when I need to bring it in and set my next appointment while I'm there so I won't miss any scheduled maintenance my car needs to keep it running for years to come.

103,"August 28, 2010","Recently traveled to this dealership from out of state, the trip was a total of three hours one way. we arrived in Ft. Worth called the dealership to get directions was given incorrect directions by the receptionist who apparently doesn't even know her way around her home town. Upon arrival to the dealership we were greeted by a very rude, pushy salesman by the name of J.D. we forgot his last name. while attempting to negotiate a price for the used vehicle we found and decided to buy ''J.D.'' insisted that there are NO negotiations at this dealership! Even after I was told on the phone to come on down and we could work something out on the price. So I continued with the offer that I felt comfortable giving, he came back to turn down my offer. We then asked how much money the dealership had invested in the vehicle he insisted not very much less than what they had it priced, so as any ordinary person would do I asked exactly how much  he replied by saying you want me to show you, told us an amount but refused to show us on the invoice after telling us he would.  My brother who accompanied me on the trip made a comment about how they probably gave this much money and now are high balling the price ''J.D.'' then went off screaming at my brother saying he had no clue about selling cars and had no clue about the amount they had invested in the vehicle. Over all   
experience was horrible would not recommend anybody to waste your time at this dealership. ",1.2
