2,"May 23, 2020","I was greeted as soon as I walked in to the dealership by Hector Campa.  He asked what I was looking for in a vehicle and demo'd a few vehicles on the lot. I fell in love with my Seltos and Hector was able to answer questions me and my mother had about the vehicle.  He was patient and knowledgeable.  I felt comfortable with the staff there, everyone was polite and professional, even the finance lady was patient has I had some questions about the paperwork. The process was smooth and fast.  I would definitely recommend to anyone looking to by a vehicle!",5.0
3,"May 15, 2020","I left this nice  review 3 months ago when I first purchased my car, the sales team was awesome again peter my sales man took care of us and still does every time I need his help. Took my car in today for my first service on an oil change, only to find out my car was damaged underneath, my car was drive-able before I dropped it off and when I picked up my car I couldn‚Äôt even get down the street over 35 miles an hour With the bottom of my car being damaged, the service department did not take accountability they wanted to blame my body shop for it, how ever again my car was driven There with no problems,  it took them 4 in a half hours for a oil change and supposedly a detail they stated my car was brought in that way. It is sad how Something happened to my vehicle and they won‚Äôt take accountability for it. The part that ripped off from underneath my car is 275 dollars and they‚Äôre only willing to pay for half when it was their problem to begin with... üò° I will not be taking my car back to them for any further services. Their manager russel couldn‚Äôt give us straight answers when we asked certain questions... keep in mind my car is a 2020 still covered under warranty and they offered only half of the part they broke off... if you don‚Äôt want an oil change to cost you more then it should, don‚Äôt take your car here!  Especially for the first service there is other reviews on here with ppl having something happen to them on their first service with the free oil change... that oil change isn‚Äôt for free it ends up coming out more expensive cause of the damage on your vehicle and they don‚Äôt take accountability for it. üò°üò°üò°",1.0
4,"April 24, 2020",I went in for a recall on my vehicle. Never thought that by getting the right sales person Jesse Luna that I would drive off with a car!! My experience was overwhelming and a big blessing!! Oscar from finance did wonders as Jesse made sure to get me in the vehicle I needed. I truly recommend Casa KIA to anyone out there that is having car issues like I was. They will take the time and really work with you!! No joke!! If you read this tell them Laura Duran sent you!! Thank you again to my angels from Casa KIA!!,5.0

13,"February 14, 2020","Wow! Alberto is an amazing human being and a great salesman. From the moment I arrived at the dealership until the very end. Best experience that anyone could possibly have at a dealership. As I pulled into the parking lot I saw the car I asked to test drive parked out front and ready to go. That is when I met Alberto ‚ÄúSarge‚Äù, a 20 year retired veteran full of energy and knowledgeable about the products on the lot. He was very patient with me as I questioned him over and over again about the vehicle and then asked to test drive a second vehicle. When it came time to go over the price of the vehicle he offered me a massive discount that would not be honored anywhere else in El Paso. After the deal was done he and one of his partners delivered the vehicle to my home! I am amazed at the customer service and friendly conversation we had throughout the entire process. I feel that I have met a friend for life. I definitely recommend that you ask for Sarge when you arrive to this dealership. He will not disappoint. Thanks Sarge!",5.0

20,"January 06, 2020","Be careful! It‚Äôs a sad time when you should have to take photos before and after service or ask for a complete walk around your car to make sure they don‚Äôt damage anything. I bought my car here and the service was just ok nothing impressive or negative but I took my car in for my first service and afterwards I noted huge multiple cracks in my windshield. I informed the front desk clerk Abi who just acted inconvenience... The manager, Russell Geiger appeared just annoyed too after I had requested multiple times to speak to him from the start. He told me there was no way to determine when I got the crack it appeared to be caused from temperature change but I know for sure it want there prior to bringing in my car. I asked if they had cameras in their service area and he didn‚Äôt even answer me. I thought they were supposed to do a general inspection prior to taking the car so this sort of thing doesn‚Äôt happen???? Also come to find out there is damage to the windshield wiper right on top of the area. They pulled up the blade when they were inspecting so I really didn‚Äôt even notice it but it‚Äôs clear as day in my picture that I took at the dealership and when I get home and reinspected the area. They told me it would be under warranty but seriously???? What a headache and to be made to feel like I was lying about it or I am just plain stupid is not right.",2.2

34,"August 30, 2018","Rodrigo Duron, Jose Luis Zarate, and Jonathan Sepehri were the best. There was a feeling of no-nonsense getting straight to the bottom line and answering all of our questions along the way. They were educated about the vehicles that they were selling. There was absolutely no pressure at all during the entire process. We were happy knowing that we got a great product at a fair price. I have recommended these individuals highly to all of my friends and family and will continue to do so in the future to all of my clients. It was an overall great experience. Thank you from the Alarcon Family.",5.0
35,"July 21, 2018","Responded to Casa Kia FB ad for new 2017 Kia Forte S. Sales rep called me & said he had a better car, amazing deal:  2017 new Forte EX loaded, less than 2000 miles, never titled, $16,000.  Went to dealer same day July 19, sales rep I spoke on phone with handed me off to Jose Luis.  Drove car with him, went to his office, & he walked in & said I‚Äôd gotten the deal of the year, nearly $10K off the car, $16,995. I said we‚Äôre still $1000 off what the other rep told me.  He said he had a new 2016 Forte 5, never titled, he‚Äôd sell me for $16k. Or I could have the 2017 for $16,995.  Went back today, July 21, Jose Luis said another rep was trying to sell the car. I said ‚ÄúGood, every sales rep should be trying to sell it.‚Äù  I said I wanted to show my wife the one I drove.  He said, that one‚Äôs $22,000.  I said, no, it‚Äôs $16,995. He said, no, we made a mistake, it‚Äôs $22,000. I said ‚Äúwe‚Äôre done‚Äù and left.  

The Lowenfield family has built a reputation over 3 generations of honest dealing in El Paso, but this slimy way of doing business by the 3rd generation‚Äôs little brother‚Äôs sales crew  will catch up with them quickly. Slimy, dishonest, lying bait and switch. ",1.6
36,"July 19, 2015","My family and I were looking to buy a used car, and were treated as if we were high dollar buyers. VERY pleased with our sales consultant, Angel Alcala.  She went above and beyond to help us find the right vehicle! Our experience with the financial business manager, Maria Bell, was top notch! She was able to work with us to get payments that would fit our budget. We couldn't have done it without them both. WE WILL ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND INTEGRITY KIA TO OUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY.",5.0
