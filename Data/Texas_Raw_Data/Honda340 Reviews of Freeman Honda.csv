1,"August 18, 2019","Never felt more disrespected. The manager Yaman is skeezy as xxxx. Don't waste your time at this place. We went to check out a used vehicle, but when we went to talk pricing, all of a sudden the price was ""marked wrong"" and was actually 2k more than the sticker...that was printed on multiple websites (including their own), the paper tag on the vehicle as well as in their own system. If it was truly marked wrong, then why was it up for 5 days with the wrong price? You've made your bed, now lay in it, its not the customers fault that you'd lose money on the vehicle, that's on you. Also, Yaman, no one believes your 'blinged out' fake Rolex is real. Glad we didn't give them our money and will gladly take our business elsewhere. ",1.0
2,"July 16, 2019","I recently moved to Texas and needed to purchase a front license plate holder for my Honda. I called first to see if they carried what I needed and the guy quoted me a price of $13.00. When I arrived to purchased the plate holder, the total was 20+ dollars.  I spoke with the gentleman and mentioned the price I was quoted over the phone by (I did provide the name of the salesperson) and he quickly adjusted the price. They were so helpful!  One of the service representatives even had one of the guys to put on my new holder and my new Texas plates.  ",5.0
3,"February 07, 2019","Had my Civic in for warranty work (rattle from dashboard). Freeman Honda attempted 4 worthless repairs. Each time I received the car back they told me ""noise is gone"". But the noise was never fixed. On the 3rd visit I got the car back and it wasn't put back together. They left the lower air duct detached. Once again I go back because the rattle wasn't fixed. Talked to the Service Manager Mike Highlen and showed him the lower air duct wasn't put back together and he offered no apology. What a bad representation of customer service. WARNING: Do not bring your car here for service. They are incompetent and unprofessional. Freeman Honda Service deserves 0 stars. ",1.6
4,"January 19, 2019","I went in for an oil change and i was greeted with smiles as always. Every employee that i dealt with had always been helpful and they never take up my whole day.

6,"June 07, 2018","I traded in my Honda 2016 CR-V in South Florida that I have bought from Freeman Honda and I've contacted Freeman Honda to have cancel my extended warranty, they've asked all the information that they needed and after several weeks they have done nothing.
I been calling for several weeks to speak with any one in finance department even I have left messages and not luck, honestly I am very dissatisfied and disappointed with this service, sorry Honda company but this is not the way to treat a customer that just recently bought 2 brand new Honda vehicles.
Very disappointed and very upset for this situation and I hope that someone from high level office could read this.
Thank you.

23,"November 16, 2017","I went to the Freeman Honda service department to get an oil change, filter and tire rotation. As soon as I pulled up, Anthony Contreras, the service advisor greeted me, addressed my issues, quoted me a price and told me that my wait would be about 1-1.5 hours. In the customer waiting area, there was a TV, bottled water, coffee, tea and a vending machine. After about 30 mins, Anthony came out to explain the service I'm receiving, told me the condition of my car and offered an upgrade service (but I declined it). Shortly after, my car was ready to go. And, they gave me a complimentary car wash!",5.0

25,"November 13, 2017","I went to Freeman Honda on a rainy day thinking it wouldn't be busy and they werent.  My service guy, David Bulkeley greeted me and I said I only wanted an oil change and nothing else. David noticied I was due for inspection so he suggested that since the car was there anyway.   He said it would take about an hour to an hour and a half and had Ernest drive  me home.  Almost to the minute, he called me and told me the car was ready but needed brake work.  I told him go ahead and do it since it was rainy and he had the car and I had no plans.  It seems whenyou bring in your car for general maintenance, they always find other things to get fixed thus running up the price but you have the option to decline.  It took over an hour for Ernest to pick me up as he had another customer and then went to lunch!   When I went to pick up the car David said I needed alignment on the tires, why they didn't tell me that BEFORE I picked up the car, I don't know.  I thought when you rotate tires, alignment was included.
Found out this is not done.  WHY NOT???????  Now I have to make another trip to get this done.  Not a happy camper about this.",4.6

30,"November 07, 2017","I recently had to ""jump start"" my new 2017 Honda CR-V. It kicked right over with the jumper cables, but several of the warning lights lit up the instrument panel. Everything seemed to be working properly but the lights stayed on. I was out of town, and had to drive 200 miles to get back home. All went well, but the warning lights stayed. on. The next morning, Sunday, the car started right off, but the warning lights still on. Monday morning I decided to go to the dealership; car started fine but the warning lights now OFF!
Dealer ran the diagnostics, reset the computer, and all seems well. Still no reason why I had to do the original jump!",5.0

",5.0
37,"November 01, 2017","My experience with sales was excellent as always!  My only issue with finance is I was presented with an in house warranty with a 100 deductible - I know that I will not use this dealership for service due to the service manager so I did not like that this was presented without discussing ALL options.  I did counter it with what I preferred and the deductible I wanted and that goal was achieved just wish that ALL options would have been reviewed rather than assume I would want to service my car there.  Maybe it was not intentional but because of my negative experiences with the service manager I took it personally in a negative way.   Don't get me wrong I love and trust the technicians & sales rep with Freeman Honda but again poor management has pulled me away as a service customer - I purchased my 2015 Accord here but once new service manager came in a little over 2 yrs ago you could see the value of service decline drastically and the overall morale on the service side was disheartening and visibly low; still is.  Aside from that as always a great experience with new car sales purchase & financing.  All the best wishes to sales Jeff Cole, Jose Arista-finance, techs we used throughout the years who are awesome: Manny, Eddie, David, Dave, & JoJo...:)  we will always be greatful for the service you provided us throughout the years!!",5.0

42,"October 28, 2017","I purchased my Accord from Freeman in 2009 and have experienced the same, consistent, great quality of service.

She gave me some very important  info. concerning some  safety features on my car , for which I am very thankful. Sabrina  was very patient friendly and patient with me as I asked here so many questions concerning my car. I was concerned that my car was made out of plastic and dents very easily, which caused a very serious issues for me. I barely backed into a plastic trash can and it dented my  car, so frustrated. This is my third Honda and this has never happened to  my other Honda's. The hail didn't bother her 1998 car, but ore my car up, saddened again, but Sabrina encouraged me in how my Honda has safety features that if I have a serious car accident that my engine would drop to the ground instead of coming back into the car to cause more serious injury, and that the lighter materials the car is made of helps with better gas mileage.  Her good info helped calm some of my fear concerning my car.  Sabrina definitely was a great and helped my experience at Freeman Honda.  I still have some concerns. Thank you Sabrina

I understand mother nature isn't the most considerate force, but transparency would have gotten them a lot further with me. For me to drive over and view the car I wanted and see all of that damage was ultimately disappointing. And to observe other cars, and saw MORE hail, therefore MORE disappointment.

I took my 2005 Honda Pilot to Freeman Honda for the 125,000 miles service on February 24, 2017.  I felt that I received top level service from the dealership and specifically from my Service Advisor [David Bulkeley].  Very friendly environment and courteous personnel from the moment you drive your car in to the time you check out.  They originally offered me shuttle service from and to the facility but a loaner car became available and my Service Advisor walked up to me while I was waiting for the shuttle service and offered the loaner.  I was quite surprised because I did not even ask for a loaner.  

David called me later in the afternoon and advised that he would need additional time to complete the service of my vehicle and graciously told me to just keep the loaner until the service was done.  I received a very detailed description of the services that were performed and felt like I got the best value.  I would highly recommend this dealership for all my future service needs.  My battery started giving me problems today [April 12, 2017] and I immediately said that I was going to take it back to Freeman Honda for the service.

I called him at 0900 hours over the phone and told him exactly what I wanted and what my requirements were. By 1630 that evening, he had exactly what I needed and was ready for me to drive off. I made it into the dealership, they did not waste time with trying to upsell me or talk me into putting more out for the car. They met all my needs and exceeded my expectations. The total time spent in the dealership was less than two hours to test drive, complete the financing paperwork, and leave after my car was detailed. I have never had such a great experience before. My previous car was a 2004 Honda Accord. They took the time to educate me on the new technology and made sure I was comfortable with the vehicle. Previous to purchasing at Freeman in Dallas, I shopped at Vandergriff in Arlington, Honda of Burleson, and Honda of Fort Worth, with nothing positive to say about those expericences. I have since recommended Freeman Honda to all of my collegaues in Dallas and Tarrant County...Thank You Freeman Honda, and especially thank you to Mr. Wyman King. You have restored my faith in dealeships and I will definitely be back in the future.",5.0

302,"December 30, 2014","I had been a customer of this Honda dealership for all my repair work since 2005 but I won't go back.  Several experiences in the last 2 years that are very poor, and in my opinion dishonest.  Most recently I brought my car in for an oil change because they sent me a coupon for $26.95 with the note slightly higher for synthetic oil.  As my hybrid uses synthetic oil, I asked about the slightly higher price, but never got a response that was legit...like quoting an accurate price.  $60 is slightly higher...uh that's more than double the price!  Not slightly higher.  I spoke with the service manager about it who said, oh well there's a discount of $6, so we owe you $6...which I've never seen, but regardless, a $6 discount off $60 isn't slightly higher than $26.95.

The inspection they do showed that I needed ""immediate"" repair on features not on my car.  They also claimed I need an overall on my transmission cause it leaks.  Really, why am I not seeing anything drip from it on my driveway or other regular parking spaces?  But the service manager wanted me to bring my car down so he could show me the leak...what after spraying some tranny fluid on the underside of the transmission?  I detest thinking that way, yet after the double talk I heard form the service agent and then this service manager, I don't trust them.

On a prior visit for repair, they attempted to charge me over $500 to fix a problem with the passenger side front seat belt.  Just about threatening me that they wouldn't allow me to drive my car without this work being completed.  Really?  They backed off and did it under warranty after I pointed out that they needed to go check their records as they had worked on the front passenger seat belt issues twice already.  

Further, when I emailed the service manager about the lack of recall work done to my airbag...no response.  Now I go online to find out that there have been 3 different recalls on my airbag/car one of which dates back TWO YEARS  and they haven't done squat about when I've brought my car in for service..

I don't know what happened to this dealership, but they didn't treat me this way when I first started going there...I believed I was getting good service for a dealership price..  Now it seems they will attempt to get you to spend as much money as possible on repairs that may not actually need to be performed.  

If you still need to frequent a Honda dealership, I' would suggest getting second repair quote from another Honda dealer...not associated with Freeman Honda.",1.0

Keep reading for the whole story:  
My mother and I went in to buy her a new car. We did so. Upon the purchase of the vehicle, we were told my mother could probably qualify for a second purchase; a lease. We went ahead and continued the process because of ONE REASON: We were told by a salesman (name has been concealed for his protection) that we would receive FREE MAINTENANCE on our lease for the life of the lease.  The first maintenance came along on the leased vehicle and it turns out that I HAD TO PAY FOR THE MAINTENANCE.  On the second maintenance I went to talk to the salesman to ask why I had been charged for the first one, he said he would get my money back but first we went to talk to the guy who did the financial paperwork and financing. He said that they offer no free maintenance on ANY vehicle. And blamed the salesman as he took himself out of the situation.  The salesman then explained that the sales team trainer was the one who had been telling the sales team to assure people they would receive FREE maintenance on their leases. This has been going on for over two years apparently.  Next, me and the salesman proceeded to the service department for the refund for the first maintenance.  The service department was rude and called me a liar for saying the first maintenance was given prior to the date I specified (Even though I had the receipt). AFTER they checked their systems they found that I was right and sat there with there faces glazed over in stupidity.  They then proceeded to tell me that the car i had bough as a NEW CAR LEASE was actually not a NEW CAR. Instead it was a car that had a ""wrong sticker."" They did a no-cost maintenance request that took an HOUR.  By this point I was fed up and went to find a manager.  The manager was no help either and he never came back out to apologize for the situation or anything of the type.   

IN OTHER WORDS. THIS PLACE SOLD ME A NOT-NEW VEHICLE ON A LEASE WITH PROMISED FREE MAINTENANCE AND ACTUALLY GAVE ME A USED CAR WITH NO FREE MAINTENANCE AND A GIANT HEADACHE.

He actually LISTENS to the customer and treats them like human beings. He doesn't treat you like he is doing you a favor by selling you a car, which other dealers do.

I recently purchased a 2014 Honda Accord EXL-V6 from Freeman Honda and it was the most pleasant experience I have ever had.  Michael Allen was my salesperson.  I cannot say enough about his professionalism and his courteous manner.  Prior to the purchase of my vehicle, I searched the internet for the best deal.  Many dealers such as Vandergriffâ€™s Honda, Huggins Honda, Frank Kent Honda and the list goes on proved to be nothing but CROOKS!  They all wanted me to purchase a Honda Accord with various trims which would increase the selling price by hundreds of dollars.  When I tried to explain to them that I was not interested in these various trims they all stated that was not possible and I would have to purchase the vehicle as is.  Needles to say I told them what they could do in a very polite manner.  They all consistently called me and emailed  on a regular basis encouraging me to consider their offer.  Finally, Freeman Honda (Mike Allen) called and after some extensive dialogue convinced me that they could satisfy my request.  Mike was so easy and pleasant to deal with.  First and foremost he was HONEST.  I felt very comfortable and relaxed.  I felt no pressure to buy from them.
Everything that I requested he confirmed via emails.  The whole process was effortless 
and hassle free!  I didnâ€™t even have to go to the dealership to purchase my vehicle, everything was done over the phone.  My car was delivered as promised to my house which I thoroughly appreciated.  If I ever have to purchase another car it will be from Freeman Honda thru Michael Allen.  Kudos' to you Mike !",5.0

Freeman Honda offered me a great deal on my car (including all the add-ons that I needed), for hundreds of dollars less than what other Honda dealerships were offering me. I live in West Texas, and had sent out e-mails requesting only e-mail price quotes from Honda dealerships in North Texas, West Texas, Austin and San Antonio. Many Honda dealerships refused to commit to an out-the-door price quote in writing. Most of them kept calling me, despite my request to only be contacted by e-mail. A few dealerships, including one in Fort Worth, refused to honor their word although they had advertised that they would beat their competitorâ€™s price. Jeremy Bilbo, the car salesman at Freeman Honda, was the only car salesman who respected my need to be only contacted by e-mail and provided me with a great out-the-door e-mail price without much negotiating. He was very prompt in responding to all my e-mails and answered all my questions very satisfactorily. Within a week of first contacting Mr. Bilbo, I was at Freeman Honda ready to buy my first car. They honored their e-mail price and the entire process of buying the car was unbelievably quick and pleasant. Furthermore, all my requested add-ons were installed very quickly.

As another person also drives this vehicle periodically and she often relies on the low fuel indicator light to let her know when to gas up, I wanted to be sure this function was working. Anyway, I drove the vehicle down to a very low level and then brought it into Freeman Honda to inspect. Jerry Gibson, the Service Manager got involved and he personally drove the vehicle to get the indicator light to come on. His attention to taking care of my perceived problem was exemplary, to say the least. I learned a number of things from this experience:  1) Freeman Honda was exceptional in providing 5 star service to me. 2) Don't believe the on board computer on any vehicle because it works on averages and not real life. 3) Gasoline pumps don't always provide accurate information as to how many gallons of fuel are actually dispensed!  4) A Honda is an excellent investment, from the standpoint of support from Honda USA, and the dealer network, especially Freeman Honda.  I had tried to get this problem resolved with two other Honda dealerships, David McDavid, in Irving, and Santan Honda, in Gilbert, AZ, and they did very little in comparison to Jerry Gibson, and Freeman Honda.

315,"July 13, 2012","My experience started out fine with Freeman Honda, and ended very badly! I went in just to look at the 2012 Accords and their features. Salesman Patrick introduced himself and asked me if I wanted to buy, I told him no, that I was just looking. I arrived to the dealership around 6pm, and I didn't leave until after 10pm that night. They let me test drive and look at a few cars, told me they could get me great deals. Took my keys to appraise my car, sat me down and threw all these numbers at me. First Patrick asked what monthly payment would I like to pay to have the car. When I told him, he gave me a number, I said no, let me just have my keys back so that I can go home and think about it. Then the salesman switching started. Everytime I told Patrick no, another person would come out and talk to me like they were authorized to give me a better price. I think I said no for 2 1/2 hours asking for my keys back. Finally, they gave me an awesome number and deal that I agreed to. When I drove off the lot that night, I knew I wasn't happy with my purchase or the car. So, the very next day I took the car back, and informed the finance manager that I didn't want the car, and to give me my car back. This is when all the customer service went out the window. All of a sudden, I was told, my car was gone and sent to auction, I couldn't return the car, it would ruin my credit. I still gave them the Keys to the car, and asked to speak to the GM. When I got into his office, he told me, ""This isn't Walmart, you just can't bring stuff back."" ""In order to reverse this paper work, you will need to write me a check for $1100.00 for all the fees assosiated with cancelling my paperwork."" I couldn't believe how horrible they were being to me. Plus, they were insisting that my car was already gone to auction and they couldn't get it back. So, I went from a 2006 Honda, to a 2012, to no car at all. The GM said they would try to see if the auction still had my car, and would let me know Monday. By this point, I was done with everyone at Freeman Honda and their rudeness. My father ended up calling up there and speaking to the GM and threating to call the police, the BBB, and the news because of the bullying and horrible service they were providing and the way they were treating me. Before the end of the day on Saturday, Patrick called me and informed me that the GM spoke with my father, and that I wasn't happy with my car, so I could come up to the lot and pick any car on the lot with the same deal they offered me for my first car. I don't understand why they didn't try to work with me in the first place, it took threats, and 3rd parties. I have never experienced car buying like this in my life, and I am on my 5th car. My only advice would be, not to let them bully you into buying, and KNOW what you want, and don't give them the keys to YOUR car unless you know you don't want them back.

I visited several different car dealerships and was astonished at the shocking lack of knowledge and professionalism exhibited by their staff and in their own products. Being a life-long car fan, I like to deal with guys who share a passion for their trade.
Being told by a car salesman that the piece of over-priced crap they are attempting to sell you is ""better than that what you wanted"" or when asked what size the motor is, being told ""it's a 6 cylinder I think"" is the fastest way to lose my business. 

Not so Freeman Honda - both Skip and Jose are a pleasure to work with in buying a car. Both knowledgeable and receptive to working with you to agree a deal.

I secured a 2009 Honda Civic coupe from them several months ago and it drives like a dream. It was a clean, honest car at the right price.
All staff at the site are friendly and also willing to take the time, treating you as an individual not just a potential sale.

As with anything folks, do your homework before buying. Check the website, check the CARFAX report, drive the car extensively - does it pull under braking, make any noises on full-lock, color of the engine oil, get on your hands and knees - what does the chassis look like underneath, does the interior look consistent with the mileage, do the door lines look straight... bounce each corner, do the shocks rebound once only. Would you honestly buy the second most expensive purchase in your life without being confident?

I'm now in the position of buying a second car and whilst I've wasted time visiting other dealerships with apparent bargain buys, it's to Jose and Skip I turn to again!

331,"April 01, 2010","We were looking for a car for my daughter for college.  With college expenses looming, we really didn't need to spend too much money.  Mike Allen at Freeman Honda was our salesperson.  He treated us very well.  He never pressured us, and never rushed us.  He also treated my daughter respectfully and like an adult, and she really appreciated that.  (So did I.)  He answered all of our questions honestly, and was just a pleasure to work with.   Also important - the price Mike quoted was the price they honored when I went in to buy the car.  Overall, it was the best, easiest, and least stressful car-buying experience I ever had. 

In contrast, another Honda dealership, when we test-drove the car, treated us badly.  They descended on us in a group as soon as we entered the door, and pushed-pushed-pushed us.  They were condescending towards my daughter, and neither one of us liked that, either.  So...Freeman Honda got a sale.  And they earned it.  They will be on my short-list for our next car. ",5.0
332,"March 26, 2010","I am a customer of Freeman Honda and have been for 2 years and am very pleased with it. I was taking in my '95 Civic LX (4 Door) for maintenance and repairs before I bought a Car Max Certified '07 Accord LX (4 Door) and traded in my '95 Civic. I am currently taking my '07 Accord LX to Freeman Honda for maintenance. I highly recommend Earl Hansen as a service advisor because he is very friendly, professional, and clear. I recommend Freeman Honda. ",4.6
333,"March 09, 2010","Because of the availability of the Honda CRV I did have to order my vehicle. And Jeff followed up with my weekly to let me know the progress in how soon my CRV would be here. He was friendly and very effecient and there way no wait when my vehicle came in and I was ready to go. I would recomment Freeman Honda and Jeff Cole to help with their new Honda purchase.

334,"February 20, 2010","Worst experience.

Bill and Mike were very kind and nice people.

The general manager Floyd was a joke. He walked in when we were signing the deal and said some crap...so we backed out of the deal.

Very bad service and they were making ugly comments and talking non sense right in front of customer service

I would never suggest anyone to go up there as they are crooks and not fit to be in business

i wish Honda sees this and black mark them so that they dont deserve the business.

Please dont buy the car from Freeman Honda --if you value ur money..

335,"January 19, 2010","One simple word --- Dont go to this dealer- Floyd whose supposed to be the manager of Freeman Honda has no courtesy, manners or dignity. He's the worst person to be doing business with. Told us when we were ready to sign the deal that he did not want to sell the car - as he had found another customer who will be paying to pay more--- I wish the owner of this company can see this and atleast call to find out as a customer service.

No wonder there are so many bad reviews --- we should have thought abt it

The only 2 people who were great at their service was Bill and Mike---- 

Floyd should be removed from this post as if he runs this business he's gonna crash it

336,"December 28, 2008","We were looking for a 2008 Honda Odyssey.  I worked through the internet sales department via email becauase having been through the typical ""game"" at a dealership, I thought maybe the ""no haggle"" process could actually be true. Worked out an email agreement with the guy for price and financing at 0 for 60 which they said they would do(assuming our credit qualified--we are in the top 90% for credit--Super Prime Plus so should not have been an issue).  Tried to have everything worked out beforehand so we could just go down and make the purchse.  Forty five minute drive down there with wife (who has no patience for dealer bs).  Met with internet manager, picked out the car (they had about five of the same one), test drove it, had our old car checked out for trade in (this was the one unknown--if they didn't give me what I wanted $3k I would have just wrote a check and sold privately), the key to us was having price and financing worked out beoforehand.  Sat down with interent manager and brought out the financing vs. lease sheet.  I asked what that was for as we already had everything worked out.  Then came back estimating payment to be 600 a month--wrong!  They try to get you to focus on payment and don't lay out specific terms.  I said we already have worked all this out.  The internet sales guy waffled and went back to the finance guy.  He came back and said that the way they can do 0 for 60 was to buy down the rate (IOW take the difference from somewhere else:  price or trade).  I said ""no--that's not what we agreed to"" and we started toget up and leave.  He said let me go tell the finance guy--he then came out to do his spin bs.  He tried to get me to focus on the amount of payment per month I showed him the email trail where we laid out the terms and said I want that.  He said if he got the payment to $400 per month w/out regard to financing would that work--I said yes as long as its a sale (not a lease) I dont' care where you take the difference from--$400 a month works out to $24,000 which was the amount we wanted to finance.  He came back with $450 for five years--$3k more than we agreed to so we left.  Same old sales spin bs--not honest with details from online quote. Avoid.",2.0
337,"April 07, 2008",Salesman tried to tell me that it was against the law for us to talk any numbers without him checking my credit first.  He's a liar.,1.5
338,"December 27, 2007","I had an excellent car buying experience. My salesman was Efrem Robinson, and he may be young, but he was very friendly, and not a hard pressure salesman.  I got the car I wanted at the price and I wanted, after careful research I discovered that the price was already under market value, but they still wanted to make me happy.  Everyone from the time I stepped out of my vehicle, to the finance manager, and then on to the sales manager, I was very well pleased with the friendliness of all of the staff, and the excellent customer service that was portrayed there.  Will do business with again in the near future!",5.0
339,"August 07, 2007","Had an agreed-upon price for trade and for the new truck, APR and credit was all approved. Demoed the truck for 2 days to make sure it was what we wanted. When we got back they bailed out at the last second and tried to force us to pay more money. Completely unprofessional. I couldn't be more displeased with the way this transaction went.",2.0
