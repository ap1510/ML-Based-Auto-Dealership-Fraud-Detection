Everybody (auto dealers ) tried to lowball the value. They all offered on price then dropped the offer by thousands. Mr. Boscoe Deas treated me with the utmost respect. The offer i  got was only lower by $300. Fabulous people and company.",5.0

2,"October 05, 2017","I purchased 6 vehicles over many years from this dealership. I don't understand how anyone could write a bad report about their sales, customer service, body shop, finance department or anything else dealing with Monument Chevrolet. From when I had to have a small budget to the more expensive rides they have always managed to get me in a dependable vehicle and helped me maintain it till it was time to trade it in for an upgrade. I ask anyone who wants a great car at a great price to give them a chance.
Now, In regards to the service department, Bill and Keith are second to none in the way they take care of you and treat you. Monument's service techs are top notch!!! They wont over charge you by getting you to pay for things that don't need fixed. Also, always get the job done fast and right.",5.0
3,"January 16, 2017","Just purchased a vehicle this Saturday - Jan 14 - 2017.  Flew in from Amarillo and did a basic test drive.  All checked out well.  On the way back home I found two issues with the car - busted back speakers and the heater did not work.  I informed the dealership and they said ""bought as is"".  The issued was found about 4 hours after I purchased the vehicle and they cannot help?  Will try to speak with the manager today (Joe Jensen).  I texted the salesperson (who by the way was awesome) and he has informed the manger but the manager stated to him ""Bought as is"".  WOW - what a disappointment!  It's funny on how many times we communicated (also instantly) before the purchase, and now that I call, I can't get Mr. Jensen to return or answer my calls.  If we cannot resolve, will probably go to the better business bureau and file a complaint.",3.0
4,"December 22, 2016",I had the privilege of getting my chevy truck repaired and fix by their body shop. I believe the guy who helped me was Dustin Cole. He had unbelievable customer service and insured me that he will get my truck back to me in a timely manner. To my surprised he kept his word and exceeded my expectations. Thank you all for a great experience and great customer service. ,4.6

7,"August 16, 2016","I used internet to get information about a Silverado LTZ 4x4 truck.  I confirmed that I was on the way to the dealership to see the truck and arrived 30 min after my confirming phone call. When I got there, no such truck was available and the Internet sales rep was no where to be found. I wasted 2 hours driving to and from this dealership. The sales person that did talk to me was not helpful at all and could not show me anything else with similar features. I suspect that she did not think I could afford such a truck.   Funny, because I could pay cash for anything on the lot. ",1.0
8,"July 27, 2016","My check engine lite came on in my 2012 impala, a computer check revealed the catalytic converter
was bad, the technician said it should have a 100.000 warranty on it. I( took it to monument chevrolet
and relayed the message to the service writer he asked how many miles was on it I told him about 80.000 he got in and checked and said it was 81885 he said he would haft to keep it overnight to be sure it was bad I said ok. The next morning he called and said the converter was bad but it was out of warranty I said do not fix it would pick it up. When i went to pick the car up there was a 109.00 dollar
charge on it.I was enraged, he new It was out of warrenty when he looked at the odometer yet he let me believe it was in warranty so he could cheat me out 109.00 dollars.The service manager came out
and said if i would leave it overnight he would call GM and see if the would warrant it. The next morning he called and said GM would pay 1/2 if i would pay the other 1/2 I asked what my part
would be he said 350.00.a replaid do not fix. i paid the 109.00 picked my car up what a trash can monument chevrolet turned out to be.    BEN BOIKE

10,"October 29, 2015","Just add my wife and myself to the long list of frustrated, mistreated customers. And the hollow, empty and insincere attempts by GM Bryan Hardman to make it look like he cares about each complaint. The fact remains the number of complaints are very telling and it seems Mr. Hardman appears to have a full time job apologizing. Why not address the issues that seem to be chronic problems at your dealership? I guess that is just a concept that eludes management at Monument Chevrolet. I felt the people I dealt with were deceitful and could care less about how the inconvenience they had caused us by their incompetence. We recently purchased our vehicle at this location so we thought we would be treated (in their words) like, ""Monument Chevrolet Family."" Well no thanks. This dysfunctional, uncaring family will get no more of our business. ",1.6
11,"July 10, 2015","If only yelp had negative stars… Very disappointed in the way my husband and I were treated today at Monument Chevrolet service department. I had made an appointment to get some recalls fixed on my 2012 Chevy Traverse. My husband and I both called to confirm the appointment as well as getting a loaner/rental car, while the repairs were being made. It was not communicated to my husband or myself that if your car was out of warranty you would not receive a loaner/rental.  The Service Manager (Danny Barnett) told my husband that he could leave his office because there was nothing he could… that he had listen to the phone conversation between my husband and the lady that made the appointment and she never guaranteed we would receive a loaner/rental.  Danny was very disrespectful and rude to us.   I have never know a service center to not give a loaner/rental while a recall or regular maintenance was being performed on a vehicle. This is very poor customer relations.   In the meantime, I have contact two other local Chevrolet dealerships, who are willing to give me a loaner/rental car while their dealership fixed the safety recall. I can say that monument has lost all my future service/purchase needs. I will never recommend this dealership to any friends/family/Co-workers etc. ",1.0
12,"June 10, 2015","This was the worst customer service I have ever experienced at a Chevrolet dealership. The service advisor never returned my calls and my car was kept at the dealership from Thursday when the work was done until Tuesday and the one item that they claimed was not on their list was never addressed. The oil change I requested, the incorrect oil was also put into my vehicle. I would never return to this place for service and I certainly would not buy a vehicle from them. Do yourself a favor and go to Davis Chevrolet and you will never go back to Monument Chevrolet again!!

13,"February 21, 2015","Summary (look below for details): Went in to look at / purchase a car but decided to leave and refuse to buy from there -  not because I didn't like the car or lacked the money, but because of their unprofessionalism, attitude and lack of respect to me as a customer and a person.

Full story: 

I saw an add on Autotrader 2 weeks ago,  but the ad didn't contain any pictures or much additional information. So I emailed them and asked for photos and information, just to make sure it was what I was looking for. Nothing after a week, so I email back to see if I could get the information. No response at all. After a few days, I decide to call and ask for the salesman to talk to him in person. He says that he will send the pictures the first thing next morning at 8:30. The next day, I receive nothing. So I decide to drive out there to maybe see the car in person.

I get there and walk in, and no one is around. I walked around to find someone to talk to and was finally led to a used car salesman. I told him that I've been trying to get more info about the car online with this other guy. This guy seemed very uninterested and acted, as if I was bothering his peace time. I go ask to see the car I'm interested in, and we go reluctantly. I ask questions and try to get more information, but he really does not seem

to care. I ask if I can go for a test drive, but he says that only after I commit to a price. *Why would I agree to a price before get to test drive a used car?* I'm also thinking he was BS'ing, because I *think* the manager came out at one point talking about it, and he shushed him off saying ""no it's okay"". Alas, I was interested in the car, so I said let's go in and talk prices. He left about 4 or 5 times, most of them without reason, for about 10 minutes at a time. 

Finally, he asked me about how I was going to pay, and I tell him that I've got my own financing with a federal credit union. Then he leaves again for 15 minutes, and I can see him chilling and laughing with (now I know) the manager while I'm waiting. He comes back with a printed piece of paper with the retail price and tax tag and title added up. 

Best part: I tell him we never negotiated a price. And I start telling him about details like how there is a seat with a cut, modifications, etc. and he cuts me off. He tells me, ""you talked to another guy before this. I'm not making any money off of this. Just give me the number."". I try to elaborate my situation with the price and I'm told, ""dude, I don't care, just give me the number"". 

By this point, I'm tired of waiting for BS and ready to walk out. I give a number, and refuse to wait in that cubicle anymore, and walk out. I say bye to the salesman, while he's playing games on his phone in the manager's office. At this point, the used car sales manager says he'll accept my price, and then starts giving the general BS about how it's going to sell this weekend because they're having a sale (on a weekend with all rain, good luck selling a sports car) and all that, even when I know it's been on the market for 3 weeks. I don't care about the sales techniques, though. 

All in all, I liked the car. I would have bought it, but I refuse to buy it from such a place where they treat people like this. Maybe I'm too principle based, but if they treat a person willing to buy a sports car without warranty like this, how are they going to treat people with family cars with warranties?",1.2
14,"September 17, 2014","My husband and I found a used F350 on Autotrader that was at this dealership. We drove all the way across Houston to go look at it. At first glance, everything was perfect with it. My husband went to drive the truck and during the test drive, the check engine light came on, along with 5 other lights on the dash. The speedometer went all the way to zero while he was driving. The sales lady (Esther) assured us that the vehicle would be completely fixed before they would sell it to us. The sales manager stated that he just drove the truck to get lunch and there was nothing wrong with it then. My husband said as long as all the problems were fixed, we would purchase it. The dealership service dept said it was throwing some transmission codes and they would have to send it to Ford to get fixed. We waited for 4 days and the truck was ""still at the Ford Dealership"" with no answer as to when it would be finished. My husband called the sales manager (Wayne) and threatened to buy another truck at a different dealership. He didn't seem to care but said we would get a call when the truck was ready. We realized then that someone (most likely the dealership) reset the computer and was hoping the lights wouldn't come on before someone bought it. They realized we were ensuring it would be fixed before we bought it and knew they already lost the sale.  The truck was listed $6,000 under bluebook and now we knew why. They obviously knew what was wrong with it and how much it would cost to fix. We realized we were getting taken and figured they were never going to call us and didn't want it anymore anyway so we found a different truck at a different dealership and are completely satisfied with it. We got a call a week later from Esther asking if we still wanted to purchase a vehicle. My husband played dumb and asked if his truck was ready. She said it wasn't yet and they were still waiting to hear back from Ford. Then he dropped the bomb saying he already bought another truck and she asked us to consider them in the future. Are you kidding me?!?",1.6
15,"August 08, 2014","I should have read the reviews before sending my wife to this dealership that wasted wasted her time. What would be a simple transaction at any other dealership was incredibly complicated, time consuming and in the end, pointless. my wife informed them she was on a deadline as she had to be at work in 4 hours, she picked the car she wanted and filled out the paperwork for financing. Before the paperwork was complete my wife was informed that she needed CASH, cashier's check or money order for the down payment (after 5 on a Friday). My wife rushed to the bank and managed to get the money out. Then proceeded to wait for a couple more hours while they processed the financing. As my wife's deadline for leaving quickly approached and everything was ""approved"" they casually mentioned they they couldn't let her drive the car off the lot until she showed them proof of insurance...with the car she was trying to purchase on it.

I don't know about you, but in 25 years of buying cars I have always been able to write a check for the down payment; proof of insurance has always been required, but not with the vehicle I was purchasing on it before driving it off the lot. One thing for sure, I'm not leaving cash for 50% of a vehicle without taking that vehicle with me. This dealership uses the kind of high pressure sales tactics that gave car salesmen a bad name back in the '80s. Don't go here if you want an honest deal or a good car buying experience.",1.8
16,"March 17, 2014","I bought a new car there. Although they tried to sell it to me at the MSRP price, I negotiated the purchase down to the price that Edmunds considers the ""fair price"".

Afterwards, I noticed that my paper work showed several hundred dollars that was added on, in fees and ""extras"". That's above the expected taxes and registration/title fees. None of these fees and options were ever discussed.

VIN etching, loan insurance and ""documentation fee"" added up to nearly $600 alone. And there were plenty more. They'll work their best to screw you over one way or another.

The finance department was a nightmare. They sold me stuff I did not want and it took forever to recover my money.

18,"February 06, 2012","My wife & I bought a Suburban from them Saturday. They were by far the easiest dealership to do business with from all the dealerships I contacted in Texas. In my search I contacted over 20 different dealers, and none of them even came close to the level of positive communication I got from Scott, and Monument's price beat everyone else by a wide margin. He explained the process to me clearly, answered 100 questions, and ordered the exact vehicle I wanted. The rest of the folks at Monument were just as pleasant to deal with, from the salesman to the finance guy, it was a very easy and painless process. I drove 150+ miles for this vehicle, and I'll do the same again for my next Chevy.",5.0
19,"September 22, 2011","I will never ever ever do business with Monument Chevrolet again! Been trying to get my car repaired for about 3 weeks now. Was treated like a number from the beginning, no customer serivce (had to intoduce myself to find out the guys name that was going to help me get my car repaired)   Called twice trying to get an update on my parts (no call back) and had to call THEM a third time to find out my parts were already there so I could drop off my car. Finally dropped it off on Tuesday, was supposed be ready today and what do you know, crappy paint job. Even as small as it was, still very noticeable.  Gee I wonder what will happen next!",2.0
20,"September 14, 2011","Just bought my 9th car from Monument Chevrolet.  The 2011 Traverse is a dream car, and Monument is a dream dealer.  I am always treated as royalty and like I am their only customer.   I trust Monument Chevrolet.  Their salesmen, their service and body shop are all run with such pride.  And the facility is gorgeous!  ",5.0
21,"August 02, 2011","Our experience with Lupe (Lopez  Suarez) was very good.  Not only did he prove excellent customer service as far as a dealer, but he also listened to our needs.  He went over and beyond our expectations.
We live in Conroe Texas.  He made the trip to Pasadena Texas worth the drive.

He proved GREAT customer service.

22,"March 14, 2011","My father bought me my 1st car here. A 2008 chevy and after 7 yrs it still works great. That is why my husband and I decided to have our 2008 chevy malibu serviced today for an oil change. We had before and never had a problem. Unfortunately today I did not experience great customer service by the staff. I wanted an oil change and all I got was an ""ok sign here"". My service advisor, Mr. Clower, mite be great at his job but is lacking great customer service and as a representative myself I understand how important it is so you can keep your customers coming back. After 3 hours of waiting, not once did he decide on coming to the waiting room and updating me on the status of my car. The wait was not the issue. The fact that there was no service or just to keep me posted would have lowered my anxiety as to what and where is my car?! I am saddened to say that I will probably not be returning.

Thank you,

23,"January 28, 2011","I am a single mother of 5 absolutely beautiful children.  I work hard to provide for my children.  I don’t receive any assistance.  I’ve had two failed marriages and a terrible string of bad luck along the way.  Yet I have been so blessed in my life to be able to keep my children in a lovely large home in a great neighborhood.  I have never been able to take them on vacation or buy them lavish things, but I spend every minute with them in sheer quality time.  I will never complain about the trials of raising them, I actually have come in my life to appreciate the opportunity to do it.

In trying to run my home and keep things in order, I decided that my 2003 Expedition was becoming a liability.  It was a large vehicle that once housed 6 of us.  Now my oldest is driving and there are only 5 of us now.  So it was becoming too much vehicle.  In its older age it was beginning to show signs of wear and tear.  My passenger side window would not go up.  The past winter mornings were trying for me and my two smallest children age 2 and 5.  The gas was another issue, I don’t think I need to explain any more except to say it got 10 mpg.

I decided to trade my faithful old truck in on a car. I shopped cars for weeks. One caught my eye. This beautiful white 2007 charger.  Since I am about to be 45 this year I thought it would be a perfect time for me to have a mid-life crisis and buy something that was a little sporty and edgy.  Beside my 14 year old convinced me I would be way cooler to drive this car.

The next day I was driving the car home with my 14 year old and my 2 year old.  We thought we were way cool!  And thanks to Theo and Jarrell (salesmen at Monument) we were!

Two days later my check engine light came on.  I became so concerned and found out that my cooling system was not operating properly.  I emailed Jarrell and asked, if anything, what could be done. You see I bought the car without warranty – “as is”.  Jarrell immediately set me up with a Dodge dealer to take my car in for servicing.  

It was found that the car has a very serious issue. It has been there for 4 days and will probably be there another 4 days or so.  The person who owned the car prior to me had overheated it at some point and caused major damaged to the engine.  Worse yet they masked it by making modifications to the thermostat.  I learned this from the Dodge dealer, and was very shocked when Monument called me with the very same news in apology.   However, the riggin of the car was not fail proof.  It was a really good thing that the check engine light came on at the time that it did...you can call it whatever you want. I think of it as another real blessing in my life.

Monument Chevrolet had no real obligations to me at that point.  I figured at the very most they would pay a portion of the repairs in good faith.  Let me tell you the MOST amazing part. Monument Chevrolet took full responsibility. They immediately with no hesistations agreed to pay all repair cost.  (which is now up to about $4,000.00!) Not only that Lisa, they were gracious enough to offer me a rental car – “for my troubles”

“Troubles”—I have none thanks to them!  They are the most honest and trustworthy dealership I have ever been to.  I respect the integrity of this place. I have been around long enough to know that people like Theo and Jarrell are the honest people they are because of the leadership they are under!  I think businesses like this deserve to be recognized.

24,"December 29, 2010","Through an internet inquiry, we received a quote for their ""best price"" on a 2011 Equinox in stock. It was indeed a very fair price.  After a pleasant test drive and a few negotiations on our trade-in value (a well-kept but well-used 2004 Honda Element) we were able to close the deal.  The sales staff and finance department were both extremely courteous and patient with us, as we worked through the whole process, while working past their 9:00 pm closing time. I must also point out that the entire facility looks modern, tidy, and fresh. An added observation is that the showroom area smelled particularly nice, akin to exotic potpourri or candles from Pier One. In summary: This was a simple, feel-good buying experience, and we will gladly reccommend Monument Chevrolet to friends and family. ",5.0
25,"July 21, 2010","NEVER NEVER EVER go here unless you want to waste a lot of time and get completely taken for an idiot. I was told they could get the exact vehicle I was looking for, they quote me a price online, so I applied for GM Credit, and when I got in they sat me there in an office for what felt like an eternity going watching the salesman click around the computer and go in and out of his office many many times, only to return and tell me he can't get me the car I was quoted. Funny, later that day I actually stumbled across the SAME car (same VIN#), and I called that dealership and YES its still available. I don't even want a GM now.

26,"April 29, 2010","I would recommended this Service Department from my experience with them so far.  Keith Clower who was recommended to me by Andrew Willard (also with Monument) was a great experience.  Keith took the time to understand my issues with a new car with warranty work needed.  I did not purchase this car from his dealership, but he still treated me and my vehicle as if I had bought it from them.  Even after the work was completed, Keith kept me informed via e-mail of the repair status and let me know pick up time via my phone.  Keith also help me understand the pickup process and walked me through it to speed everything up the next time.  I still have a minor problem with the car and contacted Keith and he was helpful in explaining what I can do and he will make it happen.  Even another vehicle I have a issue with he took the time to research and will assist in getting Chevrolet to repair this problem.  Again, if you want good customer service, then I recommend seeing Keith Clower, Service Consultant with Monument Chevrolet, Pasadena, Texas.  You will see that old fashion service still exists.",4.5
27,"January 17, 2010","On Sat 1-09-09 we just a few miles aways from Monument when our Impala went bad. We got it into the service are and parked it. We just moved here from the MIDWEST and do not have anybody here we can rely on in an emergency. It was 3pm. We went inside the dealership. THE HOURS HERE ARE OUTSTANDING!!! Thank GOD they were open. I was looking to get a rental. EVERYONE there was trying to find a car rental place that was open. No luck. Dennis and his staff went out of thier way to get us home! Our car was worked on Monday morning and we picked it up late that night! AGAIN GREAT HOURS! GREAT JOB!I will always come to this dealership for service. Hopefully never to have to buy for a LONG time, but will go here when we do.  ",4.8
28,"December 08, 2008","I drive a 08 Chevy diesel truck and I have a daughter that I am doing the drivers ed home teaching to so I had been looking for months for a small car so that she would have something more comfortable for her to drive and I could also share it with her and park my truck.  I would look on the internet at different dealership for used cars, I found a car I was interested in and talked with Keven Rey at Monument Chevrolet and went and test drove the car.  It ended up not being what I wanted and Keven told me he would keep in touch with me.  Keven would e-mail or call me periodiclly to see if I had purchased yet.  I had found a car I was fixing to buy but was really unsure because I found out it was a rental car, but I was really tired of looking.  I received a phone call from Keven and he told me he had found a car that I would love and it was in my price range.  We went and test drove the car and fell in love with it and bought that night.  I have purchased 5 new vehicles since 1999 and one of them was from Monument Chevrolet but this experience was by far the best I have ever encountered Keven Rey was THE BEST salesman ever I could tell he really cared.

29,"November 09, 2008","I have bought many cars in my life for business and pleasure. I would recommend Kevin Mcreynolds and the Monument Chevrolet dealership to anyone. I live 90 miles away and there were many dealerships closer to me but all the local dealers didn't or wouldn't get me the car I wanted. If I'm going to buy a car as much as they are now I want it to be exactly what I want. I took a chance and am so glad I did. Monument was so easy to work with and gave me the best price on the car it was worth my time and money to drive to Monument Chevrolet if you believe that customer service is gone in this world give Monument Chevrolet a try I think you will be pleased some places still have customer service.

When I had any problems, WC always made sure that every issue that I had was resolved or taken care of.  He really goes the extra mile for his customers, as that is a family owned business, and hopefully, everyone he employs will develop the same mentality that he has.  A great dealership to work with.
