0,"June 26, 2020","After taking my 2010 Corvette Grand Sport for a couple of issues, no work was performed on the car after sitting in the service department of 3 days and two nights. When I picked up the car the hood and both fenders were covered with a white baked on residue. When I approached management I was told they had nothing to do with it and that it was my fault. I don't think so. After many attempts with spot removers, polishes and waxes I managed to get it off. If you treasure your car, there are the options to pick from.

1,"June 08, 2020","I brought my 2015 Camaro here to have the stereo unlocked and apparently they don’t unlock stereos here, despite having the code they gave me to unlock the stereo when I bough it. Then they had the audacity to charge me $150 just to tell me they can’t fix my locked stereo, and that it would cost me around $1,200 to replace it. What an absolute joke. These people are con artists.",1.0

3,"January 29, 2019",I bought this 2012 Tahoe LTZ from Lakeside in June 2018. Have had nothing but problems since first month of ownership.  Called salesman because the vehicle started to erratically up and downshift while driving on highway and at same time the door locks would lock and unlock as if a child was playing. And same time my gage needles would go left to right continuously.  Then about two months ago the alarm just started to go off every time I parked it.  Now of all things the transmission is slipping. I have a hard time believing this is all related and an electrical issue.  Also the dash was doctored before putting it for sale. I noticed this when a month after I bought it the darn thing cracked like a dry lake bed. Now it squeaks constantly. It had dry overspray all over the dash area where the lot lizard patched it up. My big concern was when Dewayne the salesman said they have had no issues with the transmission going crazy and I find a entire forum on the subject by other owners. 58.000 new and I paid 25.000 when it is 6 years old. And I was told Certified used cars only applies to a few select. Humm. My 12 LTZ was on the front patio right out front. I'm very dissatisfied with this vehicle. By the way I live directly behind a Chevrolet dealership in Frisco. I choose to come to Rockwall based on your reputation.  Larry Smith Sr.,2.6
4,"August 25, 2018","Worst dealership EVER. Do not go here if you are looking for friendliness, Do not come here if you are looking for cleanliness, Do not come here if are expecting even a fast/easy service! Bob in service and the man who could barley fit himself in my vehicle are especially the worst out of all. Even when I told them give me my key to my vehicle they said to my face ""You will not be getting the key to your car back until I give it to you"" HOW DARE SOMEONE who doesn't pay for someone else's car or anything not gone you back your stuff when you are demanding it back EVEN IF YOU ALREADY PAID... BEWARE NEVER GO TO THIS DEALERSHIP!",1.0
5,"January 05, 2018",They have had my son's car for two days and still have not even looked at it to see what was wrong with it.  My son took it in on a late Tuesday afternoon and they told him they wouldn't get to it that day but really it takes 2 full days?  Today is now Friday and I still don't know what's wrong with the car.  They definitely aren't going to the be ones to fix it.  I will be picking it up today if they don't look at it and take it to Christian Brothers.  Thankfully my son hasn't needed to go anywhere.,1.0
6,"May 13, 2016","Bob Holliman was rude, used curse words and hung up on us.  You NEVER treat a customer this way.  If a deal can't be made, you shake hands, say no thank you and move on.  What a joke.  He behaved like an idiot.  I would never recommend this place to anyone and instead advise everyone to just go somewhere else.  Such a shame for the city of Rockwall.",1.0
7,"December 29, 2015","Tho whom this may concern:

I just want to report a bad customer experience I received at Lakeside Chevrolet in Rockwall, Tx.  I bought a certified Used 2014 Chevrolet Silverado Crew Cab 4WD Texas Edition from Huffines chevrolet in Lewisville, Tx. I also purchased a extended warranty as well. Shortly after I purchased the truck I noticed that the collision alert and Lane Departure was not working. It was not a necessity to get it fixed right away, so I waited for about 11 months and while i was on Christmas vacation, I had some time, so I dropped my truck off at Lakeside Chevrolet In Rockwall for Service to have oil change done and to have them fix the collision alert and lane departure issues I mentioned above. They had my truck for 3 days and they called me and said the truck was fixed, but ask me if the windshield has ever been replaced. I said that it has not since I have owned the truck. They proceed to tell me that I have a aftermarket windshield installed and they found the connection cables to the camera installed in the front windshield was unplugged and because the windshield is aftermarket, the labor/service will not be covered under my warranty and that I owed $59.17 for the repair. I am not trying to make a big deal about $60.00, but the whole situations just rubs me wrong. I bought a certified GM vehicle and just expected that I can take it to any cerified GM service center and I would be taken care of with issues I may have with my vehicle. The service advisor at Lakeside told me that if I had bought the truck from Lakeside that they would have taken care of the issue at no charge, but being I did not, I would have to pay the $59.17 that is due. Adviser stated if I wanted to be reimbursed, that I would need to contact Huffines where I purchased the truck and take it up with them... I did just that and spoke with the Service Manager Allen Moore at Huffines and explained what happened. Allen was very upset as to the way I was treated and apologized on there behalf and said that Lakeside should of fixed the issue at no charge, no matter if I have a aftermarket windshield or not.He told me to email him a copy of the invoice from Lakeside and that he would mail me a check to reimburse the $59.17. Allen Moore from Huffines was great, and I did receive a check as he promised, so I am very happy with the customer service I received from him... I just think that someone from Chevrolet needs to address this issue at Lakeside Chevrolet. I will never take my truck back there for service again.

They even gave us a full tank of gas;) Owner thanked us personally for our business. Won't get that in many stores,

10,"September 19, 2007","If you are a seasoned car buyer (buy an avg. of 2-3 cars per year) and ""know"" how to deal - DO NOT waste your time with the sales staff or management at Lakeside Chevrolet.
Old school sales tactics with dumbed down sales staff and unresponsive-
unrelated management makes for an unbarable experience.
Beware of paperwork/contract on negotiated numbers while dealing with Lakeside Management.  Lakeside Chevrolet mostly known for not standing up to their ""word"" and will back out of a deal with other unvalid excuses.  
Great dealership/business to visit and see what not to do when dealing with customers, especially if you own any type of customer relations type of business.
