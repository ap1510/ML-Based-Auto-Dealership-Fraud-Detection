9,"May 30, 2020",Kevin Barbour was professional while relating to me on a personal lever. Felt very comfortable dealing with him. Evidently because I bought a truck. Tried to deal with Waxahachie and Lewisville Ford dealerships but felt talked down to at both. Glad I could deal with Kevin. Probably will get my wife a car from them around Christmas. ,5.0

11,"May 17, 2020","I had been a customer of Southwest Ford for 22 years and intended to buy a 2020 F250. I had an appointment for 11:00 but stood at the reception area for 10 minutes before I asked someone if anyone worked there. I finally spoke to a salesperson as mine was unavailable and told them I was there for the trade in appraisal on the purchase of the F250 we had agreed on. After returning the car from the evaluation, I waited another 30 mins for the response. When he came out I asked for the trade in value which they refused to share. They told me they needed the payoff on the car which I told them was irrelevant. I told them I knew the payoff just tell me what you'll give me for the car on the trade in. Again, he refused and told me ""I need to know the trade in to make sure I give you the best deal"". I again asked for the trade in value and again he refused. Unbelievable that I was to trust him when he refused to be open with me on the numbers. I told him he had my contact information and when he wanted to share the information he could call or contact me. I walked out, went to Jack Powell Ford in Mineral Wells and drove off the lot in no time with a new truck.
I'll never use Southwest Ford for a purchase or service even though I've been a loyal customer for all these years. I told Jack Powell Ford, they are my new Ford dealership and expect me back for all of my service. Great folks, straightforward honest and upfront.",1.0

29,"January 24, 2020","Bought used truck.  They took almost three days to service the truck and detail before we picked it up.  Even though we were assured we'd go ""to the front of the line"" since this was a purchase.  Gum still in the cup holder, dirt still in the door latches, engine compartment never washed at all.  There was a water leak that i informed them about.  Told them specifically to check the rear marker light.  They picked the truck up to address all of these issues.  Got the truck back and was told they couldn't detail it because of personal belongings in the truck.  We were never told to remove anything before they picked the truck up.  Couldn't even wash the engine compartment because there was personal items inside the cab.  Was also told ""no leak found""...I inspected the truck myself and the marker light is pulling away from the cab.  The headliner is now water stained.  Tried contacting Southwest and was told...""well, the service department checked it out and didn't find anything.""  Basically...sorry about your luck.  ",2.2

34,"January 07, 2020","I get a letter to upgrade my GPS system.  While getting my oil changed I tell them I need it done but it will not download after spending $109 for it.  They weren't worried.  The service man tried to download using Ford's wi-fi.  Nothing going on there.  Suggested I bring it back in a week to see if they can fix it.  Take it back and same thing.  Was told they would now have to order a part to fix it under warranty.  Sent me home and will call me when they have the part.  Got a call to bring it in 3 weeks later.  Took it in this morning but was told no part was ordered.  The service man finally ""found the part"" but after a few minutes, the Ford website was down and probably could not download the software today.  Insisted on keeping the vehicle and seeing if it will finish downloading today. In the meantime, I am out $109 and sitting at home after three trips to the dealership.  Is it really that difficult?",1.0

39,"December 17, 2019",The person who wrote up my paperwork ( who I was told was no longer with the dealership ) failed to process all of the necessary forms. When I took in my vehicle to get the oil changed I was informed that I could not get it serviced because my name was not in their system as the owner of the vehicle. I had to request to speak to the supervisor over Ryan who had greeted me to write up the work. He was very insistent that I there was no way he could proceed with servicing my truck without the their registered owner being present. I had tried explaining to him that I had purchased the vehicle several month prior and had purchased a service contract at the point of purchase. He would not listen or attempt to verify what I had told him. I then asked more than once to speak with a supervisor which he was reluctant to do and kept saying that their was nothing that could be done to get my truck serviced. At my insistence he finally brought his supervisor out to speak with me. His supervisor was at first somewhat reluctant to proceed but as he dug deeper into their records he found that I had purchased the extended service package. In the end after almost 4 hours the did get the oil changed as well as replace the block heater cord that was on the Ford warranty recall. I have only given them 3 stars because of the hassle I had to go through to get them to look at their own records to verify that I had purchased the vehicle extended service agreement.,3.0

49,"November 10, 2019",Disappointed.  I was told I had a 0700 slot for AdvancTrac diagnosis which turned out not to be true.  Service Rep was lethargic in both keeping abreast of technician progress and contacting me on the correct phone number.requiring me to hitch a ride to the Dealer at 5:00 pm to get info on service progress.  The initial fault code for initiating service was still present when the truck was delivered to me the following day requiring return trip to Dealer.  The following day after driving truck home the faults reappeared.  Other than that (tongue-in-cheek) a delightful experience.,2.0

55,"October 16, 2019","I spent well over 2 hours waiting for the finance guy to get to me.  Then he was not totally honest about the service plan.  He kept stating that they use Synthetic oil.  Well the Motorcraft oil is a synthetic blend which clearly states that on the packaging.  I didn't realize this until I happened to see a jug of it at Walmart.  In fact Ford goes so far to use a font for ""Blend"" twice the size of ""Synthetic"" so even they know that you cannot market a Syn Blend oil as Synthetic.
Otherwise salesman was very helpful even though I changed my mind halfway through looking at vehicles.",3.0

59,"September 27, 2019","If you’re thinking about getting service done on you’re vehicle at this dealership, be prepared to get taken advantage of. To make a long story short, I drove my truck there expecting to just get a simple state inspection and was left without a vehicle for now over 70 days. They gave me the runaround about it needing a complete exploratory breakdown to fix whatever was preventing it to pass state inspection. Then proceeded to charge me $4,250.00 for their work and yet still unable to pass state inspection. I couldn’t imagine spending that much and still not have it inspected. So left it in their hands to get the necessary driving done (which i was told it needed in order for the computer to calculate it was ok for inspection.) In doing so, they had multiple people driving my truck around for well over 100 miles, god only knows doing what, and blew the engine. They now expect me to pay the $4,250.00 on top of over another $6,000.00 for a “ new” junk yard motor in order to fix my truck. So, over $10,000.00 now to get my truck back in running shape. All of this after just simply driving it there to get it inspected and be on my way. They now expect me to tow my truck home unless I agree to replace a motor they once claimed was fixed and totally repaired that they blew while driving it. This is a down right disgrace. You be the judge! If you plan on getting service done there, you better have a lawyer! ",1.0

I went to pick it up and was told they were only able to repair 1 recall issue because they DID NOT HAVE THE PARTS FOR THE SECOND ISSUE!!  Why in the world would they have me bring it n if they don’t even have the parts to fix the issue!!  That was a big waste of my time.  Now I will have to take it in again!!

72,"August 01, 2019",Purchased a New 450 KR super communicative until they had the sale. Had issues with the truck talked to the service guy they needed the tuck back. I told them I had to have back the next day since they were only measuring to see why the 5th wheel did nit fit. Service said no problem they should have back same day. the following day still had not heard back so 1 hr before they closed I started calling no one knew anything about the truck since he was not at work that day. had to go there find truck. Then a month goes by no contact. kept calling leaving messages no response. finally got someone to answer the phone and they started to track the people who knew after another 2 weeks nothing had to call that same person and push them more. Finally after 3 months they figured out the problem and it got fixed. During the process discovered the inverter did not work so when I dropped it off asked them to take care of it then. When I picked up the truck the inverter still did not work. Pointed it out while I was there they took it back and checked it out. Brought the truck back to me did not fix anything said it was working I tried to show them they just said oh well it works. 5 minutes after I left the tech tried the same thing in a different truck and well they called me to say they messed up there is a problem and would need the truck back to fix it. I called an left a message the next day to see if I could drop it off while I had time. Did not get a call back for another week  still have the same issue. ,1.4

74,"August 01, 2019","After going to SW Ford for many of years, I’ve decided to leave a review. Service department is sub-par. When you pull in their service drive, you might as well walk in and FIND someone to help you, or you’ll be standing waiting for quite a while. I use to always go straight to Charlie Mann, but it seems he isn’t there anymore and not a soul in the service department has a clue what their doing. The only reason I go is their prices, but I’ve come to the realization that I’d rather spend the extra $10 to have quick, polite service down the street that won’t take 2 hours for an oil change...

76,"July 24, 2019","My entire dealing with the service department at Southwest Ford In Hudson Oaks was the worst experience I have had with a car dealership. 

I called at 0700 in the morning to schedule an appointment to have my vehicle serviced. They told me they had an open appointment 0900. This was the first lie I was told. I dropped my vehicle off by 0730 and was told I would be called as soon as they found the problem. At 1530 I still had not heard from them, so I decided to call. My rep for the dealership was not available so I left a message asking for a call back with an update on my vehicle. After an hour and still no return call I called a second time. Once again I get voicemail. I leave a second message to get an update on my vehicle. Still no return call. So two hours after my first call and them having my vehicle for 8 1/2 hours I make my third call. Surprise I get voicemail again. So I left my third message. About five minutes later I get a return call from my service rep. He tells me they haven’t had time to look at my vehicle but it will be looked at first thing tomorrow morning. I will say I was mad and asked why do I need to schedule for an appointment if they don’t keep them. My service rep told me “it’s a third party company that schedules these appointments. They have no idea how busy we are or how long things take. So they cram as many appointments in as they can. He said my issues happens all the time.”  

So now it’s so late I don’t have time to pick it up and take it anywhere else that night. Since he promised it would be looked at first thing in the morning I left the vehicle there (my second mistake and their second lie). So once I again I don’t hear back from my service rep all morning. So at 1230 I call and surprise he actually answered the phone. He told me they were still looking at it and that’s all he knew. Know I usually work on my own vehicles but due to my busy work schedule and it being 100 degrees outside I took it to get repaired. So I know a fair amount about vehicles. The issue that I took my vehicle in for should not take a professional mechanic over an hour maybe two at the most to figure out. So once again I’m guessing they lied and didn’t start first thing in the morning. 

The service rep calls me back at 1430 and tells me they found the problem. He makes excuses of how hard it was to figure out and that why it took all day. I don’t question him and just agree. He then tells me they don’t have the part in stock and due to the late hour it will be tomorrow before they can get it. So now my vehicle will be there three days. Finally he tells my how much my total bill will be. A little over $700 (last and final lie). I tell him go ahead and fix it. 

So day three mid afternoon I miss his call and get a voicemail my vehicle is ready. Soon after I get a second and a third call from him. At this point I’m thinking wow you can’t call me back when you are not doing what you said you were. But man once my vehicle is done and you are ready for payment you have all the time to call me. 

So I go to pickup my vehicle. When I walk in my service rep is standing there talking to another customer. I stand there several minutes without him ever saying a word to me. After they just talk about a lot of nothing he finally greets me. He goes and gets my paperwork/ bill. The total was $75 more than what he told me the day before. At this point I’m done with them and just pay it without even saying a word (my fault for not speaking up).  

So he pulls my car around. As he is getting out and handing my keys, he ask hey would you like me to wash it real fast. I’m thinking maybe that should have been done before you called me to pick it up or before you drove it around. I tell him no thank you. He goes well anytime you want one stop by and ask for me. At this point I say ok and drive off.

90,"June 09, 2019","Just purchased our second vehicle from South West Ford in Weatherford Tx. And will continue to purchase vehicles from them. They have earned our respect and TRUST.  The latter being the most important. 
 The whole experience, from finding us a new Ford F350, working the best deal for us(I know was not easy), and treating us with respect, like family, and letting us know they were working for us, was the best vehicle purchasing experience we have had.
  I would like to acknowledge 3 individuals that I know make South West Ford the dealership it is. Blake Black, Mike Schumann, and Kevin Barbour. These three men made purchasing a new vehicle FUN! Blake is very personable, friendly, and makes you feel You are his only care. Awesome young man! Mike walked us through the financing and I truly believe went way over the Top in getting us the best deal possible. From financing to warrenties we felt like we were talking to our brother. He made the paperwork easy to understand, quick, and most importantly...FUN! Kevin made sure we knew all about our new truck and made us feel like what was important to us, was important to him. The best experience in buying a vehicle...EVER! We will recommend South West Ford to everyone we know! Thank you guys! All three of you make South West Ford our dealers for life. Thank you so much again.

115,"March 08, 2019","This is my 4th time to this dealership. The first time was for a purchase. They had no intentions of working with me on price, so I found another vehicle at a different dealership that was willing to work with me. However that place is too far from home for service. So I went to Southwest for some service items. Each time I have been more disappointed with the last. The place is disorganized! No one seems to ever know what is going on - who is your service agent, what are you here for, where is your vehicle?!? On one occasion, they promised me a loaner but when I got there they didn’t have one for me. So I had to reschedule. I sent in my car for some work on the air vents in the back, and they half way did the job by fixing the vents in the second row but not the third. So I had to go back again. The agents make me feel like I’m inconveniencing them instead of them being there to service my car. This last time, they had my car for a week with zero communication! I had to call and leave a message twice before I could get any information on what was going on. To top off everything, when you get the car back they don’t even bother to run it through a quick wash. How hard is that?? I will not be going back to this dealership or service department and would not recommend them to anyone!",1.8

I immediately scheduled an appointment and met with Devin and Hunter in the used car section.  They were warm and friendly.  They were not pushy and were mostly interested in providing a vehicle that met my needs.  Without much haggling, we made a deal on a vehicle. The deal required them to replace the windshield and tires.  I was concerned that I might end up with a type of tire that was not of the highest quality.  They told me that they would have to research the cost of  a new windshield and how to economically get this done with rain sensing glass.  I was a little concerned.  Incredibly, they put new top of the line $1000 Michelin tires on the vehicle and replaced the windshield at a cost of $1600.

That made me asa customer feel that I wasn’t just another number being met, but a person that he truly wanted to help. 
When it came to telling him what we need, he pulled up a nice 3 row seating car and we test drove it. Unfortunately, the numbers in this car didn’t match up with the budget we were trying to stay within. That didn’t stop him at all. He told my husband and I to hold on a few minutes because he believes he had something even better for us I our price range. Sure enough Hunter pulls up an even more amazing car and it was within the budget we were needing. 
He next step was ensuring we got approved for financing, however apparently my husband’s credit score had taken a major nose dive in the month since we last checked on it. This is when we were introduced to Blake. Blake and Hunter went to bat for us and got us a really good APR and we got the car. They even helped us make sure we got warranty for the car as well as the Sourhwest promise for oil changes and tire rotations.

I have a 15 Mustang GT with performance package, the back wheels and tires are taller than the front; this is standard from the factory. When they rotated the tires instead of rotating side to side, they switched front to back. When I picked up the car it was late and the service center was closed. I didn't notice their mistake when I picked it up, I should be able to trust that they know their product. Well after driving home and a quick trip to the corner store, my $1200 tires, rims, and the suspension is all messed up. There is rubber from the tires everywhere. I'm now going to have to miss time at work to get their screw up fixed. And this isn't a one time issue with this dealership, this their 4th expensive strike. They sold this car to me to make up for my previous mustang their body shop ruined. I miss how Southwest use to be, I've been doing business with this company since 2007, have purchased 4 vehicles from them, used their service center for all my vehicles, and their body shop several times; no more I'm done with them ruining my vehicles. Not to mention the people use to be really nice, not anymore, they seem to really hate their jobs and getting them to just answer the phone to make an appointment, good luck I called 6 times to make this last appointment. And for those of you wondering why I didn't just take it somewhere else, the tint on the back window (which was there when I bought the vehicle) was bubbling and I had to take it back to them to get it fixed, no one else would touch it.

I'll return when it's time to get another new one.

252,"August 04, 2017",Well I recently wrote a review about southwest ford that was to say the least scathing but once everything was said and done I came away with a different perspective. Now I'm not saying that I came away perfectly happy but since when is that at all possible in life. Me and the service department came away with an understanding that was pretty mutual. I am glad to say most of my confidence with southwest ford is reinstated. Their service department has really good management. I as well plan on doing my future vehicle shopping with them their sales department is second to none ,4.4

262,"April 14, 2017","I went in to purchase a new ford on 04/08/2017. I walked around on the lot for about 30 minutes before I just had to ask for a salesman. Then I picked out a vehicle and began to put the numbers together. 1st, they offered me $1,000 dollars less on a rebate than Ford was giving. 2nd, I told them I did not want the rebate I wanted to finance through Ford Credit and get the 0% interest for 66 months. the salesman came back to me and stated Ford does not have 0% financing on this vehicle. okay at this point I admit I should have walked out of this dealership, but instead I had him go to the Ford website and the salesman pulled up the Ford incentives and looked at me and stated see they do not have that incentive. I looked at him and said see the 2 tabs on the screen to the right, click on the middle tab and there it was a full page on the 0% for 66 months. 3rd, the salesman went back to the manager and returned and had the audacity to state, THAT IS NOT REALLY 0% FINANCING, THAT IS A FLEX BUY. I must have had stupid stamped on my forehead, I worked for Ford Dealerships for 20 years and I know what a flex buy is and this ford offer that Southwest Ford in Weatherford, Texas was refusing to honor and attempt to scam me into another financing scheme was pitiful. 4th, I know I am still there, just can't wait to see the next scam the pull out, so the salesman goes back to his manager and finally agrees to the 0% financing that was always in BIG BOLD print for Ford, But now the trade in value was dropped several thousand dollars, okay now I am walking out the door. Do not take my experience at the dealer lightly, their dishonesty with me was deliberate and they had no intention of honoring the Ford Financing. As I stated I was in the business for over 20 years and I understand why they were doing what they were doing and it was certainly not for the benefit or well being of their customers. I went down the road a couple of miles and purchased a vehicle and I can say I did not have to fight for the incentive deals from the manufacturer. BEWARE OF SOUTHWEST FORD....

264,"April 11, 2017","Kat Brownlee matched me to my truck. I had been researching exactly what I needed, a F-150 Supercrew (XL or XLT) 4x2, 5.0L V8. 3.55 rear axle with a tow package, trailer assist, and integrated brake controller (everything else is optional). I used two car buying services, TrueCar and USAA. She received the ping with TrueCar and I responded with my needs. My requests also hit more than 12 other dealerships not including the requests sent out through Autotrader. She is the only one that actually listened to what I needed. She worked her tail off while she answered a barrage of questions. Meanwhile, all of the other dealerships threw everything at me except the kitchen sink.  
My quest to find this truck traveled over three months whereby the DFW dealerships could only locate five trucks that met my specifications. So, the finalist came down to Kat vs. McDavid. I actually found two black XLTs (I didn’t want black), and one of those dealerships linked to the one Kat had (three total hits). The final two were on the McDavid lot, both XLTs. Unfortunately, I had to speak to FOUR different people at McDavid, none of which really knew what I wanted. They just wanted an appointment. However, I’m looking for a deal and not one to turn down an opportunity. 
Based on Kat’s dedication to customer service, honesty, and ambition, I gave her the first shot. I drove down for over an hour in heavy DFW traffic in the pouring rain. Like destiny, the skies cleared as I approached exit 411 in Weatherford. Kat had the truck pulled up as I arrived, walked me through the amenities, guided me on a test drive and scouted me through the numbers. Looking for the best deal, I told her I had to check out what McDavid had to offer, and I left. I managed about 10 miles before I texted her that I had turned around. The truck I’m about to buy has meaning, and trucks shouldn’t be emotional, but this one is equipped to tow a modest travel trailer for a family of four safely…because Kat listened. There was no denying Kat’s service at this point, the deal was done. I don’t know if she saw the text, because when I arrived she asked what she could do for me…I said I’d like to see the truck again. After a few moments, I said let’s do this!  I guess that McDavid really never stood a chance. As Kat said, these truck are metal and Southwest takes ownership in the customer experience….I partially disagree, they are a relationship and it all begins with the first impression! Kat nailed that and everything that followed. She is a true asset and our family thanks her!  
If you want to know how to earn my business, Kat knows, she is a true ambassador for the company.

As a wise man once said “I’ll be back”!

Thanks again Kat!

265,"April 11, 2017","Back in February we decided it was time to get a more dependable vehicle. We spoke with Earl Campbell over the phone and discussed our situation with him. We wanted a 2017 F-150 crew cab but Earl suggested a new 2016 due to better rebates. We live 170 miles from Weatherford, and after looking at similar vehicles at some nearby Ford dealerships, we definitely got the best deal from Southwest Ford. The 170 mile drive was worth it.
The entire purchase process was completed over the phone with Earl. The next day we drove to Weatherford and picked up our new truck. Earl came in on his day off to complete the sale. You just don't see that kind of dedication to customer service these days.When it comes time to buy another vehicle we will definitely be purchasing from Southwest Ford.
Earl.....we are sorry for the long delay in posting this review. Thanks again.

I contacted Southwest Ford and Roy about the price of a 2017 Ford Explorer Platinum and he emailed me back immediately.  When I emailed Roy back he was out of town on a Special Olympic event and Carl Price returned my email and was making himself available to assist me with whatever I needed until Roy returned.  I really appreciated that someone stepped up to keep me informed.   When Roy returned on Monday he contacted me and we worked out the purchase of the car.  I need to mention that I drove over 3 hours to Southwest Ford, since they beat all other the Ford dealers in the Austin, Texas area.  Dan Laux was the individual I worked with to finish the sale and he was very through in explaining all the additional warranties that Southwest Ford offered.  I really enjoy the environment around Southwest Ford in that they do not pressure you into anything and that's another reason I have purchased 2 new vehicles from them.

292,"December 23, 2016","My husband bought a truck a couple of years ago at Southwest and it went very smoothly and he still loves his truck.  So when we needed a new vehicle for our daughter, who had totaled her car in an unfortunate encounter with a deer,we thought of Southwest first and met Justin Hood.  He asked us questions about what we were looking for (I was concerned about safety, my daughter wanted heated seats).  Justin found her a car with the extras that she wanted, but was also a safe car, so we were both happy. After my husband had a chance to look at it, we purchased the car...it was a 2012 Ford Fusion Sel.  My daughter fell in love with it very quickly.  But it wasn't meant to be because, she had another accident a week after we purchased it and it was totaled.  She was just heartbroken, but we only cared that she was okay.  I called Justin to let him know what happened and he was very sympathetic and I  asked him to keep us in mind if any thing similar became available.  He stayed in touch with us and also helped get us some info on the title transfer of the wrecked vehicle, so that we could start seriously looking for another vehicle.  So today we went back out to see what Justin had available and he was in his Christmas suit, which was awesome!  And once again, he helped us find a vehicle that we all liked...again, it was a very easy, pleasant, and very quick process.  We got there at 3 and we were out the door by 4!  This time we got a 2015 Nissan Altima.  Although I hope we do not have a need again soon for another vehicle, I would definitely call Justin first,  if I  did need one.  We have been extremely pleased with our experience with him and the dealership and would recommend them to anyone in the market for a car.

I made a call to see if it was still available about an hour & half before their closing (our drive to the dealership would take almost an hour).  When we arrived the truck was already pulled up front under the lights for us to see.  Justin Hood was our salesperson.  After dealing with car salesmen all day, he was by far the best....knowledgeable & patient (remember we show up almost at closing time).  After looking at the truck & taking it on a lengthy test drive, he graciously gives my wife & I a moment alone to discuss things.  We present our concerns & our offer.  Justin & Andrew were great to deal with...we had everything nailed down in a short time & were on our way to financing.

296,"November 17, 2016","First of all, it was really easy shopping for a car through the internet sales and being able to see what the price will be, compare prices, etc.  Car shopping has always been somewhat painful for my husband and me in the past, but this time it was really a good experience.  I am really glad we found Southwest Ford as the whole process went very smoothly.

One of the reasons it was such a good experience was our 'new car internet sales consultant,' Lindsey Sipe.  Lindsey was very courteous, very pleasant, and very knowledgeable.  We were looking at the Ford Escapes, and she was very familiar with them and answered all our questions.  On the test drive, she showed me some of the different features on the vehicle.  After we got back to the dealership, she sat there and showed and explained even more features.  She made sure we had all our questions asked before we signed the papers . One thing I really liked about her was that she was helpful, knowledgeable, courteous, and was never, ever the least bit pushy.  That has not always been our experience with 'sales consultants over the years.  She also followed up with a phone call checking to see that we had no questions or any problems with the vehicle.    I was very comfortable around her and with her. I would highly recommend her to anyone shopping for a new vehicle.

We qualified for the 0% interest so we did finance through Ford.  Jeff Yates was the finance manager who helped us.  He, too, was very knowledgeable and not pushy at all.  He clearly explained all the options and helped us get the best deal.  

However, without Lindsey's help, we would likely have never reached the decision to buy the Escape when we did and at Southwest.  I would recommend both the dealership, Lindsey, and Jeff.

We went to one dealership and all they wanted to do was get us into a new car.  We didn't have the money for a new car.  So, my hubby suggested Southwest Ford.  We stopped into the used car lot and began to look around.  Within a couple of minutes, Blake Black came out to help us.  He said that he could show us something in our price range.  We did look at a couple of cars, but my son just wanted to think.  So, we gave our info to Blake and went home.  Over the next few days, he sent us cars that he thought my son would like.  Our price range changed during that time, as my son didn't have as much money as we thought.  Blake didn't even blink, he kept finding us cars.  Finally, after a few days, Blake sent the perfect car -- a 2010 Mazda 3.  It was close to our price range and we all wanted to go see it.  We went out to test drive and it was a perfect fit for us...price wise, size, clean, low mileage.  We weren't sure if Blake could get the car into our price range, but he said that he would do his best.  He got the car spot on in our price range (including tt&l), not a penny more.  We bought it immediately!  Blake is a man of his word and doesn't play the game of trying to get you into more car than you want, need, or can afford.

410,"July 06, 2016","How do I start....I guess I should say first that I enjoy car shopping about as much as surgery without anesthetic.  Our recent experience with Southwest Ford has changed that! Our salesperson, Kevin Barbour, was excellent-he listened to our needs, he got us an awesome truck and went to the extreme to make sure that we were satisfied in every way. Even the finance guy went above and beyond and found us a great rate.  Also, a process that we expected would take hours, took way less time and was a smooth as glass.
I could go on about how the folks made a family with two special needs kids feel as welcome as if we were at home or how they went over the truck with a microscope to make sure it was good to go, but let me sum it up by making a suggestion-if you are reading this, you want or need a vehicle, right? Do yourself a big favor-get up from your computer  and get yourself over to Southwest Ford! You will be very glad you did!

In this day and age regardless if you are going to the dry cleaners, getting something to eat, or yes even buying a vehicle finding true customer service is almost impossible.  This however is NOT the case at Southwest Ford and with  Roy Dooley. If you are wanting a new vehicle or if you find yourself in the position of absolutely needing a vehicle like I was you need to give Roy an opportunity to make this happen. Roy goes above and beyond to help you. He takes the time to find out both your needs and your wants then he goes to work finding the right car for you.  He does all of this with absolutely no pressure. He wants you to be happy with the vehicle and feel comfortable with the deal that is made. If the financing is challenging he does not give up or pressure you into a huge down or something you can't afford. He just keeps working with his financing department until not only are you approved but you are happy. Imagine that... someone who works for you and puts your needs as top priority. How is this best said? Oh yes it's what is almost impossible to find these days good old fashioned Customer Service!!

Roy I want to thank you and Dan Hall (finance) for the top notch service and work you provided to help me. I will be happily recommending you and Southwest Ford.

452,"May 16, 2016","John Beasley is a man of great attitude and character. If you have frustration, worry, or are seeking just general knowledge about repairs and maintenance of your car, go see him first!  Back in March I came across an issue with my car and that is when he began to work with me to resolve my problems.  My extended warranty ran out and hit an emissions issue problem that was going to take a bit to repair. I was very worried as this could cost a lot out of pocket. By his help and the help of Jimmy Ogle and Chris Bonnett, The Dealership was able to get all the repairs done for me and they were able to get it covered under my warranties through the Ford Motor Company.

Let me tell you what a relief that was.  

Anytime through the process that I had a question, all I had to do was call and he was there to give me any and all responses I needed.  It didn't matter if he was busy or if I was stressed out and taking it out on him, John always did his job 110% and with a smile on.

I ended up getting the car for less than what I originally saw it for, and received what I wanted and without a worry. 

The reason why he is getting a review now is because even to this day, Roy continues to greet me with a smile, and even though I am not at the stage for a new car, he new about repairs I needed for my current one, and kept an eye on it to see how things progressed.  Not once did this man forget my name even three years later.  This man will not pressure you, and will be there when you need him. ",5.0

First he located a truck in inventory which met my needs exactly, then after we test drove the vehicle and examined it closely he  worked with me and his staff to develop a deal which fit in my numbers.   Overall it was an outstanding experience.  

Please note:  for me this was a very significant change in direction.   I had been a dedicated Toyota owner and had earlier the same day explored trading my FJ cruiser for a Toyota Tundra.  I would likely have made that deal if not for the poor performance of the Toyota salesman.  He was uninterested in either my vehicle requirements or my special needs (I have bad knees and need specific hand grips etc to get into vehicle - the Tundra did not support this as Toyota had made the decision to not have driver side accessibility assists and the salesman was unhelpful).   I was so unimpressed with the Toyota salesman that I decided for the first time in decades to try a different brand.   I am so glad I did.   Seth and the Ford team and the Ford F150 product have made me a Ford guy now.

526,"January 29, 2016","I appreciate John’s input in helping me to choose my recent accessory purchase of a cargo net for my vehicle. Although he offered to help me install it when I picked up the net, I later installed it myself with minimal ease; it was helpful that John had previously shown/explained how and where to attach the net. Overall, I am very pleased with the cargo net, thus far; and I believe it was a worthwhile and necessary purchase. 

Description: The cargo net is rectangular in shape, has four study durable hard plastic hooks on each corner, two bungee type encased straps that run along two sides, and two sides that are netting material only. Pros:  I like that the net expands/stretches to accommodate the cargo, that it is easy to unhook and re-hook the netting when loading and unloading, that it has two sturdy reinforced sides, that it holds cargo in place preventing items from falling out when the rear hatch door is opened, and that you can see the cargo through the netting. Cons: After having utilized the cargo net, I believe that reinforcing all of the sides of the cargo net and designing a net with a tighter weave would help to keep the cargo more tightly secured and in place. 

Thank you so much for your help, John.    ",5.0

540,"January 07, 2016","     Thus far, given my experiences at Southwest Ford over such a short time period, they have exceeded my expectations and equally so when compared to my previous experiences with other dealers over the past years. The following Southwest employees’ positive and friendly attitudes, knowledge, and high standards of customer service will most definitely keep me coming back! Thank you so much from a truly satisfied customer.  
    First, over the past years, after having owned Chevy, GMC, Buick, Chrysler, Lexus, and Toyota vehicles, this is the very first Ford vehicle that I have ever owned in my life. Since purchasing my Ford vehicle, I have had it serviced twice, both times at the Southwest Ford location. The first time I called Southwest Ford, it was to discuss a recall on the vehicle and to order a necessary accessory--Josh helped me over the phone with the recall by coordinating with the parts department and ordering the necessary part(s). I also spoke directly with the gentleman in the parts department concerning the recall part and also ordered the accessory. Josh was most professional, friendly, and knowledgeable as was the gentleman in the sales department, who later went the extra mile in installing and showing me how the accessory worked. I truly appreciated being kept in the loop when Josh and the parts department gentleman called me on several occasions to give me an ETA status update(s) of the recall parts and accessory. 
     Once the recall part arrived, Josh set up the necessary appointment for me and unfortunately I was unable to make it to the first appointment (as well as several others he later set up for me) because of a conflict with my schedule. I'm embarrassed to say that I was unable to take the vehicle in and the part had to be returned. Even so, when I finely made it to Southwest Ford to have my first maintenance service, Josh was most understanding, professional, and patient, and courteous when I explained why I was unable to keep the appointments he’d scheduled for me to address the vehicle’s recall. 
     The first vehicle visit involved oil service and a complimentary car wash. I truly appreciated Josh’s professionalism, courtesy, friendliness, knowledge, patience, and follow through. The oil service and car wash were exemplary and were performed while I waited; since I was unable to leave my vehicle with Josh at the time, he scheduled me for a loaner car (because I needed a vehicle) so that I could bring in my vehicle for the second visit which involved the recall repair and additional diagnosis/troubleshooting and repair(s) related to a warning and alert indicator and icon on the dash display and alarm, all under warranty. 
     During the second visit I was helped by John Beasley, who was as professional, courteous, friendly, knowledgeable, and patient as Josh. John also took the time to walk out to my vehicle and advise me on an additional accessory that I needed, which he ordered for me.  He also coordinated with the parts department for the necessary recall (parts) and introduced me to Sunny, who assigned me a loaner vehicle. The not-so-common alert warning indicators on the dash were taken very seriously by John. I am very pleased to report that the necessary recall maintenance was accomplished and the other problems were diagnosed and repaired. When John called to tell me the great news and that my vehicle was ready for pick up, he also explained all of the repairs that were done to my vehicle, which I really appreciated. I am so amazed and impressed with the efficiency of how quickly the parts were ordered and all of the necessary maintenance/repairs were performed. Outstanding service! 
     Having never needed or used a loaner vehicle at Southwest Ford before, Sunny was amazing in her professional, friendly, courteous, and efficient manner. She very patiently explained the protocol of using a loaner vehicle, prepared and explained all of the necessary paperwork, and went the extra mile in helping me to inspect the loaner before she handed me the keys. She also coordinated with the porter to help me. 
     Lastly, when I drove in to pick up my vehicle, Johnathan met and greeted me with a big smile at 6:31pm after I’d driven up on the driveway of the service department and he saw me hurriedly walk toward the glass doors.  He very kindly let me know it wasn’t too late to pick up my vehicle and return the loaner. He coordinated with a porter to bring my car around and retrieve my loaner; and although he was prepared to close out my paperwork, Sunny very kindly assisted me in checking out. And even though it was late, she did so most efficiently and with a sincere smile on her face. Amazing!

This place truly knows how to put customers first and it's clear to me after spending two days at their dealership they have good leadership. A special thanks to Dan Hall who not only accommodated a very special request (bow on car for wife) but also beat my banks low interest rate by a little bit. Mr. Hall also had us in stitches with his witty commentary. I had a very brief misunderstanding with Brad?Brandon ( manager ) that was quickly corrected. Mr. Price (hope I get names right) was another manager who was very attentive.

547,"November 25, 2015","On 11/18/15 I purchased a pre-owned vehicle that test drove well, but after doing the paperwork and having it prepped it stalled 3-times before I drove it off the lot. Needless to say, I was very uncomfortable with my new purchase. My sales rep Jorge, his teammate Dustin and the sales manager Andrew all assured me they would make it right. They kept the car overnight and had it serviced the next day. After changing a sensor, they said it should be fine, but if it isn't just bring it back. I drove it 200 miles the very next day and it stalled 3 times. They invited me to bring it back and kept it for 3 more days of troubleshooting, trying to get the car to duplicate the intermittent problem. Unfortunately, it could not be duplicated. I really thought that I was stuck with this 10-year old vehicle because it was purchased ""As Is w/No Warranty"". However, Andrew gave me the option to return it for a full refund or keep it. Duh! I returned it, but I was so impressed with the entire customer service experience that I stayed right there and purchased another pre-owned vehicle. The guys were great.

553,"October 09, 2015","I would most highly recommend that you take your Ford service needs elsewhere.  I have had two very bad experiences in a row.  #1  The brakes on my 2012 Expedition XLT started pulsing and I thought that it was probably time for a pad change.  Instead, it was told  that the brake rotors were warped and had to be turned, one strut had a minor leak and thus and a pair of struts had to be replaced.  OK, that's no big deal, I thought.  The bill was over $900!!!!!.   For turning the rotors and replacing a couple of struts?  Any local shop would have charged less than half of that.  #2.  The car would not start, the fobs would not work and the ""security lock system"" engaged, the car had to be towed to the dealership.  After performing a ""diagnostic"", we were told that the car battery was dead.  Can't you simply use a volt meter to tell that?  We were required to buy the new battery, and pay for 2 new fobs and their re-programming fee just to get the car to work.  You mean that simply disconnecting the battery causes the security system to lose it's programming?  You mean that it's not non-volatile RAM?  If that's the case, the Ford has some serious engineering issues (I'm a graduate engineer).  It cost me over $500 for this fiasco.  Although it might not be possible to do so, I will actively attempt to avoid ever spending any money at Southwest Ford service department ever again.  I recommend that you do the same.",1.0

Every time I took it to the service center, they changed the bulb and sent me on my way, saying everything was okay.  This went on for several months, and I finally had to take it to a service repair shop who felt it was an electrical issue.  He ordered the part and could not complete the installation without 2 key fobs to program. (very poor customer service on Ford's part).  I only had one fob so called several times to SW Ford to see what they could do.  I just needed it programmed, I was not asking them to replace the part.  I finally took the car to Ford and Jonathan Pankrez was my service advisor.  He felt there was nothing we could do without ordering a $300 key fob.  He then suggested that it may be a programming issue and he wanted to try that before ordering the fob.  It turns out, that solved the issue!

I was trading a F150 Raptor for a F250. We weren't off on the numbers by much. ($500). I do realize you take a loss on a trade in, but I was asking about the different promotions from Ford and their website - $500BUYTODAY scam. But after trying to explain to MR. DUDLEY that I was confused on the promotions and the pricing for the truck and trade in. He told me to go READ THE FINE PRINT! 

It gets better... After realizing I no longer want to do business with Southwest Ford. I proceeded to grab my things to leave. The salesman literally GRAB MY ARM and forcibly restrain me from leaving his office. xxx! At this point I started to feel threaten. I demanded that he needed to let go of my arm. After shouting out loud for others to hear. The salesman comply and I left as quickly as possible.

I'm still in shocked that someone would physically grab your arm and try to restrain you from leaving. I went to buy a truck, and instead I also have to get in a altercation to leave. Not somewhere where I'll ever buy a car, and I'm hoping my experience explains why you should look into another dealership.

I usually don't do these kinds of reviews, but the situation at Southwest Ford blows me away. I hope to do whatever to discourage people from buying cars at this dealership.

562,"July 20, 2015",excellent response when calling dealer new car salesman Tommy Tatsak. Financing was an easy process. Doing online credit  application saves time at the dealership. My information was readily available so it saved me time. Great selection of vehicles and had the f150 platinum I was looking for. I live about 110 miles from southwest so it they made it easy so I could get new vehicle in one day. Overall southwest an tommy get excellent review. Thanks,4.8
563,"July 11, 2015","My husband and I were in the market looking for a newer Ford for our family. We decided to take a look at Southwest Ford to see what we could find. Our sales consultant was Jason Shaw. Mr. Shaw is a very respectful and understanding person. We did leave that day because we could not find anything that we wanted. However, we tried shopping around  to dealers and behind the scenes , Mr. Shaw was steadily trying to find us something that fit our budget. A few weeks later Mr. Shaw called us and told us about a vehicle and once we saw pictures we knew we had to have it. We used our credit union to finance the vehicle and that was a little difficult on both parities, After every thing was sorted out, Mr. Shaw and Mr. Rogers worked very hard to get us in this vehicle and made it happen! My husband and I will continue to business with this dealership and our sales consultant, Mr. Shaw. Thanks for such a great experience and all the patience that was shown when dealing with our credit union.

569,"April 22, 2015","Purchased a truck from Southwest about 10 years ago, good experience. Since then we have made several attempts to purchase another car from Southwest but never have. This really has me scratching my head. In January we attempted to purchase a SUV but the terms were horrible. We went straight across the street and drove home in a new car an hour later. We got such a good deal on that car, we just traded it in on a larger sedan Hybrid. This could've been Southwest business. I like Ford cars and trucks, instead I drive a Dodge and a Hyundaui.   ",1.0
570,"April 07, 2015","In February 2003 my husband purchased a new F-150 through Five Star Ford and at that time we were introduced to Johnathan Pankrez who was assigned to take care of our truck and he did a fantastic job always keeping us informed of what maintenance was required to keep our warranty valid.  Over the years we purchased two more brand new vehicles from Five Star Ford because we knew Johnathan was there and would continue to ensure our vehicles were always maintained with the upmost care and concern just as he did with our truck.  By the way the truck has approximately 207,000 miles on it right now.  My daughter who is the proud owner of the 2012 Focus actually drives from Corpus Christi just for her oil changes, because she refuses to let anyone touch her motor!!! In fact, one day she got up to a flat tire and she was totally distraught since we was so far away from home so she called me to asked me what to do and since her car was under a full warranty and I told her to call Johnathan, so he informed her, she actually had a warranty on the tires and he bent over backwards from his location in Fort Worth to help her in Corpus Christi to obtain a brand new tire without being raked over the coals and how to use her warranty at the dealership in Corpus!!  And, this is how Johnathan has cared for us over the years.   So, we are pleased to know that Johnathan  is once again working at a ford dealership since we would rather the same company care for them that built them!!  Cause where Johanthan goes we shall follow!",5.0
571,"April 07, 2015","  I am the maintenance supervisor for Trican Well Service in Springtown, Tx. I have had the pleasure working with the service department at Southwest Ford for 3 years on our ARI leased light duty vehicles. Working with Jeremy & Travis has been extremely smooth. They know exactly what I expect & our units are repaired in a timely manner.
  Since Snake Garrett is Trican's fleet representative I try to purchase vehicles through him. August of 2014 I purchased a new F150 FX2. We traded 2 vehicles in at that time. All went very well.
  In January 2015 I ordered a new 2015 Mustang GT Premium through Tommy Tatsak. Delivery took longer than expected because of weather & other issues. I had to turn the purchase down in mid March because of my job. The Mustang had not been sold. On 4/6/2015. My wife & I reclaimed my beautiful 2015 Mustang. Traded in our 2010 Mustang & drove home with big smiles. Tommy was a real pleasure to work with.

First he showed us a ruby red F150 Platinum and we loved it. Then when we got back to the dealership we found out we couldn't finance a 2014 so he showed us a green metallic Platinum (2015). We drove it and decided to buy it.
We are totally satisfied with the truck, dealership & Mr Brian Aherns professional presentation!!
I will recommend him and the dealership to anyone interested in a new vehicle, car, truck or van.

586,"December 04, 2014","When I arrived at your dealership, I realized that my vehicle had some significant electrical problems. My desire was to receive the necessary repairs to resolve my problems at the lowest possible cost. The worst case estimate provided by your service manager Dave was in excess of $1,325. I told him that I did not want to buy a new electronic brain if it was not necessary, and I did not want to purchase a new windshield if the seals could be repaired without breaking the windshield. (The leaking seal around the windshield was the cause of my electrical problems). Dave was successful in seeing that the work was done without replacement of the electronic brain and without replacing the windshield. My final bill was reduced to $625. While this amount was still costly, it was more acceptable than the original estimate. I am grateful for Dave's efforts.

Completely satisfied. My hubby and I have been regular customers for about five/six years now. We also like the fact that they run our vehicles thru the car wash after any service. They almost feel like family. :-) With 4 teenagers and 6 cars in the family it works for us.",5.0

589,"September 06, 2014","Thank you Brandon for making this car buying purchase the best ever. Having bought several new and used vehicles from other dealers over the past decade, it would be easy to say that this is one of my least favorite things to do, but, that all changed today.  Brandon was courteous, prompt, and listened to what we wanted in a vehicle. Found two different vehicles, test drove both, couldn't decide, bounced back and forth, in and out, did I mention it was raining.  Brandon never faultered or acted put off even when we told him we were going to look at a vehicle from another dealer.  Gave us his card and assured us he would be there if and when we decided.  No running after us, no hard sale tactic, no we have other people interested so don't wait too long.  We did return two hours later and asked to drive both vehicles again. Again Brandon was more than helpful. Drove and looked, drove and looked, did I mention it was raining.  Finally made up our minds and bought one of the vehicles. Thanks again Brandon you've sold me on more than just a car.....

Not to forget you Jeff (finance). Jeff was equally attentive and helped us obtain a more than fair offer. Jeff covered all the extras with no added pressure, just the facts, and let us make our own decisions.  All in all, well worth the hour and a half drive from where we live. 

We'll be back!

I took it home before I got home the TPMS light came on I called the salesman and he said bring it back and they would fix it. When I took it back they found that there were not sensors in the wheels and that I would have to buy them and they would put them on for $80.00. I asked what happened to they would fix it and was told it was my problem. I was also told by the salesman there was a warranty on it and found out pretty quick it didn't. Before I bought it it had a front tire rubbing the inner finder when making a hard turn. I told them about it and they fixed it or should I say patched it it is now doing the same thing. The free oil change is nice but you need to watch them do it I took them oil to use because I wanted synthetic oil. I had it setting in the seat and told them to use it. I just happened to be where I could see them and watched them start pumping regular oil into it before I could get them stopped.

637,"August 08, 2013","Bought a new 2013 F150 crewcab and after driving it for several weeks noticed that the a/c compressor would shut off every 25 seconds for a period of approx. 10 seconds causing temperature rise of 10 degrees, very irritating to say the least in 100 degree weather. Also have a related issue in that when it rains the inside windows fog every 25 seconds, also very unsafe. Had the truck back to Ford in Weatherford for service three times for answers to problem. Have been told all three times this is normal, but could not prove there assertions. Asked for technical data to prove this theory but was told I could not see that material. Was shown another vehicle and it did same thing albeit it only shutdown at two second intervals. Have worked on all types of a/c systems for 30 plus years and have never seen this occur. Apparently no one there can diagnose and fix the problem so I will have to seek help elsewhere. Beware of the a/c systems in the 2013 F150 series and if you have a significant technical problem and you may not get the answers your looking for.

659,"May 04, 2013","In September of 2012, my wife and I purchased a new 2012 F150 FX2 Supercrew. Recently, 04-27-13, the truck had to go in for its very first service after hitting 3000+ miles. A problem developed during this service that seriously rattled the confidence my wife had in the truck she always wanted and dearly loved. After discussing the seriousness of the situation with Mr. Jimmy Ogle, Service Director & Mr. Stephen Gilchrist, Operations Coordinator, it was determined that the best solution for all parties was to replace the truck with a new one. Since no other 2012's were around, Southwest Ford in Weatherford did the unselfish act of stepping up with a 2013 truck with all the same features as our 2012. We were not charged a dime extra even though there was a price differential. Roy Dooley, our sales consultant at our first purchase in September 2012, was right there to ensure the new transaction went as smoothly as possible on May 01, 2013. In my opinion, you can't buy this type of caring and concern from most businesses today, but Southwest Ford in Weatherford gave them and sacrificed profit for customer satisfaction.",5.0

This was by far the best experience in purchasing a vehicle I have had. All were knowledgeable, courteous, and most of all respectful. I had gone to the dealership knowing what I wanted (Internet search) and at no time did any of the individuals try to talk me in to something else and the price was actually lower than the internet price. 

I did end up purchasing a different vehicle (my choice) and received the same great service. When I had to go see the business manager, Dan Laux, I thought now the high pressure sales of extended warranty would start. To my surprise, he provided the information, but when I said I needed to think about it, he said no problem and gave me another 24 hours to decide.

667,"March 17, 2013","All I can say is ""WOW""!!!!  I live in West Texas and was planning on making a vehicle purchase later this year.  Unfortunately, things got accelerated and that purchase came over spring break.  I tried working with a local dealership but, after 3 days of test drives, the best they could do for me was to order a vehicle and hopefully have it in town within a week.

I got on the internet and checked Southwest Ford.  They had the exact truck that I was looking for and it was in stock.  I called on Thursday when they opened and was told all sales persons were in a meeting.  The receptionist I talked to was very helpful and even confirmed for me that the truck I saw on the internet was still on the lot.

After filling out the internet contact section, I was contacted by Roy Dooley in a short amount of time later.  We talked on the phone and he also confirmed that the truck was still on the lot.  We initially talked about a price and Roy gave me a figure before I hung up.  This was much more progress than what I got with the local dealership.

My wife and I made the 2 hour drive and was introduced to Roy.  Roy was very knowledgeable of the truck I was interested in, to the point of giving me too much information!!!!  This was definitely a welcomed change from the information I got from the local dealership.

We negotiated a price and it was within the range we were willing to pay.  From here, we were introduced to Dan.  He was very easy to talk to.  We told him what we wanted and were not forced to hear a ""sales pitch"" of things we weren't willing to buy.

We were very fortunate to have Roy and Dan handle our purchase.  So much so that my wife is thinking of trading in her car for another truck.  Thank you both Roy and Dan.

673,"February 26, 2013","Not really sure where to begin on this one.  Everything started out great when I found just the truck I was looking for on Autotrader.  I recognized the name Southwest Ford, due to the fact that several of my friends in the area had purchased their vehicle from this particular dealership in Weathorford.  Even though I lived in San Antonio, I took the day off to come look at a truck that they had listed.  I had assurance from my friend that I wouldn't regret dealing with this group of people.

I was picked up at the airport by a gentleman, and driven out to the dealership.  Everything was going great until I saw a huge scratch down the side of the truck that had not been shown in any of the pictures on the internet, or in several texts that I had received from the dealership.  I then tuck the truck for a drive and noticed a strange sound coming from under the hood, but was assured by and employee that it was just the alternator, and that newer fords had loud alternators.  

When it came time to working out a deal, the sales person was extremely nice, and emphasized that it was a family owned business and I had nothing to worry about, because they were there to do the right thing.  I was assured that the truck had been put through a rigorous ""certified pre-owned"" test, and that if something was wrong, it had been found and fixed. 

On my drive back to San Antonio, I noticed a bad shake in the steering wheel anytime I applied the brakes and was going over 50.  I thought this was just simply due to non-balanced tires.  I stopped in a town, still on the way down to SA, and luckily a nice gentlemen pointed out that I only had one license plate light.  I looked and sure enough, one had fallen completely out of its place and was dangling underneath the bed.  

Even though all of this had happened, I kept remembering  back to the salesperson saying that this is a Family run business, and they would stop at nothing to do the right thing.  Boy was I wrong, and simply embarrassed that I actually believed that.  After letting a couple days go buy I took the truck into a ford dealership to have these three things checked out.  The service department called me and told me that the whining noise was my tension-er pulley going out, not a loud alternator, the shaking in the steering wheel was due to warped rotors and all four needed to be turned.  I asked him how these problems could have possibly been overlooked by the Southwest Ford Dealership, especially since I was assured all ""Certified Pre-Owned"" vehicles go through a rigorous test,  and the service tech said it never should have been passed as ""CPO"" with these problems.

I called back to Southwest Ford and talked to my salesperson, who was great through this whole process, and he assured me that they were going to do the right thing.  Well long story short he said they would not cover any of the costs.  He asked management several times, and simply got a no in reply.  If this is ""doing the right thing"", I was taken for a fool.  Frankly I would be embarrassed to be a part of this company, and ashamed to know that this is how they treat people.  Especially only a week after buying the vehicle, they know that these problems existed when I drove it off the lot.  Simply put I will never buy another vehicle from this dealership and will try my best to let my friends in the DFW know how these people treat customers.  Simply pathetic that a no answer is all I ever got.  ",2.6

680,"February 14, 2013","I have been buying vehicles since 1979, I have purchased from many dealers and have found that SWF has by far the best sales force and absolutely hands down the best service department in the state of Texas.  We have been SWF supporters for over 5 years now and will not allow or give our vehicle business to any other dealership.  SWF is also a gold star supporter of our national television show Hunt Wicked Close TV that airs on the Pursuit channel and since our relationship was bonded we as a team have assisted in the sale of over 1/2 million dollars in new and used vehicle sales. Hunt Wicked Close could have offered the national ad spot to any dealership but none and we mean ""None"" of the others hold a candle to SWF in professionalism and just plain home town participation.  SWF is not only a participant in Hunt Wicked Close TV but has made a over the top impact on our local residence and our local school aged children.  SWF is one of the top supporters in numerous home town activities that supports all the local events that make our future leaders able to excel and become top of the top in education and further education with scholarships.  SWF is a top notch dealership and prove why they are number one in the state week in and week out.  

With SWF professional sales staff, 2nd to none service department, and its strong christian values it will always be number one with us and will always be our dealership for life.

686,"January 23, 2013","Purchased this F150 through your internet sales.  Did not know what to except and was more than pleased at how Eric Segovia treated me and took care of me during this sale.  It was a pleasure doing business with SouthWest Ford.  I came from MS to purchase this truck because all of the dealers around my area just want to try and hotbox you and intimidate you with all of their sales techniques.  My favorite is if you have a trade they take the carkeys from you and will not give them back until you have dealt with the saleman, then the manager comes and talks to you and then if that doesn't work, then the owner comes out to see if there is something wrong with his sales personnel and can he help sell you the car.  What a bunch of bull.  Eric was straight forward, told me the truth, and made buying this truck fun again.  When you spend $38,000 + or - the sale should be fun and you should have a great feeling about the sale when you finish. I have and had this feeling after dealing with all of your personnel and especially Eric.  Thanks for running a dealership that makes it fun to buy a car again.

701,"December 06, 2012","My experience went south really from the start.   My sales men Kelly Shannon was kind of pushy.  Going back and forth with his manager. After he figured out that he was not getting anywhere with me, and trying to stare me down he passes me off to his manager Jason allbritton.  I was put off by Jason . He seem cocky and arrogant. Asking me if this was a game to me and I wanted to “win”.  No this isn’t a game, this is about money and a truck.  After we finally come to terms. I go and sign the papers. And leave with the truck( on an almost empty tank).  I made a agreement when buying the truck that I wanted to keep my wheels/tires off the truck I was trading in, as I had just put new tires on it and I wanted to keep them. So we made the appointment for me to come back the following Saturday to have the swap done.  I arrive at 9 am Saturday and hand the key over too have the swap done. Kelley and I tell the service rep that we are swapping wheels and tires and to keep the right TPMS sensors on each truck.  3 hours later while I wait… I get my truck back with everything swapped .  soo I thought. I get a mile down the road and the TPMS starts making all kinds of noise. ( all they did was pull the entire whee/tire of each truck and swap them. Leaving the wrong tpms sensor on each truck, I immediately  pull over and call Kelly and tell him what happened and that the tpms were not swap and now I have a light on my dash.  Kelly says hes busy and will have to call me back.  I say ok and continue my hour long drive back home.  Monday comes and I have still not gotten a call back. So I start calling to get this issue addressed so It can be fixed. For Monday and Tuesday I get to play phone tag. I start calling Tuesday after no one ever calls me back. But I can’t seem to get anyone on the phone. I finally have to call over to the main dealer and have them call someone for me. After playing phone tag some more. I finally get ahold of kellys arrogant manager Jason. He says he didn’t know about the issue which I doubt he didn’t since I was playing phone tag with Kelly earlier while he talked back and forth with Jason, so I thought, about the issue. Jason calls me back and says I didn’t know about the issue let me get with service and ill call you back. Now its Wednesday and I haven’t received a call. So I get on the phone again and start process of getting ahold or either Kelly or Jason. Kelly calls me back and I say so what’s the deal I haven’t heard anything yet. He says oh. Well just come in and I will have it set up. I say ill be there 3:30 sharp. When I arrive im greeted by a service rep and explain to him my name and I have an appointment. He says he has so idea of it. So I call Kelly again and say this guy has no idea why I’m here. Come handle it.  And I want to speak to Jason in person.  While my truck is being fixed (I hope) me and Jason have a chat. He explains to me that he had no idea. Saying if he knew this would have never happened. Well I say well when I was playing phone tag with Kelly.. Who was he talking to since it wasn’t you? I don’t like getting the run around or being lied to and both were done to me. Now I have spent 2 hours round trip driving and 3 hours at the dealer Saturday, I get to do it all over again on Wednesday night. So no 4 hours of driving and 6 hours in the shop I finally get my truck back. The service techs that worked on my truck were nice and apologized and I told them its not your fault and I thanked them for staying late and their hard work. I grabbed my key and got out of there. The “South west promise or not”  I will not be back. The lack of customer service is terrible. All I ask is to call me back, keep me in the loop, and make it right.  If you have to go to this dealer avoid Kelly and Jason. ",2.2
702,"December 06, 2012",Was my first car buying experience and I was concerned about both my credit and my lack of experience in the situation. Andrew was very knowledgeable and helped me understand exactly what i needed to do and helped me find a car in my price range that also suited my personality. Since i purchased my car ive recommended several of my friends to the dealership and specifically to Andrew and will continue to do so in the future. ,5.0
703,"December 06, 2012","I really value consumer reviews and was happy to see SW Auto Group rated so highly when I went to check out a used vehicle that I was interested in. My experience was good, but not as great as everyone else seems to have had. I want to write an honest and fair review of my experience. 

First off, I was in the market for a used vehicle in the $10,000 range. So I recognize that my experience is going to inherently be different than someone looking for a $40,000 new truck. I was also visiting the dealership from Keller, so some of my issues would also have been avoided had I lived closer to Weatherford. 

Nonetheless, I found what I was looking for on their web site. I called and the sales guy, Andrew, was incredibly friendly and helpful. He answered several questions and offered to stay a few minutes later than usual so I could drive out that night. He came down on price to a number that I felt was more than fair, and then he and his manager let me test drive the vehicle for a couple of days. 

Over those couple of days, I decided I would purchase the vehicle and set up the bank draft. Prior to returning to the dealer to sign papers, however, the check engine light came on and the vehicle started having trouble accelerating. I nervously returned to the dealership, but Andrew and the used car manager Lee Ford were incredibly accommodating. They gave me the option of walking away no questions asked, or they offered to fix the problem and give me another test drive to make sure all the issues were resolved. 

I decided to go ahead with my purchase, and a month later I've had no more issues and love the vehicle. The only reason my experience was less than great was with a stupid issue with the dip stick. When they replaced the spark plugs, they managed to break off the oil dip stick and I had the hardest time getting it replaced. I was told when I purchased the car on a Thursday that they would have it sent to my house by that Monday. Monday came and went. Then I couldn't get my calls returned. I finally heard back from the sales guy who said it had been lost but they were ordering another. A few days passed and I couldn't get calls returned again. Then I spoke to a gentleman at the actual Ford dealership rather than the used lot, and he profusely apologized and said they were ordering a new one immediately. He calls to let me know that the new one is in a couple of days later, but says that they won't be able to mail it and I'll need to drive an hour each way to pick it up. When I said that I was told it would be mailed, he refused to budge and said he couldn't spend any more money on this vehicle. 

This is the source of my frustration in this experience. I just spent $10,000 on a vehicle and have been jerked around for nearly a month waiting on the simplest of things - a dip stick - and now the dealer won't spend $10 to have it sent to me? He said he couldn't do it. Ultimately, the sales guy Andrew acknowledged that he had said they would mail it so spent his own money to send out. So in the end I received the item as promised, but I was shocked that it was such a hassle to get such a simple thing done and that they flat our refused to spend a few more dollars to mail something to me. 

I do think they're generally good people out there, and seemed very fair up until the weird ending. I'd still recommend the dealership if you live out that way, but next time I'm buying a vehicle I'll probably try and find some place closer because just in case funky issues like this arise. ",3.8

We couldn't be happier with our new 2012 F-250. My husband was very impressed when he got home and all he had to was sign papers!

729,"September 20, 2012","Excellent experience in buying my new truck.  My salesperson, Cody Doyle, did an outstanding job in closing the deal with me.  In my search for a new vehicle, I had narrowed my choices to the Toyota Tundra (my two previous trucks were Tundra's) and the F-150.  To his credit and my comfort, Cody spent his sales time with me selling the positive attributes of the F-150 and the Southwest dealership and not the least bit time on (negative) comparisons of the two vehicles.  Additionally, his excitement of the Ecoboost engine option caused me to further research my options that did not previously include anything but a V8.  I choose a truck with the Ecoboost.  Based on my first time experience at Southwest Ford, I would highly recommend this dealership and the young, but wisely attentive Cody Doyle.  Also, a big thanks to Eugene King for his patience and civility during the usually 'not-so-fun-time-for-me' of paperwork processing.",5.0

Was contacted in short order by 5 of these dealerships including Roy Dooley,Internet Sales Consultant, of Southwest Ford in Weatherford, Texas.  Roy stood out as most friendly and most interested in obtaining my business.  With the assistance of Mike Waitkus, Internet Direcotor, we got an agreement worked out.  Thoughout this negoiation, it was on a very friendly level and I had the distinct feeling that both were genuinely interested in what I wanted and were doing their best to satisfy my desires--and they did.  Went over to Weatherford to complete the transaction where I was treated with the utmost respect and consideration.  Turned over to Eugene King, Business Manager, to complete the paperwork.  Eugene was also a great guy to work with.  He and I had a very pleasant time while doing the paperwork.

I am almost 80 years young and over the last 60 years I have bought a lot of vehicles.  This was the first purchase in that time which was a totally pleasant experience.  Southwest Ford has a great facility and I am convinced that they are into providing customer satisfaction without compromise.  Would not hesitate a moment to recommend these folks.

After wasting my time haggling over prices of their truck and my Chevrolet trade I left disappointed, not with the prices but how I was treated. I was talked down to and felt like I was a number not a potential customer. 

Disappointed with the brand, I waited a month then drove out to Southwest Ford in Weatherford. I met with Mike Waitkus and Roy Dooley. These guys are great! The day I went out there it was sprinkling and both of them took the time to show me the Platinum and locate the color combination I wanted, in the rain. Both Mike and Roy were very outgoing, friendly, and made me feel that customer service was number 1 with them.

Mike did a great job getting me the most for my trade and the price of the Platinum was very good. The quality of work was great. I had the dealership add a couple of options and the workmanship was excellent. 

I purchased this Platinum at Southwest Ford because of Mike and Roy and the excellent customer service. Both of them gave me their cell phone numbers and said to call anytime I needed anything.

769,"June 16, 2012","We have been totally loyal to Chevy most or our adult lives.  That being said, we bought a 2012 Ford Lariat F150 w/EcoBoost.  Not only do we love our new pickup, but we love the people at Southwest Ford, especially Brian Ahern.  
We had just been down the street at a Chevy dealer wanting to trade in our 2007 Silverado and were very disappointed by the salesman attitude.  We, my husband and I, do not care for car salesmen as a whole, but had always been treated well by this particular dealership.  Not this time.  Off we went to see what the new Fords were all about and ended up having one of the most plesant buying experiences possible. The place was packed and everyone was happy.  The customers were patient and the staff smiling and helpful.  Then we were greeted by Brian.  Since it seemed that everyone there was extremely busy and being pulled in serveral directions, we left a list with Brian of our must haves including the monthly budget and agreed to return later that evening. Not sure that Brian believed us, but return we did.  He must have been watching for us because he was standing at the door holding up a key and grinning like a Cheshire cat.  Now, I'm a skeptic and didn't really think that he could have met my wish list that fast and stay in budget....but he did.  We took the pickup out for a spin and left with it a few hours later.  The way Brian treated us was such a disconnect from our previous years of dealing with car salespersons.  I mean, really different.  I have to apologize to Brian for taking so long to get around to doing this review.  Sometimes life just gets in the way and I let it.  So, Brian, thank you so much for making this one of the best experiences we have ever had when buying a vehicle.  I will say there have been a lot of jokes aimed at me for driving around in a Ford, but after they experience a ride (I won't let anyone drive it yet)their minds change quickly.

Roy took the time to answer my questions and not rush or pressure myself or my wife,even before we went to meet him at the dealership. We like that! I sold cars in the early 1980's and was all too familiar with some dealers who make a living on high-pressure tactics. Southwest Ford is a first-class automobile dealership group and Roy Dooley was certainly the star of our puchase of a 2012 Ford Flex. There was absolutely no pressure, no games, just a genuine care for people/customers and the best service I've ever received at any dealership by far.

I was not only impressed with Roy and his Ford product knowledge, but also his attention to detail. We came in not knowing what to expect and left the dealership in a brand new Ford Flex and without feeling like we were taken. No hassle, no haggle, no negotiations! This was exactly the experience and outcome we desired. A great car, at a great price,at a great dealership!

Lynn ""Big Tex"" was awesome to work with, and went well beyond the call of duty by following me to Love Field to return my rental car and taking me back to the dealership to get my new truck (50 miles each way). WOW!

They have set the mark for others to strive for.

I love the F-150 FGX Super Crew truck and the Eco-Boost.

A highly satisfied customer.

You don't find to many salesmen that are willing to work with you after three hours & fussy child.

My sales consultant was Bruce Williams and he was very knowledgeable about the F150 series. He was low pressure and professional, he considered my offers seriously and made my purchase a pleasant experience. In short I got rebates and a warranty that could not be beat by any other dealership.

801,"January 09, 2012","I took my 2002 Ranger to Southwest Ford to have the Cam sensor and synchronizer replaced. This is a common problem with the 3.0 Ltr V-6, there are many forums on the internet addressing the issue, and there is a Technical Service Bulletin from 2005. There was a recall on the speed control, so I decided to have both done at the same time. I had already priced the parts required for the repair and saw that it should require 1.2 hours labor. All together, the repair should have cost around $300.
I met with the ""service advisor"" and told him what the problem was with the vehicle. I told him that I only wanted to have the parts replaced, nothing more. There would be no codes to diagnose the problem, as the problem only occurs at over 3000 RPMs and no codes are recorded over 2500 RPMs, this is also stated in the TSB which I provided to the advisor. 
When the ""service advisor"" returned two hours later with the estimate for repairs, he said that it would cost $566 to be repaired. The mechanic supposedly had already diagnosed the problem, for $89, even though it was not needed. The parts were going to be almost twice what I could have gotten them for at retail at any number of locations. They even tacked on 12% to the already inflated labor charge for environmental/shop supply fees. according to the estimate, this is for ""nuts, bolts, washers, tape, rags, aerospray, shellac, solvent, carburator cleaner, towels, solder, battery cleaner, wire, window sealer, waste disposal, used oil, antifreeze and reclaimed R-12 etc."" None of these would be applicable to my repair except maybe a rag to wipe the mechanics hands, and is that not a cost of doing business?
The repair did in fact fix the problem, but I feel that the cost was way over the top. The ""service advisor"" spoke to me as if I knew nothing about car repair. I should have done the work myself, as it is a 30 minute for a competent mechanic, but since I was getting the recall work done anyway I decided to let them do the work. 
Considering the lack of responding to the customer's wishes and the outrageous pricing for a simple repair, I would not recommend this dealer to anyone. We are planning to purchase a new Edge in the next few months, but it won't be from Southwest Ford.",2.4

829,"July 18, 2011","I live 15 minutes from 3 different Ford dealers but I drove 1 hour to Southwest Ford to purchase my new F150 Lariat. This is the third truck I have purchased from Southwest Ford. First, there is no haggleing over the price. If you are serious about buying, they get on the computer and in a couple minutes lay down the low price and that is the end of it. You can shop all the other dealers and write down their prices and South West doesnt even ask what the others are selling for....and their price will be the lowest! Then they have this thing called South West Promice...they change the oil, filter, and rotate the tires for free for the next 2 years! And wash it too! Then you think, sure all this free stuff, it will take all day for an oil change. Well it doesnt, their service dept is spotless, and fast. There are also other freebees that go with your new purchase too, like door ding repair, windshield chip repair, and more for free! But back to the beginning, while they send you to the finance man you new truck/car is being cleaned inside and out, and filled with gas...and with a 27 gallan tank on my truck thats close to $100.00 more I just saved. On this purchase I traided my old truck in and they gave me more than blue book for it. They dont try to force you into buying any extras. They tell you what they have ask if you are interested in any of them, and thats the end of it. They explain Gap insurance and their extended warranties and ask if you are interested in prices. They search several different fiance options and get the lowest avalible. You sign the normal stack of papers and they hand you your new keys and walk you to the front door where your spotless new truck full of gas is setting. Also the dealership itself... a beautiful building full of friendly polite people. Even if your not going to buy anything, you should go there and just look around at the beauty of the place. There is even a waterfall in the show room full of new cars and trucks. Its just an amazing place. Also if you are lucky enough to be there when the owner, Charlie Gilchrist, is roaming around in the building, he will even say hi. One more thing, I wasnt even going there to buy on this trip, I just wanted to see what all the hipe was about with that new v-6 engine that has the twin turbos and fuel injection.

833,"July 01, 2011","I drove 2 hours to buy my Ford from South West. No one in the area of Texas I live could compete with their price or selection of certified pre-owned Ford Trucks. Gary Osbourne   our sales person was so informative, knowledgeable and great to work with. Before I even arrived he had a full fleet of trucks in my price range and features ready for me to test drive. I never felt pressured and he helped us make an informed smart decision. We are very happy with our purchase and of all the dealerships I have dealt with around the country and abroad,South West was heads and shoulders above. They also have a first rate service department that took care of some small issues that needed fixed upon our purchase. The finance people were great too and we bought our truck on a Saturday and drove it home that afternoon. I would recommend South West to anyone in the Dallas Fort Worth area and beyond. I drove from Wichita falls where I live.",4.8

 we have purchased our past three vehicles from Jerry's Chevrolet in Weatherford  we went there to trade our truck in for a new one we ended up dealing with the manager tried the truck over night went back the next morning to make the purchase and our sales man was to busy to be bothered with us he was in the side office giggling with the young girls,we sat there for about an hour before he had time to say anything to us then after a while was told everybody is at lunch we cant be helped come back later we kept being blown off so that's when we went over to SouthWest Ford in Weatherford,TX and glad we did we wont be going any place else .",4.8

838,"June 19, 2011","Great car buying experience! In my lifetime I have easily purchased over 100 new cars for business and personal use. I would put my purchase experience with Southwest Ford as one of the top three of all time and the absolute best in the last ten years. Mike Waitkus, Roy Dooley and Dan Laux did a great job of taking care of every detail and made us feel like we had known them for quite some time, they even put up with our new puppy we had to bring along. Not only them, but everyone we ran into at the dealership had the same helpful and welcoming attitude. No high pressure and no hype, just sound buying advice and a very fair trade-in valuation helped make this one great day for buying a new truck. Having spent some time with another local dealer before going to Southwest I was dreading the routine of negotiating, at Southwest there was no stress and no drama, just good folks doing their job in a professional and most helpful manor. I highly recommend Southwest Ford in Weatherford. ",5.0
839,"June 17, 2011","This was the second time we have bought a car at Southwest Auto Group from Roy Dooley.  We were happy the first time however we didn't go back just because of our previous sastifying experience.  We once again went to several places after doing much research on cars.  My husband was admanant that since the car was going to be mine to drive, that I had to make the decision. I was the customer that most salesmen hate because I had 2 extreme sets of criteria that I wanted in a vehicle.  My husband and I knew going into this process that no vehicle was going to cover everything. Mr. Dooley at Southwest Auto Group is where we started since we were happy with our previous transaction with them.  Mr. Dooley realized very soon that we were juggling a potential apples to oranges comparison challenge.  He made us aware of that and proceeded to show us cars in each category. He presented the pros and cons of each car and guided us to and suggested other cars that we might want to consider looking at in order to obtain the best way of getting most of our wants in a vehicle after agreeing with us that we needed to stay away from making a fruit salad.  Roy Dooley is a delightful car salesman in that he is not just a salesman, he is a living socialable knowledgable textbook about cars, and not just the makes and models that are on his lot.  After thoroughly evaluating 9 cars, we found ourselves in the unique situation of me being equally happy with 2 very different models of cars. One was in the $15 - $17 thousand base price range and the other was in the $22 to $25 thousand base price range. The above cars were at two different dealerships and neither place had both kinds of vehicles.  Once we had narrowed the choice down to two cars, we made each dealership aware of what models we were going to decide between. We were as honest as possible with them and Mr. Dooley was just as ethical and honest with us.  He had the more expensive model, which is the one we ended up buying. We were impressed. Dan helped us with the final paperwork and receiving the check.  He very effectively and efficiently presented the ""extras"" and never once were we pressured into buying anything additional such as longer warranties, road assistance packages etc.  He did an excellent job of making sure that we understood the fine print and he got answers quickly when needed, while also being very personable and extremely careful in making sure the details were correct on the proper forms.  Again we were impressed. After the transaction we had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Michael Waitus, the Sales Director.  He is a man of integrity. I would like to highly recommend this dealership to any potential customers. They are not just trying to sell a product.  Purchasing a car there is akin to going into an old time mom & pop hardware store and explaining your challenge. Not only are you shown what they have to offer you are provided information on various ways of getting your goals accomplished with great advice and personably fantastic service at the same time.",5.0
840,"June 16, 2011",Mr Dooley made our buying experience very pleasurable. He was extremely professional and knowledgeable and showed us not only vehicles that we had requested to see but some that we were not aware of. We narrowed our choices down to three vehicles two that we knew were in our price range and one that was a dream vehicle. Mr. Dooley knew that we do not like to haggle and that he had one shot to present us with his best deal. He not only met our expectations but exceeded them. Thanks to Roy Dooley (salesman) and Dan Laux (finance dept.) we were able to purchase the dream vehicle. Thanks guys!,5.0

Overall an excellent experience and much better than the average auto dealer that I have dealt with.  They had a much larger inventory of vehicles that interested me, so I was more likely to find a vehicle that I wanted. Give them a try, you will be pleased.",4.8

I like the no non sense, no games approach to buying a vehicle. I ended up purchasing more options than I planned on but feel I was given a fair price for the vehicle and a fair trade and was never pressured on the deal.  It is an amazing vehicle and I love all the extras.

I was working in Weatherford several years ago and had used their service department which is the best - I was sorry they aren't very convenient now but think I will drive there to have my car serviced after the wonderful experience I had with the purchase.

The next day we left to help my brother and his family move to Houston and it drove like a dream.  Chad Williams helped us with the financing and I believe that God put us with the right people to make this purchase.

He was honestly one of the best sales people I have ever dealt with! 

We located the car in Abilene and went and got it. Mike called a few days later just to ask how things went and said that eventhough I did not buy him, that he understood how we need to take care of our mothers and that he would always be there to make sure she had any service or help that she needed with the car.  He gave me his email and direct number and told me or my mom to call anytime. What a guy! Skip the DFW and local dealers and go straight to Mike. This is how you run a business! ",5.0

I went to Southwest Ford and met Roy Dooley and was shown many used trucks and all looked good but I wasn't excited and the payments would be tough. Then Roy Dooley asked if he could show us a new pickup. He explained with the rebates and warranties and financing would make the payments lower on a new Ford pickup than a used pickup. We decided to buy a Ford F150 V-6 and Chad Williams helped us witht the paper work and explained everything as we went and we believe we got the best deal. I was very pleased that we were able to go through Roy Dooley for help and we did and do recommend him to go through for used or new purchases. We even took our daughter there to purchase a new Ford.

All of the staff we dealt with at SW were so kind and friendly, we stopped in just to look and ended up driving away with a 2011 Ford Escape, it was late in the evening and time for everyone to leave for the day, and they totally went out of their way to make us feel like we were the most important event that was happening and we had more than their undivided attention.

Overall our experience with SouthWest Ford was great.  We knew exactly what we were looking for before we arrived.  Roy Dooley (sales) had the car ready to look at and test drive the moment we got there.  The car was exactly as described in the online add.  The price, however, was higher than was described online.  They said it was an honest mistake and Roy (and the sales management) apologized for the error and offered some good faith and lowered the price to what we felt was very reasonable.  Overall the process was very low pressure and Roy was committed to making sure we understood the ins and outs of deal.

Based on previous experiences of buying cars we were expecting a bit of a run around with the financing.  We were literally shocked with how upfront and honest Chad Williams (finance officer) was about everything.  We knew our credit was not top notch and were expecting to be told that we would be getting a great deal at 15% or higher interest.  When Chad came back with the first financing break down I told him that everything looked great, but I knew that the interest rate he had written down (4.9%) was impossible for us.  He then flipped his computer screen around so I could see it and sure enough 4.9% was true!  Not only did he not jerk us around and play the whole ""I am your friend, but the bank is the greedy bad guy here"" routine, but he actually worked with us to explain all the options and we left with a payment that is about $50 a month less than what we had expected and planned for.

878,"October 02, 2010","This is the third vehicle I have bought from Southwest Ford in the past 5 years, the second in the past year.  By far it is the best dealership I have ever done business with.  Both the sales and the service departments are outstanding.  Its clear that Chris Bonnett sets the tone for the rest of the employees and everyone is knowledgeable, pleasant and helpful.  It is obvious they enjoy working at the dealership. 

Add a great line of Ford vehicles and a outstanding dealership like Southwest and you have winning combination.  I simply will not do business anyplace else.",5.0
879,"September 29, 2010","SOUTHWEST FORD IS GREAT! I HAVE BOUGHT 3 BRAND NEW F150 TRUCKS FROM THEM, AND WOULD NEVER THINK OF GOING ANY WHERE ELSE, GREAT JOB SOUTHWEST FORD! ALWAYS CURTIOUS AND PROFESSIONAL. FORD HAS ALWAYS MADE A GREAT PRODUCT, AND I WILL CONTINUE TO PURCHASE MY FORD PRODUCTS FROM SOUTHWEST.",5.0
880,"September 27, 2010","I give Southwest Ford 5 stars in new car sales!  I have bought two new Fusions there, and both times have been fantastic experiences.  The salesmen are polite and friendly, the ones I had were not that pushy, they just answered questions I had and showed me the bells and whistles of the cars, which basically sell themselves!  Finance was pretty easy, they looked for the best loan for me with the lowest interest rate, which I really appreciated, they could have easily financed it through their main finance company and not bothered looking up a better deal for me.  I thought the entire process was easy and I absolutely love my Fusion.  Also, I definitely recommend to add-on the Auto-Butler service when you are in Finance, it is defintely worth the money!",5.0

882,"September 12, 2010","I bought a new Ford Taurus at SW, which is unusual because I only buy a car once every 10 years.  So I was impressed that I got the best imaginable price from SW Ford --- in fact, it was the same as my last car purchase a decade ago!  And a got a larger, more ""bells & whistles"" car.  I am totally converted from the European cars because the styling and details of new Fords now match or exceed all my comparisons and are priced much, much better.  After 10 months, the car is still performing great and still has the ""brand new"" feeling.  Love it!  ",4.8
883,"September 06, 2010","After meeting with Brian on several occasions, we were able to get a great deal on the exact truck we wanted. all members of the staff from sales to finance were awesome to deal with.  if we ever need a new car in the future we will certainly be calling on Brian, thanks so much.",5.0
884,"September 01, 2010","I have dealt with Charlie Gilchrist since 1993 and have bought personal as well as business vehicles from his dealership.  I even recommended him to my son and sister whom have purchased cars there.  

Biggest asset is his office is open to all with no secretary/traffic cop to screen or redirect you.  Any issue he addresses personally and he is the one responsible for the answer you receive.  Some mega dealerships you cant find the person that is responsible for an answer.  

He as well as his employees not only have earned my business but my repeat business as well.   ",5.0
885,"May 24, 2009",I called the manager Chris Bonnett about purchasing a new 2009 Ford F150 Platinum Truck.  He assured me that they had the vehicle and that I needed to come out and see it.  I was very leary about that knowing that most dealerships would tell you they had the car just to get you out there.  He set me up to deal with the sales director Shane Hacker and the finance director Roger Newberry.  I made my way from Arlington out there to meet Shane and he already had the vehicle pulled up and clean for me to look at.  After a very simple negotiation process I spent some time with Mr. Newberry who arranged financing within 20 minutes and I signed up for my new truck.  This was by far the easiest and best experience I have ever had buying a car.  I will drive 30 minutes for my next vehicle and every other one I purchase.  This is the most professional staff and beautiful dealership I have ever encountered.  I strongly recommend this dealership and purchasing a vehicle from them.,5.0
886,"May 20, 2009","I have personally bought six vehicles from Southwest Ford in Weatherford, Texas over the past twelve years and others in my family have also purchased vehicles there.  The selection provided by Chris Bonnett, the Sales Manager is outstanding, second to none!  I tell them, first thing, give me your best price because I am not going to haggle.  Their price is always way better than the other guys.
  When I need service, Jimmy in Service has the best team I have ever seen. I never worry about getting ripped off at Southwest Ford in Weatherford. ",5.0
887,"May 19, 2009",I have been a customer with Southwest Ford for over 7 yrs on the sales and service side. I would not take my vehicle to any other dealership! The sales managers go out of there way to make sure you are happy before you leave the delership with your new vehicle. The service advisor I dealt with was very kind and made sure my vehicle was done in a timely manner. ,5.0
888,"May 12, 2009","This was the quickest car buying experience I ever had.  The sales man was very organized and didnt play games with me. Knew knew everything about the truck I purchased and went over all the operating proceedures that were new to me. He was very polite and dressed nice.
I should also mention the finance expert, Skip, he was the best I have ever met. I have bought a dozen new cars in my lifetime and never have I met a finace person that was as sharp as he was. As was the salesman, Skip was also very polite, organized and fast. 
Between the two of them, I look forward to buying my next car, rather than being drained and dreading the next time I have to buy a new car.",5.0
