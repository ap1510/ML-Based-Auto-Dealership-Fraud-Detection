0,"February 08, 2020",My name is Paul Lee and I've had a bad experience with this dealer ship I was told the vehicle I purchase was inspected and had no problems but while driving the vehicle home the Abs light came on I took the vehicle back to take care of this problem while I was there I told kelberth my sales person to have the noise the vehicle is making while I'm driving the vehicle he said the will have the mechanic check it out when he brought me my keys back he told me the mechanic said he didn't see anything wrong with the vehicle because I kept hearing the noise I took the vehicle to my mechanic and he told me on the passenger side the front wheel bearing are bad and needs to be replaced immediately he said the wheel could come off while I'm driving the vehicle so I paid to get the work done my mechanic said there is a noise coming from the rear of the vehicle I tried to contact Kim Eddy the General Manager of Sterling McCall Acura with no response I felt like I was being avoided when I was trying to get a vehicle I had no problems contacting anyone but now I have a problem I'm being avoided  I took along time before Kim Eddy called me she told me I wouldn't be reimbursed for fixing the vehicle I emailed Kim Eddy and ask her would the dealership fix the other problems with the vehicle that another shop I took the vehicle to said needed to be fix I never got a response back I also signed a cancellation form to cancell the warranties I was trick into by the finance guy who did the paperwork he lead me to believe the paperwork work was part of the loan agreement  but they where not the warranties were optional the only thing this dealership needed to do was the right thing don't lie and trick people just be upfront and onest  not deceitful and manipulative I gave this dealership a 1 star rating.,1.0

2,"December 14, 2019",Worse place in Houston to make any car purchase. My wife recently purchased a vehicle from them that has major mechanical problems that they knew of. We took the car in 2 days after the purchase date and the basically blew us of and said there's nothing they can do uh until the warranty kicks in so my wife had to ride around in this car that throwing out smoke and exhaust fumes with my little nephew in the car and they could care less we tried to return the car and they didn't even bother to try to help us resolve this issue they basically said we're stuck with it please do not use this place for any of your purchases kim eddy the general manager is super rude as well,1.0
3,"December 06, 2019","12/6/2019, At Sterling McCall Acura trying to get a car for my god son with his mother. After negotiating a price the sales representative went to check with another man on the price negotiation.  So then a man named ""Blake* came out,  full of negative  energy, and stated, "" there's nothing more I can do.""  I asked about lowering the price on the 2011 Toyota Corolla we were trying to buy. He said he already lowered the price. I told him we were trying to pay cash if we could get the price down. He was very stern and said he could not do it.  I asked, ""can not or will not?"" He then rudely  said, ""neither!""  I told him between me and my god son's mother, we have bought 4 vehicles from Sterling McCall Toyota over the years, what about customer loyalty? ""Blake"" said, ""I'll make it esay, this is all I'm going to do"" and pushed the same offer sheet toward us. Simply stated, ""Blake* was Rude, Arrogant, Nasty and Mean Spirited!  We did not let ""Blake's Nasty Disposition"" stop us from getting the car, because the car was for my god son. Shame on you ""Blake* for your lack of compassion for loyal customers and your nasty disposition!",1.0
4,"November 07, 2019","Long story short, I bought a 2015 Acura TLX V6 on Jan. 2017 from Sterling McCall and I also paid couple thousand dollars for Extended Warranty. The odometer was read about 18K miles. Today, the odometer is reading 34,421 miles, running perfectly fine, no warning lights, nothing wrong at all and 4 new tires. However, on the Oct. 31 (Halloween) the temperature in Houston area was drop to 31-degree Fahrenheit. It was cold on Thursday morning and my Acura couldn’t start so I had to jump cable to make it started. However, three warning lights VSA system, Precision All-Wheel Steer System, and Check Transmission were showing on the Dashboard. Next Friday morning my Acura couldn’t start so I had to jump cable again to make it started. So, I decided to drop my Acura to Sterling McCall Dealer next Saturday morning to check which I did. So, I met Christian Gonz as a Service Advisor. I told him the battery issue. First, he told me my Acura is not under warranty that is wrong. He said, it takes 2 hour and 30 minutes to find out. I told him OK, please call my cell phone, I have to go lunch with my friend. Around 4PM, he called me and asked when was the last time I replaced the battery. I told him I never did since I bought that car. Then, he said the battery wasn’t original from Acura, he had to find out on Monday because the store is about to close soon and closed Sunday. He offered me loan a car that I declined. On Monday around 5PM he called me and told me the battery was replaced that also fixed the other two warning lights but the Precision All-Wheel Steer System is not gone away and stay. He also said there was Coke spilled on SBW Shifter could causes the problem and not under warranty. I told him I never drink Coke or Soda. He asked me to pay $164.50 for diagnostic to find the root cause. I said OK go ahead. Next Tuesday around 8:10AM, he called me and said that SBW Shifter needs to be replace that cost $768.20 before Tax and Shop Fee. I declined that because I don’t have that much money at the time, in the mean time I still pay $1100 on my Credit Card for 4 tires that replaced couple months ago from Sterling McCall. My Acura was recalled to fix something else, they recommended to replace 4 tires which I did and cost me little over $1100. Around 9:30AM on Tuesday 11/05/2019, I picked up my Acura and paid $168.50 for diagnostic (the code PC26C3). But, all the three warning lights VSA system, Precision All-Wheel Steer System, and Check Transmission were still on the Dashboard. So, the other two warning lights were not fixed as he said. I talked to my friend about it. He took my Acura on the same day and went to his friend’s shop. In 30 minutes, he took a picture on my Acura’s Dashboard and called me BaM! it cleared. It needs to reset after battery die or replaced battery, that’s it. Problems solved. Bottom line, Mr. Christian Gonz lies to me several times about my Acura that is not under warranty, Coke spilled, SBW Shifter damaged, battery not original and pop, the Precision All-Wheel Steer System must be fixed cost $768.20 first to clear the other two warning lights, I believed they didn’t do any diagnostic but charged me $168.50 for it,  and kept blah blah blah. I’m working hard to earn money to pay Rent, Dental, Insurance, Car, Utilities, Gas and Food, but not waste money like this to Sterling McCall. From now on, I never buy or bring any car from or to Sterling McCall again, they are not honor their warranty, dishonest, lies, made some problems up to avoid under warranty, treat their customers like idiots. I need to call in to cancel Extended Warranty because it is not worth it since Sterling McCall Dealer is not honor that. ",1.0
5,"October 26, 2019","Complete waste of my time! I had an appointment scheduled to see a vehicle, to only find out that it had been sold the day before. Instead of receiving a courtesy call/email to notify me about the status of the vehicle, I drove for over an hour to find out that the dealer I had an appointment with was “sick”, and that the car was no longer available. I will never do business with this company! ",1.6
6,"September 16, 2019","This is my 3rd Acura  purchase from Sterling McCall dealership. My salesman Darrell Babineaux went above and beyond to make sure my car purchase was smooth and delivered the same day. Darrell is perhaps the most knowledgeable person I have ever met, very professional, courteous, and willing to go out of his way to assure the customer of the best possible experience and outcome. I receive a best deal and can not say enough good things about him. Definitely he made my car buying experience more pleasurable than I'm used to. I am so happy with my purchase of Acura RDX A-spec 2019. I will send anyone to Darrell. Thank you for all your help and support.

7,"March 02, 2019","Nov 10, 2018, I Purchased a 2007 Honda Accord with 120,000 Miles. Within 2 months I had to replace the brake pads and the starter. It is now Mar 2, 2019 (less than 4 months ownership)  and the belts are making a noise. I asked them to repair it and refused, they say I should have bought an extended warranty, and that the car passed inspection. Well, It looks to me that their inspection standards are very lax or non-existent.   

So, Buyer beware My recommendation is to bring a mechanic with you. Have them replace the worn parts that the mechanic points out and then sign the paperwork,  Paying 100 usd to a mechanic is well worth it. As the repairs can cost 500-1000 usd.",1.0

9,"December 21, 2018","Terrible and shady people..they will lie to you to get you to sign the papers and after that you on your own ... Purchased a sedvehicle from them , they told me i had a 300mile warranty, I took it back the next day because i found so many things wrong with the car .. they took it and kept it for over a week only for them to tell me they can't fix any of it because it would be too expensive and not profitable for them ... Is that how to do business ?... would not recommend anyone buying from them.",1.4
10,"December 21, 2018",If I could give a negative 5000 rating I would! I highly DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE!! FROM DAY 1 ADAM (sales person) has promised to get a vehicle fixed in which we were buying and that has not been done. I have visited this place over 10x pertaining a vehicle that we were promised would be fixed. It has been over a week and we have only been able to drive the vehicle for 4hrs!!!! They have had the car in their care this entire time only to pull us into the store to tell us that their main function on a used car is to only make sure it drives not the stereo capability. They have ran the credit over 4x claiming to get a deal done when they recieved a 21%apr rate and we went home and recieved a 11%apr rate. We were told by Gabe (finance manager) we were meeting with the director and they brought in a (sales manager) Thomas instead to try and make us stay with the 21%apr rate. This makes no f******* since. Be aware who your dealing with! I WILL BE COMPLAINING TO CORPORATE! ALL THESE OTHER REVIEWS MUST BE BOUGHT BY THE DEALERSHIP BECAUSE WE WERE DEFINITELY NOT TREATED APPROPRIATELY! By the way GABE ALSO STATED SINCE WE DIDNT HAVE ANYTHING IN WRITING FROM ADAM THAT WE SIGNED THE PAPERWORK AND THE DEAL HAS BEEN DONE!,1.0
11,"October 15, 2018","On Sept 5 I turned my Acura RDX in early, it was due Sept 7. I needed a new tire. I confirmed they had the tire available and had my car towed, by Acura, to the dealership. When I arrived they had sold my tire. I spoke to management who took my payment for a new tire and gave me a receipt for turning my car in. On Oct 14th I received a credit alert that my credit score had DROPPED because Sterling Acura of Houston DID NOT turn my car in to financing!!!!! After 2 hours on the phone, and thankfully receipt proff, I got the delinquency off and am told it will stay on my credit for 6 weeks. ",1.0

17,"January 08, 2018","I dropped in toe Sterling McCall Acura without an appointment to have my battery checked (car had died overnight) and, since I was already there, do a routine maintenance (oil change, tire rotation).  It was Monday afternoon and they were busy, but the service advisor accommodated me into the schedule and patiently explained the issue with the battery.  I opted to wait for the car even though a loaner had been offered. 
During a lull in traffic, the advisor came and talked to me about maintenance items I might want to consider if I planned on keeping the car longer (the car is already old!).  He explained things clearly including which might be deferred and which would pose a risk of a more expensive repair.  He also explained the cost associated with each repair and the work involved.
I found the conversation quite educational and helpful.",5.0

28,"December 12, 2017","In a 14 year relationship with this dealer for purchase and service , this was my worst experience. I called in advance to set up an appointment to see if I could have a state inspection done in roughly an hour. I was assured that it was not a problem. When I arrived, I asked again could I get in and out in roughly an hour. Yes I was told. After about 15 minutes in the waiting area the service rep. came out to say that my battery was ""dead"". I could only treat this with skeptisism since the car had never even had a hard or slow start. Yet when I'm here just for an inspection, it is stone cold ""dead"". Bear in mind that I drive the car everyday and never had the slightest indication when starting the car.
Nevertheless I agreed to buy a new battery from the dealer ( I'm sure they don't make much on doing state inspections.). So after two hours I see my car get driven to the customer pickup area. Thinking that Iwould be out of there soon I sat for 25 more minutes watching. my car. I finally asked someone to check for me and it took ten more minutes to confirm that my car was indeed ready. When I get to the cashier I am informed that the state inspection was not done and it would be a week or 150 miles before all of the monitoring was reset before the car would pass inspection. Remember, the purpose of the visit was an inspection and I needed to be in and out in about an hour. I can't help but feel like I was sold a battery when what I needed was an inspection. In the end I didn't get the inspection and missed the appoinments I had for that afternoon.",2.4
29,"December 11, 2017",Went in to look at vehicles. Tommy was helpful and  not pushy. Eventually we settled on an MDX and everything went smoothly. This was a positive purchase experience. Would buy from Tommy again when we are ready for an RDX.,5.0

34,"November 29, 2017","As consumers, we should be informed of what to expect when visiting a place of business which is why I am taking the time to write this review of my personal experience at Sterling McCall Acura. I contacted this dealership on 11/28/2017 to test drive a used 2014 Lexus GS350 listed on a car website and ensure that the car was in stock. I informed the dealership that I would be traveling 30 miles from my house and that I did not have any time to waste, and in turn they responded that they had the car and it would be ready to test drive when I arrived. I arrived on time and met with the sales person (Dammy) who said he had to retrieve the car. I waited for approximately 10 minutes and when Dammy returned there was no car. He stated that the car was having tire issues and had been sent to the service shop for repairs the prior day to which I questioned why I had not been informed before driving 45 minutes to the other side of town. He apologized and asked if I would like to test any other cars, and I stated I did not. I left feeling lied to and very frustrated so I called the sales manager, explained the situation, and asked why they had wasted my time. He stated how they have so many cars and that it's hard to keep track of all of them and apologized and said that he would personally call me back shortly to look for another car close to the same price range for me. I never heard back from him. I do not hold anything against the salesperson as he is not the one I spoke to on the phone who told me the car would be ready. I do hold the sales manager responsible because his attitude shows me that he does not care about his customers. I take this personally because my time was stolen from me and cannot be replaced. This was my experience, and I will be posting it on as many websites as possible to inform others until I hear back from this dealership.",1.0

68,"September 26, 2017","It was time to trade in old faithful. 100,000 trouble free miles from our '12 Acura MDX.

My wife and I were looking at several vehicles including the Volvo XC 90, Mercedes Benz GLS450 and Audi Q7 3.0t.

All of those vehicles went out the window after we looked at the '17 Acura MDX Hybrid Sport Advance model. 

I searched inventory at several local dealerships who all seemed to have similar inventory.  I made an appointment to see the new Acura MDX at a dealership and when I arrived, I asked for(Anonymous) in sales and was informed that there was no one there by that name.  I made a mistake and went to the wrong dealership!

It turned out NOT to be a mistake when I walked into the showroom at Sterling McCall Acura.  I was promptly and curteously greeted by Darrell Babineaux.

I informed Darrell of the model and trim we were looking for and he informed us that he had a vehicle for us to see.   I was o.k. with any color as long as it was white.

We walked out to the lot and looked at a '17 Acura MDX.  White/Espresso in color.  This seemed to be the right vehicle for us.  

This is where I met Sales Mgr. Edwin Gonzales.  I informed Darrell of where I needed to be price wise and he delivered!  The price I received is too low for me to post on this review.

Mgrs. Edwin Gonzales and Kim Eddy are straight shooters.  They were up front with me from the beginning and gave me the best price on my trade in and on the new vehicle.

I met service Mgr. Mario Quiroz where my car is being serviced as I write this post.  I will continue to service my new Acura at Sterling McCall for years to come.

Lastly I met finance Mgr. Clayton Lewis who went over all the new car offers through Sterling McCall Acura.  I was in and out of finance in less than 25 minutes!  Sign me up!

I called Sterling McCall Acura several times during my new car purchase and was always greeted with a friendly voice and helpful person.  (Melissa Bruder)

I am overwhelmingly satisfied with Darrell Babineaux and all of the staff at Sterling McCall Acura!

94,"July 13, 2017","It's a shame that I have to even give this place one star to leave a review but here goes.

To start, we were looking at a 4Runner this dealership had listed at their location.  We live in Denver so we made sure to get as much information from the sales person over the phone regarding the condition of the vehicle prior to committing to the car.  The sales person at first interaction was very rushed and pushy.  He wanted us to sign documents to agree to a price on the car before even seeing or driving it.  Maybe he had too much coffee at 6pm?  Who knows.  But once we confirmed that they were going to perform the usual 180 point inspection for used vehicles at a brand name dealership, we waited for the results.  Shortly after, our sales person told us everything checked out with inspections and it was going to be cleaned that night so it was ready for us in the morning.  Easy right? 

NOPE! Once my husband was able to test drive it, he noticed issues that sent the car back to their mechanics only to show there were three rather important elements that needed replacement.  When we mentioned that the sales person confirmed everything checked out, he rebutted with ""I meant the safety checks that are Texas standards checked out. Not the mechanical inspection.""  So then why tell us the car checked out as far as the safety regulations? SHADY AMBIGUOUS LANGUAGE.  At this point, the dealership agreed to replace the cheapest and easiest problem which was fine by us.  The other two [which included shocks and struts] they quoted around a $1,000.  After doing some research on the 4Runner, I called my husband to confirm the vehicle did not have a high performance suspension system as that would be a much higher price tag confirmed by a shop near our house to replace all the necessary parts to which the sales person confirmed 'It's just the stock suspension.'  I confirmed with a Toyota dealership that this model did in fact have the high performance suspension as part of the package and promptly called my husband.  He began pressing the sales rep for a firm verbal confirmation that we were not dealing with this high performance suspension system, his confidence in their 25 year mechanics started to drop off saying '25 years isn't that long to know what kind of suspension system they were looking at.'  SHADY AMBIGUOUS LANGUAGE. After all of this misleading information from the sales staff and 5 hours at the dealership, we walked away from the car and the entire ordeal cost us several hundred dollars for my husband to waste a day off at their dealership without any offers of transportation back to an airport. 

I strongly urge anyone looking for a car to avoid this dealership like the plague.  But for those of you that like having papers shoved in your face while being given the run around or having your questions completely ignored by the sales reps and the managers, then enjoy your experience with the steaming cesspool of a business that is Sterling McCall Acura in Houston Texas.",1.2

",1.0
99,"June 02, 2017","I purchased a 2014 Acura MDX from them in March. Here are the issues I faced that you should consider and be aware of:

1) Do not purchase Acuracare from them. They quoted about $3000 and sold it to me for $1,900. The same evening I checked online and was able to easily get the same coverage for $1200.

2) The folks at financing are not truthful. It is one thing to make a profit and another to lie. They implied to me that a lender would provide me a better rate if I purchased Acuracare. That is not true. The dealership chooses to provide a better rate (that is already offered by the lender based on your credit) if you purchase Acuracare at an exorbitant rate from them.

3) The finance department is absolutely unresponsive if you decide to cancel any of the services. You can cancel Acuracare within 60 days and I cancelled it within 14 days. They take 6-8 weeks to process the cancellation in the first place. It has been more than 8 weeks and they are yet to process the refund and they do not respond to calls or emails.

4) Take a good mechanic along to purchase any used vehicle. I purchased a 2014 MDX and I found out (when the car was being inspected for our relocation) that it had had multiple paint jobs all around that was due to body damange and this was hidden by the dealership. They had sold the car in 2014 and maintained it since then and were aware of all the damage.",1.4

101,"March 03, 2017","Wow rude sales people and sales director. They are very shady there. They claimed that Acura currently don't have any discounts or incentives and there's no way to get a lower price. Really who in their right mind would pay MSRP?! They were trying to take advantage of us because we were two females. Because the other Acura dealerships were offering thousands of dollars off for the same vehicle so I know they are shady!! I know because I email the internet sales manager for different dealerships. 

Additionally, I let them know that a competitor car brand in a similar price range was being heavily discounted and the sales director basically called me a liar! Not only that he goes off and lies to us stating that he called them and verified that price was not possible. So of course we get up and leave Acura and go next door to purchase that very car for a lesser price!

106,"October 24, 2016","Have been coming to Sterling McCall for years.  I have been wanting to trade in my Acura sedan for an Acura SUV for some time.  I had my car appraised in July at Sterling McCall and have since been in contact with a couple of sales people.  I came in on Friday to get my car re-appraised and brought my Dad for company and a second opinion.  Several sales people gave us the run around.  First, they said it take 20 minutes, which would make sense since they have already appraised my car just a couple of months ago.  During that time, we had asked to look at a pre-owned vehicle they had on the lot.  About 35 minutes went by and they told us they had sold the car we were interested in. There were several men in the managers office, just talking and laughing, did not appear the dealership was even busy or working on appraising my vehicle.  During this point, someone who appeared to be a sales manager told us it would be a couple more minutes and offered for us to go out to dinner on them if we would make a deal with them today.  We told them we were not going to make a snap decision and needed to know how much they were offering for my car before we could make our next move.  A lot more time went by and we still did not have an answer on the figure they were willing to give for my vehicle, a 2014 Acura ILX. We wound up getting the keys and leaving without a figure.  As a young women, I felt as if they could have cared less about my business, even though I was paying cash!  They were not transparent and just kept us going in circles and wasted our time.  This situation proved to be unfortunate. I always enjoyed getting my car serviced with Charlie in the service department.  I wound up purchasing a car this weekend, and it was not from Sterling McCall. ",1.3

I explained my current situation to him, and his response was don't worry I will help you purchase a car.  He asked what kind of car I wanted and directed my to their website.  I selected the car I wanted, and he pretty much did the rest.  Because of my demanding work and work schedule, he drove the car to me for my review and test drive.  I spent less than an hour at the dealership before I driving  away in my new car.  The finance managers were very kind and helpful as well.

Needless to say,  my credit was not on point and I was able to get financed.

114,"April 14, 2016","Sterling McCall's service department is by far the most outstanding group of people you will ever have the opportunity to associate yourself with. I am over 40 years old, so I can say I have dealt with many service writers, technicians, porters, etc. etc., and these individuals are very professional and courteous. When I went out to purchase a new car, in 2013, for my wife, we shopped everywhere from Ford to BMW. We ultimately decided on the 2014 Acura MDX, which was just rolling off the truck in July 2013, and we are very happy with it. Almost immediately I had to take it in for service and that's where it almost got very ugly. The dealership I leased from was very close to my house, no other reason, but they almost ruined my whole experience. On all 5 visits to their service department I thought wow, what a mistake I made coming here. Finally, I decided to drive 13 miles out of my way, to a different Acura dealer, Sterling McCall, and as angry as I was by this point, I am so glad I did.  I was at the point that I actually considered turning my lease in early and paying the penalties. However, after dealing with Sterling McCall, I not only love the Acura name again, I went ahead and bought out my lease. I really want to thank you folks at Sterling McCall service for proving to me that  there are still people out there who actually care about one another and not just their bottom line.",4.6
115,"April 08, 2016","I purchased a certified preowned Acura MDX at Sterling McCall Acura in June 2015. My purchase experience was fine ... no issues at all.  My problem occurred three months later when I had a blowout on a rear driver-side tire.  When removing the failed tire I discovered that a piece of plastic ... yes plastic ... had penetrated the treads and sidewall, causing the blowout.  I also learned that the tires that Sterling McCall installed, to meet the certification requirements for my ""luxury"" preowned vehicle, were Chinese-made ""Linglong Crosswind"" tires.   It didn't take but about ten minutes of research on my iPhone to find out that these tires are very poor quality and quite possibly dangerous, not to mention costing me about 5 miles to a gallon in fuel efficiency.   I replaced all four tires with quality Michelins and had the Linglongs sent to the dump where they belong. 

Shame on me for not doing my homework at the dealership before my purchase, but I find it appalling that Sterling McCall chooses to jeopardize their customer's safety as well as their reputation just to save a few bucks.  I shelled out over $1,200 to replace the crappy Chinese tires with the Michelins and I would have gladly upgraded from the Linglongs, perhaps saving about half of this, had the dealer offered it at the time of purchase.

We even took our issue up with Acura and they stood by their dealership. So be it. This will be the last Acura I own as well. Hello Lexus!

My wife and I were fortunate it wasn't a front tire that blew or we may have had a serious accident.  I will not do business with this dealership or any Acura dealership again simply because I'm convinced these greedy practices aren't limited to tire selection.  I will also be sure everyone I know is aware.

My wife and I had the one we wanted picked out, and began the negotiation process with salesman Sammi (I think..I can't remember I'm so aggravated from the other guy...Raad?)  Anyway, Sammi was great and patient and showed us a few vehicles we were looking at.  I made a low offer to Sammi (negotiation 101), who in turn took it to his manager, who then came in and began lecturing me on how the car business works - appreciate it kid...I've bought cars before - and basically berated me and walked out the door...yup, turned his back and walked out on me.  I had $14,000 cash in my pocket, ready to make a deal, and I took it down the street to another dealer I knew from previous dealings and bought a car.  (same year, same model, same mileage, and at the price I wanted).

Let's support a person that believes in our kiddos and gives to the community. He has also given to other schools in our district. Again, a huge thank you from the staff and students of Marcella.",5.0
123,"December 07, 2015",Salesman Darrel Babineaux was great. Really helped me find a car that I liked and that was within my budget. He continued to search multiple cars until he could find one that was suitable for me. I would recommend Darrel to anyone. ,5.0
124,"November 11, 2015","Went with my wife to buy a new RDX. MJ was the salesman assisting us. He told us that we could not get to price we wanted on the new RDX. The sales manager came to meet us and suggested a certified pre-owned. We really liked the car and was told they could get us at the price we wanted. MJ then noted that they could not do that after we drove the preowned one and liked it. My wife and I had both bought new Acura's from this dealership in the past. I felt as if they were not honest at all with us. We purchased a new Infiniti from Southwest Infiniti and absolutely love it. We will never buy from Sterling McCall again, and I will definitely let everyone know about my experience. ",2.5
125,"October 28, 2015","DO NOT BUY ANYTHING!!!! At  Sterling McCall Acura
In April 2015, I bought a 2014 Focus at Sterling McCall Acura, in which my wife and I love the car design, sporty feel, interior and sleek look of the car. 
At the time of test drive a few things were noticed about the car which were, rear tire noise, tire balance 
and serious transmission noise. The obvious issues were the jerking, sudden launching and shudder of the transmission and we were told that it was a hybrid transmission and that was normal. 
 The salesperson suggested that we purchase extended warranty just in case.  We went ahead and bought the car with the agreement that the issues were going to be fixed.  
 A few days later the car was brought back to fix the issues.  I was told that all of the issues were fixed.  Tires were changed and balanced and the transmission was looked at and was Ok.  I told the sales guy to put the information on paper and give it to me.  He never did.  He asked me to return the loaner car. 
And that the service manager would call me about the transmission.
I continued to send email notification to the sales guy but were avoided and never responded to. 
The car continued to make transmission noise and worsen as the months passed. 
The dealer and salesman were looking out for this best interest and not the one for the customer !!
I was never contacted by the service manager regarding how the transmission was “looked at” or serviced. 
I am stuck with the car with a bad and unsafe transmission,  the car launches suddenly, hesitates as low gears and it is unsafe to drive, this car should have never been sold to anybody if they knew that the transmission was bad.  	DO NOT BUY ANYTHING!!!! At  Sterling McCall Acura. 

",2.8
126,"October 24, 2015","I would not recommend this dealership to anybody. Because I bought the car from this dealership and had following experience. 
The Sale Person showed me car twice  in  dirty condition. I had stains all over the seat. I had to make 4 trips to get it cleaned. 
Their director sales get involved but he was not so professional either. The care was given to me without car mats. broken cover of USB connections. and I am still waiting on this. I think if someone is paying almost 30K for a car. The dealership needs to show more courtesy. 

It seems the whole sales staff is untrained and unprofessional. The one sales person told to take the car home and come back to get it clean. 

I would not recommend this dealership for their unprofessional behavior.

It was not a certified car, so within a week and a half the gas cap light came on so I took it back to get serviced because I tried tightening it and did not work. After they checked the car the service manager calls me to give me a lengthy list of things they found wrong with the car, The gas cap light turned out to be a problem with the evaporator canister valve so that had to be replaced. Also they informed me that the front and side motor mounts were completely broken, also they said the car needed the timing belt replaced and that meant the water pump as well. Also the oil pump seals were leaking. This was a few dollars shy of a $1,000!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! For a car I had just bought a couple weeks earlier!! I had not even made the first payment on the car and I already had a grand to invest in it. To make matters worse, the 'warranty' they sold me for the car (that I did not request and stupid mistake of mine that I just signed it when I bought the car) did not cover most of that work. They said they were 'pre-existing' conditions and would not be covered by the warranty!!!! Needless to say I was beyond LIVID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! After fighting with them and me doing my own research I learned an AS IS car is just that. BUT, I was told by mechanics, a lawyer, as well as the lady with the warranty company that this information about the lengthy problems with the car could have been disclosed by the sales person. I FELT BETRAYED AND TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF!!! I HAD TO PAY A GRAND ON A CAR I BOUGHT OFF THIS LOT WITHIN A COUPLE OF WEEKS!!!

At first everything was excellent they would tell you what you needed and recommend the only what was necessary. They would inspect everything and give you a report. Recently after spending over 2500 dollars in service they stopped doing a good job diagnosing the car. They would just do the minimum charge you and send you on the way. After that service something always seemed off. First it was just the power steering pump they replaced the pump and then it was a engine cleaning. The power steering still makes a noise and then it was a belt tensioner. They waste your time when I first told them of all the problems and they just fix one and don't follow up with the other ones. They take your money and waste your time with repeated service calls. Then they break your car!! First they broke my center console and it took many calls with the service manager and general manager to get that fixed they didn't even try to call me back and had to track them down. Then my rims mysteriously were bent in the front and ever since the clutch on my car has never felt right. Which they refuse to do anything about. I pay good money to not have to worry about when another thing is going to go wrong. The icing on the cake was when I get a call back from Richard Hudson to try and address the issues. He questions how I spend my money and why I didn't come back to do the service! Last time I checked you don't have to answer those kind of questions unless you are married to that person. I won't be taking my car back there anymore. They used to do a good job now they just go through the motions, take your money and make you late by making you wait two hours to pickup your car!",1.2

Somtime at the end of April or beginning of May I brought my car back for a minor paint chip repair on the front passenger door.  I won't go into all the details or the drama I had to go through to get this small job done.  Finally this month, October, my car was completed.  The paint job was not to manufacturing specifications but acceptable.  There are a couple of outstanding services that still need to be completed, which I'm sure will get done in a timely manner and to my satisfaction.

Sterling McCall (Randy Khalaf and Ronnie Metersky) gave special attention to the small details and made sure that this job was done correctly commuinicating very often to the repair shop.  Randy and Ronnie went beyond their call of duty to keep me satisfied and a very happy customer.

I am glad to have my car back.  Now I can start to really enjoy driving my car.

we purchased our fourth Acura from Sterling McCall Acura. The service was ""Second To None"". We were treated with the utmost courtesy and respect. Our Salesperson Hermie was a tremendous help in selecting our New MDX. He made sure we were able to add the running boards and roof racks at a tremendous price and get it all done in one day. When we picked up our new MDX Hermie made sure everything was perfect. He even touched up a few areas that were missed by the Make ready people. We were shown all the features of the MDX and Hermie made sure our phones were connected to the Bluetooth option and he gave us a simple instruction on setting up the garage door opener. 

We have owned Mercedes, BMW, Lexus and other luxury autos before but by far Sterling McCall Acura goes the extra mile in making sure every customer is satisfied before they leave the dealership. 

Mike Chan the Sales Manager made sure the price of our trade and new purchase were satisfactory to us. We were treated very well on our trade, something that does not happen often when trading in a vehicle.

We scheduled a meeting for Friday morning. Danny was prepared, the car was already waiting, test drive and everything was over in 20 minutes. Then I left, waisted time with some other dealerships, and called Danny after few hours to tell him I would like to see the car inspected at my mechanic (Botis @ Montrose & Richmond, another great guy). Denny took it there himself (!!!), then took care that few glitches were repaired in the same day. I've checked in again at 5:30pm and out in one hour with all the documents in hand.

I've been with at least half a dozen dealers this week. Half of them lied about the cars; after a phone call telling them which cars I would like to see,  I visited them to find out that the models I was looking for were not there and they were just showing me something else, typically more expensive and trashy. Most of them were ignorant (nothing was prepared in advance), aggressive (they are dealers for years and are always right), and pushy (buy our car, you will not get any better one for this price). If not for Denny, buying a car would be a nightmare.

So I here thank Denny Holiday for help, positive attitude, calmness and a very positive experience.",5.0

I have brought my car in 3 times, today 7/25/13 being the third time.  The paint job has been done very poorly with no attention to detail.  Ronny has been great to try to get this rectified but to no avail.  Management needs to investigate this matter immediately.  I have not been able to enjoy my new car due to the poor quality of work done with the paint job.  Not to mention the drives back and forth from my office downtown Houston.  

Description: 1st attempt there was a dark shadow on the passenger front door that was very obvious.  Overspray of paint/chemicals on my front windshield and on the trim around the front door. 
On the 2nd attempt, they was a bubble above the door handle on the front passenger door and the dark shadow now appears on both passenger doors which doesn't make sense.  Paint looks dull.
Third attemp is today, 7/25/13.  I hoping that this time the job will be done with perfection.  

The paint seems dull and not shiny as it should.  I purchased the Resist All when I bought my MDX.  This needs to be redone entirely on the passenger side.  If the paint job is not corrected this third time, I will be forced to request a new MDX idential to the one I bought.

161,"June 19, 2011","My husband and I heard about the 0.9% special financing and just thought we would stop by and take a look.  I had purchased a 2003 TL-S from Michael R back in May of 2002, and although I had transmission problems and had to trade it in for another car, my TL is still my favorite car to this day.  Back when I had all the issues with the transmission, Jack Chambers took great care of me, did everything in his power to take care of my needs, and I have nothing but positive memories of my experience. So when I paid off my Honda CR-V, I had an itch for a new car and the 0.9% special made me even more curious.  I sent in an internet price request and Aaron Strand responded.  My husband returned the call and spoke with Aaron and Lee Mitchell. We arranged to come by and speak with them some time on the busy Memorial Day weekend.  We were greeted immediately, taken back to Lee's office and explained our situation.  Back in 2009, we had to file bankruptcy after my husband lost his job. He has since secured a great job and we have worked hard to get back on our feet.  We were upfront and honest about our circumstances and never felt judged. We filled out a financial disclosure form and Ki Yoon began the process of qualifying us.  Aaron and Lee then went about finding the right car.  We originally felt the new Forged Silver was not the color for us, but after test driving the Black, White, and Charcoal decided we preferred the silver. We made these guys work; I tend to be very particular, ask alot of questions, and take a very long while to make decisions. Aaron and Lee were so patient with me.  After much deliberation where there was no pressure, no haggling, no uncertainties, no long waits, we finally chose the Forged Silver with Technology package.  I never felt they were trying to upsale me but all the information they gave me made perfect sense.  We drove away that night and have had no regrets or buyers remorse whatsoever.  We even went back several times to have Aaron help with the bluetooth integration and help us with the navigation system.  Poor Aaron must be the most patient person.  He helped two self-proclaimed techno-phobes understand and even went the extra mile to sort through some cell phone issues that weren't his responsibility.  He went several extra miles. As did each and every staff member. Many people remembered us from back in the day when I owned my original TL.  Jack Chambers even remembered specifics about my first TL that I had forgotten.  
We are so glad we chose to purchase our new TL from Sterling McCall.  I have and will continue to tell everyone about my wonderful experiences.

Sterling McCall was nearest to where I lived and I've dealt mostly with Jack Chambers, who is probably the most pleasant man you'll ever meet, although Tim Machuca gives him a run for his money.  He's always up front, honest and in the case of my starter bent over backwards to get me the best deal. I've gone to Sterling McCall Acura ever since.  When you pull up they have someone outside to greet you and start prepping the car, when you walk in the door you're greeted again and directed to your service advisor.  The service advisors I've dealt with (Jack Chambers and Tim Machuca) are thorough in making sure every request you have is completed.  On a recent visit I asked Tim if, when the car was being washed, they could vacuum glass off my passenger seat from a recent break-in.  He said they would but couldn't guarantee they could get it all.  Well the passenger seat looks amazing and I don't see any glass on the floor either.  It seems as if everyone they employ goes above and beyond!  I've been told having service at a dealer is more expensive and if that's the case you get what you pay for here, excellent customer service.  While you wait they have free wi-fi to stay connected, water and coffee to keep you quenched, and television to keep you distracted, although I've never waited longer than an hour.  If the wait is longer or a part is needed they've always hooked me up with a loaner.  I really couldn't ask for more which is why I drive 20 miles to get my car serviced.

We looked at one car in particular that I had my eyes on but since I had test drove one of a similar type so I was not really interested in test driving it, however Darrell insisted. I actually fell in love with the car at that point. Darrell took me inside and proceeded to offer me the best deal he possibly could and I knew that because I had done extensive research on that particular vehicle. We went over figures pretty late but I was still not sold. While we went over those figures Darrell and I began a personal and spiritual conversation that at the time I really needed. The compassion he showed for his a fellow man, a man that he had never met was amazing. It helped to provide a deeply enriching experience that I was not expecting. Well needless to say it got pretty late and I didn't buy the car that day, so Darrell cleaned it up for me and let me take it home. Well I ended up keeping the car.

He was very professional, treated me with respect, and I didn't feel like he was playing games like so many other places do (trying to show you vehicles they know you aren't interested in, trying to convince you to buy new when you are set on buying pre-owned, pushing you out onto their lot to keep you at the dealership longer, etc.).  Buying this vehicle was a daunting task given all the pressure I had received from some sales people and because of  the lack of respect I was being shown by others for being female (not to mention having to lug my two little kids w/ me most of the time).

226,"July 13, 2010","Overall, the buying experience was pressure-free, friendly, and professional. However, I received no follow-up after my initial visit/test drive. Only after a second visit did anyone seem to take my interest seriously. Additionally, the finance guy tried to sell me protection packages at the table, including a tire replacement package while quoting me a grossly wrong price for a rim. I walked over to parts dept, got the right price, and then declined the insurance. The primary sales persons, Darrell Lowe and Shelby Eastin, were very helpful, especially when I needed a car immediately.

This dealership seems to stock the largest selection of Acura's, so it's a good starting point for anyone looking for an Acura.  But I've walked thru the showroom many times browsing and not received attention, even when absolutely nothing seems to be going on.  I think maybe they don't think I'm serious or old enough to buy a car.",4.6

243,"June 15, 2010","I live in Austin, TX and had been looking all over Texas for approximately 3 mos. for a super clean, low milage, reasonably priced 2003 to 2005 BMW X5.  I came across a listing for a 2003 BMW X5 4.4i with only 40k miles at Sterling McCall Acura in Houston and called immediately.  I spoke with a gentleman in sales named Darrell Lowe and he was very helpful in sharing some details about the automobile.  I informed him that I would plan to drive from Austin to Houston over the following weekend to look at and test drive the vehicle.  He was kind enough to basically put the vehicle on hold for me so that it would not get sold prior to me getting down to look at it.  When I arrived in Houston at Sterling McCall Acura, Darrell was very helpful and attentive and brought the car around for a test drive.  After a thorough test drive, I decided I would likely purchase this BMW as long as a pre-buyers check out came back clean.  Because I live out of town, Darrell offered to deliver the vehicle anywhere I needed it, to have it examined.  I returned to Austin, and subsequently set up a buyers check and let Darrell know.  He promptly delivered it the very next morning and picked it up later that afternoon.  All much appreciated and above and beyond the call of duty.  Several days later, I returned to Houston and purchased my much desired BMW X5.  The price we negotiated was very fair and they gave me a more than gernerous trade in value on my old vehicle.  The logistics of the purchase went very smoothly and efficiently.  Everyone I came in contact with was extremely friendly and I would highly recommend Sterling McCall Acura to anyone I know.

Happily, this was NOT the case at Sterling McCall Acura. Mr. Lowe came out of his office to greet my wife and I shortly after we walked in the door.  We told him that we were looking for an Acura MDX. He took the time to explain the many features of the MDX, and show us how each worked. When we told Darrell which ""packages"" we wanted and that we needed the new vehicle delivered within two weeks, we were shown a list of vehicles the dealership had on order which met our requirements.  Mr Lowe explained to us that expected delivery dates were estimates and might not arrive within our time frame.  He then went on to see if Sterling McCall Acura could find a vehicle in the Acura system which would satisfy our requirements. Happily, a vehicle was found and delivered to us in time for our trip.  Mr. Lowe took the time with us in our new MDX and set up the many functions of the navigation system.  In short, our experience with Darrell Lowe and Sterling McCall Acura were above and beyond any I have had in over forty years of ""car shopping"".

We flew in from New Orleans. We had a model (TL) decided on and had watch the prices in different areas for at least a year. Houston had lower prices in general on cars. We stopped a McCall Sterling first, but had also called on ""by owner"" cars in the area.  Their 2007 TL only had 25,000 which made it very attractive.  I was not crazy over the red, but now I really like it.  Had not planned to finance with the dealership but the 2.5% interest rate sounded great.  Quick, easy, transaction.

Antonio took the time necessary to explain and familiarize me with the operation and maintenance of my 2008 Acura TL. I must comment that the Finance Manager, Mr. Ki Yong, remembered me after 15 years ! He has an excellent memory and a very pleasnt demeanor.

342,"February 08, 2010",I was interested in the 2010 Acura TSX.  I called ahead and spoke with Bob Cook.  When I arrived at the dealership he had a car ready for me to test drive. After the test drive we sat down and went over pricing and questions that I had.  He was very friendly and informative.  He made the experience very enjoyable.  He gave me all the information I needed and answered all my questions.  I would recommend him and Sterling McCall Acura to everyone I knew looking for a new car.  I love my new TSX.  Thank you to everyobe at Sterling McCall.,5.0
343,"February 02, 2010","The consistent professionalism of the Sterling McCall staff, beginning with the service department staff, with whom I dealt for many years having my previous Acura serviced, is the main reason I will always go to this dealer first when buying a new car. Aaron Strand, my sales representative was friendly, helpful, honest and to the point. There was never any sense of being pressured and I truly felt that he had my interests at heart even though he works for the dealer and wanted to make a sale. He was knowledgeable about all aspects of the vehicle I was interested in and was able to answer all of my questions. The finance person, Dale Amar, was also courteous and very prompt in getting my paperwork processed. She was able to answer all of my questions related to extended maintenance options and I believe helped me make the best choice in this regard for my situation. When my options were installed and I took possession of the vehicle, Aaron Strand carefully walked me through the manuals and gave me hands on demonstrations on the most frequently used features of my MDX. He left it open for me to call him with questions at any time or to schedule a time to come back if I needed additional guidance in learning the vehicle's features. Sterling McCall runs a class operation and it is refreshing to see real customer service in a time when everybody talks about it but few truly deliver it.",4.8
344,"November 06, 2007","When I was in the market for a used Acura I shopped several dealers and this on was the one I bought from.  When I walked in the front door I was greeted by a salesman who was polite and friendly but did not talk to me about buying a car.  Instead he called another salesman that was a member of my own race.  I do not know if this dealer has a policy of doing this to make people feel more comfortable but it seemed very strange to me.  Anyway, the first salesman blew a commission on a sale so I could care less.  

The man that did sell me the car was very professional and polished.  He did not follow me around on the lot like a monkey.  I had all the time I wanted to browse and then speak to him about the car I wanted.  He took a copy of my license and handed me the keys to test drive the car.  In fact, he suggested I take it out on the roads and freeway to really test it out.  Most salesmen either come along for the ride or ask you return in 10 minutes or so.  When I came back from a test drive I told him I was not going to make a $18K decision after only 25 minutes.  I needed at least a few days to think about it.  He did slightly pressure me by saying they did not hold cars for customers who had not signed a sales contract but at the same time he suggested I take my time and come see him again when I comfortable with a decision.

I went back 3 days later and bought the car paying in full.  The price was average but rather than haggle I asked him to adjust the price so I would drive out for $18K with all taxes and dealer fees paid.  He agreed to it without the ""let me talk to my sales manager"" line you get at sleazy dealerships.  My car was detailed to perfection and presented to me with a full tank of gas. 

A few months later when I changed the battery in the car my radio locked up.  The code was not anywhere in the owner's manual so I went back to the dealer.  The man who sold me that car was not at work that day so the receptionist sent me down to the service department.  The service advisor asked for $75 to pull the radio, read the serial number, and get a code for it.  I declined and left.  I called up Navid a few days later and told him about my visit when he was not there.  When I took the car back to the dealership that day he seated me in his office and personally drove my car back to the service area.  He returned 15 minutes later with the radio playing in my car.  The man appologized for the service advisor asking me to pay $75 when I had bought the car at the same place not too long ago.  Navid also added about 10 gallons of gasoline to the car to top off the tank before I drove off.  

As long as people like this guy are selling cars at this dealership they will have me as a customer in the future.",4.4
