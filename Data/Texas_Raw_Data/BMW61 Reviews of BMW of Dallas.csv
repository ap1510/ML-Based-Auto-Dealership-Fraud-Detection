0,"February 12, 2020","2-12-20 I have owned a 2017 X3 for almost 3 years; I excepted it as a 'loaner' to their customers w/approx. 4300 miles.  Within 13,000k miles, the tires were worn enough to replace 3 of the 4. I am at 24000k miles now, and told yesterday, it is in need of another set of tires.  These are 'run flat' tires and the dealership claim, there are 20K - 25K tires...WHY are these tires wearing out so quick and they are NOT cheap to buy.  I refuse to buy a set to turn the car back to them.  Do the math... Also, I take it in for something ie: 24k mile service and because I refused approx. $700 mile check up  or a $600+ check up, nor a $135 check up; there is very little they will check. I explained the low coolant light came on; I was told ALL the fluids would be topped off.  I asked before leaving the dealership and was told 'all fluids were topped off.'   On my way home, the light came on again showing  low coolant; I text my BMW support person, no response; I called the phone number - no response. At 5:00am this morning, I had to ADD coolant - it was VERY low.  I would not buy nor lease another.",1.4
1,"January 25, 2020","This 1 star review is due to a complete lack of responsibility of the dealership to honor the delivery of a second key and owner's manual per the We Owe portion of our paperwork. After waiting the 1 month they said it would take to request and receive the key, I contacted the parts department and was told it was the sales representative's responsibility. 

Over the course of another month, I emailed, called, and left voice messages and received no reply. Finally, I called and explained the situation with another sales representative who admitted my representative was available. He forwarded my call, but again, no answer. I redialed, requested a sales manager to speak with and was forwarded to another voicemail -- this time a sales director. I left a message explaining the situation and within 15 minutes of hanging up, I received a call from my sales representative. Finally! 

I explain that I'm still waiting for my key and manual and ask for a status update, and they inform me that it was already mailed to me. I asked for more context -- via which carrier, when? The response was, paraphrased, ""It arrived to our parts department and was sent 3 weeks ago via UPS or USPS or something."" To their credit, they followed up with, ""I'll look into it and get back to you.""  

3 hours pass and of course there's no follow up. I called the parts department and explained the situation and they confirmed that the key had arrived and was received by the sales representative weeks ago. After a 20 minute hold to look into it, I was told the sales representative was currently working with a customer and there was nothing else the parts department representative could do. 

The dealership is now closed and despite speaking with a handful of employees today, I'm not any closer than I was a month ago to understanding when -- or if -- I'll receive what is owed by this dealership.   ",1.0

I called 4 days in advance to schedule my car for service but when I got there they did not have my name on the list and could not drop the car and get a loaner. This is very frustrating, tied of having to take the car out there at least once a month with different type of issues. They are not friendly and total waist of time.",1.4

Edited 09/24/2019
Check received on today, thanks to Mr. Huck Hibberd, the general manager.  When he realized on yesterday 09/23/2019 that we hadn’t received the refund on Saturday, he had it sent to us via overnight FedEx.  It was delivered around 9:30 this morning 09/24/2019.  We appreciate you Mr. Hibberd. BMW of Dallas need more people like you who take customer service seriously and keep their word. Unfortunately 5 stars because of Mr. Hibberd plus 1 star for previous experience equals 6 divided by 2 is 3 stars average.

They only treat you well when it benefits them. 65 days and no refund.  Would you let me drive your car off the lot and keep it for 65 days before buying it? No? Then why should we have to wait for our money?

My husband and I bought a BMW from them, but decided to trade it in. When we were thinking about purchasing and up until the deal was done, they were to eager to help. We were getting calls the week before. We got to the dealership late, but they stayed open for us to close the deal. They even took care of some things on the car for us the next morning.  We thought it was a great experience. 

So when we traded the vehicle and received our paid in full letter from the bank, we sent all of the proper and correct documentation to BMW of Dallas to receive a refund for the tire and wheel contract.  This was done via email and sent to the finance director.  Almost eight weeks later, we call to check on the status of the refund. Well, it took about a week and a half to finally talk to someone in finance. The original person we spoke with was transitioning to another department; therefore we had to start over. Guess who we end up communicating with?  Yep, the finance director and he acted like he didn’t know what the status was and was going to find out.  He even made comments like “We don’t want your money.”  Well, why did you sleep on our paperwork all of this time?

Okay, so he has someone to send us another document (the last document)to sign and saying this will get the refund processed. Document gets signed and sent back to the finance director and the person who sent the document.  Okay, 7 days later, I email the person to check the status of the refund. I’m thinking at this point it should have been expedited because they dropped the ball.  Well finance director emails that night and states “we’ve done everything on our end. The refund usually takes 60 days.”

So basically, we had to suffer because they messed up and didn’t feel it was urgent enough to be escalated or expedited.  After going back and forth on several emails with finance director and even sending one to the general manager, finance director says corporate has received our concerns and get a check out next week. 

We don’t care how it works normally, because this is not a normal situation. We didn’t purchase a vehicle from corporate and the 60 days were up last Monday, September 16th.  This is not the first time we have traded a vehicle and received a refund. Dealerships are able to cut the check on their level if necessary. Apparently this isn’t necessary enough to do that. 

Finance director says he is accepting accountability and once he gets the check in his hands, he will get me a Fedex tracking number.  He never once apologized about this until I threatened to post a bad review which we don’t usually do.  He basically said if I feel Ike I have to do that, then go ahead. 

So until we get our refund in our hands, I’m posting this review daily. ",1.7
4,"June 27, 2019","Arrived for 7:30 AM appointment and Service person “DONNA” decided she would do me a favor and help me because “Bill” is parking his truck.  

First, Donna didn’t provide a welcoming attitude, but one of it is early and I helping you out because Bill not at desk yet.

Second. Proceeded to discuss the nature of my visit but realize horn not working as well. Explained that to her.  Also, I asked what would be the wait time.
She replied a couple of hours at least.  I said can I get a loaner car and she said no, can get a shuttle ride.  I said, well my old service person normally will try to work out something etc.

I asked to speak to a manager and she leaves for a good minute and come back with a service manger.  The service manager stated into that my old service person didn’t do things right and they don’t have enough cars for customers that need them.  

Poorly transition of customers that developed a great reppore with someone they felt did do things right.

Laziness approach and didn’t provide great customer services based on the facts.

I did ask for a general manager twice and she didn’t right away attempt to provide any urgency.  

I went back to ask if he knew that I wanted to speak with him and she appeared to have a facial express of a....

Bottom line, told the general manger my concerns related to her and customer service. Asked to to pleeeese remove my paper work and her to pleeeese don’t attempt yo speak with me again.

He’s extremely knowledgeable about all things BMW, and goes above and beyond in his service. I had to return a separate rental vehicle during my purchase, and Ryan drove ~20 minutes to pick me up so I didn’t have to Uber back.

6,"May 23, 2019","DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE DEPARTMENT!

PLEASE READ BEFORE YOU CONSIDER TAKING YOUR CAR THERE!

BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT: THIS SERVICE DEPARTMENT TOOK ADVANTAGE OF MY GIRLFRIEND, AND TRIED TO DEFRAUD HER OUT OF NEARLY $4000 OF REPAIRS

My girlfriend drives a 2013 328i. A week ago, she got a drivetrain error so we took the vehicle in for service. Our service rep was Jason K.

The codes revealed we had a malfunctioning wastegate for the turbo. The BMW of Dallas service department quoted us a price of $976 for the replacement of the wastegate. ($600 part, $376 ((2 hrs.)) labor, those numbers will be important later) Thinking, ""Well I drive a BMW so this was going to be expensive"" she authorized the repairs.

Without getting more technical, the replacement wastegate revealed that we needed to replace the entire turbo system. The service department informed my girlfriend that the replacement turbo system would include a new wastegate, and therefore the previously purchased wastegate would not be required.

The quote was $3877 for turbo replacement. ($1960 parts, $1917 ((12 hrs.)) labor) A quick google search revealed that the average cost of replacing a turbo on a 2013 3-series should have been approx. $2000. Therefore, I called the dealership and halted repairs while I conducted more research.

Here is what I found:

OEM Turbo and the installation kits are MRSP for $1419 and $121.01 respectively and has a wholesale price is $1038.91. (Which some BMW parts department will offer you) There is a $900 dollar mark up on an $1100 worth of parts? Do you remember the $600 price tag on the wastegate from earlier? The actual MSRP for a wastegate is $303.81. (I found places to get it even cheaper, but I digress.)

Then there was the service labor issue. Google searches, discussions with 3 other authorized/certified BMW technicians, and a check in the All Data manual states that a turbo replacement in a 2013 BMW 3 series should be 6.6 total hours, not 12 as we were misquoted.

So let us do some math together. If labor at BMW of Dallas is $160 per hour, times 7 hours (I rounded up for the benefit of the doubt), total labor should have been calculated to be $1120, not $1917. Parts should have been, at most, $1540 not $1960, as we were misquoted. With a total estimate to be $2660 versus $3877.

However, what happened to the labor charge for the work they did on the wastegate previously? Just to make sure my argument is not shortchanging our ""friends"" at BMW of Dallas, I will add the labor charges I paid to the service department for the wastegate to my above quote. $2660 + $376 = $3036 versus $3877.  What is the $840 dollars leftover paying for?

Alternatively, they could have offered the whole sale price of $1038.91 for parts, and charged her the correct 6.6 hours of labor (like the manual says) for $1056, with a total cost $2094.91 versus $3877. In addition, waived the 2 hours of labor they wasted putting on the misdiagnosed part. However, they did not....

I asked them to put on the original wastegate. I paid them $500 of labor (We needed to pay them to take the new wastegate off and put the old one back on, even though that was not the issue, that’s fair.) I limped the car to another service department, and where we paid roughly $2100 for the turbo replacement. The service completed the same day. At $2600 total cost, it still came out cheaper and faster than BMW of Dallas could manage.

I understand when you take something to a certified BMW dealership you are paying for a higher level of expertise and expected higher level of quality. I expect to pay $160 an hour for labor as an example, however I do not expect to pay for nearly an 85% total mark up in labor hours and parts cost. This treatment is fraud and dishonest, and unworthy of my business. Isn’t capitalism great?

Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else...",1.4
7,"May 22, 2019","I purchased a vehicle from this dealership that turned out to be structurally unsound (via the mechanic I took it to after the fact), when I returned, within the 5 day reversal period allowed, they offered to ""fix it"", at no charge, which leads me to believe they knew the problem existed before selling it to me. Naturally I said no, that I still wanted to return it, easy, nbd right? Shouldn't have been, but since I used my own bank, for outside financing, 2 weeks later, when I noticed the loan still had not been paid off, I called and they said it was something I'd have to discuss with my bank. Low and behold, no it was not, because the funds dispersed to BMW had already been processed, and it should have been the responsibility of BMW to reverse it. Long story short, I now have interest due on a unsound vehicle that I drove for less than 5 days. Also, they gave me the run around about ""processing time"" when I addressed that they took too long to return the check, which took 2 days to fix the loan, once they actually sent it.",2.0

Instead he jumped into his car at 5 PM with a porter on a Friday afternoon and endured the worst traffic I've seen in Dallas in years.

22,"July 06, 2017","I found a car listed by BMW of Dallas on their website, bmwusa.com, and autotrader.com.  In all (3) locations, the car was listed for MSRP.  I inquired about the car and spent a bit of time detailing information about my trade.  I intended to pay the asking price advertised.

In the morning, I phoned the dealership and spoke with Susan Kelly.  I told her what I wanted to buy, that I was willing to pay the advertised MSRP, and that I had a trade.  She asked me to email several documents regarding my trade and claimed she was confident that I'd be purchasing a car from her in lieu of the deal I had been negotiating with a dealer outside of Texas.  

After spending a good amount of time putting my information together and sending it Susan's way, she replied via email.  She said, "" Lets start by addressing each step one at a time.
 
We can sell you our car brand new car that has not been titled for $5,000 K over MSRP.
We can deal with the trade next….""

When I inquired for clarification because the car was listed for MSRP on several sites, Susan replied and said, ""Yes….the marketing tools do not make it possible to note the Market Adjustments on these Limited Edition Cars. I apologize.
There simply are not any new ones that do not have a market adjustment attached. We are seeing $5K - $20K….""

This was either a lie or sheer incompetence on the part of Susan.  I was able to find (3) identical cars (the car I was interested in was a limited edition car, so it was easy to find identical cars as they were all packaged the same way) that were listed for over MSRP.

I don't take issue with BMW of Dallas's decision to sell the car over sticker.  I take issue with their choice to market the car for one price but then try to sell the car for $5,000 more once I've made contact with the dealership and wasted my time sending information to Susan.

To make matters worse, Andrew Severage drafted an email in a response to an email he received from Susan (that was clearly for his eyes only and was not supposed to be sent to me as she insulted me) trying to justify their tactics.  Once again, he was missing the point and clearly thinks it's acceptable to market a car for one price and change that price upon dealer contact.",2.2

25,"March 03, 2017","Update to my 5 star review posted on Google. 

NEVER USE THIS DEALER.  They sold me a defective new car with only 9 miles on it and covered it up when I took it in for diagnostics and repair.  I subsequently took it to Classic BMW and they properly diagnosed the problem and uncovered that two key front end parts had been replaced since leaving the factory but could find no record in BMW USA even though it would have been a warranty fix. Of course, the ""fix"" didn't fix it. The car dangerously drifted to the right, within 2 seconds of taking hands off steering wheel I would be other lane next to me.  I was constantly having to tug left to keep it straight.  Classic changed some parts to make it drivable but it still has drift, but minor, modestly irritating. I knew better than to use an Autonation dealership but they had the inventory and in a weak moment I bought car from them. 

Part of my emaIl to the new BMW of Dallas GM Tania Eubank is below.  Our telephone conversation after she read my email was a waste of time.  They are taking no responsibilities and don't care that I have text exchanges with my sale rep that document the whole ugly process.  They are betting I wont file suit alleging fraud, comforted by the fact that my sales rep has moved on. 

My email to Tania:
"" Unfortunately, my worst dealer experience in 45 years of car ownership, EVER!  I should sue for BMW of Dallas selling me a new 2016 M235iX with an apparent latent front end defect, covering it up and then lying to me when I took it in to repair (occurred before you arrived).  Due to health issues I have not taken action until now. 
 
My car drifted dangerously to the right from the git go (4/27/16).   For several months I kept adjusting tire pressure thinking that was the culprit.   I finally brought it in last summer to have it checked out.  Service called and said I had a front rim that was bent on the inside. I responded I had no idea how that could have occurred but asked for repair under my wheel and rim insurance I bought with car.  Service said it would not cover the repair. I threatened to escalate to BMW USA.  Service said they would go up the chain and get back to me. 
 
A few days later service called and said the rim was not bent and I only needed a front end tire rebalance and rotation.  I authorized the work 💭 great but very suspicious about the competency of the service department.  I also had a separate issue on a bungle quote to replace the chin spitter (a very poor design, barely 3 or 4 inches off ground) plus a poorly done repair. 
 
I picked up my car and when paying my invoice I noted that service said the car did not drift when I first brought it in and that I had requested the rebalance/rotation. Both lies.  My sales rep Jamie Forbes was kept in the loop the entire time and I have texts and emails to prove it.  I ignored invoice comments and paid under the assumption I would drive away a satisfied customer. (I have owned 3 BMWs prior to this, not BMW of Dallas, plus 4 Lexus, Porche, Ford, Chevy, Suburu, Honda, Mini...).  It never occurred to me I would be lied to in an attempt to cover up a more serious issue. 
 
I drove away and immediately realized NO DRIFT IMPROVEMENT.  I contacted my sales rep, Jaimie Forbes (who was always great) that it was not fixed and I felt like I had been lied to and read her what was on the invoice.  I told Jamie I planned to escalate to BMW USA but out of respect for her I would get a second opinion from Classic BMW who I had planned to buy from but did not have the inventory at the time I was buying.  
 
I explained to Classic what was going on and they said the first step should have been to have me authorize a front end alignment, at my expense, and if it still drifted, warranty would cover repairs.  I authorized it and they called and told me the alignment did not fix the drift. 
 
In their next step they determined a part had been replaced on the right front suspension that changes the camber ( I may not be calling this incorrectly) but could find no record of it in BMW even though it would have been a warranty issue.  That alarmed them so they checked the left and found it had been replaced as well. They were dumbfounded. 
 
They ultimately replaced one of the two and it corrected the drifting by about 70%.  Classic documented their findings on my invoice.   It appears something was wrong with the car from the factory or from subsequent transport and BWM of Dallas attempted to correct it off book, a criminal act (fraud, they would have been required to disclose the repair).  I don't know if anyone will or can ""follow the trail"" and get to the bottom of it. 
 
Out of courtesy, I am notifying you of my intent to file a formal complaint with BMW USA and demand resolution, to take the car back and pay off the balance on my owners choice lease less sales tax I rolled into the lease.  If that fails, I will have my attorney file a formal complaint with the CFPB and possibly the DAs office and post my experience on social medium. 
 
At this point I have not lodged any complaints or responses to the service surveys, postponed because of Jamie.""

5 star review:

I'm not an Autonation fan but this dealership doesn't seem to know its a member of a conglomerate. I just closed on a 2016 M235i and my sales associate Jamie Forbes was a delight. I'm generally a pain having owned or leased over 25 cars but she never showed any impatince with my anal tendencies.  She worked hard to make my deal happen and her sales manager, his name escapes me, exceeded my expectations when I through a wrench in the negotiations when my wife chewed me out for forgetting I still owed two payments on my Lexus lease.   Other than the fact her boss is a bit strange, he eats a entire large angel food cake every afternoon on the advice of his personal trainer (I saw it), my experience was first rate including my F&I guy, JJ. That is huge coming from someone spoiled by Lexus dealerships over the past 10 years.",1.4

31,"July 20, 2015","For the love of God do not go here. If I could have lower than 1 star, I would. 

My car has been there for 18 days and they still can't tell me when I will get it back, and did not provide me a loaner. 

They had my car in their shop bc it would not start.  I bought the car brand new and it has had continuous problems.  I picked the car up after being ""fixed"" and I had it back for 4 days before it broke down AGAIN.  They told me it would be another $1,113 to fix it again.  I told them they are not fixing the problem, this is not the problem.  They would not listen. I had to have corporate tell them to diagnose the car further. SURPRISE, they found the real problem.  They were going to continue charging me to go around the real problem because they wouldn't listen.  

Now the car has been there for 18 days and they seriously cannot tell me when I will get the car back.  No one communicates or gives two licks about their customers.  They don't know how to fix their own vehicles, are terrible at communication, and do not care about you. They DO NOT care about you.  My friend who sits by me at work was THIS CLOSE to buying there before I told her my experience and she went across the street and bought a Lexus.  She has raving reviews and has not been treated like this.

OF COURSE you will love them if you are buying a new car.  DUH.  The only good reviews are on the sales side?  Sounds about right for a car salesman...

Go across the street and get a Lexus.  Do not go here.  DO NOT GO HERE.  You will regret it the rest of your life, I promise. ",1.0
32,"May 22, 2015","I visited the dealership undecided on making a purchase. Zack was awesome! He showed me a couple of different vehicles I liked and took his time answering all the questions I had with no pressure.

When I decided on the vehicle I wanted, he worked with me on the price and got me exactly what I wanted at a great price! 

The vehicle needed a few  small details fixed  and he completely went out of his way to ensure everything was taken care of and I was satisfied. The whole process was painless and I am extremely happy with my new BMW! 

I will definitely recommend him to anyone looking to purchase a BMW!!

33,"May 05, 2015","Gary Aggas is truly top-notch. He helped me get a smoking deal on a 2014 535d  CPO back in March when I couldn't find one in California, and it was a pleasure working with him. Gary was/is:

<> Was responsive
<> Patient and facilitated the negotiation process
<> Treated me like a king when I arrived to pick up the car (he carried my bag for goodness' sakes)
<> Did a fantastic job working through some post-sales items

Gary Aggas was the face of BMW Dallas, and I only have great things to say about them. I wish this was my local dealership.

Lastly, I _LOVE_ my car, and I don't say that lightly. Never before have I enjoyed driving my vehicle this much. (Don't tell my wife though, she doesn't realize yet that I've started inventing excuses to drive around and do errands.)",5.0
34,"March 06, 2015","I would like to share my experience with your guys. I am a customer in Seattle Washington, which is thousands of miles away from BMW of Dallas.

About 2 months ago, I was looking for a used BMW M6 online. I found out that they have a pretty good M6 in their inventory. So I asked for a quote, and a salesman (Jay Purdy) reply me within very short of time. After I had been communicate with him, I decided to buy this car in distance because he was passionate and made me have a good experience of purchasing the car. So far, everything was good. After waiting for 3 weeks, the car finally arrivals. Then, I realize the car does not have the second key, which makes me wonder why a car worth 80,000 only has one key. So I called Jay, and he told me that they (dealer) are ordering a new key for me and it will be shipped when they have it. After waiting for 2-3 weeks, the nightmare starts. I called Jay’s number and no one answers, and no email replies as well. 

Finally, after I called sales number on their website and talk to someone, and this guy told me that Jay Purdy is no longer with them. So I asked him what about the issue that Jay left over? He said he would contact the sales manager and let me know what’s going on. And you know what, that was end of the story. I tried to call the manager for so many times and left so many voice messages. And finally, sales manager Denial told me that he could do nothing with it, and let me talk to another sales manager John Bosco. After million of phone calls, John picked phone once and told me once they receive my documentation, they would go ahead order my key. After I send my documentations to him, I thought someone was going to help me out with it and unbelievably that was BS as well. John Bosco never picks up my phone call again.

The entire thing is the worst experience I have ever had in my life. I can not image how would the people like them become the leader of the sales team and how would the salesmen going to be with their supervision. I feel like they are taking advantage of I am being far away and treated me with so much disrespect by ignoring me. A couple of hundred dollars key isn’t a big thing compare to the $80,000 car. But it clearly defines who these people are, they would do anything to get your money with no moral and manner. 

In short, what I am trying to say is if you just want to buy a car from them and 100% sure that you will never interact with these people. Then, go for it, they will “treat” you as their God. However, if you may need to somehow interact with them after they get your money, RUN AWAY AS FAR AS YOU CAN. They will never care about you.

PLEASE THINK CLEARLY BEFORE YOU GO THERE.

I hope my review would help.

36,"September 30, 2014","I have been all over in search of either a 228i or M235i. I wanted to customer order one, but after realizing it would take probably three months to get it. Usually, going to any dealership is daunting for most. This was my first lease, and I absolutely loved my 328i Coupe. Bimmer fan for life. 

I simply can't believe how easy they negotiated with me. And the fact that I have one of the rarest cars in the US right now well below MSRP and with a great rate. 

Better though is the fact that my Saleswoman was extremely personable, informative, and let me truly test drive the car without acting like those jerk guys at Classic BMW or the ""luxury"" Park Place. This car purrs like a little kitty.. meowww

A car like the M235i sells itself, but Elsa truly knew about the features/options and how to use them. Even after the sale, she has made an effort to help me figure out the features (even on my 328i Coupe I barely knew how to use a lot of them!) No salesperson at a dealership has ever really explained this kind of stuff or been so dedicated. 

Additionally, everyone there was friendly... this was BEFORE I bought the car... all made an effort to get me with my requested Sales Lady Elsa even before I really got down to the nitty gritty with the numbers. Very friendly staff...

Sure, they try to add on extra sales protection plans at the end (what business doesn't?) of which you can decline... and YEAH I would have preferred to get SOMETHING for NOTHING...
but I seriously have a car that will last me ten years, and it's 0-100 in about 7 seconds. 

I'm just overly satisfied with this staff, especially Elsa Nunez, and the dealership in general. It's as nice as Classic BMW (without the bad service guys and pushy staff) and the staff is like BMW of Arlington (although that location seems old.) 
Take from this review what you will, but also remember that the guy below me lost a great car over $400. ",5.0

45,"February 11, 2013","Buyer be aware! If you have not shopped around for the extended warranty, you will be surprised! Since extended warranty is honored by any BMW dealer, you should at least do a few inquiry before heading to the most expensive one in town.

I have learned my lesson. The sales person Ronald Drayovitch showed many additional items for consideration. To make his sales, he exaggerated the cost of maintenance. For example, he told us the oil change costs 250 dollars and the brake costs 2200 dollars and assured us better to go for the extended maintenance if the budget does not allow us to buy any other items.

So, please bring your smart phone next time to this dealer and fact-check with anything the sales person said.

When we got home, we found out the extended maintenance usually costs 1000 dollars less. And when we consider adding a little more will also add the warranty etc, this is what he replied in verbatim:

SORRY ZAK BUT NO.

THOSE ITEMS ARE ONLY AVAILABLE AT POINT OF SALE ON THAT DAY.

THEIR CONTRACT WAS COMPLETED THAT DAY AND SUBMITTED TO MINI THAT SAME DAY.

All capital. And RUDE.

51,"February 03, 2012","I had one of the worst customer experiences I’ve ever had at BMW of Dallas.

I scheduled an appointment for 4:15PM, noting what services I wanted performed. When I got there and had my car looked over briefly, my service advisor said the mechanics were leaving in an hour and probably couldn’t fix my car. I asked why I wasn’t notified of this possibility, and my advisor said, “Well, I was gonna call you but I thought maybe it’d be a quick fix.” She kept repeating that they could try to fix it, but I’d have to wait, and there was no guarantee they could fix it that day. Even though I had so I’ll come back later three times, she kept insisting that this was an option, even though it was unlikely. It was extremely frustrating. I finally got to leave, wasting an hour and a half driving out there and back, only to have to reschedule my appointment.

I emailed my advisor and the dealership complaining about the experience. I didn’t hear a response for three days. Very frustrated (again), I called the manager. He was very nice and said they’d come pick up my car next week so I wouldn’t have to drive out to them.

On the scheduled day of pickup, after forty minutes of waiting for them to come, I called them. And after waiting on the phone for several minutes, they said they’d be there within the hour, that there was a miscommunication.

At that point I almost wanted to tell them not to come, which I should have done. During my service the manager was very good and explained the repairs (though labor costs seemed even higher than expected for a dealership, and an hour and a half to install a Z4 battery seemed excessive…). However, when I came to pick up my car, I looked over everything and realized they forgot to install the floor liners like they said they would. I waited around for nearly half an hour to have that done. My service advisor, who had called me to come pick up my car, was walking through the lobby, and I had to stop him to introduce myself, instead of vice versa. (At other dealerships I was used to having someone tell my service advisor that I was there, and then having him come up to me and introduce himself.)

Apparently, the wrong parts came with my floor liners (which I bought from them), so the manager working on my floor mats stuck Velcro to my carpet to keep the floor liners in place. He said he’d order a new set of floor mats for me, and that I could come pick them up. It’s been a week, and I haven’t heard from them, nor do I expect to.

My service advisor called a few days later telling me they'd be sending me a survey soon, and practically begged for a good rating, saying that the survey was his report card. I mentioned that they were supposed to order new floor liners for me, which of course he hadn't heard about. He didn't stop to make sure that that would get done, but instead to continue to ask to give him a good rating.
