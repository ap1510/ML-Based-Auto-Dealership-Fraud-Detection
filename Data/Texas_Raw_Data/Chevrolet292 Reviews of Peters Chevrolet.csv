0,"May 21, 2020","I’ve been blessed over the last few years and have been able to buy a new vehicle about every two years either for me or my wife. I have had a lot of good and bad experiences. After dealing with Ms. Frost and her team, I am sold on the quality of this company. I have never been treated as good as I was from these people. The inventory at this lot is amazing. I am definitely working solely with Peters going forward. ",5.0

4,"January 03, 2020","I have purchased many vehicles from Peters Chevrolet. Quite honestly, the inventory the keep on hand is unmatched in East Tx. There is always something for everyone and if they don’t have it they will get it. Besides that it comes down to the salesman/ woman who makes your sale and the service after the sale. I have never had a bad experience with Peters but I have had a few mediocre ones. My most recent purchase has led me to write this review and highly commend my salesman by name! Bruce Hofstetter will be my salesman for as long as he works at Peters! He is honest and transparent and gives it to you like it is! No typical salesman BS! He went way above and beyond to find me the best deal possible and the truck that I wanted! He is very realistic and does what he says he will do when he says he will do it! I can’t praise Bruce enough for just being real, keeping my needs in mind throughout the process and delivering when and how he said he would! No more, no less! And on a side note, my finance guy Floyd Ainsworth is the exact same way during the signing process. I’ve signed with him many times and he is thorough, clear and concise! He will take the tine to explain things in plain English and doesn’t spit a bunch of garbage at you and just shove paper after paper in your face to sign then kick you out the door! I walk out of his office with no questions and a clear concise picture of my purchase and service contract every time! These two guys are what make me go to Peters, why I will return and why I would recommend Peters! Vast inventory to shop,  no BS and real East Texas folks that will put you in a vehicle you want and can afford! I can’t speak for every salesman there of course but if they are anything like Bruce you can’t go wrong! ",5.0
5,"October 24, 2019","Let me start by saying this was my second purchase from this dealership. My first one was a great experience, hence why I went back when I was ready for a new car. The first vehicle we were interested in had some issues as soon as the salesman started it up. That should have been our first red flag to go somewhere else. He swore he had a great vehicle that would make up for the flub, so we gave him a chance. We ended up buying a different vehicle that was supposedly ""a great vehicle"". Turns out, after leaving the lot, the brakes began squeaking, there was condensation in the light, two recalls came out within a month. They claimed they fixed the issues and replaced the light, but the condensation is still there, the breaks still squeak and when I had an oil change performed, the body behind the headlight popped out. Oh, and I still cannot get a scheduling for one of the recalls. I have tried online, by text, and by phone. Still NOTHING! This is the worst experience I have ever had with a dealership in years.

6,"October 16, 2019",I can’t say enough about Peter’s service department they go above and beyond to help you. They know what they’re doing very professional. Have had to take our Tahoe in twice both times it was fixed quickly.  I like that they use texts to update you. Sean is very helpful. ,5.0
7,"October 14, 2019",My 2005 Jeep Liberty Limited started dying after I had driven it for approximately 15 miles or so. It was a weird problem because it ran perfect for the first 15 miles of a trip. Peters was able to locate the problem and get my Jeep back to me running fine without cutting off any more.,5.0

9,"September 08, 2019","Thank You Peters Chevrolet for helping me find my perfect car. Rick Lambright was my salesman and was Awesome!!! He answered all of my questions and made my buying experience quick and easy. We decided to finance through Peters with Randy Dugan. The process and paperwork was handled very quickly. The service department tinted my windows and cleaned up the car and it looks so good. Everyone at this dealership is so friendly. My overall experience with this dealership is way beyond 5 Stars. Thank You Peters. I will send everyone I know looking for a vehicle your way. By far, the best car buying experience I have ever had. Thank You - Anna Blalock ",5.0
10,"June 14, 2019","I heard about a truck through word of mouth, but found the owner had already traded it in for another truck at Peters.  I was not pleased about having to go through a car dealer, thinking it was going to be an ordeal.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  Keith Bounds was great!   He quoted us such a fair price, there was no reason to quibble.  Keith had the oil changed, got it washed and cleaned out and ready to go by time we got there.  Everyone else at Peters that we dealt with were also helpful and nice.  If you need a good pre-owned vehicle, I absolutely recommend Keith Bounds at Peters!",5.0

17,"March 18, 2019","My parents recently decided to hand down their 2015 Equinox to my sister and buy a new 2019 Equinox. I volunteered to take care of negotiations to make the process easy and stress-free for them and to stand over their shoulders and make sure they didn't get taken advantage of. I initially made a deal with Patterson Chevrolet in Kilgore, but when it came time to sign the papers the price when up by $600 and they refused to stand by their quote, so we walked out. Fortunately, that was a blessing in disguise because we ended up buying the SAME vehicle at Patterson for $4,000 LESS than Patterson wanted. Peter's treated us with respect and trust. I'm a loyal Honda buyer, but I highly recommend Peter's if you're looking for a Chevrolet.",5.0

27,"November 04, 2018","I had an oil change, tire rotation and alignment done at my last visit and everything went as expected. It was when I arrived home later that day I noticed something dangling from under the vehicle. It was the heat shield for the spare donut housing. One screw was missing and other was loose, I’m thinking this should been noticed. I mean they found the condenser air filter dirty and changed it, shouldn’t this have been discovery during the tire rotation or the alignment.",4.0

29,"September 26, 2018","We travel to Longview from Texarkana because Peters has an excellent staff and will also offer car delivery to your house when available. James Frank is the best Salesman I have had the pleasure to deal with. Just bought my second Durango from him in 5 years plus a Dodge truck.

34,"July 22, 2018","I originally scheduled a visit to Peters Chevrolet intending to buy a specific certified pre-owned '16 Colorado Trail Boss that I located through many hours researching online.  Unfortunately another buyer beat me to the punch and I was notified of it's sale as I was literally blocks away from the dealership.

Not wanting to just turn around and drive 50 miles back home in frustration, I decided to visit the dealership anyway to see what else they might have on the lot that was comparable.  

I asked the receptionist to speak with a knowledgeable truck guy.  That's when I was introduced to Jim Lacy, and I could tell right away he knew his stuff.  I let Jim know I had come all this way looking for a specific Colorado package and he wasted no time in showing me their stock.  A short time later I was driving home in the most BEAUTIFUL '18 Colorado ZR2 I've ever seen, literally right off the showroom floor.  And I feel I got a solid deal to boot.

In all honesty this is the first time I can ever say that I actually enjoyed the buying process.  Jim and Peters Chevrolet were 1st class all the way.  I look forward to doing business with them again in the future.",4.8

37,"May 23, 2018","We give Peters Chevrolet a 5 star rating because of the service!  Kody Huffman takes care of us every time we come in!  He goes out of his way to accommodate our family by making sure we have a loaner car big enough for our family of 6, along with all of our stuff.  Not to mention meeting us after hours to trade vehicles!  People like that, create lifetime customers!  Thank you Peters Cheverolet for hiring employees like Kody Huffman!

39,"May 10, 2018",I had a great experience with buying my new truck from Peters Chevrolet. Salesman Isaasc Tovar was very courteous and knowledgeable of my truck and stood behind every detail we discussed on the phone and Internet.  I would drive the 500 miles from Corpus Christi again to buy my next car!  He is probably the best salesman I have ever met. The closing went smoothly and I was impressed with the quality of service I got from both people at Peters Chevrolet.,5.0

44,"January 09, 2018","I contacted the dealership on Friday regarding a vehicle listed for sale and insuring about pricing. I was contacted by one of the internet managers with a price and another price including tax, title and license. I told them I was interested and had a few follow up questions. The communication was very slow and when they finally sent me the purchase agreement on Tuesday, the price was $2,000 more and the same guy just said that's the price. Why not just tell me that up front? I will look elsewhere for a dealer who is upfront and communicates better!",1.0
45,"December 23, 2017","Everything went very fast and smooth.  Called in over an internet add around noon, made it to the dealership @5:15 where they had our car already detailed and full of gas, driving home with our new Jeep at 6:30.

46,"May 23, 2017","Horrible! I dealt with Maykol, The dealership had a 2004 Honda Accord with 137 miles. I go in and say this is what I want I tell him I need a buyers order sent to my bank. So long story short my credit is pulled without my permission. I asked several times what's the total price of the car I never received a response. Fast forward I'm told that my bank said that I needed a co signer and/or money down. I ask how much money down, I never received a response. So I get a consigner. I'm told by Maykol that that consigner is not good enough. He told me that I can get a higher car and have it financed longer. I told him I don't want that. I go to my bank and ask them what's going on with my loan because i feel I'm not getting the entire answer from the dealership.  I was told that my loan request was denied the day before due to the value of the car was lower ($1500) than what if was being sold for. So here is my issue. I never was told the bank denied my loan the day before. I was steadily being pushed into purchasing something I didn't want. I was lied to several times. I was told my bank said this and my bank said that. Lastly I asked ""so what did my bank say why did they deny the request"". I was told by Maykol- ""they didn't say anything!!!!!!!!!""""TOTAL LIE!!!!!!! Then I received a call from my bank saying they were told I went to Peters asking for the owner and causing a scene. I DID NOT GO THERE AT ALL!!!!  Then I received a call from the finance officer, Floyd. I informed Floyd I was highly upset that I'm being told this and that and being lied to and on by Peters employees. After explaining to him several times he FINALLY apologized on Peters behalf and continued to blame most of everything on my bank. I informed him I was highly satisfied with my bank and they didnt do anything wrong! After I told him I would be writing into the BBB and the State General Office. He told me the ball stops here- he is the boss. So to sum up this place TRASH! Do keep in mind I've purchased a car here before. I will not recommend them to anyone EVER!!!! BBB here I come!!!!!

47,"February 13, 2017","Highly recommended! Bought my truck there but live in Bossier City Louisana. I needed some warranty work done (injectors went out) with 36,214 miles on it and local dealerships wouldn't touch it Because it was 214 miles past the factory warranty so I called my salesman Jake Pool and he sent a wrecker after it that day and had me a loaner to drive the next morning! Eddie in service stayed in touch with me thru the whole process and was very professional! As soon as my truck was fixed they drove it to me and took the loaner back with them. Service was amazing!!!!!!! ",5.0
48,"September 16, 2016","We had the first oil change on our used car purchase on July 29, 2016 at 76,662 miles.  We were told to bring it in in 6,000 miles to have the second free oil change and oil change.  At 6,000 more miles it would have been 82, 662 miles.  I brought the car in yesterday 9/15/2016 at 81,273 miles.  I was informed after 30 minutes that according to the service department I was over my mileage to have the free oil change and tire rotation.  They had put a sticker on my vehicle that showed the mileage (wish I had taken a picture of it, live and learn) and that it would be $70 + dollars to have the work done.  I told him we were within the 6,000 mileage that was on the sticker and they needed to make it good.  He informed me that he would cover it but he wasn't suppose to.  When we purchased the vehicle the fuse box cover was missing.  Rick made note of it and supposedly got it ordered.  When we went in the first time we ask about it, the person who knew if it was there or not was out of the shop for the day.  Yesterday I ask the service department to see about it and my husband also called Rick.  Rick informed him that the cover was there.  Needless to say I left without the cover to the fuse box.  I realize that we purchased a used vehicle NOT CERTIFIED, the only thing we could truly afford, but when I am promised something and something needs attention I feel I should be treated as if I purchased a new vehicle from you.

49,"July 21, 2016",We purchased a 2015 Colorado. We traded a 2009 HHR plus gave $5000 down. We bought an extended warranty and a maintenance plan. Besides not giving us a deal. They now refuse to refund the extended warranty since we traded the Colorado a month ago. What a awful place. We don't know how we will get our money back. ,1.6

51,"October 11, 2015"," After a three-week search with local dealerships and several unsuccessful negotiations I finally decided to turn my attention to looking on the Internet. That is when I found the truck I was looking for on Peter's Chevrolet website. I worked with salesman Lonnie Newberry, at first online and then on the telephone. Lonnie was very professional, prompt with his responses and very easy to deal with. I would highly recommend Peter's Chevrolet and Lonnie Newberry if you're looking for a new or used vehicle. ",5.0

Look forward to doing it again in the future.......UPDATE, now that I remembered the site I posted this on, let me give an update. Yes terry called, gave me an offer if I changed my rating. my wife went to the dealership to talk to Terry, who is now retired, and said it was like he really didn't care since I made the change in this site before hand. Offered a free oil change since we didn't care to buy a vehicle at the time. Now the employee that gave us grief since we didn't buy the vehicle on the 31st (which I realized they need a quota for the last day of the month & I had a 5 and 2 yr old sitting 2 hours making a deal and needed 1 day to sleep on it..already had financing and we're going to buy it) Is now one of the used MANAGERS. Stay away, they are only worried about numbers, not people. I drove 265 miles to find a great price and great service instead of 15 miles to this place. The owner is my neighbor as well! Also....I had posted this 2 months after mine and Shawns blow out in the middle of the store...2 months, I found this site, posted this and it took Terry that long to find out, only because they got a bad review. Thank you dealer rater!",2.2
54,"July 18, 2012","I have to say this was by far the best new car buying experience I have ever had.  Shawn Ware was friendly, but most of all he was to the point and had us in and out quickly.  Buying a new car is always stressful and time consuming, but not this time.  No BS.  I told him what I wanted and what I wanted to spend and he made it happen quickly.

67,"March 15, 2012","This is the first new car I have purchased in over 20 years, and to be honest, I was dreading ""the process"". To my surprise (and delight) it was ""painless"". Ron was very helpful and not ""pushy"". While I ended up purchasing a more expensive car than I originally thought I wanted, it was a result of my desire and not pressure from the salesman.

He is the only salesman that I heard from who responded to my request for a price quote and he stayed with it (no ""pumping"") when I got to the dealership.

I strongly reccommend that more people take advantage of this meathod of shopping and purchasing automobiles.",5.0

73,"March 08, 2012","I have gotten a new vehicle three times, and comparing those times I have NEVER received such service as I had received from Dennis. He is a car salesman, which often gives a negative connotation. However, I didn't feel complete dishonesty from him, he appeared to be completely honest and willing to help us. I understand dealerships have to make a profit, but he wasn't looking out just for himself and the dealership, but for me as well. I really appreciate the courtesy.

It was time to buy my son his first new truck as a collage graduation gift. I again went direct to Ron and told him what I wanted and why. We found the perfect truck. He knows I am going to buy a truck so he does not jerk me around like most dealerships try to do. He gives me his best price and best trade in value and I take it or leave it. I like dealing that way. Needless to say my son took the dreaded test drive and is now in love.

116,"January 19, 2012","We shopped Peters because we wanted a great deal on a new Jeep.  We not only got a great deal, we received excellent service.

When we first got to the dealership on the day of purchase, Robbie Bunch was with another customer.  While we waited, another salesman opened three Jeeps for us to look at.  After we looked at the Jeeps we went on inside the dealership for coffee, and the Sales Manager talked with us at length.  During the waiting time, Robbie made an effort to let us know he had not forgotten us.  So, the ""waiting time"" was a ""busy"" time for us, productive because we ""shopped Jeeps"" thanks to the other salesman, and entertaining because of the Sales Manager's interaction with us.  We also could see that Robbie gave excellent care to his other customer and we believed he would do the same for us.

Then when the process began to actually trade our vehicle and buy a Jeep, the steps were worked through quickly, efficiently, and we believed we got an excellent deal.

When the paper signing part began, we thought it would take hours...not so, the financial manager was so professional...paper work in order, questions at a minimum, friendly, efficient.

After the paper work was complete, Robbie helped us understand the Navigation System  and he programed our phones to the BlueTooth.  

This experience was excellent.  Each person we interacted with was friendly and knowledgable and helpful.

I arrived from Louisianna on Saturday at approximately 12:00 and, with the help of Issac, I was out of there with my new Traverse before 2:00.  Everything was there waiting on me, no gimmicks or backsliding.

I couldn't believe that Mr. Ware didn't offer me an extended warrenty or something to correct the issue. All that was offered to me was keys to a standard compact car.

Everything went smoothly and without incident. The truck so far has been impressive with everything except the fuel economy, but since it doesn't require the DEF fluid, I'm hoping that makes up for the lack of mileage. The last new truck I purchased new was an 01 3500 cummins and stickered for $39,800, this one stickered for $62,000, that's appx. $22,000 inflation over an 11 year period, that's why the ""price"" of the truck got a ""good"" instead of a ""great"" rating, it had nothing to do with the sales men, they were great guys to deal with, and I will return to Peters when I need another vehicle.",4.8

No one at Peters tried to pressure us into buying a vehicle.  They let us look at the cars & test drive the ones we were interested in.  Our salesmen told us some neat features about the ones we were considering - but let us feel like we were capable of making up our mind as to what was best for us.  
We left without buying a car - but returned later the same day and did in fact purchase a beautiful like-new Jeep.  When we left, we did not shop around - we knew we were going to buy from Peters when we decided to buy.  
Our salesmen were Hugh Carruth & Dennis Reiger.  They have always been honest with us and made us feel good about the decisions we made. 
Floyd Ainsworth, the finance manager was not high pressure either - he offered us a warranty deal that made sense to us & we purchased it - but again, there was not the old school high pressure.
We dealt with the same team we used 2 years ago - and plan to use them again when we need or want another new car.

151,"November 16, 2011","This was my third purchase from Peters.  Prior to this purchase I made the mistake of looking at a vehicle with another dealer.  Randy Dugan not only saved me from negotiating a bad deal with an unscrupulous dealer, but he and his fellow associates gave me a terrific deal on a car I really wanted.  I told them all that I'll N-E-V-E-R buy a vehicle from another dealer.  These folks don't employ all the old school car dealer stunts that make car buying a grueling, unpleasant process.  All of the folks with whom I've worked at Peters are confident in their ability to take care of customers, and that confidence translates into a precise, efficient buying experience.
I've commented on this before and I'll say it again:  DO NOT BUY A VEHICLE FROM ANYONE ELSE!!!

Sincerely,

152,"November 15, 2011","This visit turned into a pleasantly surprising one in getting me into a vehicle that fit my needs even better than the last time I shopped here.  As far as the Chevy side of this dealership, they exceeded my expectations from a prior visit to the Chevy side 3 or so years ago. The only way this experience could have possibly been any better was if the sales agent hadn't been spread so thin as to leave me by myself for extended periods and I wanted to ask additional questions. However, when the sales rep DID return, he provided answers to each of the questions I had....to my satisfaction.  I have been most pleased of all with the service I have been receieving from the service department.  Thats another reason I'll be coming back.",5.0
153,"November 15, 2011",First time ever to use internet sales and was very impressed with JJ and how it all worked.  Used Auto Broker to see price of trade before coming and called and talked to JJ and he had exactly what we had talked about waiting out front for me to look at and we went to office and closed the deal.  This was one of the best buying experience in all the years that I have bought new and used vehicles and I for one am now a Peters and JJ customer as long as I drive GM products.

165,"October 22, 2011","I did indeed have the best experience I have ever had buying a vehicle. The staff at Peters Chevrolet were just great. My salesman Sergio, is very up to date and knowledgeable. I had already researched all the new trucks and had decided I wanted the Silverado 1500. I told Sergio what I was looking for and he showed the ones Peters had. He explained every thing about the 1500 from front to back. How every thing worked, getting into details about each system on the truck, from drive train on up, how to operate all the controls inside and what they did.  I had a couple questions about transmission and engine oil coolers, along with tow ratings. Only one thing he wasn't sure about so he got the service manager to come out and talk to me about the transmission cooler. Sergio got me the running boards I wanted and had them installed, made sure the truck was gassed up and ready. He got me connected with OnStar so they could get me set up. All in all, it was a pleasant experience at Peters Chevrolet, everyone I met there in the sales and service departments was very friendly and helped me. I would recommend them and I would buy from them again.

He seemed unwilling to work through difficulties in the deal, and even more unwilling to look at things differently so we could get any difficulties solved and move on with the deal.

I also had an offer for the same truck with $500 back of invoice with a dealership in Louisiana I had done business with previously.  I purchased from Patrick instead because he said he would help me when it got time to service my new truck by picking it up and leaving me a demo.  You don't get that kind of service from an out of town/out of state dealership.  I am a widow and have been for over six years now and I've pretty much learned to cope alone with issues that come up in everyday life, like maintenance on a vehicle.  However, it was nice to hear that I would have some assistance with that in the future.  It's called, service after the sale.

I was never pressured to buy now, I never received those annoying phone calls. My salesperson made sure that I had her contact information and was there with answers when I did call. 

When I made the decision to buy, the process was fast and painless. I asked that the paperwork be ready for me when I came in to the dealership, so that all I had to do was sign my name and get back to work. It was and only took 30 minutes out of my day.

I was happy after about 30 minutes he asked us to come meet the finance guy. They added gap insurance and an extended warranty plus financed me with a local credit union with a rate less than my bank. My payment came out eight dollars less than my bank a month plus I had an extended warranty. My wife and I are very happy with our wrangler and the deal that we received from Peters Jeep in Longview.

I was looking to trade my pick-up for a newer model with less miles and my wife and I looked around and found the one we were interested in and the sales man came out with a set of keys to one vehicle to show us and it was the same vehicle so that was kinda awesome, Like it was meant to be and that turned out to be the one we bought.

264,"March 24, 2011","We had been shoping for a car at several dealerships in the Dallas area over the course of a few months and our experience was miserable at best. We then began looking on the interet for a nice used Acura MDX and found one on the Peters web site that was within the price range. I spoke to Brian the next day and was suprised (after our experiences in Dallas) how honest he was about the questions I had. We then did our research calling family friends in the dealership, and wholesale car business to get there opion on the price, keeping in mind every business needs to make money. My first impression of all the staff at Peters was nothing like our experience in Dallas. Everyone was friendly and very welcoming. We then met Brian and really, I can't say enough about how great it was to work with him on purchasing the Acura. Brian is straight with you from the get go and that sold me not on the car but the person.  When someone treats there customers the way Brian treated us you gain trust and loyality and that is priceless for any business.

265,"March 24, 2011","The thing I liked the most was the price. I asked for the best price...and received it the 1st time. Took me 2 weeks of shopping around to realize I was given the best price the 1st time. That meant a lot to me. I prefer shopping local....and will even pay a little more to keep it in East Texas.....glad I was able to. My sales guy rocked.....really took his time to help weigh the options.

The only thing that went wrong was not receiving the correct gift card. Originally, I requested the Lowes Card from the business choice awards...and was asked if I would prefer a Master Card. I said that would be fine....I ended up receiving a $500 gift card for Chevrolet Accessories.....which I didn’t want or need. The Chevrolet accessories are limited and I prefer ordering online for those items, or a local truck accessory shop with more option. I feel like I'm stuck with a $500.00 useless gift card....I understand I could use it for car washed and oil changes….but the Lowes card would have been preferred.

Other than this...my experience was awesome. I will refer my client and friends to your dealership......my mother in law is getting ready to purchase a new Chevrolet, and I hope to see her on the lot very soon.
