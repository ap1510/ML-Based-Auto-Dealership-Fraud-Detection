1,"October 14, 2018","My wife was looking to replace her 2011 4runner....we had just left another dealer very disappointed so I suggested going back to AutoNation Toyota to browse their inventory......so glad I did. My wife knew exactly what she wanted and there was no chance of settling. They thought they had it in back, a 2016 4runner, but alas it was sold the previous day. Our salesman, Mark Diaz, who she purchased the 2011 from, was not about to give up!!!  He found us 3 in Colorado.....we made our pick and got the ball rolling....he came back numbers in hand, but there was a problem....we didn't want to commit to a vehicle without seeing and driving it and they didn't want to risk paying transport then getting stuck with it......I didn't blame them but Mark was determined to work it out. But wait, a few minutes later here he comes with her dream vehicle, a BRAND NEW 2018 with all she was looking for and not much more payment wise. Fast forward, an hour later she was driving it home!!!  Thank you Mark",5.0
2,"April 29, 2018","BLUF: The service technicians at #Autonation #Toyota did not secure a hose to the transmission after I paid $350 for a flush resulting in a CEL, damaged sensor, a rental, and a poor customer experience. 

I’m disappointed with the service department’s technicians. I’ll say that first of all, the employee that was helping us, Taryn, was courteous and accommodated my girlfriend and I as much as she could. Saturday morning we dropped off her RAV4 for a transmission flush that we were supposed to have picked up later that day. We paid $350 for this service. My dissatisfaction began as we were driving home. The CEL came on in her vehicle about 1.5 miles from the dealership. We took the vehicle back to have it looked at and waited in the lobby/customer area. After a while we were given the news that the CEL came on because a hose wasn’t secured, which resulted in transmission fluid being sprayed all over the engine bay. This obviously caused quite a mess and they apologized and said they would clean it out and send us on our way. Well, more time went by and they approached us again stating that the leaked fluid is beginning to smoke on the hot parts of the motor which is causing other problems with the vehicles sensors and to be safe they were going to replace it for us at no charge. Due to it being Saturday afternoon, they weren’t going to be able to get a part or work on it because they’re closing soon and not opened on Sunday. What makes matters worse is that my girlfriend lives in San Antonio and she now has to come back down to get her vehicle back whenever its repaired! As you can imagine, we’re both upset about this and all we can do is get a rental and deal with it. What is even more upsetting is that the rental we were given was a Corolla which, in my opinion, isn’t comparable to the RAV4 we were supposed to have been driving home that day. 

I would not recommend service here because of this issue and the fact that no other efforts were made to make this better. I paid $350 for this dealership to damage my girlfriends vehicle, keep it, give her a lesser-valued rental, and send us away displeased. I will be contacting the service manager about this. I don’t feel the dealership extended themselves at all to rectify this, but did the bare minimum to get us off the lot.",2.2

4,"October 15, 2015","So let me start by saying that Lupe and Leo are like the dream team. At first when I went I had lofty goals I thought, but little did I know I could actually be able to get a new vehicle with their help. I have now bought 3 vehicles from them and I keep coming back over and over because they simply are the best. Everyone at Autonation Toyota is very friendly everytime I go. Also I got to give a shout out to the service department especially David and Scotty. I truly feel like I am part of a family there and I know they will take care of me. They always try to find the best deal and best vehicle for me and they sell me just what I need including warranties and such. I truly appreciate them, their managers, and their GM all of whom are very nice to talk to and deal with. Thanks guys for everything and I love my Tacoma, absolutely love it",5.0
5,"June 01, 2015","Great sales experience.  Lupe was helpful and responsive, and very thorough throughout the entire process.  He was not pushy, and he respected that we had already done lots of homework.  By the time we got to the lot we knew what we were looking for, and he understood that and guided us well.  Great service + fair price = happy customer.  We'll be glad to recommend AutoNation to anyone.",5.0

Scotty is there for me every time I need help.  I continue to return because I'm treated like a customer and not a number. I live in Victoria, TX and I will continue to return because I love the service, professionalism and friendship of the staff.  Thank you for everything.

15,"February 17, 2015","I was in the market for a new Tacoma and gave several local dealerships the opportunity to find me the specific color and trim I was looking for, but after three weeks of promises nobody was really wanting to help locate one for me. 
Long story short, I called Marc Diaz from Toyota Autonation in Corpus Christi and within a few hours of my first conversation with him, he texted me pictures of my now new truck ..I was amazed and suprised at how he was able to find me the truck within a few hours .. This is after three weeks of back and forth games with other dealerships. So next day I drove from mcallen Texas to pickup my new tacoma. The whole experience was perfect and the financing was a breeze. Everything mark promised was exactly how things turned out. Great team of people . I highly and honestly reccomend this dealership for your next vehicle .. A++++++",5.0

17,"January 14, 2015",This is the 4th vehicle that I bought from AutoNation Toyota in Corpus Christi Texas and the experience gets better each time. They do all my Service as well.

The price compared to Ford and Chevy was extremely cheaper as well. Thank you Mark and Leo!!!!! ,5.0
18,"January 05, 2015","A 3 time repeat customer!  That alone should speak volumes alone.

I bought my first used car from Autonation Toyota @ Corpus Christi 4 years ago.  The experience was bar-none the best.  Scott Abplanalp and Paul Beaudoin were incredible.  Made the whole buying experience easy, painless, and stress-free.  No of the hard selling stuff that you would have expected.  It was so good that 2 years later, my mom needed a car and again Scott and Paul made the experience great.  So definitely not a fluke or beginner's luck.

Most recently, I had gotten into an accident and needed to replace my Jeep.  Called Scott and he quickly jumped on, connected with Paul again, and within a day or two, everything was in process.  Showed up at the dealer (which was 4 hours away from Houston, TX where I live) and within 2 hours, I was back on the road, a satisfied customer.  Leo Espinoza was easy to work with in Finance!  Walked me through everything quickly and efficiently.  Made it easy for me.

Again, special thanks to Scott Abplanalp and Paul Beaudoin.  I'll keep coming back and referring family and friends to you guys, b/c I know you will treat them right.  Autonation is lucky to have you two.",5.0

20,"August 25, 2014","Mark set me up with a new car. Very helpful and knowledgeable. I drove in from San Antonio to buy an old car, and he set me up with a newer  at cheaper payments for me, which I liked. Only change I could make, I wish I had the new car smell. Since I changed decisions last minute, they didn't have time to clean and detail the car, but it was already very clean. There weren't any floor mats in my car so Mark personally went and got me some out of another Corolla so I didn't have to do without. Great guy and I would recommend him to anyone.",4.8
21,"August 06, 2014","Recently purchased a Toyota Avalon from Mark Beverly. Had a very pleasant experience, no hassel, not pusy, very professional and eas to work with. Mark understood my concerns and assured I would get only the best. I will definitely recommend my family friends to autonation Toyota, Go see Mark!",5.0
22,"July 01, 2014","I recently purchased a new Toyota Corolla back in May from a one Joe Harris at Autonation Corpus Christi. A first car purchase can be a pretty daunting task, not to mention an obnoxious one. As I learned, many salesman can sense your inexperience and try to coerce you into thinking that their car is the only option and you'd be a complete idiot if you do not purchase their vehicle. Yes, a great way to get customers right? They refuse to understand or comprehend the phrase ""I am not looking at buying today"" and continually pester you that the 2013 car that has been there for over a year may be gone by tomorrow morning. Nice try and a hurricane may hit Corpus next week. 

My experience at Toyota was different. Joe was actually the first salesman I went to in my two week dealer hop in search of the best deal. Joe was also coincidentally the first one to not obnoxiously and incessantly flood my inbox with annoying voicemails. I jumped from Toyota to Honda to Mazda to Nissan. I simply wanted a plain reliable car to get me from point A to point B. Something that all these brands could obviously offer (no respective salesman would of course tell you that, I guess you can't expect them to). Toyota, more specifically Joe, offered me the best customer service and price. On top of all this, Toyota had by far the least annoying staff. Joe was willing to work with me on prices and I was able to drive away satisfied that I got the best deal I could find. Car salesman naturally get a bad rep from, well, everyone. There is some validity to this, at least at the other dealerships in Corpus. But Joe is one that is actually respectable. He doesn't act like a conniving annoying sleaze ball that will treat you like a prisoner at Guantanamo Bay in order to convince you to ""drive off of the lot with a car today"". No water boarding at Toyota. If your in the market, go see Joe and get a Toyota. Toyota as a brand sells itself, I have nothing but awesome things to say about my new car but the awesome service is what put me over the top. No one wants to buy a car from an ass. 

What you will find at other dealerships: 
Mazda: Pompous jerks that wear their aviator sunglasses inside while talking to you, you know who you are, this isn't Top Gun 

Honda: Cocky annoying kids that can hardly grow facial hair and a Godfather type manager that interrogates you with his car salesmen disciples, nice try with the cult interrogation tactics though 

Nissan: actually pretty nice staff, but I found out that Golden Corral gets better reviews than the Sentra engine. Only black mark of the dealership is an annoying lady that constantly leaves you voicemails even a month and a half after your visit, and she never sent any selfies either! (this sort of applies at all the other dealerships other than Toyota) 

All of you dealers, take a lesson from Joe Harris.He understands that the best looking girl at the party isn't going to beg to go home with you. 

Cheers!

23,"June 05, 2014"," Took my 2012 Tundra for 25K complimentary service. The service advisor call me an hour later, that my right rear tire had a sidewall puncture and required replacement. And told me he could get me a new one for $277.00 dollars. I told he that I would take care of it. When I pick up my truck I notice it had grease stains on the door sill scuff plate, which when I drop it off the service writer told me how clean the truck was. when I got home I took the both right side tires and start to inspect them and I found no nail or puncture sidewall as the advisor claimed.  I did fine that they had left a bolt loose on my front skid plate and had request the tires to be top off at 35 pounds. when I checked them one had 47 pounds and the other three where between 42 to 44 pounds.  So please be aware it can happen to you.",3.0
24,"May 21, 2014",Working with Paul was great.  Was not pushy like most car salesman.  Listened for what I wanted and worked to find a vehicle that matched my wants and needs.  Even went out of his way to find a vehicle at another lot in another city and worked to get the car to me because it matched what I wanted.  Will work with Paul any time I need another car and will make sure I refer all my friends and family to him.,5.0

27,"February 07, 2014","I had the absolute pleasure of dealing with Lupe and Leo. They made me feel truly important and valued as a customer. I appreciated all their hard work and time to help me get a good deal on the car I wanted. They are very trust worthy and my experience with them was excellent.

A note on the store itself: The store feels very positive. Everyone has a great attitude and I was greeted multiple times from employees asking me how I was doing. I felt very welcome in this store and at ease during the whole process. I have now purchased my 3rd car from this dealership and would have to say that I truly feel like a part of their family and will be looking forward to again in the future dealing with them for all my auto needs. 

Thanks to everyone at the Autonation Toyota store, you guys make buying a car fun and enjoyable! ",5.0
28,"January 11, 2014","Joseph Linan was a great salesman, pleasant, patient, professional, and very helpful.  EVERYONE we encountered at this dealership provided the best customer service we've ever experienced when buying a car.

30,"November 05, 2013","I have purchased 4 Toyota vehicles and 2 of them have been with this Dealership. My first experience was disappointing, but I purchased. This time the entire experience was redeeming and professionally handled. My thanks' to David Sanchez, Albert, Paulie and Leo in financing. This experienced has renewed my opinion of this dealership and it's people. The turn around they have shown in the last 2 years is remarkable. I will be buying my next vehicle from them. They went above and beyond to ensure all my needs were met, haggling is still a seasoned art, but they tolerated me and we came to a deal. I found that all the sales staff were extremely kind. The kid with the fluorescent sun glasses needs to take them off when dealing with the public. Thank you to all involved, it was really a remarkable experience. ",4.8
31,"November 04, 2013","     Buying a car has never been one of my favorite things to do; however, my recent experience at Auto Nation Toyota of Corpus Christi was entirely different.  We were treated as a potential valued customer and were shown the model we were interested in.  The salesman, Arnold Balboa, introduced us to the various features of each selected model.

     He was low key in his presentation and never once balked to a question we asked.  He knew his product well and conveyed the information with clarity.  He made us aware that he was available by phone or visit to the agency for any questions or concerns.

     After the sale, Arnold didn't ""disappear into the woodwork"", but had made sure that he would be available for any questions.  We have taken him up on that on several occasions & he has always been eager to be helpful.  We will always be grateful to Arnold Balboa for making this buying experience an enjoyable one.",5.0

33,"October 07, 2013","Stephen and I came to Corpus just starting to look for a vehicle and having NO idea we would buy the same day but it happened with Jason Coe. He has a GREAT personality...was really friendly with us...explained everything with us and WAS NOT pushy with us at all. Something we were really worried about! Worked on the deal all day and he worked for us and got us a deal on our Tundra that we couldn't pass up. I think Jason should be employee of the month....great guy and great salesperson. We will definately come back here and ask for him! Thank you Jason for making us a deal and getting us the truck we wanted!!

34,"September 30, 2013","I do not usually write a bad review about a company, but this was really nuts.  I was in the market for a vehicle for my mother, daughter and myself.  I went to AutoNation Toyota to look at a vehicle that my mother was interested in.  While I was there I test drove a 2012 Highlander with a sticker price of $24,991.00 on the windshield. I showed my husband the Highlander with the salesperson and we both decided that we wanted the vehicle.   I asked them to email me the contract and received a call that the price was almost $10,000.00 more because it was actually a 2013.  When I actually received the contract via email it was listed as a 2012 Highlander which was what the sticker on the Highlander showed at the $24,991.00 price.  My husband discussed it with the manager, Jeff Amidon and he told him that the best he could do was reduce the price slightly below 33,000.00.  He also told him that we would now have to pay $500 for the Highlander to be certified when I was already told that it was included in the price before we tried to buy it.  How can they do that?  I even have a picture of the Highlander with the price of $24,991.00.",1.0
35,"June 11, 2013","Went on a Sunday, dealerships in Corpus Christi are not open on Sunday, was able to find a salesman anyway, returned on Monday and found the above salesman along with Sam.  

I really couldn't afford the truck I wanted, a 2013 Toyota Tundra CrewMax.  They were knowledgeable, patient, and most importantly honest.  They worked with me regarding my trade-in, and were able to offer me a deal that was way above (by far) fair given my circumstances.  The deal was fast and efficient, one of the fastest yet, and they worked with me to find a truck that fit my needs (fixing some ignorance on my part as well) rather than just trying to make a sale.  

Sam and Arnold have earned my trust, and I recommend them to everyone, and I will not hesitate to return when the time comes for a new vehicle.",5.0
36,"May 25, 2013","David was an awesome sales person. He was very friendly & worked really well to get us into a vehicle with us being upside down. We were a little disappointed with the gas mileage on our Tundra we purchased. Disappointed that Toyota doesn't have a customer satisfaction guarantee. The sticker had a big difference as to what we were actually getting. That was the reason we agreed with a Tundra because of the gas mileage that was stated on the sticker. Leo with finance is great. We have dealt with him a couple of times in the past and he exhausts every resource provided to keep us happy. We have had some issues that was not on his part and still he managed to help, regardless of how frustrating the situation was. My husband is very hard to ""keep happy"" and Leo somehow has done just that. He shows how he cares and is understanding no matter what situation comes up. ",4.2

39,"April 25, 2013","This is the first automobile purchase I have made from a dealership. Stories from friends and a few personal experiences with expensive dealership repairs gave me a fairly low opinion of dealerships in general. My experience yesterday with Internet Sales Manager, Mark Beverly, changed my view. I came in with a specific car and budget in mind. Mark went out of his way to show me what he had in stock. Then he went to work for us to get the vehicle we wanted at the price we could afford and were willing to pay. All in all, for our future purchases, Mark and this dealership will be at the top of our list. Thank you Mark for taking care of us.

I had been to a few dealerships in the past 4 months or so, and had gotten the run around, the smooth talk and all. Basically left frustrated with the decision I would keep what I had and wait a year or so. On a whim I decided to visit Champion Toyota and contacted a salesman, Mark Beverly, there. He pulled what he had that I was interested in and I drove it. Of course I loved it. They were busy being a Saturday so I ended up leaving around 5 and said to do what he could and let me know what he found out. He and I kept in contact on Monday, I didnt want to pressure anyone as I was not desperate to purchase. He emailed me on Tuesday with great news, and here was the deal, like? I accepted the deal as it was exactly what I had told him I wanted in the first place.

Mr. Hernandez had a detailed and quick response for every question we had for him; which was very satisfying to us.

I trold the salesman I had but never got a response, he checked and told me I had been approved at 3.9%. Since I had already agreed with the Credit union so  went with them.

44,"October 22, 2012","I knew the truck I wanted and had done my homework on the Internet for a late-model Certified Toyota Tacoma (double cab).  Living in southern Brazoria County, there is not much local inventory, so I expanded my search for 200 miles and am glad I did !!  After looking on-line for two weeks, I could tell that Champion Toyota Corpus Christi consistently had the best selection with lower prices than other dealerships in Houston and San Antonio.  

One morning I saw the 2011 Tacoma I wanted on the Champion web site, called Mark Beverly and scheduled an appointment the next day.  Mark promptly e-mailed me a sales agreement with a detailed breakdown on the pricing (it agreed with the Internet pricing), so I would not be expecting any surprises.  Mark received other offers on the Tacoma later than mine, but was true-to-his-word and held it in reserve for me to arrive. 

The next day I flew in from Houston, went straight to Champion and met Mark right on schedule.  He carefully showed me the truck, explained various features and completely answered my questions.  (BTW, Champion Toyota Corpus Christi does a very nice job with their web site.  Lots of sharp photos, good description and detailed technical specifications are provided on each model.  What I saw-on-line, is what I saw-in-person at Champion.  No surprises !!) 

Mark was very thorough, but also very efficiently moved me through financing where I paid cash for the exact amount of their sales quote. No surprises !! I was in and out in less than 45 minutes.  Friendly and efficient, no stress and no surprises !! Pleasant 3 hour drive back home in a great truck.  Best car-buying experience I've ever had.  I really appreciated working with Mark Beverly and the staff at Champion Toyoto Corpus Christi.  ",4.8

48,"August 23, 2012","Internet vehicle shopping is the way to go. It made bargaining so much easier. I requested quotes from all over South Texas and was willing to travel out of town to get the best deal. Responses to requests for information were consistantly prompt. Initially, I had a different vehicle targeted. I was able to take the vehicle home and determined it was not going to meet my needs. I received a little pressure to take a similar vehicle to the one I ultimately purchased that was on the lot. However, I knew what I wanted and was insistant and they were willing to work with me and find one to meet my needs. I was able to get the price I wanted. ",5.0

50,"July 10, 2012","Seven hours after my 8am appointment for an oil change, brake job, and alignment ... nothing had been done ... nothing even started!
What is the point of an appointment if someone else can drive in and get service while your vehicle sits waiting?

Not even a courtesy call telling me they were not going to get to it that day.

General manager was friendly and said he regretted the delay but that it was due to the new lifts not working.
What ... old fashion floor jacks dont work anymore?
Did they know this at 8am?

Totally unacceptable service!
Had to take it to Minit Man for the oil change.
Taking it to brake check in the morning for the brakes.
They say they can do it in one hour.

Dealing with the friendly staff at Champion Toyota of Corpus Christi was azaming and worth the 45 mile drive from our home town. The great service provided by Lupe Hernandez and Ralph Gonzalez was very professional and pleasant.  Both men are very knowledgable about the vehicles we purchased and totally committed to meeting our financial needs. We were not pressured to purchase the vehicles and they both worked in getting the price that was within our budget. They will get you a great deal on any vehicle on the lot or they will get you what you need.  After agreeing on the price of the vehicles, our paper work was done by Mr. Leo Espinoza, very professional and easy to talk to. Mr. Espinoza did the paper work and explain our options on purchasing different protections for our new cars.  He explained every single document before we signed on the dotted line. I would highly recommend these men to help you in buying your next Toyota car or truck.  Its like the they say, ""if you need a new car, who you gonna call? Call Champion!""  Thank you for your help gentlemen. ",5.0

I had bought a Honda Accord a year earlier to the date I went in to see Lupe about exchanging the Honda for a Toyota.  I has some reservations but when my Friend kept telling me about the great experience he always receives from Toyota as well as the Service Department from Scotty Evens I had to see for myself.  Well I came in and was greeted by Lupe, and Alex Castro they were very professional and polite. The Finance Manager Alex Salinas was very polite and made the financing effort-less. I didn't have to do anything they served me popcorn, drinking water, and even put in a DVD on a wide screen TV for my entertainment.

67,"June 19, 2011","At first, I went to Champion Toyota in hopes of just browsing their selection and to think about what cars they had. Then, right after I walked on to the lot, Jim Finnegan introduced himself to me. He struck me differently than any other salesmen that I had seen that day. The others were only interested in figures and getting me to buy today, or worse wouldn't even look at me since I'm only 18. Jim was right away asking me what I needed, and how he could make it work for me. 

The first time I went to his lot it was about 15 minutes before closing, but that didn't matter to him. He offered to drive around to the other eleven lots to help me look at what they had. Living about an hour away from Corpus, I declined, but thanked him for his time and give him my number (as I did with the other salesmen I met that evening). 

The next day, Jim was the only person to call me and follow up. His call wasn't just a ""Hey, how ya doin'"" type call, but instead he had looked at his inventory and told me about what he thought would fit my needs as a college student. I thanked him and went on with my day at work. 

The following day (Saturday), I returned to Corpus mid morning to look at some more lots with hopes at buying. I visited a few of the lots owned by Champion's rivals, but was met with either a selection way out of my price range or by salesmen who wouldn't give me the time of day (often both). As I drove past the lot where I had met him, I decided to give Jim a call, and see if he was there.  He answered warmly, and told me to see him. 

I arrived at his lot, and started looking at cars within my price range. Eager to show me other cars I might enjoy, Jim grabbed some keys to the ""manager's special"" (a 2000 Buick LeSabre), and said he had a few cars he thought I'd like just down the road. I got into the car, and we were off to visit several lots. The whole ride Jim entertained me with stories about his family and life, while at the same time taking in what I would want in a vehicle. 

Over the next few hours, Jim and I looked at (and drove) several different cars in my price range. I found a Ford Focus, and thought it was an OK car for me, but didn't feel too right about buying it. We drove back to Jim's office, and started doing paper work on the Focus. I didn't feel too comfortable with it, and I think Jim saw that in my face as we discussed how far apart we were on price. He suggested the comfortable Buick LeSabre that I was already fond of. He and I (and the all important stern manager) discussed price on both cars. I had made an offer on both of them, but Jim couldn't make it happen for me right then and there. I got up and went to lunch to think about my first real car purchase. 

At lunch I made some calls to my family and my mechanic to talk about what had happened so far that day. My mechanic and I talked about some minor cosmetic issues of the LeSabre, and about the uneasy feelings I had about the other cars that I was originally intent on getting. He told me that the price and condition was more than right with the LeSabre, so I decided to go back and visit Jim after lunch.

I came back to the lot and was greeted by the gregarious Jim (and manager from afar). I went in and made them an offer a little bit lower than their counter offer had been on the LeSabre, and it was immediately OK'd by his manager. Jim shook my hand, smiled, and said congratulations. He finished up his end of the paperwork, and passed it on to the friendly financial manager of his office. While my paperwork was getting finished up, he asked me how long I had til I needed to leave. ""I'm fine the rest of the day"" I replied, ""why?"". He said through his genuine smile, ""well, if you have an hour or so, I can go wash your new car for you when I go gas it up"". I thanked him, and said it would be great. 

While he was out, I told everybody about the great deal I got at Champion, put it up on Facebook, and everything else an average young adult would be expected to do after just promising to spend more money at one time than ever before in his life. I was called into the accountant's office, and started to do some paperwork with him. He and I talked about college and high school and friends while I read my contracts. He was more than fair, and explained every paper he put in front of me. He even gave me some tips about building credit since I was paying for my vehicle in cash (check). 

Jim returned shortly to take me to the main Champion building where my now gleaming LeSabre was parked. Along the way we talked, and I felt like I had made more than just a business transaction, I felt like I had made a friend out of Jim. We arrived at the main building to put on my dealer plates. On the way to my new car, I met the general manager of all the lots in Corpus Christi. He smiled, shook my hand, and thanked me for my purchase, and told me to give them a call if anything was wrong. I shook Jim's hand one last time, and drove my like-new Buick home. 

Jim Fennigan is a gentleman, a genuine person, and a great man to spend a day with looking at cars to say the least. If I had it to do again, I would definitely skip going to the other dealerhips, not spend as much time looking at cars online that sell ""just a few hours before I got there"", and buy through Jim. I recommend him to anybody looking for an honest, genuine guy to by any vehicle, new or used. ",4.4
68,"June 17, 2011",I went to several dealers in Corpus Christi and I found that i went back to Champion with Jim Finnegan because he was the friendly salesman I had work with this time when I was looking for a car.  He always kept in touch with me and took me to several of his lots to make sure I would find what I was looking for.  And I did.  I am very happy with my vehicle.,5.0

70,"June 16, 2011","I have purchased vehicles for over 20 years of my professional life.  As with all experiences, there have been both positive and negative ones over the years.  I must say that the experience at Champion rates as the absolute best of all my car experiences.  Even though this was a late model used car, I received much better service and attention than many new car purchases I have made.  Victor stayed in regular contact without being pushy.  Albert followed up, thanked me for my business, and verified that they had delivered quality service.  Dealing with finance (Chance) was a breeze as well.  From the moment, I walked into the dealership, to test drive, negotiations, and purchase it was a total of one hour.  The whole staff was courteous and helpful.  The true test of customer service is (1) Will I go back? and (2) will I recommend to others?  The answer is definitely YES.  Thanks for an awesome experience!

71,"May 31, 2011","This is the best dealership I have bought a car from ever.  Noooo Pressure. They know there product. I looked online for a used vehicle and asked for help, they responded within a hour. Talked to them about my price range and we worked with that. I got the vehicle I wanted below book value. Two other dealerships kept trying to sell me more than I wanted to spend, they were so pushy and my wife and I felt so pressured. We had saved our money to buy a car (CASH) and did not want a payment. Trying to get out of debt is alot harder than going in debt.

72,"May 31, 2011","I would like to thank you all for everything.  My experience in purchasing my new vehicle went great.  Scotty was able to always take care of me during my service appointments with my pervious vehicle.  He is always there for the customer.  When I finally decided to purchase a new vehicle, he was there to guide me to a sales rep (Joe) that he trusts.  Joe is fantastic.  He had all the answers to my questions.  He made purchasing my vehicle a little less stressful.  He slowly helped me understand the vehicle I was looking to buy (2011 Tacoma).  He never pressured me or tried to force my decision on this truck.  I thank him greatly for that.  He has a great professional attitude and personality.  He also helped me prior to the final purchasing paperwork.  He introduced me to Cooper.  Cooper walked me through the financial process and seemed to be very honest in answering my questions.  He seems to really love his job and to help all customers in getting the vehicle that they dream about.  Going through the financial process is the most stressful part of purchasing.  He made it much easier than expected.  I look forward to being a long time customer with the Champion Toyota Team.  My experience with the entire Champion Team was great and I will try to bring new customers to Joe's door.  Thanks you again.

73,"May 27, 2011","I have been taking my lexus and toyota cars to Champion Toyota for since 2004.  There have been some service members who would see you and dont say anything for several minutes, and when it seems that no one is going to help you then they say ""May I help you"".  Well...  Those service reps are no longer working there that I know off. 

However, Since working with Scotty from the service department, he has been very helpful in taking care of the problems of my cars.  When ever I go to do any type of service, I specifically ask for Scotty.  He always puts the needs of the customers first, ensuring that they feel important and that their car problems will be handled correctly. He makes recommendation based on the need of the car, to ensure that it runs perfectly as if it is his own car. I can honestly say that it is hard to find people like scotty who puts his whole heart in the job that he does. If there was more people like him, I can honestly say that Champion toyota will continue to excel in customer service.

In my recent purchase of my Tundra Crew Max 2011, it had a few issues with it, and I can honestly say that it was kind of disappointing that I had encountered such problems.  However, becuase of Scotty professional service, he ensure that my truck was handled correctly.  For example: when my truck was purchased some of the items on my old truck was moved to the new truck.  While doing so, there were some minor scratches that were on the door.  Well, when the truck was sent to the shop to be fixed, it had be be done twice becuase he did not accept the first time becuase he did not like it.  I honestly feel that he took ownership of the truck as if it was his and would want it to be perfect which I very much appreciated his outstanding ethics. Most people wouldnt even take a second glance and just give it back to the customer, but I am glad that Scotty is in a different catagory. He takes care of his customers and I believe that all should follow in his foot steps.  Just yesterday after getting my truck from toyota, as I cleaned my truck I found another scratch that I reported to Scotty, and becuase of his great attitude and professional customer service, he said ""I will ensure that it gets corrected and have it back to you as soon as possible"".  Again, I very much appreciated his efforts and left the dealership happy.  Scotty, Keep up the great work, and for you managers, you should make him ""Employee of the Month"".  ",5.0
74,"May 26, 2011","In the fall of '09 I  purchased my used 2009 Tacoma from a private individual. He recomended Scott Evans as his service advisor. I contacted Scott and set up our first visit to the Corpus Christi Champion Toyota. He proved everytime to be an excellant service person. Scott has assisted me with my truck ever since (he's awesome). Two weeks ago I called Scott and scheduled my truck for servicing. While waiting on my truck to be serviced (which took less than an hour) I told him I was looking for a used vehicle for the wife. He introduce me to Leonard Espinoza (TCUV Sales Consultant). Leo told me of a a 2009 Highlander he had just received. I thanked him and said I would tell the wife about it. He gave me his card. The following Saturday I called Leo and told him we would like to come and see the Highlander. He said come on over. When we arrived one of the sales person greeted us on the lot. I told him we were here to see Leo. He went and brought Leo to us. Leo said he was currently with another customer and asked if it would be alright if Tom Sanchez could assist us with the vehicle. Tom showed us the Highlander. He let the wife test drive it along with several other  wehicles on the lot(she did not know if she wanted a car or a SUV). After spending a several hours with Tom we agreed the Highlander was the vehicle she was interested in and Tom and I began discussing price. I told him we would think about it over the weekend. He offered to let us take it home over the weekend and we said said no thank you. Monday morning I called Tom and the rest is history. Now not only am I a proud owner of a Toyota but so is the wife.

77,"May 21, 2011","It was hands down the best car buying experience I had.  Definitely worth the drive from Houston!!  I would do it again.

As I said, I live in Houston, TX and my lease was about due on my vehicle so I needed to buy a new car.  A friend of mine from Houston recommended that I consider looking at Champions Toyota in Corpus Christi.  He bought his last Tundra there and said that he had a great experience with Champions.  It was a bit far for me and I was skeptical that it would be worthwhile, but I'm big on personal recommendations so thought I would give it a chance.  I called in to Champions and was immediately connected with Paul Beaudoin in their sales department.  In short order I told him was I was looking for and at what price.  In less than 30 minute, Paul called me back with the exact vehicle I wanted and at the price that I asked for.  

Everyone I dealt with, from their sales department to their service department, was extremely helpful and friendly.  They made the whole buying experience EASY.  

The things that stood our most was that Scott Abplanalp, their Reconditioning Manager, did a thorough walk-thru with me to make sure I was 100% satisfied.  They detailed the car before I got there.  

It's easy when things go well, but the true test is when there are issues.  Since I was buying a used Jeep, I didn't expect everything would be perfect and as it turned out, I found that the jack was missing.  It was pretty minor, so I thought that they wouldn't give it too much attention.  To my surprise, Paul went out of his way to order me a new jack and had it shipped immediately to my house in Houston.

Great attention to detail and service.

78,"May 20, 2011","Love this dealership.  I have purchased from them in the past and again today and found them to be straight forward, honest and ready to make a fair deal on both new and used vehicles.  I also really liked their online connection which I looked at before I went in.  They actually had the vehicles on special that they listed.

Frank Favre, my salesman, is great and made my decision to purchase easy.  He paid attention to what I wanted in a vehicle and did not waste my time trying to sell me vehicles that were not within my parameters.  He found me the exact used vehicle I wanted and the entire deal did not take 2 hours.  And I had shopped the car dealership strip up and down SPID before I went to Champion.  Ich.  

And then I found Frank at Champion Toyota, Corpus Christi, Texas.  Frank took my offers and counter offers to the management (who was also great and the same gentleman I knew from the purchase of a new Tundra in 2006-Champion must be doing something right to have kept this guy for so many years!)...and did not insult me by making faces and grimaces during negotiations.  On the contrary, his boisterous laughs, sense of humor and big smile were so refreshing.

And their finance department is not one that keeps you waiting and waiting.  They already had arrangements in place with my financial institution, which saved me from another stop.  I should mention that I am an ""average joe"", not a high roller and looked ragged after gardening and I was still treated with respect by everyone from the man opening the front door to the receptionist and everyone I ran into.  Not one salesman hovered or made me uncomfortable.  

It is a small thing, but I really appreciated the cold bottles of water and coke!  I also appreciated the open atmosphere and cleanliness of the dealership.  

You won't find a bunch of guys lined up on a fence out front staring at each person driving up like a bunch of vultures (i.e. Eddie Yaklin dealership).  Not at Champion Toyota!  

So, cudos to this dealership, my salesman, Frank Favre and the entire place.  Way to go, guys.  I have used their service department before and know by experience that it is top notch too.  I am not a spring chicken and I recognize a good business when I am in one.  Nice to know where to go when I or anyone I know needs a car...yup, that will be Champion Toyota.
