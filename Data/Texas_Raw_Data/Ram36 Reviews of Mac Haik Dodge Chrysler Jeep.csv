1,"June 03, 2020","I called up looking to but a Jeep Wrangler Rubicon for 47K and when asked about it I was told that they add $2,988 for a protection package to all new vehicles( nitro, tint, lojack, and some 10k if your car is stolen). I said I didn't want any of that I since it seemed like it hadn't been added and was not on the website didn't seem like it was a requirement. I was told well if you don't get it then we will just add 3k to the top of the price to make up for losses. I said ""Thanks, but that is not on the website and I was calling because you have the lowest price around"". Before I could finish the sentence they hung up on me. Very rude and misleading advertising. Will never buy from this dealership and I hope nobody does.",1.0
2,"May 12, 2020","I sent an inquiry about a Gladiator and got an email with pretty good pricing. Went to the dealership the next day and after the test drive, they gave me another number which is almost $200 more per month. I asked why is the price so different and they just said the internet price they sent via email is automatically generated and not correct. I just left in shock. Terrible dealership.",1.0
3,"May 09, 2020","Please beware of this dealership!!! The prices advertised are not even close to the actual price. A jeep online was listed for 33k, when I got there they stated that it was 53k. Very classic bait and switch routine and please DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS DEALERSHIP! ",1.0
4,"March 10, 2020","Beware - the advertised price is not the accurate price.  They increased the price of the Jeep I was on my way to purchase by $3,900 after I indicated I was interested.  Driving from Austin, at least the salesman informed me of this increase before I drove the whole way to Houston, but they lost a sale because if unethical business practices.",1.0
5,"March 09, 2020","I recently took my truck to Mac Haik Dodge for a hose leak going to the DEF pump, once I was called to pick up my truck; I found more problems than when I dropped it off. The Service Manager John L. stepped in and what could have turned into a bad situation Mr. John L. made it the best experience I’ve ever encounter from any dealership I’ve every sent my vehicles to in for services. Mr. John L. by far does understand customer service and in my opinion demonstrate Houston’s, Mac Haik Dodge Chrysler Jeep Ram Service Department, professionalism, honesty, integrity and just a good person of true value. You have surely won me over as long term customer. Service Manager Mr. John L. sincerely thanks very much for your valued customer service you provided to me in resolving the issue with my truck, you’ve earned my business going forward. ",5.0
6,"November 11, 2019",I came in and mo naddaf was honest and up front and ude to my bank dropping the ball I didn't get the car I wanted instead of me getting messed over by texas auto I wished could have closed the deal with him,4.0
7,"October 25, 2019",Called to confirm a price and that I would qualify for incentives. Sales person said the price on their website was for a lease even though it did not state anywhere it was the lease price. The price went from 18k to24k. Dirty dealer. Will never purchase from Mac Haik.  ,1.0
8,"October 16, 2019","The service shop here is pretty poor. I've had a few recalls that just require a software update. Every time I would take my car in they'd say they're too busy to do it or only have one guy doing it and can't do it that day. Often say I should drop my car off the next day and leave it there with no loaner. I'll drive to the other dealership down the street and they get me in an out as quickly as the software update can go in. I had a windshield replaced and was told to go get the rain sensor re-calibrated, show up at Mac Haik and they immediately assumed I put the wrong windshield in and it wouldn't work before even looking at it. Now Safelite is not stupid enough to put the wrong windshield in. My last issue with this dealer came about when I got a nail in my tire and they fixed it. Later I got another nail in the same tire and took it to the Discount Tire as it was close to my work. Discount Tire told me they could not repair the tire because whoever did the last repair did not do it up to tire repair standards (meaning they only plugged the tire and standards say plug and patch). So I drove right back to Mac Haik and explained it to them and they looked at me like I was an idiot and said ""we repair up to standards but not Discount Tire Standards""... if the dealer has lower standards than the tire shop with ""discount"" in their name, the dealer is clearly is doing something wrong. In all, I was pleased with my purchase from them until I had to start dealing with their service center. I will not take my car back to them and will always drive the extra 10 miles to the next dealer. I just don't trust these guys. ",1.6

11,"May 09, 2019",Worst Experience Since Monday this place has been giving me the run around regarding picking up my vehicle. We purchased a New Vehicle on 4-14-2019. We got a text on 5-6-2019 saying that the bank pulled back from the deal so to take the vehicle in or they would REPO it from us. So we arrived with the vehicle to be told that our trade in was sent to auction but they would be bringing it back on Tuesday 5-7-2019 at noon. We didn’t not get a call my spouse and I have been calling and leaving voicemails. We just keep getting the run around yesterday I spoke to their New Sales Manager who twice said he would call me back yet never did. My husband called twice and they hung up on him both times. Finally i speak to someone and they said they’ll call me by noon today it is now 2:15PM and still nothing I called and they tell me the manager isn’t there today! Please don’t waste your time with this place it a whole bunch of running around and playing games. They are not worth the effort and very unprofessional!,1.0
12,"February 19, 2019","Researched online for a few days and looked at 1 other dealership. These guys had the biggest selection and the cheapest price hands down. John A. Is the man to talk to. No pressure. No gimmicks. Showed us a truck I asked for while getting my other appraised. They were very competitive on trade in value. Was late that night so I had to come back the next day. When I came in John was more then helpful again, even when I thought he was going to get irritated when I asked to see another color I’m the daylight. John did not get irritated. Showed me all the colors. Then we put together the deal. Before fincance I had the pleasure of meeting Scott. He was able to explain asscessories and the EVTS system. Great guy if anyone needs anything even if you already have a truck and need some upgrades. Sam the finance guy was straight forward and quick. Went through everything in detail. Very good guy. All in all I’ve worked with a bunch of dealerships and these guys knocked the experience out of the park. ",5.0
13,"January 10, 2019","I took my truck which was leaking water through a plastic piece located in the water hose.
Was told about the ""Diagnostic"" fee but I have the extended warranty so I assumed since it was the plastic piece leaking it would be covered. It wasn't ! Now here comes the good part. For a radiator hose replacement it would be $ 340.00 parts and labor. I just bought the part ( NOT THERE) for 70.00.
It is basically three bolts that it takes to put this hose on. Since  i would not pay them 360.00 for a 70.00 part I had to pay the 145.00 diagnostic fee. Not to mention that once again I had to have my truck in the shop for recalls that makes at least 5 recalls on the truck. We had three Rams in our family. One just changed to Chevrolet and the other changed to Ford. I'll be next. This part should not have worn out. It was not the hose but the plastic piece that they designed into the hose.   ",1.0
14,"January 06, 2019",My sales representative did everything in his power to get me the deal I needed on the truck I wanted. We took the golf cart and looked at dozens. (Just to come back to the one that he first showed me). As far as vehicle purchasing goes this was a much less stressful and more relaxed setting. ,5.0
15,"August 18, 2017","Had our car towed to dealership for estimated repairs on a throttle body replacement.  Service person did not identify any upfront diagnostic charges at estimate request.  Upon receiving estimate for parts and service, respectfully informed service person I would like to check with secondary repair shop.  Found expert shop to do same repair for 2 hours less quoted labor time, a free loaner car, and an overall savings of over $200 on a $600 repair.   Upon contacting the delaership  and politely requesting when the vehicle would be available for pick up by a towing company, the service person stated she would release the car when a $110 diagnostic fee was paid.  Paid the hostage fee and moved the repair to the better source.  Shady and shallow business practice.  Don't blame the service person, appearantly - it's the dealership policy and business model.",1.6
16,"May 11, 2017","Beware.  Do not stand behind their work,

I had my Jeep Liberty in for some diagnostics on a transmission, AC blower, TPSM and leak issues.  Yes it's a teen car.  I paid the $110 diagnostic fee and was told about all the repairs and recommended by the tech that I do not make the repairs due to some rust issues.  

Fast forward a few months and I decide to keep the car and want the AC blower and TPSM repaired.  They told me they had no record of the recommended fixes just that I refused repairs. 
 I was charged another $110 to re-diagnose the AC blower and $185 to reprogram the TPSM per their recommendation from our first trip.  The estimate for the two repairs from my first trip were apx $330.  After $410 of repairs ($380 ""all in"" estimate this time plus $28 shop fees are not included in the ""all in"" estimate) I drive out with both repairs complete.  I felt a little burned, but was happy to have the car repaired.

Two hours later, my TPSM light is back on with the error message.  I call this morning and leave a message only to be called back with the greeting of ""we reprogrammed the TPSM just as you asked"".  In order for them to touch the car it's another $110 diagnosis charge.  The ultimate insult, this is their service manager.  He also then told me I only paid for the diagnostic on the transmission last time but one day earlier told me he had no records from that previous visit even though all of the items were on the original work order.

In summary, before you take your car here consider the following:
 - The service manager will take no responsibility for their repairs.  I was fine if I took the car back and had to pay for an additional repair, but to pay $110 for them to check a problem they fixed was not right.
- ""All In"" quotes do not include everything.  I get they charge shop fees, but that's why I asked for an all in quote.
- Don't trust these guys.  Stories changed. Estimates changed.  Didn't stand behind their repairs.

In the end they were unwilling to assume any responsibility and just wanted my money and me gone.",1.2
17,"February 18, 2017","I have purchased 3 cars from this dealership and I am very satisfied with the salesman and the service.
Just make sure if you purchase a used vehicle you have them service it before taking possession. I had to bring my last car back for an oil change, no big deal. I highly recommend my salesman Anthony Berry, a very polite and knowledgeable young man, and Alton Williams the finance manager got me the best possible deal.

18,"November 29, 2016","All purchasers should request/demand that the charges added for ""Documentary Fee"" and ""Dealers Inventory Tax"" be removed from the Vehicle Purchase Order. I had my loan officer negotiate those fees away prior to closing. Hey, a deal's a deal. Don't tell us what you'd take for the vehicle then add in additional fees that were not agreed to. The personal property tax is the real joke. Mac Haik DCJ  asks you to reimburse them for personal property taxes they paid on the vehicle you purchased. Just imagine how they would respond if you asked them to pay the personal property tax you paid on the vehicle you traded in/replaced. And document fees? Come on people. That's a cost of doing business. Try to get the dealer to pay you for the gas you used to get to their dealership or for lost wages if you took time off from work. As for post purchase customer service, there's not much to say other than it doesn't exist. They did not return my phone calls or emails even when I was told someone would contact me. You may get to leave a voice mail, but you'll never actually have a live conversation with anyone.",1.0
19,"November 27, 2016","Sales personnel are not truthful.  Classic Bait & Switch tactics.  Advertise a good price, then claim that vehicle is ""sold"" , ""it's not here"" in the time it takes you to drive there.  ""But , we have this different car"" 

If you've ever bought a car at a dealership, you know this process takes a while.  Its just a scam.",1.0
20,"June 29, 2016","The General Manager, Nancy Lambert, is remarkably committed to superior customer service. I was really touched at the way she lead by example within her staff, and made sure that the needs of myself and my family were met  throughout this memorable purchase experience.

I believe I am now a life-long Dodge Ram customer because of my experience at Mac Haik DCJ of Houston. This says a lot coming from me, as I was raised in a Chevrolet family.

Go to this dealership, and ask for Nancy Lambert, Don Ruguleiski, or Anthony Berry - you will be well taken care of, trust me.",5.0
21,"March 30, 2016","I made a deal on a truck against my better judgement after they refused to honor the internet price, saying you had to meet all sorts of mysterious conditions to get that price. After the deal was struck and I took delivery, I got a call 2 days later saying they had put the wrong pay-off price for my trade in on the deal and I had to come re-sign the paper work. Of course the new paperwork added their mistaken pay off difference back into the deal and my payment went up 40 bucks. I initially refused to sign the deal but they were adamant, saying they would let me out of the deal but they couldn't eat the difference.  I had already installed a 5th wheel hitch and added some other accessories to the truck so I went ahead and signed. What really pissed me off is we told the finance guy that they had the wrong pay-off price on the paper work and he just passed it off saying they often get different pay-offs than the customer gets. 
This was all my own fault, I should have never made a deal after they refused to honor the internet price.  Just hope this saves some other poor sucker. ",1.0
22,"November 16, 2015","I found a vehicle online and was put in touch with John Arrant.  He assured me, first through email, then over the phone, that it was in stock.  I told him that my husband and I would both have to take off work and drive across Houston in traffic, but we would be there ASAP to look at it.  When we arrived, we were informed that the truck had ""just been sold"".  Conveniently, they had a list of other vehicles for me to look at.  Huge waste of time and money. The sales reps at this dealership are liars and I would make it a point to steer others away from this family of dealerships.",1.0
23,"October 05, 2015","This dealer has got to be the worst of any other dealer. First of all I had an appointment to see one salesperson, before I got there I was called and informed I would be seeing another. Once I got there I was pushed off on another salesperson. This third person would not listen to what I wanted and was very rude when you pointed out his mistakes. Once I got into a truck around closing time and left I noticed the check engine light on. Called the salesperson back and was told to take it to the closest dealer to my house. I do not think I will ever use this dealership again. Thanks to the salesman and all involved in this sale.",1.4
24,"October 03, 2015","The worst dealership i've ever dealt with. Charles Smith, the Pre-Owned Sales Manager, is a pathological liar. It was very difficult to get them to answer and return a phone call. They were not motivated to sell. They acted like they could care less. Wired money for a down payment and asked for it back after i was fed up with all the lying. Took 26 days to get my money back and was told multiple lies about when it was mailed. Don't think you're gonna get any help by calling the General Manager. She is as bad as her sales people. When i started threatening legal action i started getting people to take action.",1.8
25,"September 20, 2015",My gf found me an amazing internet deal on Monday morning. I did the online app and no less than 30 min i had a phone call. Tim the salesman pulled the keys already before we talked. I gave him all my info told him exactly what i wanted and expected and they met it to a T.  All was lacking was physically going with my trade. Just like another review the trade process took longer than expected they need to fix that. But as far as new truck sales finance and even the girl that sells accessories were on their game. Total time spent from online to driving to the dealership to driving my new 1500 home was less than 4 hours. AMAZING.,5.0
26,"September 09, 2015","Prior to and during the sale, service is great. God forbid you should have a question or concern after the fact. I reached out to my salesman two days after the sale with a question and never received a response or acknowledgement. The following day, I left a message with a sales manager to express my concern - no response. I definitely will not be referring any friends or family to this dealership. I should have gone to Helfman Dodge. ",1.0
27,"August 22, 2015","This dealership was the most helpful of all those I have ever worked with when buying a new vehicle!
I purchased a new Ram pickup and after I got it home realized it was to lightweight for what I needed.
I returned the next day and changed my purchase to a Ram 2500. No questions, no problems! 
I couldn't be more pleased with my experience and the sales rep was a pleasure to work with.
 Thanks Fred Seel !

28,"July 29, 2015","I had emailed with a ""Internet Sales Manager"" supposedly named Sunshine Delgado.  There was a truck on their website that I wanted to test drive.  She emailed me the VIN and the link and said the truck was there for me to come by and ask for her (She even made an appointment with me).  I even spoke with her on the phone. Well I drove 45 minutes after work to look at it and was suspicious from the start.  When I got there and asked for her, they handed me off right away to another salesman.  So I ask him if they are ready to have me test drive the truck.  Well surprise, surprise he said that truck is no longer there.  I said let me talk to the manager.  He went and got MIKE EPP, the sales manager. So first I ask Mike where ""Sunshine Delgado"" is and he says she's at lunch.... Really?  It was 4:30 pm in the afternoon AND she had an appointment with me. So I ask him where's the truck with that specific VIN that I had verified with Summer over the phone and via email.  He said ""Oh, we sold it yesterday, but we have a bunch of other ones just like that one.""  I told him why did they LIE to me and make me drive all this way and he flat out denied they LIED.

And while I was there, another customer cussed them out and called them crooks, this was just as I sat down.

These guys are the ultimate xxxxxxxx.  Stay Away!!!",1.0
29,"June 26, 2015","I drove from Waco to look at a used black Jeep Grand Cherokee. Once I arrived and decided to starting negotiating it took forever. They kept discussing my trade-in for a long time in a small glass room. When the car salesman came back they offered hardly anything for my car. I was very upset and most of all offended. I don't think a 2010 Jeep Grande Cherokee with 76,000 miles is worth 7,000. I can't give my car away. I drove to another dealership that same day and got 3,000 more for my trade-in. I never plan to come back even though I only drive Jeep or Dodge. ",1.0
30,"May 14, 2015",Fred Seel was our salesperson who tricked us into buying a vehicle that can't pull a trailer even though we specifically told him what we needed it for. We have been told lie after lie by this dealer. We can't even get a title for the vehicle and its been almost 3 months!,1.0
31,"February 27, 2015","My husband and I traded in my 2013 Jeep compass for a new 2015 Jeep Cherokee. I worked with Hoyuki online and with Henry Hernandez at the dealership and they provided excellent service. Our transaction was fast and hassle free. Henry was very nice, friendly, and helpful. He helped us with our vehicle and made the process extremely easy and stress free. I have gone to other Jeep dealerships in the past and the sales guys are horrible. I felt welcomed and was not pressured to purchase anything. I would recommend that you go there and I will definitively be buying from them again in the future. ",5.0

33,"November 22, 2013","Went to the dealership with a pre-approval from my preferred financing vendor and gave it to them and let them know the truck I was interested and the price on the website that was $28,143   sales person Jeff said he had to check that because he does not know pricing. Jeff called and told me that everything went through and i could pick up the vehicle i chose the next day. When i got there we went over all the terms on a 4 panel bidding sheet he told me that the price was now 29,999 because the website shows cash only prices I let him know that was not listed anywhere and he said he understood but that was a cash price and they could not honor it I told him i would agree to that price if they paid off my trade in (2735) and gave us 2000 down he agreed and we both signed the paper. They then took me to financing and explained all the details as we spoke I said that was correct and then they explained that they could not use my preferred vendor and preapproval because they declined me I asked why and he said because of my debt to income ratio and called someone over at my lender to ""verify"" I said reluctantly agreed because I did not understand how i could get denied after a preapproval ( later I spoke with my finance company they said the reason they said no is because the price was hiked up and it was a 2010 at 95000 miles so the pricing was not approvable) .....they then had me sign and initial blank documents for the truck and handed me brochures for the warranty they said they provided for gap coverage and a 1yr warranty later the finance guy ran them through the printer folded them and handed them to me and said congrats on the car. It was not till I got home and was about to add insurance to the vehicle that I saw they changed most of the information from what we agreed on they put a higher price for my trade in pay-off and then listed that we still owed them 900 so they never added the pay-off and additional 2000 dollars for it then said my 1000 dollars was a 100 dollar payment (guessing they were going to use the rest of it on the trade in) so now they have us listed for a 2010 truck at 680 for 72 months they never added the 2735 to pay off the vehicle and they have a trade in . I went back to speak with the finance guy he directed us to the used car manager and That gentle man (I use the term very loosely) basically did not address the blank documents the higher pricing or they did not pay off my truck and provide the 2000 we agreed on the company said they have a signed contract and i better come up with the money or i get a repo. I let them know there was no way we could afford the vehicle with the pricing they put on the contract and they were not concerned one bit I was quite appalled by his behavior overall until I spoke with the General manager showed her the documentation proving the numbers were wrong and asked her to produce the worksheet we signed prior to going to finance and she did not care either and told me to leave her dealership. So now i know even though I was referred to the company from my finance company they were out to rip me off from the moment i walked in there I cannot blame that on my lender because I felt that the company would work in the best interest of me and the referral company but I have quickly seen that is not the case they are liars and cheats and they ALL practice dirty tactics in that particular dealership to line their paychecks at the customers expense

34,"June 05, 2012","Mr. Jackson helped me find my dream car, after 4 other dealerships failed to do so. He was extremely professional and and walked me through the process from beginning to end. He took all the stress and pressure out of the process, especially when I've had problems dealing with pushy salesman in the past.

35,"August 14, 2011","Went in to see about trading my 2011 Dodge 1500 Sport for a 2500 Diesel 4x4, very nice and open about everything, no games and no time wasting. I would recommend seeing these guys if looking for a Dodge/Chrysler/or Jeep vehicle.

The only questionable tactic was Jeff said he needed my vehicle bad and could give me more money than anyone else for trade or to buy outright from me. They came back with $25k, thats $25,000 which is $2,000 less than a 2010 model will bring with more miles. I don't know if that off the wall lowball BS price was from Jeff or someone else who thought I looked like a sucker that wanted to give my truck away but time will tell. If they come back with $15k+ off the new truck then maybe I will understand their lowball offer better, but otherwise I have 3 other dealerships offering $4,000 more on my trade but only $9k-$12k off a $51k msrp truck. 

Everything I saw was 5 stars today, I was in and out quick, no games(gave my key back to me after I test drove and fell in love with the 2500), from what I have seen Mac Haik Dodge is a business I would recommend and buy vehicles from. I am a fourth time returning customer but these are all new people I have never dealt with before.



I had another dealership &quot;lose&quot; my key when it was sitting on the sales managers desk the whole time and I had to go in and get it myself. They &quot;lost&quot; my key because I was approved and ready to go but they wanted $3,000 more than I was willing to pay, the sales guy said &quot;its only $60 more per month&quot; but was'nt willing to give the the $60/monthly to make up difference. After that I walked out and started looking for my key because I will not buy anything from a hypocrit, sad thing is if he whipped $60 out of his pocket I would have bought right then and there just because he showed integrity which is very rare in the car business.....Avoid Tomball Dodge!!!

Will update next week and see how this dealership pans out.

It is now 8/22 and no phone calls or follow ups in any form. They were still nice guys but not following up in over a week on a buyer for a $51k+ msrp truck in this economy is crazy. If you are looking for a Chrysler/Dodge/or Jeep vehicle drive 6 miles north on the freeway and visit Spring Dodge where they have a high rating from hundreds of satisfied customers. Look them up on this site and read for yourself, looks like they take great care of their customer at Spring Dodge.",3.0
