0,"June 26, 2019","Want to thank and commend Sales advisor: Vivian Vu for taking extra steps to assist and guide us in our 2019 Buick sales process! Great to work Vivian Vu, very passionate about her job, ensuring the we are happy with the advice and making ours a really smooth transaction!

We live this vehicle and also the purchasing choices presented, and Vivian helped easily deciphering the numbers (with multiple applicable discounts stacked on top of the each other). We really thank Vivian, for her passion to help clients and do the sales (in-fact Vivian was more of an Advisor in guiding us thru, rather than typical pushy Sales!), and we give thumbs up for Sewell dealership in helping us towards our 2019 Buick purchase. 

We came out very impressed how smooth the whole process turned-out to be! Thank to - Sales manager/director Steven Lamb and financing/business manager, and rest of the Sewell Buick/GMC teams have taken extra-steps, and special care to meet our strict financial needs – ensuring both vehicle suitability as well as financial budget. Kudos to Vivian and Sewell Team!",5.0
1,"May 10, 2019","I looked at several vehicles at Sewell, ranging from a 2010 Acadia to a 2017 Enclave. I ended up purchasing my dream vehicle elsewhere simply because it wasn't available on any of Sewell's many lots at the time. However, I can't tell you how awesome and professional the staff here was. On the 2010 my sales guy OFFERED to replace the break pads and provide a second key and key fob on a 9 year old vehicle! I ended up purchasing a 2016 from a different dealer and they wouldn't replace the worn tires of provided a second key. All that you've heard about the Sewell experience is true!! Looking to spend your time and money at a credible dealership, this is it!",5.0
2,"March 11, 2018","Want to thank and commend Vivian Vu for taking extra steps to assist and guide us in our 2018 sales/lease process! Great to work Vivian Vu, very passionate about her job, ensuring the buyer is extremely pleased with the advice and smooth transaction! 

We've been very happy with the vehicle and leasing/purchasing choices presented, and Vivian helped easily deciphering the numbers in such a complex lease transaction (with multiple discounts stacked on top of the each other). We really thank Vivian, for her passion to help clients and do the sales (in-fact Vivian was more of an Advisor in guiding us thru, rather than typical pushy Sales!), and we give thumbs up for Sewell dealership in helping us towards our 2018 vehicle lease/purchase. 

We came out very impressed how smooth the whole process turned-out to be! Thank to - Sales Director Steven Lamb (Sales Director) and Courtney Lucky (financing/business manager), and rest of the Sewell Buick/GMC teams have taken extra-steps, and special care -- literally 'bend over backwards' to make this deal happen that meet our strict financial needs – ensuring both vehicle suitability as well as financial budget. Kudos!

The dealership had Ice-Cream on this Saturday afternoon – with Free custom specialty Ice cream sandwiches made on-site and offered to the whole floor and all the customers. This made more of a family setting and helped lighten up what could be a tight sales floor. This turned out to be our icing on the cake, on top of our purchase! Did we mention, Free unlimited car washes/vacuum at any/all Sewell dealerships comes with this purchase!

This is TWICE in a three years Sewell family dealerships taking care of our vehicle needs, kudos Sewell family dealership guys!",5.0
3,"July 14, 2011","This is my first GMC purchase. I purchased my Terrain in Amarillo, TX and shortly after I was experiencing an engine noise, like a knocking noise. I brought my Terrain in several times to the Panhandle dealerships to be dismissed every time. This was so frustrating because the vehicle only had 8,000 mile on it. During Spring Break I decided since I would be in the Dallas area I would drop my Terrain off at Sewell GMC where I was approach by Justin Townsend. I voiced my concerns and addressed the knocking noise. Mr. Townsend reassured me he would figure out the problem. Mr. Townsend provided me with a loaner vehicle and always made sure I had everything I needed. I ended up taking Sewell GMC's loaner vehicle back to Amarillo while my Terrain was still being fixed. After a few days it was determined that my engine needed to be replaced in my Terrain. Mr. Townsend was more than willing to send his staff on an 8 hour drive to return my Terrain to me and then have his staff drive their loaner vehicle back to Dallas. I have nothing but outstanding things to say about Sewell GMC. The customer service Justin Townsend, Head Technician, and management provided me is truly unheard of. They were prompt, efficient, over the top accommodating and so willing and eager to make this a hassle free experience for me. After this experience I know with the utmost confidence I will continue to take my business to Sewell GMC; and recommend them to everyone I know.
