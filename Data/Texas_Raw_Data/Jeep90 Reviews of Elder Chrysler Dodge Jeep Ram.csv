0,"May 06, 2019",Had been looking for truck for weeks. Went my closest dealer with the printout of the truck I wanted and where it was located. The sales manager told me if I didn't want the similar truck at his dealer he couldn't help me then he walked away. I called Elder and told salesman Oliver Beltran what wanted and here it was. Oliver called me back in a few hours and told me that truck will be at his dealer in morning and he would have everything ready to sign Worked with Mandy in business office and she was  great also. ,5.0
1,"October 15, 2018","I purchased a pre-owned from Elder, Alexis Johnson and Forrest Elder are the BEST at customer service ! The truck was exactly what I was looking for and at a very good price . Alexis made sure that my buying experience was that of what I receive from the luxury dealers in Dallas. Bringing my vehicle and paper work to me in another town was A+++++++. Thanks Alexis.    ",5.0
2,"August 15, 2017","I found this dealership through the Ram website. They had the exact vehicle I was interested in. I was contacted by Internet manager-Kris who answered my questions and set up an appointment. 
I drove 124 miles to get there. On my arrival, Salesman-JT was waiting on me. We took a test drive and he was able to answer all my questions.

JT got the deal I wanted. I met both of the Mr. Elder's who treated my like I was an old friend. 

When its time for another Ram, I'll be back!",5.0

5,"September 22, 2014","I live in a small town with 3 dealerships. I have bought a new car from each. My purchase last week was by far the best! I walked in at 2pm and left 2 hours later with my new truck! My salesman Stephen was great! Friendly, knowledgable and made the process effortless. I needed to go pick my son up from football practice and one of the managers handed me the keys to his personal vehicle and said ""we will have you ready to go as soon as you get back."" Sure enough 20 mins later my new ride was ready to go! My other purchase experiences at ""other"" dealerships were terrible....xxxx I felt like it took an ENTIRE day to buy a car! Elder dodge has a new life long customer! Efficient, friendly, and I got a great price for my trade and on my new ride! Thank you to everyone at Elder's for a great experience! ",5.0

7,"September 06, 2014","I already knew what type of vehicle I wanted and I did a website search for it. Elder Dodge had exactly what I was wanting. I talked to several people that lived in Athens and all their responses where excellent. I called and spoke with Stephen Magee and he was very patient and attentive to my wants, needs, expectations and even my work schedule. We worked out the rough details on the phone before I drove 45 minutes to the dealership. Once we arrived we were greeted immediately with smiles and hello's. At no point did we ever feel pressured. The deal went smoothly and we were treated like we were the only ones they cared about. Thank you to all of them for our experience and there family type atmosphere. I would also like to add that there website was very user friendly!!

Thanks again

Although our circumstances changed and we ended going in a different direction, I wholeheartedly recommend working with the team at Elder, particularly Stephen Magee.

13,"December 29, 2013","Keven came  to meet us, was very friendly and knowledgable and helped us with the application for a new car. He also talked to us about a used car. He made both of us very comfortable during our time there. The payments were higher than we felt comfortable with so therefore we declined to buy a car at this time. Would like to have keven again when we return at a later time, if possible.....Thanks.....Sincerely, Larry and Gwen Lamp",4.6

17,"November 30, 2013","Enjoyed the experience of a ""Business"" Transaction - Keven is a No-Nonsense Professional who appreciated the value of my trade-in - maintained the balance of staying in touch but not pushy.  Mr. Elder's interaction helps you feel you are getting the best deal possible, not just for show.  No ""oh by the ways"" at closing - just $'s for ""Drive-out with a Full Tank of Gas"".",5.0

20,"October 17, 2013","Was in the market for a Ram 2500 and after spending hours online looking through inventories at several dealerships, I found one in stock here that fit the bill.  I took off work to make the 1.5 hour drive from Frisco to look at it and was sold on the spot, but that was the easy part.  I've purchased many vehicles, but none of my previous experiences came even close to this one.  By far the best service I've ever had and it was worth every minute of the drive.  The staff makes you feel at home and very appreciated, and growing up in a small town, I felt at home.  The owner even dropped by to say a few words.  Many companies can take a lesson from these guys.  I will even continue to make the drive to have the servicing done by this team and will be a customer for life.",5.0
21,"October 01, 2013",LOVE Elder Dodge. 2nd vehicle purchase & couldn't be happier. Alex in service dept & Mike Trevino in svc. dept are 2 of the nicest guys & go 110% for customer.

23,"September 07, 2013","In my first experience with buying a truck for personal and business use Kevin Cruz, Elder Dodge, and their whole team were on the mark of perfection. I told them exactly what I was looking for and they exceeded expectations. Kevin went above and beyond to get the deal done and he moved promptly just like I needed. They did not ride the negotiation process out like a lot of dealerships and salesman. Kevin and his whole team were super friendly and they are in the customer service business not just the car business. They build relationships and add value to your experience. Thank you Kevin and Elder Dodge for a great experience and a great vehicle!! I will be back to see you again!!",5.0

26,"August 17, 2013","I bought a 2013 crew cab 4x4 in April from Elder Dodge with the promise of remote start. They found out this week that the particular truck could not have that feature, Elder Dodge and Stephen Magee offered a straight across swap with the exact same truck with remote start at no cost. How dealers do you think would make that offer? Luckily, Stephen knows my weakness and offered me an upgrade to a mega cab for minimal cost. All I can say is, WOW. I would tell anyone and everyone, before you buy go see Stephen and the guys at the GREATEST DEALERSHIP IN TEXAS - ELDER DODGE",5.0
27,"August 12, 2013","We were just looking!  Then Tim was there shaking our hand and asking how he could help.  We told him what we were looking for and he showed us what he had that we might be interested in.  We were very happy with the choices we were given and the excellent service from the entire dealership.  We love our truck and will definitly check with Elder's Dodge, and Tim when it's time for our next truck.

28,"June 27, 2013","Best car buying experience that I have had in thirty years. My dread was driving onto the dealership lot, be met by a car salesman who had to make a sale and felt he needed to show his inventory of cars. At Elder Chrysler-Dodge we were approached by a sales consultant; his name is Stephen Magee, a wonderful person to do business with. He invited us into his office, asked how he could assist us and what we  wanted to purchase. Stephan listened to what we wanted and not try to sale us what he thought we needed. In fact he almost did to good of a job. I told him that "" I want a Dodge Caravan, must be black, prefer cloth seats with a good radio and air condition. It does not even need to have back seats. He excused himself and in a few minutes he had found a Dodge Tradesman, which is a Caravan with a steel rear floor, in black  and for a price that I felt was fair and did not need negotiating. This is a beautiful car that is used at a funeral home. He is the only person that we had to see other than Mandy who typed the title up, which was completed ahead of time. Over a two day period one day to buy the car and the other to receive the car the entire transaction took less than an hour. No pressure sales, easy going home folks. Elder Chrysler-Dodge is a good dealership, Stephen Magee is a great salesman. Thank you. We will be back.",4.8
29,"June 16, 2013",My sales man Kevin Cruz was friendly and was happy to walk me threw all the features of my new truck. Even days after my purchase.  The GM came out to greet us. I will go back for my next truck and will be sending my friends.  Normally buying a car is a headache but this time was a pleasurable experience,5.0
30,"May 18, 2013","No pressure, down to earth, like buying a car from good friend.  Easiest car buying experience ever.  Told Tim what I wanted and he delivered.   Owner was very gracious.  I will tell anyone interested in a dodge or jeep to shop here.   Definitely a laid back atmosphere with no frills.  I highly recommend you check out their website and use the live chat feature - very helpful.  ",5.0
31,"May 15, 2013",A big thank you to Tim Powell at Elder Dodge for helping us select a new and much needed vehicle.  We appreciate him working so hard to find us a great deal within our budget after our vehicle was totaled in an accident.  Tim and the entire staff at Elder Dodge made our (unplanned) buying experience the best ever!,5.0
32,"May 10, 2013","My internet search for the vehicle that fit my needs took me to Elder Dodge 50 miles away. 
All the employees that I came in contact with were very pleasant and helpful. Kevin Cruz meet me in the lot and assisted me in a manner that I was very comfortable with. He was never pushy or tried to sell me anything I was not interested in. His knowledge of the vehicles was refreshing and informing.
I am very pleased with the experiance and will look forward to my next visit. I would recommend Elder Dodge to every one. 
It was very nice to shop with pleasure once again.
Thanks Kevin and Elder Dodge.

34,"April 19, 2013","This dealership obviously has elected not to recognize, acknowledge, or otherwise reward customer loyalty. This latest purchase of a new vehicle was my third there in 5 years.  I have had every bit of service and scheduled maintenance performed at this dealership. In my opinion I was a loyal repeat customer.  After all this time, this latest salesman has decided to treat me with disrespect and a demeaning attitude.  Not only was I not offered one single incentive for being a loyal repeat customer, the salesman attempted to cheat me by listing my exceptional trade in as less quality than it was. I told him I was insulted by his offer after I had already told him what I expected to get out of the trade in.  He immediately went to my price but by then I was already offended that he would even attempt it.  He stated his reason for doing so was that the dealership needed the money. To add insult to injury, I had inquired about having an electric brake controller installed since I tow a camper.  Before money changed hands, he said it could be done with no problem. I remembered to ask again after we were complete with the transaction only to find that he wanted to charge me over $300 to install it.  A product that I could have done down the street for less than $190.  I became even more offended that he again showed no recognition of my repeat business and that I just once again spent a lot of money with him.  Again, his reason is because the dealership needs the money.  I had to make another trip to the dealership to bring my second set of keys to my trade in.  I was greeted with rudeness and much disrespect.  He had promised to fix a scratch that was on the truck, but once he saw me only asked about the key very rudely.  I suppose that is again because money has already changed hands and he does not have to live up with unwritten promises.  Another reason of many why I will take my business elsewhere.",1.2
35,"April 11, 2013",Everyone at Elder was more than helpful and did all they could to make a deal happen for me. I don't have the best credit rating and Kevin Cruz exhausted all options to find a way to make this purchase possible for me. A very big thanks to the great folks at ELDER CHRYSLER DODGE JEEP. I highly recommend a visit to Elder if you are looking for great service and selection of vehicles..,5.0
36,"March 29, 2013","We love over 250 miles away and found this van on the internet.  Elder Dodge (Charles specifically) did a great job doing as much over the phone and internet as possible as all we had to do was drive our trade down, do a little paperwork and then we were on our way in about 2 hours.  The only complaint we had it that our driver front tire was low, they put air in it and said we were good.  We continues to have a low tire off and on and now know we had a nail in the tire.  I would of appreciated it if they would of took it off and looked at us because normally there is a reason for a low tire.  But other than that all the people were great and we LOVE our new van from Elder Dodge!",4.6

56,"November 30, 2012","Salesperson was very nice and helpful.  He made the car buying experience better than I am used to.  Even the owner came and introduced himself, which is unheard of, and made us feel extremely welcome and important.  The only reason I gave a good rating on price is because I bought a very expensive car, the Chrysler 300c, and there is not as much wiggle room as I would have liked because I am used to haggling over price, but would have probably spend the same amount even if the car was originally priced higher to begin with.  Thank you Elder Chrysler! ",4.8

64,"August 20, 2012","First of all, let me start off by saying that we are from Lufkin, Tx. The day before visiting the dealership, i was browsing on the internet at several different vehicles (SUV's in mind) & comparing them. We had already test driven 3 different makes & were not sure what route we were going to take. I came across a Nissan Pathfinder on y'alls website and became very interested, seeing as how my husband had mentioned this type of vehicle to me. I called just before closing on a Friday evening and spoke to a salesman (Bill Johns) to set up an appointment for Saturday. I inquired about the vehicle to make sure it was still on the lot. He assured me that it was and proceeded to tell me that he was not going to be there on Saturday, but referred me to ""Shack"". When we first got to the dealership, nobody came to help us. My husband had to go ask for ""Shack"" to come help us. A few minutes later, 1 of the managers (Chuck, I think)came to help us, while ""Shack"" finished up with another customer. We were able to test drive several different cars that we saw there, but were really interested in the Nissan Pathfinder. Once we decided that we wanted that vehicle, it was smooth sailing. The staff was very friedly. We would recommend this dealership to all our friends & family. We will highly consider visiting this dealership again in the future.

75,"June 03, 2012","Haden Elder is is a man that knows how to sell cars! I priced Toyota and Dodge and advised him I was on the fence, he went out of his way to make me realize that Dodge was by far the better purchase for my dollar. I have purchased three new Dodge vehicles in the last six months, two from Elder Dodge and I can not say enough good things about Haden Elder and his salesman. Stephen ""Goo"" Magee was the young man assigned to handle our sale and he was extremly professional, knowledgable, and above all a real nice guy! I did my homework, knew what I wanted and how much I was willing to spend, Haden and Stephen located my truck in record time and made the deal exactly in my price range. Haden even earned my finance business by closely matching my credit unions interest rate. Thank you Haden Elder and Stephen Magee for making a truck buying experiance something to smile about from beginning to drive-off! I would highly recommend this dealership to my friends and family and will obviously return to Elder Dodge for my next vehicle(s.)",5.0
