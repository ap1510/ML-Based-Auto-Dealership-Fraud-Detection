1,"May 03, 2020",We had a wonderful car buying experience at Van Griff Kia. They were friendly and knowledgeable. They take their time answering your questions and donâ€™t make you feel pressured. We worked with Edan Palmer and Brad Ferris. Both top notch guys. Thanks for my new ride!!!!,5.0
2,"January 21, 2020",Fabulous vehicle and an unbeatable price always makes a buying experience great. Throw in a wonderful sale person like Eden Palmer and a management staff working with him to help us and you just can't beat it! Van Griffith is THE place for us when it comes to buying cars.,5.0
3,"December 05, 2019","Friendly, knowledgeable and patient sales associate.  He  listened and heard our needs and flexed as that changed.  The options for vehicles that met our needs was satisfactory and we ultimately chose something that really exceeded our expectations.  Kia has made believer out of this 30+ year Toyota veteran!!  And we returned to Van Griffith with no hesitation 9 months after purchasing our first Kia!  Worth the drive to Granbury!!  Ask for Mike D! ",5.0

5,"May 12, 2018","I have to say the buying experience was good. It's what happened afterwards that wasn't so good. I bought a used 2015 Nissan Murano on a Monday night. I had the car back up there Wednesday. I told my used car salesman that I wanted to return it because I needed something dependable. He told me that wasn't an option but he could get me in something but I would probably be taking a big hit. I let their service department look at it and they said there wasn't anything wrong with it. Well I told then to send it to Nissan to check it. They told me I would have to make the arrangements but they would take it. Well, they missed my appointment because no one took it. Nissan has checked my car and they are having to replace the transmission. I haven't heard not one word for Kia. No apologies...nothing. Most dealerships would back what they sell and give you a trial period. The paperwork hadn't even gone through when I wanted to give them their defective vehicle back. They said it was my problem. Horrible customer service!!!",1.0
6,"October 09, 2016","When we went into Van Griffith Kia on !0/3/16 we had no intention of buying a new car - we only wanted to take a test drive to compare the Sorento vs the Hyundai Santa Fe . What we found was that the Sorento beat the  Santa Fe hands down in comfort , style , and mpg. Still , we had planned on getting our new vehicle through the Sam's Club / TRUEcar program . We already knew what our guaranteed savings would be through the TRUEcar dealers . We also knew what our trade was worth based on kbb.com. Our salesman, Eden Palmer asked if he could try to work out a deal for us . It never hurts to ask . To make a long story short , they matched the savings from the TRUEcar program and gave us  fair value for our trade. And , we didn't need to go to Ft Worth or Dallas for our new vehicle . We love our new Sorento.  Hats off to Eden and the team at Van Griffith Kia ",5.0
7,"July 15, 2015","I want to say up front I hate buying a new car. From the time I drive on the lot, usually I feel like fresh meat for the vultures that are hovering just waiting for you to exit your car. At Van Griffith, the opposite is true. These people run a classy dealership (down home country style). 

JR was our salesman and I can not say enough good things about him. From the get go, he was behind the 8 ball because I had a firm quote from a Dallas dealer that would be hard to beat. He went out of his way to find me the deal I wanted and met the price (he also threw in 2 free hats). He also spent nearly an hour with my wife sitting in the car going over all the gadgets on the Soul Exclaim. He was patient with old folks like us, never in a hurry. 

I will recommend Van Griffith to anyone looking for a vehicle purchase in the future.",5.0
8,"July 06, 2015","Our purchase through Brad and the internet sales department was simple and pain-free.  At pick-up, the staff was ready for our arrival and made the paperwork and new car transfer as easy as possible.  They even made sure we were made familiar of every gadget/gismo in the new car.  Thank you! ",5.0

10,"April 28, 2015","I have a 2011 Kia Sedona with 39,000 miles.   A while back the engine was making an odd noise, we had it towed to van griffith.  First they told us they would not supply a loaner vehicle because we didn't purchase the vehicle from them. ..  ok..  The diagnosis was a tensioner pulley and they sent me on my way.   A couple of months later,  I'm driving down the road, there's a loud bang, engine dies and won't start.   I have it towed again,  the service tech says it looks like the oil has NEVER been changed,  says there's probably sludge in the engine and the warranty won't cover it.   We provided maintenance receipts, they took the valve cover off and what do you know?   Sludge build up that caused catastrophic engine failure.   We contacted Kia consumer affairs,  a week later that was denied.   I have filed a case with the BBB, and Becky Oliver from Fox 4 news is investigating as well.   I have contacted Kia corporate,  I have been told numerous times that someone would contact me.   I have yet to hear a word.   I have been a Kia customer since 2006.  I'm paying on a vehicle I can't use and it's the ONLY vehicle I can fit my family in (we have 5 children).  I'm absolutely sick about the whole situation.  Not once has any one offered to help.  I spoke with one of the salesmen and told him my story, the first words out of his mouth were ""well the great thing about Kia is the warranty"".  No, no it's not.  Look up Kia consumer affairs and you will read story after story just like mine, it's like reading from a script.   Learn from my mistakes! ",1.0
11,"April 27, 2015","I've purchased a lot of vehicles in my 60 years but I've never had a experience in buying a car like I did with Jay Simons. No pressure, up front on details, no back and forth. Just a great salesman.",5.0
12,"February 24, 2015",I've been buying from this dealership since November 2003 and just picked up my 12th vehicle from them today. There isn't any other dealership I care to shop because each of my experiences have been effortless and enjoyable.,5.0
13,"February 05, 2015",The service at Van Griffith is great! Everyone is so friendly and helpful. Chad is a great salesman.  I love my new Soul! Thank you so much. ,5.0
14,"January 30, 2015","Hands down, this dealership is the most personable dealership! Dawn Reese Law is the best. Ryan Moorehead was the salesperson and she went out of her way to make sure we were happy with our new Kia Soul... Financial was persistent with getting us the best loan, general management , Dawn runs the staff to make sure service is impeccable. We do highly recommend this excellent dealership! ",5.0
15,"January 19, 2015","I knew what I wanted and did my shopping on the internet. It was very fast and convenient! The day I posted my request, I received a response back. The dealership also made the purchase very smooth and fast. The staff made themselves available to stay past their work hours to accommodate our work hours. Very pleased with the service I received!",5.0
16,"November 08, 2014",Jay Simons did really good. He was not pushy at all. We told him our price range and he showed us the vehicles that was in that range. He did really good.  I would recommend him to everyone. ,5.0
17,"November 07, 2014","Jay Simons, listened to our needs and pointed us in the right direction. Jay never tried to sway us on way or the other or sell us more car than we were looking for. By far, Jay is the best car salesman I have ever done business with. Once we decided on a vehicle, Jim Dollins walked us through the financing process and we were on the road with our new Kia. Both Jay and Jim did a great job of getting us through the process with no hassle and excellent customer service. If your in the market for a new car and your interested in excellent customer service go to Van Griffith Kia first! ",5.0
18,"October 01, 2014",Hands down the BEST car buying experience I have ever had! Was able to get most the information I needed from Brad through e-mail. Once it was time to go in Ryan and Dawn took extra special care of me. They made me feel very comfortable and well taken care of. Ryan was very knowledgeable and never made me feel pressured. Dawn was amazing...made me feel like I was buying a car from family. All involved were AWESOME! I will definitely go back and recommend to everyone I know! VG KIA is where it's AT!!! ,5.0
19,"September 12, 2014","Friendly Staff, quick service, great experience, and a good price!  The drive out to Granbury was definitely worth our time!  The three other dealer visits in the DFW area couldn't even compare to Van Griffith!",5.0
20,"September 07, 2014","Fond the right car, with the right color at the right price. Fortunately for us w also found the right sales person. Ryan Moorehead was so easy to deal with if changed my perspective about pushy car sales people. She was friendly,  knowledgeable and efficient. ",4.2
21,"August 10, 2014","I have bought 3 KIAs from Van Griffith KIA in the past year and a half from Eddie Patterson. He is the best or I would not have gone back. He is a genuine person and a pleasure to work with. Eddie is always available if I have any questions. Recently, I had a question about one of my KIAs and Eddie stepped right in to help me figure out what was going on. Luckily, it was nothing.
I also want to praise the service department! The service advisors are very professional and competent. I have worked with Joey Rempel and Leonard Scott and am very pleased. I would highly recommend this service department.
Van Griffith KIA is a small dealership and it feels like a family because everyone knows everyone. I would suggest that you buy your KIA from Van Griffith KIA and get it serviced there as well!
You will be glad you did!",5.0
22,"July 28, 2014","I first went and looked at southwest kia and from the online info. They had a 2013 kia soul listed for only $12,000. We went up there to the location they told us and wouldn't you know it that car was at a different one. Not only that it was listed as an automatic and wasn't. They went from telling we I would qualify for a payment of $175 a month to $380. We decided to keep looking when a friend told me about Van Griffith. I had a wonderful sales guy and really everyone in there was awesome. We got exactly what we wanted at a much lower payment. ",5.0
23,"July 23, 2014","Start to finish, The Best Experience EVER buying a car! Chad McGinnis is a genuine, thoughtful man of integrity. A trustbuilder.  Always encouraging questions and works to find answers he doesn't know right off, but mostly he had ready answers and offered us so much we didn't know.   His professional manner as well as his sense of humor were very welcomed! We actually had a GREAT time buying a car! ZERO stress!  Chad made such an impression it just felt right to name our new Kia ""McGinnis""

Jim Dollins took over the end financials and we loved his patience, professionalism and again great sense of humor. There were belly laughs! Who has a happy time filling out forms? We did! Hearty Recommendations for anyone who wants a joyful experience! 

Van Griffith Kia just plain works. There is no mystery to why. They simply put the needs of people first. ",5.0
24,"July 18, 2014","When I feel the desire for a new automobile I always return to Van Griffith Kia. They always make us feel like part of the family. They are genuine and friendly folks that are always willing to go the extra mile to make our experience joyful and effortless. Ryan, in sales, is a down to earth gal with great knowledge of cars. Great in helping pick out just the right car for your desires. Randy is always looking out for my best interest at heart. Joey is a outstanding service manager. Dawn is very helpful at resolving any car issues.  Jim, in finance, always works very hard to get me the best deal for my budget. My credit has not always been so good, but Jim always comes through for me. Brad is excellent for your internet deals. I won't go any place else!!   Thanks guys and girls, you all make my car shopping a pleasing experience.  Love all of you!!  Lynn Benge",5.0
25,"July 12, 2014","The most stress FREE purchase - EVER!
My brother accompanied me the day I looked and took a test drive.  The sales staff addressed ME and not just the man.  I appreciated this.  I was given a very fair price for what I think will be a good product. Everyone that I saw was friendly and very accommodating.  I am thinking of another vehicle purchase soon.  I hope it will be at VGK.  Friends had told me about their wonderful experience with VGK, and now I have a story too!",5.0
26,"June 28, 2014","They are the only honest dealership in Texas! They are honest and friendly! I would never buy a car from anyone else again. They told me what I would get for my trade in, which was more than any other place, and that was what I got with no haggling. The price was thousands below msrp. The entire car buying process was really painless which says a lot because usually it's a long and drawn out process. Don't waste your time checking out the other dealerships in Texas, just go straight to them. You will not find a better deal or a better group of guys to work with. ",5.0
27,"June 03, 2014","As a first-time, new car buyer, I was apprehensive to purchase a car from an individual I did not know. Everyone has heard the nightmare stories of high-pressure sales, intense negotiations, and rude sales people. Well, I had the exact opposite experience. Jay was an amazing individual who really made my first car purchase memorable. He was very helpful and honest about everything, which was quite refreshing. He accommodated every request I had and was a valuable resource for questions. If he did not know the answer, he would find the individual who could help me. I am so thankful for this amazing car purchase! Without Jay, I would not have had as good of a time. 

Also, I wanted to mention/thank Brad for his honesty and knowledge in the finance department! Again, much like Jay, he was up front and helpful in answering all of my questions.",5.0
28,"April 09, 2014","I have never had a NEW car and was really nervous at trading in my 2004 Saturn Vue. When I walked in and met Eddy Patterson he was more than willing to help me with what I needed and very professional. I never felt pushed into anything or overwhelmed by the prices or the experience of it all. He was very courteous and professional in helping me to choose what fit me best. After that he introduced me to Jim Dollins who made the numbers work for me. I am one HAPPY NEW KIA OWNER! Thank you guys for going above and beyond to help me get into the best new car ever! I will absolutely be telling everyone about your awesome service.  So glad I didn't go to the Toyota Dealership where I started out to go.You guys are the BEST! God Bless!

32,"February 28, 2014","I had checked out your web site on Friday and my wife and I decided to drive into Granbury from Brownwood on Saturday.  About 20 minutes out of Granbury, BradFerris gave me a call to follow-up on my web site visit.  I told him I was heading that way and would arrive in a few minutes.  Upon arrival Brad greeted me at the door By Name.  I assume Brad was working with another customer because he asked  if Marcus could help me, Which was fine.  I told Marcus that I was looking for a 2012 or 2013 Soul, but I would like to test drive a 1.6 and a 2.0 so that I would know the differents in performance.  He promptly accomadated and during the test drives expland the features of the Soul.  He also explaned the discounts that were available.  Marcus listens to the customer.  I didn't have to repete myself and he didn't waste my time showing me cars that didn't meet my needs.  We talked about tradea trade-in.  I told him that I had dented my door on my car and that it should be ready by the end of the coming week.  But I didn,t drive it down because of  body work and I didn't think the dealership would offer what I thought I could sell it for.  He explained the Tax savings of a trade-in, which I hadn't realy thought thru.  To shorten a long story we did some paperwork and was nicely surprized by the dealerships offer for my trade-in,unseen and trusting me to bring them the car after the repair is completed.  The deal was sealed.  This was by far the best,easyest new car buy I,ve ever done afterall the paper work was completed, I think at least half the dealership including the owner came by to Thank and congradulate us on our new car purchase.",5.0
33,"February 26, 2014",I was very pleased with my experience here.  They were all very friendly and quickly understood by needs.  I needs great gas mileage and I was on a budget.  They helped me to locate a vehicle with really good gas mileage.  The worked with me on pricing and trade in value and we were able to stay within my budget.  I would recommend this dealer to my friends and family.  Thanks Van Griffith Kia for all of you assistance. ,5.0

The best thing for me is it didn't take hours upon hours to make this sale. I feel very comfortable that Brad and Jay gave me the best deal. I have always dreaded going car shopping but they made it a very pleasant and (SHORT) experience!,5.0
36,"February 13, 2014","For 2 years now, I have been telling myself that perhaps I just expected too darned much out of the support surrounding my first brand new car purchase. However, the latest event has finally trumped my thoughts of unrealistic expectations.

I would like it to be known that I do still love my little Soul. However, I feel that the relationship with the dealership from which I purchased my car has really fallen flat beyond being the channel through which I acquired my car. The moment I walked into the show room for the first time, it was as though everybody was my best friend...then I signed the paperwork, making the purchase official. 

Since then, these are the less than stellar interactions that immediately come to mind:

*There was a mix up in the delivery of my license plates.

* I was told that there was no courtesy light in my glove compartment when I called the service department about the intermittent light flash in the passenger floor board area that I suspected was the courtesy lamp. I was told that it could take a day or more to fix the problem & that ""the"" loaner car was not available. When asked if it was possible to get a phone call when the loaner was available, the call never came. Whenever I called about the status of the wait, I got the impression that I was an inconvenience. With concerns about my new car catching fire due to an electrical short, I got a bit more insistent that something needed to happen to get my car repaired & since I had only purchased the one car from Van Griffith, I had no back-up vehicle to rely on.  Oh, and it turned out that I DO have a courtesy lamp...because imagine my ""amusement"" when I discovered the tech specs underneath my passenger seat...

* I asked about why their policies are so different from most other dealerships who return your car after service with a wash & vacuum because they seem to have pride in the product that our vehicles represent (not to mention that the dealership name is proudly displayed on the vehicle!).  Oh, and also, some dealerships offer free oil changes, etc. when you purchase from them. To which the reply was, ""We do not have the facilities."" ???

* I tried to redeem a coupon for a free wash, pulled from the website, only to be told, ""We don't have a car wash."" 

* And now, the latest...because of the recent ice storms we have been experiencing lately, I had occasion to use my windshield washer...only to find out that the last time I brought it in to Van Griffith for service, the fluid top-off meant filling my reservoir with water instead of wiper fluid. Which I discovered as I was going down the road. Imagine my surprise! Thank Heavens the sudden ice sheet that developed did not result in an accident!!! This has given me pause to wonder if some of the other little oddities (occasional rough idle, strange noises, ammonia smell from the a/c, intermittent ghosts) may be a result of the service done.

I did voice my concerns to my salesman in the beginning and he assured me that all I needed to do was look him up whenever I came in & he would personally see to it that I was properly taken care of. Well, it is kinda hard to deal with a salesman who never seems to be there when you come in. 

And these are some of the reasons that I have decided to take my future business to a different dealership. I no longer feel as comfortable or SAFE in my car after the business dealings experienced at Van Griffith Kia. I must say that this really comes as a huge disappointment when talking about a major purchase. In the beginning, I could only say good things about how the purchase went. Now, sadly, when asked, I can only comment to the personal experiences received since the finalization of the purchase. I will choose more wisely when I get ready to make my next purchase and most especially when it comes to making recommendations for a good dealership.",2.8
37,"November 26, 2013","Two years ago, my wife purchased her new Kia Forte fom Van Griffith Kia. Her salesman was Michael Garr. She was extremely impressed with his professionalism and non pressure demeanor. When it came time to close the deal, I was introduced to Micahel and I too was very impressed in his style of salesmanship. He quickly made me feel like a close friend. Michael is very knowledgable about his product and was very thorough as he demonstrated how the electronics and features worked on our new car. As we were leaving the dealership, I told MIchael that I would be in the market to get another vehicle in about 2 years and that he would be the first person I would see. As it turns out, Michael was the first and last sales person I would see. Last week, I made my way to Van Griffith Kia, met with MIchael and once again, I felt like we were life long friends. I was interested in the two pre-owned Forte's on the lot. I was shown both cars and purchased the hatchback. The price was fantastic! The terms were fantastic! The quality of the vehicle looked as if it was new. Dawn and Jim made my closing process quick, easy and very relaing. I will highly reccommend this dealership to family and friends. Thanks again Micheal!",4.8

Therefore me and my husband drove down to your dealership from Gustine, Texas about 60 miles away just to try. We were greatly impressed on the way all of your staff especially Marcus Chavez and Brad Ferris and Jim Dollins.  Marcus made us feel right at home and was able to find us a vehicle that fit our needs perfectly. Brad was able to process our applications even before we arrived at the dealership which made everything flow perfectly.  Jim Dollins was able to get us great financing even tho we had less then perfect credit. Thank you for all your help with our purchase so far we are well pleased with our vehicle it is my dream car.

43,"August 23, 2013","From our initial drive through the lot to purchasing a new Optima our experience with Juan Zamudio was great.  He spent ""lots"" of time with us deciding on the right car and color.  We look forward to our future experiences with the dealership.",5.0
44,"August 07, 2013","I filled out an online survey months ago and Brad Ferris responded to me.  I told him I was not ready yet and he respected that and did not harass me.  this meant a lot to me.  He did check with me one more time and I told him that in about a month I was going to be ready to come in and look at cars.

When the day came that I was ready Brad was on vacation.  I left a voice mail on his cell phone and he had JImmy call me.  This means he took time from his vacation to help me and that really impressed me!  Jimmy was wonderful in helping me get connected with salesman Eddie Patterson.  Eddie is so knowledgeable of the car and haw it works!  He sat at his desk and told us where everything on the car was and how you worked it.  I ask him if all of the Kia's worked the same and he said no!  That means he knows all of the models, I think that is awesome.

From Eddie's office we went to Jim Dollins office.  He is the Finance Director.  He did a great job, he was freindly and infomative, but not judgemental at the finance choices we made.

All in all we had a great experience and I would recommend Van Griffith Kia to anyone interested in a Kia

46,"July 08, 2013","I went car shopping during the last weekend in July, 2013. I went to Granbury, Texas and went through all of the main dealerships (with the exception of the toyota dealership). I found not just good, nor great, but exceptional service. I have never had a ""good"" car buying experience before, however at Van Griffith Kia, the personnel went above and beyond to ensure my family received the best deal overall. Van Griffith Kia is hands down the best staff, therefore telling me (as the customer) they put forth training into every single person affiliated with them. It is truly unparrallel and I cannot express my gratitude enough for the experience.

48,"April 01, 2013","Phenomenal purchase experience!!!  Juan's professionalism and expertise of the Kia Sorrento made it very easy to purchase the car.  No pressure sales tactics and his follow-up were greatly appreciated.  

Everything delivered as promised.  There were a few issues the Kia Sorrento had.  Juan made us an appointment and followed through with everything.  Juan personally cleaned our vehicle and taught us step-by-step on the features of the car.

Excellent Service Department.  Service Department expertly corrected some minor vehicle issues (typical pre-owned vehicle issues).

Overall experience was outstanding!  There are benefits in shopping with a small-town dealership... Friendliness, Customer Service, being treated like family... Van Griffith Kia sets the Gold Standard for all dealerships!!!

49,"March 11, 2013","Before we visited this dealership, we called to inquire about the options they had and the prices. Mr. Carden was the most honest person we spoke with during our two month search for our vehicle. He told us what they had available at the dealership, he searched in other states to see if he could locate exactly what we wanted, he never pushed us to come in or gave us any false promises. Upon visiting the dealership that day, Mr. Carden was very warm and welcoming. He let us see and compare everthing. He took us for a detailed test drive. He explained everything he knew about the car from front to back and didnt lie to us if there was something he didnt know. He was friendly to our children and even provided them with drinks and coloring books so they could enjoy their visit, too. He gave us space and privacy to discuss things when we needed to, and never once made us feel pressured or uncomfortable. He never asked us if we wanted to buy, he never threw numbers at us. We went at our chosen pace, and we let him know when we were ready to sit down and figure out a deal. When we sat down with him, he gave us EXACTLY what he had said on the phone. He gave us a fantastic purchase price and a wonderful trade in price. We accepted his very first offer. When it came time for financing, Mr. Dollins was just as great! He made us feel like old friends, was warm and welcoming, and he didnt try to upsell us or offer us anything else. He was also honest. We left the dealership feeling truly happy, and blessed that our experience was so smooth. During the two months before our purchase, other car dealerships had been a nightmare- promising prices via the internet and phone that they did not stand behind when we arrived, guaranteeing us they had the car we wanted only to say, ""Darn it just drove off the lot"" when we showed up for our visit, going back and forth to their managers 6 times to bargain prices, making us sit with our kids for 4 hours only to find out they had no clue what they were talking about, their employees acting completely unprofessional in front of us, salesmen acting like they could care less about our purchase... The other dealerships left us stessed out with high anxiety! Van Griffith in Granbury was a top notch example of what customer service SHOULD be like. We were amazed by them, and have been bragging about our experience daily. We are so very appreciative for how they made us feel.",5.0
50,"March 11, 2013","I just purchased a vehicle from Van Griffith Kia and this experience was the best I've ever had buying a vehicle.  I have four children, all driving age, and have been in a few dealerships purchasing cars.  This was a pleasure, even considering the stress of buying a car.  I traveled two hours and had requested detailed info about the car before I made the trip.  The info was very accurate and the car was exactly what I had expected.  I'd recommend this dealership to anyone buying a vehicle.  It was well worth the drive!!",5.0
51,"March 01, 2013",I began looking at cars a few months back... Did my Internet research because in the past I have had negative car buying experiences with rude salesmen that were pushy and made me feel silly for asking questions. But I am a SHOPPER and was determined not to be taken advantage of as a single female.  I stopped by Van Griffith to look and was so very pleasantly surprised! Jimmy was helpful. Answered all my questions and let me look at every car I wanted to see. But for me that was still not enough. I was determined to get the best price. I contacted EVERY Kia dealership within 100 miles and did my price shopping- what a waste of time! Van Griffith blew ALL of them out of the water! I NEVER felt pressured and everyone there was so pleasant - especially Jimmy and Dawn! I went back to Van Griffith and my purchase was completed quickly and easily! Jimmy sat in my new car with me and my 10 year old duughter and patiently explained every button and gadget on my new Kia Optima SXL!!!! I truly enjoyed my car buying experience. I will definitely be a repeat customer and would recommend anyone not buy a car until you have visited Van Griffith! ,5.0

54,"January 21, 2013","Wonderful buying experience.  My husband and I stopped into the Kia dealership after seven months of looking for the perfect car. At Kia I was able to satisfy my ""cadillac taste on a pinto budget"" with a gently used 2011 Kia Sorento.  Upon our arrival Juan was very helpful in showing us all of the Sorentos on the lot.  Juan told us about a used Sorento that had just been traded with low miles, a good price and in great condition...but someone else was looking to buy it.  So we were surprised when he called us on Sunday to say the car was available.  I talked my husband into looking at 'one more' car.  It was everything Juan said it was...great condition,great price and great warranty.  He kept me abreast of what was happening with this particular car and never pressured us for a sale.  Juan took the time to show me every option on the vehicle and helped to sync my phone. Jim Dollins did a fabulous job in the area of financing by getting us the trade in value we asked, the interest rate wanted and the loan terms requested, all through our bank. Phenomenal experience. Thank you.  ",5.0
55,"December 28, 2012","We purchased a new Sorento today from VanGriffith Kia in Granbury.  We worked with Juan, Brad and Jim, it was the most unbelievable expierence we have ever had purchasing a new car. That is the most professional team we have ever worked with, we practically had all the information we needed before we drove to Granbury thanks to Brad.  Juan took a lot of his time and went over everything in the car with us. Jim the financial person went above and beyond to give us the best deal possible.  Thanks to all of you it was a pleasure working with you and we will surely tell all of our friends.  Have a very Happy and prosperous New Year.

56,"December 23, 2012","I have needed to buy a new car for a year or two and dreaded the whole process.  I had narrowed my decision down to 2 makes (KIA or Toyota) but kept hearing from every KIA new car owner how much they loved their cars.  A friend, Lenee Weldon, mentioned what a great experience they had at the Granbury KIA dealership and she had the sales guy i needed to  meet.  So, i followed her over last week and decided she was right and Juan was the guy i was buying a new car from.  So, after a test drive of the new KIA Sorento, i was sold and by Friday, had a new car.

He made us feel like we were important and not just another sale. He kept us informed on what they were doing and didn't just leave us sitting there wandering. We looked at a few different Sorentos and I feel like Juan helped us make the right choice. Then we talked to Brad who took care of the financing. He actually talked to one of the banks and talked them into a lower interest rate. He didn't settle for there first offer. Thanks Brad I appreciate it. Then after the deal was final we went back to Juan and he explained everything about our new car to us. He even got in the car and show me how to work everything. It wasn't any one thing they did. It was everything from start to finish. They are an amazing group of people. We have already told several people about our experience and will continue to do so.

I emailed different dealerships and none of them kept in touch with me like Van Griffith Kia. I was wanting a specific color and options and they were able to find the exact one for me within a few hours. Brad told me he would notify me as soon as it arrived into town. When it did he called me and I drove up there and met Juan Zamudio who showed my husband and me all the different things on our Sorento. He made sure we understood everything about our new vehicle before we walked out the door. Financing went quick and they never pushed us into anything we didn't want to do or buy.

66,"August 19, 2012","My wife recently purchased a new 2013 Kia Sorento from Van Griffith. We sent out 7 requests to different Kia Dealers with the exact description of the vehicle we purchased through Van Griffith.  Two responses requested a call to advise what vehicle we would be interested in.  Three dealers never responded with one of our local dealers not even returning our call on top of the request.  One said the vehicle was not available.  Brad Ferris not only responded, secured the vehicle, started the credit process and gave us a more than acceptable price all within a couple of days.  We were very impressed with the way the process started only to be overwhelmed by the customer service given to us by the staff.

We were greeted by Dawn Law as if she has known us all of our lives.  She explained Brad was out for the day and Jimmy Carden would assist us through the process.  Jimmy showed us the vehicle verifying it was exactly what we wanted, answered all of our questions and then introduced us to Jim Dollins the finance manager.

My wife and I dread finance managers with the hard up sales and the length it takes to complete the process.  Jim made us feel like we were dealing with our favorite family members, just a very pleasant experience and it was short and sweet. Brad stopped in during this process thanked us for our business on his day off.

Jimmy Carden then took ample time to explain all the features, buttons etc to us even paring my wife's cell phone. Customer service, friendliness, quality not only of the vehicle but of their staff can't be rated higher.  It was worth the 150 each way drive and knowing how this went we wouldn't hesitate for a second driving twice that distance.

With Van Griffith having filled the tank we were back on the road to Lake Texoma.

Thanks to all the staff for everything.                           Bill & Mary

I asked what they could come close to in the Plus.  Within a few minutes they drove one up in the color I wanted.  Yes, it didm't come with everything the Exclaim would have but it did have everything I wanted plus a few extras and the cost was less than the Exclaim.  

I already had my fiancing through my bank at what I thought was a very sweet APR.  They asked if they could beat it, would I fiance through them.  They were able to beat it by more than 1%.  Needless to say I took it and was happy that I let them check.

The salesman, Michael, was extremely knowledgable of the product. He never became ""pushy"" during his time with my wife. Dawn, the sales manager, was very professional and freindly during the close out portion of the sale. Dawn thouroughly expalined all of the sales contract, offered extended warranties and GAP insurance. My questions were answered with concise answers and I never felt that I was trying to be hustled or taken advantage of. The product is also a very good car. Due to this wonderful car buying experience, I can assure you that the next time I need to get another vehicle, I will begin, and most likely end the process at Van Griffith Kia. My heartfelt thanks to everyone involed who made my wife very happy. ",4.8
115,"November 20, 2011","We have dealt with Van Griffith before, when we purchased a new car three years ago, and have returned to buy another.  We love our KIA, and this dealership was the ""frosting on the cake"".  There was no pressure, just honesty and helpfulness.  When we are ready for another new car, we will return to Van Griffith, but meanwhile will use this dealership for any service needs we may have. Thank you Van Griffith, and Eddy! We will recommend you to all of our friends!!",5.0
116,"November 19, 2011","They don't try to nickel and dime you and throw in hidden fees and things later, which I was very surprised about. Everything I had read about car salesmen, they proved false. They put me at ease and the whole process only took about 3-4 hours. They didn't try to tell me things I already knew and didn't treat me like a bag of money. More surprisingly, they actually mailed me a check for a dealer incentive that was supposed to come out of the total price of the car upfront. Another dealership might have just pocketed that money and hoped I wouldn't notice, and to be honest had they not mailed me the check, I would not have known, which proves this is a dealership with integrity. I would absolutely recommend going to them if you're in the market for a KIA. ",5.0
117,"November 19, 2011","We had such a good experience with the online sales manager, Brad Ferris, right from the start.  He worked with us trying to see if he could find what we needed.  We set up a day to come into the dealership and he introduced us to Vernon Knapp.  Veron was very nice and right away we took to his personality.  We went on test drives with the Sorento and the Sedona.  We ended up with the Sedona 2012.  Veron took the time to explain the warranty, and went over the papers and features of the van.  Then he even showed us how to use the features in the van and where it all was located.  He answered questions and what we really were impressed with, was how he called us a couple of days later to see how the van was doing for us.  We love the Sedona so far and Vernon and Brad and the finance dept have helped us with our needs.  I would and have recommend this dealership to our friends and family.  Thank you, Kia!",5.0
