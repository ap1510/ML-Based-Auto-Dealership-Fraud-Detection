I was treated like a VIP.  I knew what I wanted and had contacted multiple dealerships who either never called me back or put me off. This is how buying a car should be!",5.0
1,"July 26, 2017","I was in the market to upgrade my 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee LTD.  I always do my homework on exactly what my trade is worth, what options I want, and how much I can pay.  Online responses from the first two dealers sucked.  The first was had a stupid nickname, pretty much ignored what I was looking for just to get me to the dealership, and won’t stop sending irritating follow-ups.  The second guy didn’t even know LTD means Limited package and was asking me if I needed a leather interior.  Isn’t always that third try?  I found exactly what I was looking for at Principle Alfa Romeo FIAT.

Robert Lopez was my guy there and he was wonderful.  He’s intuitive – anticipating a full tank of gas or moving my existing weather mats.  He’s calming compared to the sales guys on TV & in person yelling 29,995 and it could ALL be yours.   He listened and responded to what I wanted without sneaky car buying games.

I had a great car buying experience with Robert Lopez and highly recommend him to others.
