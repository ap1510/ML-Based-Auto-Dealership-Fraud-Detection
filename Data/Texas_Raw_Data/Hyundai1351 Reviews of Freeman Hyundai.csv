I was in and out in less than an hour. 

Very happy with the service!

107,"November 03, 2019","After doing the research and deciding on what vehicle I wanted I searched area dealers.  I asked for total ""drive off the lot"" prices because I HATE haggling and will not do it. I also cannot stand to be lied to.  I was exceedingly clear on both of these points prior to going to dealers.  I literally went to three dealerships after getting these ""Final Quotes"" only to find that ALL THREE had been dishonest and tried to badger me into paying higher prices for undisclosed dealer add ons, etc (in addition to things listed and discussed and agreed on).   One even sold the car I was headed to the dealership to buy (yes, I was working with a specific salesperson, we had a set appointment time and he knew I was enroute to meeting him/buying the car) - but he was more than willing to sell me a higher trimmed car when I got there. The irony is I would have paid the higher price for the add ons, but I will NOT work with someone I cannot trust.  I was disgusted and tired of looking and decided to just keep my old car.  However, by a fluke I ended up in Irving just down the street from Freeman so I thought I would  look.  On their website was listed the EXACT car - color, engine, trim - that I had been looking for (and had been willing to compromise on because I couldn't find the whole package anywhere else). I went by, the car was sitting on the lot, the price was the EXACT price quoted on their site.  I expressed my shock and happiness and was told - ""Yeah, we get that a lot. Especially from people who have been to other places.""  Thank you Freeman for being exactly what you presented yourself to be. A little over an hour from arriving at dealership I drove off in my new SUV - I was probably the easiest sale Freeman made in October.    ",5.0

121,"October 13, 2019","From my very first contact with the salesman things were better than dealing with other dealerships.  Here I was provided more information that help me understand what most other dealerships were doing but not telling me.  And in my case Freeman was discounting the car I wanted more than any other dealership.  The discount was right off the bat, with no haggling and no tricks.  In my case thousands more discount than any place I had contacted  up to that point. Later after finalizing numbers with all dealerships, Freeman was still best.
The staff was friendly and efficient.  They understood what kind of buyer I was and did not try to waste my time with unnecessary items.
The biggest problem this dealership has is contact and internet presence.  Their presence on TrueCar was  excellent and it is what first drew me to them.  But there search presence on Google, trying to get to valid website and phone number is horrendous.  My best recommendation is if you end up at the dealership, grab some cards including those from service so you have good contact #s.  I actually called a couple of different numbers from the web trying to reach service.  The operator made it sound like I was at the right place and I did end with a voice mail system that sounded right, but never heard back.  Then I flipped to the back of on of my manuals and found a card.  I dialed the number, the service manager answers and I get everything I need on the spot.

124,"October 09, 2019","We bought a new Hyundai Santa Fe 4 months ago.  When we signed all the paper work we were told out first service would be free.  I have not used a Dealership for service in over 15 years.  I said what the heck, since it is free I will try it.  I drove our Santa Fe into the Service Department and was greeted professional by a trainee.  Ken, the Service Representative, approached me, we discussed what service i required, I explained to him that the air pressure in one of the tires was extremely low. I then asked him how long the service would take and was told about one hour.  Ken showed me where the lounge was and I settled in to what I thought was going to take hours.  20 Minutes later Ken came in and told me that there was a nail in the side wall of the tire and it could not be repaired.  I explained that we had purchased tire insurance when we purchased the car.  He took care of the insurance and changed the tire.  While checking out Ken helped me get my Blue Link working.  All this was accomplished with professionalism, caring and an sense of urgency so as the customer does not have to spend all day waiting.  Thanks to Ken and his team I will return and use the service department in 3 months or 3750 miles.

Another comment that is beyond Bradley's or the other service technician's power: the delay in getting the service scheduled.  This was the first of my service valet requests that was not scheduled within 3-5 days.  My vehicle exceed the proscribed mileage by almost 1500 miles before the service could be done.

194,"June 06, 2019",This review is specific to Hyundai service.  Brought my Genesis in for oil change and tire rotation and was told it would take 1.5 hours.  Seemed like a long time for simple service but appreciated being provided proper time expectations.  A little over 2 hours later I am told the car is ready.  Never heard from a service advisor the entire time and I had to ask for checkpoint list to be printed and provided. Several services were recommended on sheet including coolant flush and alignment which are services that were performed around 5 months and 7000 miles ago.  At this point I was not thrilled with my experience but things got much when I walked out to my car and saw a rather large visible scratch on the driver side door.  I went back in to point this out and the advisor who I never saw or spoke with until this point pulled out the iPad to compare pictures from when I first brought car in. None of the pictures had a clear image of the door.  He tried to then buff it out to no avail and then claimed it wasn't that obvious.  He seemed to think all was well so I asked to speak with the manager.  Larry came out and also made the claim that it wasn't that obvious but did offer to take car back to attempt to use electric buffer.  10 or so mins later the car was back with the scratch still in place and very visible. Larry didn't really seem to care and I got the sense from him that he thought I was lying.  He did make a weak offer of painting the door but at that point I did not want to have any further dealings with Freeman.  My car is older and has more than its share of dings but I am 100 percent certain this is new because it is on the middle of the driver side door that I see every time I walk up to car.

Closing the deal with the business office was something else. 

Dealer is responsible for vehicle inventory tax at end of year. Customer should not have had to pay this. Freeman rolls it in (this is common practice id they can get away with it). Further the state collects 0.02% on UNSOLD inventory at end of year, but Freeman marked it up to 12x that. Clearly this vehicle wasnt in inventory the while year. 

The Documentation Fee of $150 is supposed to cover supplies & computers. At that rate they can buy a good computer for every 8 cars sold. Yet another rip off.

From the moment I arrived, until I finally left many hours later (turns out I had a transmission temp gauge sensor issue) I was greeted and treated with smiles, and hospitality.

Anna Gallegos was the main person who helped me.  She checked me in and helped me figure out my Extended warranty.  She listed the recall items that needed to be checked out in addition to what I came in for.  One of those things Included an oil change, so I saved a little money there.  Many other mechanic places would have just gone ahead and taken my money for the oil change anyway.  She gave me a list of items that needed addressing and walked me through them in the order of the most importance so that she could work with me within my budget.  I cannot tell you how important and refreshing it is when someone understands and is willing to work with a customer who can't just throw down a credit card and take care of everything all at once!  Anna, Thank you so much for your time and your care!

In addition to all of that, their waiting room looked pretty comfy.  It was quite large and had comfortable seating instead of just a few hard chars along a wall, which I have seen at other dealerships.  I say it looked comfy because I didn't wait in that room at all.  I actually waited in their business center.  Y'all, they have three little cubicles with electrical outlets set up in their service center!  I cannot tell you how incredible this is!  I was able to work remotely the whole time I was waiting for my car to be serviced.  I did't have to spend a bunch of money on a Lyft/Uber rides back and forth (I live just outside the dealerships range of complimentary rides home), and I didn't have to take nearly a whole day off of work to get this service done.  I was able to comfortably work from right there within the service center.

I usually prefer to take my business to a local mechanic in my neighborhood, but since my favorite auto shoppe changed hands from a private owner to corporate, I haven't been super happy with any of the shops in my neighborhood.  After this experience at Freeman, I will 100% bring my car back to the Freeman service center for all of my maintenance.",5.0

Nope, it was rodent damage ( I live on a farm). The service consultant, Anna Gallegos, is a seasoned professional and carefully listened to everything I had to say about my concerns. I was impressed she did not try to push up-sales on the drive before knowing a diagnosis. The technician made a very quick and accurate diagnosis, 'wiring chewed by rodent'. The car still has never had a mechanical failure. Anna emailed pictures of the damage, gave me a reasonable estimate, and suggested some maintenance items coming due. Perfect customer service. I was able to pick my car up the next morning. I give the highest rating and recommendation because from calling for appointment to pick up I was impressed with the service, Thanks!",5.0

Our sales rep (Edida) was great! We narrowed it down to 3 cars we liked and she let us test drive each of them on our own. We narrowed it down to 2 cars and she had us thoroughly inspect them (without her influence) before committing to either. We decided on one that needed a few things done to it (a new front bumper being one of these things) and she wrote them into our contract without any problems or additional costs. This was an ""as-is"" car (2011 Sonata Limited Edition) but she still made sure these things were addressed and still didn't pressure us. When we went back to pick the car up she even put a bow on it for us! It had been washed, vacuumed and had a full tank of gas. This experience was even better than mine when I bought my brand new car! 

We also worked with Jesse in the financing department and he was wonderful to work with also. He worked hard to get us a good payment plan even though we don't have great credit.

We were contacted by the dealer manger so we told him about it.  He quickly  apologized and offered to send us a refund.  We were surprised to see just how quick we got it... (within just a few days). We were completely happy with this and appreciate how quickly he made good on this.  His actions outweighed the bad experience we had at the close.

In my opinion going forward with your Genesis sales, this level of customer that you are going after, competing with BMW, Mercedes Benz, Lexus, Infiniti and Acura,  is probably not going to want to come to a Hyundai dealership for service and sales.
They will be looking for an exclusive Genesis dealership.
Of course as you know with Lexus (Toyota), Acura (Honda)  Infiniti (Nissan) they are their own dealerships because of their high-end pricing and I feel that if Genesis wants to compete with he high-end automobiles, they will need to make a break to their own separate dealerships, as some have already done.",4.4

Let me test drive vehicles, and went all the way to Houston to pick up the car in the color I was looking for.

I am glad that I did, because the exact same vehicle was nearly three thousand dollars lower at Freeman Hyundai. 
 
After talking with Freeman Hyundai Internet Manager Darren Bridges about the various models and different options available on the Santa Fe Sport, I was impressed with his ability to answer all my questions and concerns.  Darren was extremely helpful and was very knowledgeable about the Santa Fe Sport.  I have purchased many vehicles over the years, but I would rate this purchase has one of the best.  Darren is not your average salesman asking you the same old questions that most do; he was straightforward, knowledgeable and friendly.    

After the purchase, Darren took the time needed to go over the numerous operating functions of the vehicle. Thanks to Darren, our purchase and delivery of the vehicle at Freeman Hyundai meet all of our expectations. The next time we are in the market for a new vehicle, we will definitely contact Darren Bridges at Freeman Hyundai first.

It wasn't until I got into the finance office that I found out the salesman changed it to a 4 year lease and never told me.   3. When I picked-up my plates, I was told my vehicle would be detailed since it was not done at the time of purchase. They cleaned the outside, vacuumed the inside, but never wiped down the inside. It was still dusty.   4. When discussing the lease, I was told the dealership would pay for my remaining payments and over-mileage. Instead, I found out that amount was being rolled into the cost of my new vehicle rather than the dealership paying for the amount out of their pocket as discussed.   5. When discussing the lease, my wife and I were told several times in person and on the phone that the dealership was going to purchase my leased vehicle.

895,"January 05, 2017","I brought my 2012 Hyundai Sonata purchased at Freeman Hyundai dealership and took it to the service department for repairs to serious defects when vehicle was exhibiting abnormal conditions in both steering and motor seizing. The defect is covered under manufacturers warranty and the defect/condition was reported within the warranty term. The vehicle was defective and unfit for use on public roadways.  I requested a loaner vehicle and detailed estimate/repairs completed paperwork as well as the check in sheet for my vehicle.

I have never received ANY voice messages (or other correspondence) from Aaron my service assistant. I did however receive a certified letter threatening to sell my 2012 Hyundai Sonata VIN KMHEC4A43CA020727 at public auction. I have sent repeated emails to the service department requesting a detailed estimate/repairs completed paperwork & update and have not received the requested paperwork.

I have never encountered such disregard for a customer consumer of a large purchase such as the new vehicle which I purchased from Freeman Hyundai  in 2012.  I greatly regret having done business with Freeman Hyundai.

Hyundai was forced to recall almost a half a million Sonata's for defective motors. They routinely denied warranty for a KNOWN defect to their theta gas engines and instead blamed the consumer across the board for lack of maintenance. Hyundai tells Sonata owners they must produce a complete set of maintenance records even though they know the Sonata engines fail regardless of owner maintenance due to the faulty rotating assembly. My experience is no different so I am left with the only recourse available to me.

The car is under warranty, this is a known issue. The service department is trying to get out of the repairs because the oil changes were not done by them. The oil has been changed every 5000 - 7000 miles since I purchased in new in 2012 from Freeman Hyundai.

I purchased this vehicle from the Freeman Auto Group and I was considering buying my next vehicle from Freeman Hyundai but this has given me pause. A car purchase is one of the biggest investments a person will make. I expect my dealership to honor the warranty and make any needed repairs with factory replacement parts.  I am reminding Hyundai of the promises made when selling me this vehicle and Freeman Hyundai’s obligation to stand behind their product. This is a Freeman Hyundai service department and I am taking this issue with the service department up the corporate ladder as needed.

979,"September 24, 2016","I am really disappointed with this dealer, specially with the financing closing. The seller was great and very patient. No problem with him at all. But, after agreeing with the selling price and moving to the financing office, we were totally misled by the financing person. Because we don't have a long record in US, we were approved to finance just with a huge APR, 5.74%, and that a lot of services were included in the APR, by the financing institution, since we weren't approved by Hyundai's bank. So, the person just gave us the final amount of payments. Believing that it was true and that it would be the only way to finance the car, and almost 4 hours inside the dealer, I signed the papers without reading, what I totally regret myself for being so stupid for doing that. The sale was done on Saturday (09/10/16) and doing the math at home, I decided to go back to the papers and read them, which shocked me!!! It was included in the car’s cost U$ 4,433.00 of unsolicited/unexplained services, other than changing the agreed car’s price (She told us by phone that we lost the Hyundai's rebate for not been approved to finance with Hyundai's bank). I sent a lot of emails arguing that, and just after some calls, the person said that they could not cancel it right away and that we would have to wait all the paper been processed and that the dealer would give us a credit that we could use to anticipate the financing. Despite all the emails, we never got a written response from them with their commitment to give us the credit. We still waiting and anxious to know if everything will be fixed or not and that we will only pay what was agreed!!!",2.8

I purchased my first Hyundai Elantra from your dealership approximately two years and 4 months ago and not that the experience wasn’t great but it surely paled in comparison with the excitement of my new Hyundai Sonata Ltd.
And although the car is of a higher grade it’s not that alone that has made your dealership endearing to me but rather the Salesperson that assisted me.
From the very beginning he was welcoming, hospitable, cordial and knowledgeable. And his attentiveness to his customers is definitely worth mentioning as he makes them feel like they are his number one priority! He follows up by both email and phone messages and definitely stands out from the rest in my opinion. What customer wouldn’t be delighted with that type of commitment towards their satisfaction! 
I would recommend your establishment to anyone who asks where I purchased my car as I see people admiring it as I travel on the highways. He went out of his way to try to meet every desire I had and successfully found the  car of my dreams.

1069,"July 13, 2016","This is the first online review I have ever posted, and hopefully it will be my last.

I have just recently leased a new 2016 Genesis sedan from this dealership just about 2-3 months ago.  This is my second Genesis with this dealership and my third Genesis overall.  I decided to get the new one to replace the previous one I owned since the the previous one, a 2012 Genesis sedan, had a problem with the fuel tank which the service department could not correct after multiple attempts and even replacing the fuel tank altogether, which created another problem they also could not correct after multiple attempts.  Upon expressing my frustration, they agreed to take my 2012 as a trade-in and give me a substantial discount on a new one, never mind that I wasn't really in the market for a new car, I just wanted the problem with the one I had previously to be remedied, which apparently just wasn't going to happen.

The deal for the new car is structured as a single pay lease.  The 3 year lease was paid in full up front so there would be no monthly payments to make, and I have the contracts and receipts to verify all of this.  Ever since bringing the car home I have been harassed by Hyundai Motor Finance for monthly payments I don't owe, to the point where I have received delinquency notices and statements of intent to repossess the vehicle due to non-payment.  I have returned to the dealership on multiple occasions asking for their help in resolving the issues, and so far, after two months, they have failed to do so.  I have spoken with the owner on the phone (he wouldn't meet with me at his office at the dealership) and asked for some sort of concession of his choice (free car washes or oil changes, perhaps?) to try to right the multiple wrongs experienced by a repeat customer loyal to the brand, and he has offered nothing more than an apology.  His explanation is that this is not the dealership's fault, it is a problem with the Hyundai finance arm.  While he is technically correct, it doesn't begin to address the issues with the service department and the inordinate amount of time and aggravation I have spent on all of this

As of today, the lease issue remains unresolved 2 months after bringing it to their attention.  During my conversation with the owner I informed him that this has all been a deeply dissatisfying experience and I no longer felt any sense of good will or loyalty to Freeman as a business, especially due to his apparent lack of concern or desire to make any gesture to maybe make things a little better.  As a former small business owner myself, this failure to attempt a corrective gesture strikes me as unconscionable.

As a result of all of this, and it is still ongoing, I will not be doing business with this dealership in the future, nor can I recommend them to anyone I know, and I have informed the owner of this.  He doesn't seem to mind losing me as a customer.  Keeping in mind that while every employee there with whom I have interacted has been unfailingly polite, cordial, courteous, and quite nice, the problems that have occurred just have not been resolved and there seems to be no accountability anywhere in their staff, even from the person (the owner, Mr. Freeman) that signs everyone's paychecks.

My advice?  If you're in the market for a Hyundai product, and I believe they offer a line of good cars and good value for the prices, find a dealer who will be there for you if a problem arises after the sale is made.  Freeman has not proven themselves to be one of them.  At least, not for me",2.4

1194,"February 01, 2016","The title of my review sums up my experience at Freeman Hyundai in Irving.

""W"" = Wonderful People - Mary Litte is the reason I chose to purchase a vehicle @ Freeman Hyundai in Irving for the second time since I have been a resident in the state of Texas. I shared with her what I was looking for in a vehicle, which included price range, mileage and type of vehicle. Although it was challenging, she found a few options that would fit what I was looking for.Upon my arrival to the dealership to check out the options, Mary had carfax pulled on each vehicle available for me to review before we set out on our journey to find me a vehicle. I say our journey because she was not just a sales person seeking just a sale, she payed attention to me as I shared what I was looking for and praying to find. She wanted me to be sure and comfortable with my purchase. With her assistance and level of expertise, I settled on a vehicle that was/is best suited for me. There was no pressure involved. I am thankful for Mary and her servant's heart. There was some work that needed to be done before I could drive it home. I was placed in a loaner for a few days. Mary handed me the keys and shared some encouraging words that did my heart well! When I entered the vehicle as my new-to-me vehicle, I was greeted with a care package of encouraging words and mints....wow! I would be remiss if I did not mention the sincere welcoming and friendliness of the staff, at least those whose path I crossed....key word in this statement is sincere! Sincerity is very important to the consumer and I find that is alive and well at Freeman Hyundai in Irving. 

""O"" = Outstanding Sevice - A day after I drove my ""new-to-me"" vehicle off of the lot, I encountered my an issue with the gas cover not opening. I contacted Mary and she immediately responded advising me to bring it in and ask for Matt or Larry in used cars. I did just that. Larry was availableand able to see the issue. He showed me how to get the cover to open manually and advised that maintenance would be able to take a look at it and get it fixed; I would just need to contact Mary to set up a day/time to get it fixed. Mary followed up with me and we agreed on a day/time. I arrived on Friday a little after 3pm and Mary immediately took it back to Maintenace to take a look at it and repair. Not only was the repair completed timely, Mary put gas in my tank to compensate for the inconvenience.....wow!

""W"" = Well Done - Customer Sevice done well...Freeman Hyundia in Irving!

1197,"January 25, 2016","I went to this dealer on 1-01-2016 and walked on their lot without talking to a salesman since they were closed. I was looking for a used Santa Fe and was not sure if they had one until I saw what would be my vehicle of choice for the next day once they were open. I had been to numerous locations to look at a few vehicles and could not find a vehicle that would suit all my needs, that is until I came here and found the black 2015 Santa Fe Limited Ultimate. I went there the very next morning and met with the used car manager Larry and explained my needs and wants and the fact that I did not want to haggle or negotiate. In a matter of minutes I was working with a salesman named Kirk Stanley. Mr Stanley showed us the car and gave us the key and told us to take it and drive it a while so we could make sure we wanted it. It did not tale long before I knew I wanted this car and returned back to the dealership. The whole process lasted 2 hours and we were done. The only issue was we did not get a 2nd key but he assured me he would order 1 for me.  By my choice I waited 3 weeks and returned to get my key and when I left I was surprised the car had been washed, vacuumed and the gas tank was topped off. He explained to me this is for you having to drive back for the key. In the future if I ever need a vehicle I will recommend Freeman Hyundai and Kirk Stanley, Thanks Guys!!",5.0

1217,"December 14, 2015","The Internet Sales Manager (David Foster) contacted us 6 weeks after we drove the vehicle off the lot and told us that they would not be paying the over mileage fee on the 2013 Sonata that we did a lease turn-in on. He stated that they paid the Disposition fee, but that they lost too much money on the deal, so they couldn't pay off the mileage too. He informed us that he spoke with him GM and blamed the situation on him ""not knowing of the mileage cost"", even though my son, who turned the Sonata in for me, signed the Odometer Statement and Turn-in form when he handed them the keys, so it was clear at that point that they did in fact know mileage.  It was their responsibility at that point to adderss the cost of the mileage fee before the sales contract was executed to address if they were not willing to pay for it, even though, once again, that they committed to doing so. 
They did not give us any opportunity to choose between paying the mileage fee or not buying the car, so this is outright extortion. We have contacted the Internet Sales Manager and he basically stated ""too bad"" even though the Internet Sales Manager has admitted that he did in fact assure us they would waive the disposition fee and the over mileage fee before committing to purchase the car.  I am not sure if this is the kind of representatives that Hyundai wants representing them, but this was not the case with the dealer we purchased the 2013 Sonata from in California.  
Unfortunately, we are now forced to resort to legal action with our attorney because Mr. Foster and your GM have told us ""too bad"".  It is sad to see these kinds of business practices going on from such a large, and mostly respectable dealership.  I cannot imagine that Freeman has been in business for 55 years by doing things this way.  I assume this is a result of someone making a promise they ended up not being able to honor and is now lying to try to save his own behind.  We have clearly communicated in email form with Mr. Foster and stated that it was not our intent to take legal matters, but due to their unwillingness to tell the truth and honor their commitments, we are forced to do so as we have no one else to contact about this matter. I have already been in contact with my attorney, but if someone at Freeman Auto Group is willing to try to resolve this issue without going to legal measures, I am willing to discuss it. Again, Mr. Foster absolutely knows what he committed to as it was fully disclosed that this was the only way we could purchase the new vehicle and he reassured us that he would honor this.

1232,"November 11, 2015","I was sent to Freeman by Jerry Reynolds, Car Pro.  I dealt with Brad by Phone while on Vacation driving a rented 2015 Sonata.  I had seen and driven an Elantra before at other Dealerships and decided that is what I thought I wanted.  Jerry Reynolds told me to call Brad.  I did and told him I wanted an Elantra Sport, White w/Black Cloth, NO Options as Hyundai charges too much for them as Factory Items.  I can buy them later from the Parts Dept cheaper.  The ONLY option on my car was Floor Mats which I took as the $40 difference from what I could buy them for was not enough to bug Brad over since he was having to go 200 miles to find the car.  After he found the car on Friday and said they could not trade until Monday I waited.  On Monday I told him I wanted the car to which he called later and said that the Conroe Dealer was working a Deal and it was NOT available.  On Tuesday he called back and said he could get it after all, which I took as God's way of telling me I should buy this.  I told him I would call Wednesday morning; I did and he put Sandee on it and got the car based on me telling him I would take it.  I found that absolutely refreshing that he took my word for it with none of this ""deposit nonsense"" which I find very insulting.  If I tell you I will do something and you do all you promise and deliver as promised, I will keep my end of the deal.  He did, and I did.  Very Easy, Very Enjoyable, and the way 2 persons that trust each other should work together.  As I said, Brad then turned it over to Sandee once we made the deal to finish up and deliver the Car.  She did everything I asked including having a 'clean' 2016 Elantra Sales Brochure at her desk when I arrived.  Your F&I was respectful of my time while still informing me of what items you could offer to make my Car more enjoyable and worry-free.  I bought NOTHING, even though a few items did sound interesting, and received 110% respect for my decisions with courtesy and professionalism!!!  I gave you 5 Stars on everything except Price, which I consider was a fair deal (or I would not have bought) but being me, I would like to have had for a bit less.

1306,"February 11, 2015","I want to report a very positive experience with the Internet Sales Manager David Foster at Freeman Hyundai,  and a very bad experience with another dealer on the very same car.  I was car shopping by using TrueCar estimates from Consumer Reports which is supposed to guaranty a price and an in stock car before you visit the dealer.  My first disaster was at Alan Samuals Hyundai in Fort Worth. I called ahead and these guys said the had the car in stock at the TrueCar price.  As soon as I arrived at the dealer, I showed the salesperson the Truecar certificate and made sure they understood that I wanted that car at that price.  Sure....No problem...They said  After wasting an hour or so of test driving, when we sat down to close the deal, I found out the car that I had been testing was about $2000 more than quoted because of DEALER ADD-ON'S of stuff I neither wanted nor needed. I said... just sell me a car without the add-ons and was told ALL the cars had this stuff installed. I left mad, with a bad taste in my mouth.
  Now here's what happened at Freeman.  I called ahead and David had the car I was looking for parked right by the office and ready for inspection.  The price was almost exactly what was stated in the TrueCar estimate with no useless dealer add on stuff. Now here's the best part, while closing the deal I found out that I was eligible for a 500 dollar discount for owner loyalty (I already owned another Hyundai) and also eligible fore another 500 dollar discount because I'm a veteran. That was another 1000 dollars off with no real negotiation that I wasn't even aware of!

        I consider David Foster a good guy to deal with and he will be up front with you.

1308,"September 01, 2014","I called Freeman Hyundai in Irving, Texas the morning of August 23rd to tell them I would be there before noon.  I arrived around 11:30.  They had told me they would be ready for me but were not.  I drove into the parking lot and circled the lot twice because there is no clearly marked entrance.  I finally parked at the back... got out... walked to the car in question... looked inside and at other cars but there was no salesman to be found so I walked into the building.  I then walked into the back of the building.  Once inside, it took awhile to be acknowledged and I was finally approached by Maxanna who offered to have Jim paged because that is who I had been talking with about the car in question.   Jim came over and introduced himself and advised me to deal with Maxanna because he was busy with other customers.  She offers a test drive and proceeded to verify driver and went to copy license and get plates made. 
 When she came back with the keys, the sales manager followed her over to introduce himself.  She then asked if I had a trade-in to get appraised while test driving but I declined, stating that I didn't know if I was going to have a trade-in.  She replied, “Well I thought we could save some time by doing both at once,” adding, ""I've got all day.""  Because of her tone, I felt pressured to agree so I replied, “I've got all year.  I don't have to buy today.""  The sales manager then asked if I was planning on buying today and I said that I wanted to test drive it first and that I had a question on the mileage being that it had 4,500 miles and the discount did not seem to be an accurate reflection of the high mileage.  Maxanna stated that at the price they were offering, she had 3 people waiting to but it.  However, the sales manager chimed in and said that Maxanna was previously unaware of the price deduction, which I found odd because she had just mentioned that she had 3 other people waiting to buy.  So I asked why it hadn't already been sold if there were 3 other buyers, to which Maxanna replied, ""I just found out about the price reduction.""  Suddenly, the sales manager began to dismiss me by stating ""thanks for coming out.”   I stood there stunned for a moment, trying to figure out what had just happened.  Then I told them both that I had a TrueCar quote for a new car without the mileage and the sales manager replied, ""No one will sell it to you at that price unless it is in stock"" and the car I was trying to drive was right in front of the building.  The sales manager then added that he wasn’t trying to strong arm me but he wasn’t going to argue.  He also added that I knew the price when I got up there.  I then questioned, “So you're not even going to deal with me?” to which he replied, “No,” and he turned around and walked away.  Then Maxanna had the audacity to ask if I still wanted to test drive to which I replied, “I think we are leaving.”  On my way out, they both sarcastically said, “Nice to meet you.”  
Patrons, do yourself a favor and stay away from this dealership.  It is not obvious that they are used to applying old-school passive aggressive tactics that just do not sit right with me.  No one should be treated this way.  Their lack of professionalism revealed their major shortcomings when it comes to customer service.

1311,"July 23, 2013","I went to Freeman Hyundai due to it being close to my home. I had previously owned a Hyundai and was extremely happy with it, (not purchased at Freeman),
I went in to test drive the NEW Hyundai Veloster (2013). Due to my credit not being strong, I knew already ahead of time what my budget was, ( I had already been approved through Santander Credit). My decision was between 2 Velosters- 1 which had 3300 miles on it with a RED STICKER SALES TAG on the rearview mirror for 18,500 or one with 0 miles for 23,900 and change. Well to me, logic was go with less expensive one, 3000 plus miles is nothing I thought, plus the sales rep Terry Gibson PROMISED to make it like NEW, meaning full detail, couple of scratches removed, rims on car buffed. (To date, only thing the  car has had done, one oil change and wash)- rims and front bumper still have scratches. Believing on FAITH, I went into Finance office to sign paperwork with Brad Parker, not thinking anything, but how excited I was that I was getting a great deal on the car,plus what I wanted! Well,I signed everything and left to work, car was to be detailed at later date due to increment weather,and I had to go to work. I signed all paperwork with the X marked as told, not thinking that price WOULD be ALTERED or CHANGED, again in GOOD FAITH. After receiving my paperwork a few weeks later, 6 to be exact,(after calling various times to request it, I received most in the mail, after reviewing it closely, I noticed that SALES price was incorrect, Immediately I called the dealership and kept getting transferred from one person to other. To my dismay, I was told that as an ADULT, I should have read the binding contract, and that there  was nothing that could be done. I advised that I would like to speak to GM or higher, so that they may hear my concern, I will await the call in the morning. I will post afterward. 
I am really disappointed with this,as I thought that the CAR SALES Business Reputation had changed, and thought, that there were HONEST,HARDWORKING, TRUE TO WORD people in the business. GUESS NOT?!?!?!",1.0
1312,"July 19, 2013","We were looking to purchase a new Elantra Coupe. Freeman Hyundai had a couple of the only ones in the area so we decided to pay them a visit. From the moment we walked in everything was handled professionally. We were originally paired with a salesman by the name of Morgan Felton, but apparently he got the pink slip during our week long purchase process. We drove the automatic coupe in stock but we were really looking for a manual so Freeman said that they would send someone to pick one up from Louisiana. Getting to the price was the easiest negotiation a car dealership has ever seen. We told Morgan the price was a little bit high, so he went to talk to his manager, Trent. After a brief break, Trent comes out of the back and tells us the price, which was extremely good, and that he can't go any lower. But we didn't need to as it was a very attractive offer and we couldn't have gotten anywhere close at another dealership. And to top it off we didn't have to sign anything or put down a payment until we saw the car in person when it was delivered later in the week. Overall a very professional dealership that will not waste your time or try to squeeze the most money out of them. I would highly recommend  this dealership based on the four or five people that we dealt with through the whole process and how everything was handled. Even though this dealership is not my closest Hyundai dealership I would purchase another vehicle with them because of this experience. A+",5.0

1316,"March 18, 2013","I can't speak about the sales department but if you have business with the parts or service department I would advise you to take your business elsewhere. Both departments are utterly incompetent. 

I called the service department to make an appointment in response to a recall notice. I was called back a week later when the part came in as they didn't have it on hand. So I took time off to have the repairs made only to be told after 45 minutes in the waiting area that they were ""sorry"" they didn't have the right part and that I would have to make another appointment and come back at another time. After a waste of my time and gas, problem solved. Seems I'm a glutton for punishment though. The sun visor on my car broke so I went to the parts department for a replacement. They got the vin number off my car and looked up the part on their computer but still managed to sell me the wrong part and to add insult to injury, refused to return or exchange the new unused part accompanied by the original receipt a few days later. Reason given, ""You don't have the plastic bag that it came in"" (a bag exactly like a newspaper comes in). So now I'm stuck with a 100 dollar sun visor I can't use because it doesn't fit my car due to their incompetence and unwillingness to correct their mistake.

Needless to say, I will never be doing business with them again.",1.0
1317,"December 31, 2012",I just bought our families 5th Hyundai from Freeman.  No other dealership can compare in customer care and friendliness.  Mike Sandefur (the sales manager) is just great.  We have worked with him on all 5 of our car purchases.  Maxanna Borden was our sales associate on this most recent purchase and she was very knowledgeable about the vehicle and very friendly.  Brian in Finance was so helpful and did not pressure us to buy extras but explained all the options for extended warranties etc.  I have bought MANY cars through the years and BY FAR Freeman Hyundai is THE ABSOLUTE BEST dealership I have ever worked with.  ,5.0

It was an EASY car buying experience...and how often do you hear that?!  There's also been follow up from Roland, that I appreciate as a new car buyer, to ensure that everything is going well.  Would I go back and buy another car from Freeman Hyundai?  In a heartbeat.

Drove all the way to Freeman and their offer was 8k. What a colossal waste of time. I bought a car from them about 5 years ago from Danny Ward and got a fair deal with good service. This dealership is definitely on the way down. Mr Foster was useless to deal with. Don't waste your time with this dealership. I will never go back.

Deal was made over the internet and the phone. Darren picked us up at Dallas Love Field and drove us back to Freeman Hyundai. Overall, a very good experience as no upselling or bait/switch occurred at any point. Freeman is also rated A+ by the Better Business Bureau which is a definite positive in the auto sales business. If you call Darren Bridges he is free to use my name as a reference.",5.0

Darren was very knowledgeable about the Hyundai Tucson Limited. No pressure, just good communication and answered all my questions. Easy transaction, test drove the car I wanted. Negotiated the discounted price showing him my internet homework prices. He got with his manager and we had a deal. Drove my new Black Limited home an hour later.
I choose Darren from his customer comments on the internet. I showed up at 9 AM at the dealership and asked for him. He was as good as all the comments I read.

He showed the car, took us for a test drive and never once pressured or asked me if I was ready to make a deal.  Two weeks of shopping later, my wife and I decided on a used vehicle at Freeman that we found online.  I called Darren and set up an appointment.  After test driving, we sat down and worked a deal out in under 30 minutes.  It was the smoothest purchase I have yet to make.  I've read some of the bad reviews regarding Freeman and luckily ours was the complete opposite.  I would definitely recommend Darren Bridges to anyone looking for a new or used car.

My husband had looked up reviews on dealerships in our area and ran across Freeman and Darren Bridges.  Both with very good reviews.  I went on my way to the dealership by myself and picked out the exact car I wanted.  I have to say I was very nervous going in there by myself considering I'm a female and know NOTHING about cars.  Darren made me feel at ease right away.  He listened to what I wanted and my comments and didnt try to upsale me.  I greatly appreciate his honesty.  It was very refreshing.  Of course I was stressed when the number were being worked out etc, but who isnt.  Part of the game.  Once I got back to finance Brian was very helpful too.  He took his time with me.  Inputting different numbers trying to help us get what we were wanting.  I have to say that both of these gentlemen gave their all and then some in making sure I was happy and satisfied.  Darren even went as far as scraping off my tolltag and a couple of other stickers I needed and putting them on my new car.
