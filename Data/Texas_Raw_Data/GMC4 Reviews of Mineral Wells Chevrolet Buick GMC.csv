0,"October 24, 2018","I traveled to Mineral wells buick gmc chevy in hopes of buying a dodge tradesman. The sales guy was young but nice. We took a dodge truck out while mine was being appraised and it was ok, nothing special and stock. I was considering the vehicle and waited around for about an additional 30-40 mins while my truck was supposed to be getting appraised. I couldn’t wait any longer after an hour and a half plus of handing my keys over. I requested the sales guy call me with the appraisal and he agreed. This never happened. I called three days later and told the receptionist or whomever that i was never contacted, she said ok we’ll get back with you. Never happened. The sales guy texted me a week or two later and asked if i was still interested, i said sure what’s my appraisal. He didn’t know. He never called back. 3 MONTHS LATER, i get some piece of mail saying they want my truck for 11k (i paid 32k two years ago). I understand dealerships lowball but that offer is just hwy robbery, unserious and pathetic. I’ve gotten 2 appraisals since i was there for between 17-18.5k and all were done within 30 mins of requesting. This place is unorganized, slow, I’ll prepared, rookie sales, ghost management and piss poor quotes. Don’t go it’s a complete and utter waste of time and money. ",1.6
1,"April 12, 2017","DO NOT BUY A CAR/TRUCK HERE! I made the mistake of choosing this place to buy my first new truck and was highly disappointed with their customer service. From my dealings with Mike Durant, salesman Diego, finance guy Kevin, and even Amber Khan with my license plates I was repeatedly lied to. From top to bottom this place employs habitual liars. I drove 110 miles only to find out the truck was not the actual listed price on the internet, still agreed to purchase with little help from Diego my actual salesman. Once in financing Kevin got me to agree on a monthly payment then right as I go to sign my signature the price goes up not once but twice!! I should have walked out then but after 4 hours I wasn't coming home empty handed. They sent me home with no papers showing my finicall agreement so after 2 weeks of me calling 5 different times they sent me a scratched out piece of paper with numbers on it. Then after waiting 2 months I called to see if my plates were in since my paper plates were to expire in days, they said they had been sitting there with no thought on their end to call and notify me. I asked her to send them to my house then after 1 week they still had not shown up so I called again and she stated they were mailed the previous week. I finally get my plates after multiple calls only to find out they overnighted them after I called upset yesterday . So now I can honestly say this will be the LAST TIME I ever do business with or even recommend this place to anyone . Consider yourself warned!!!!",1.0
2,"January 16, 2017",Paid cash for a Nissan SUV  which started leaking transmission fluid within a week. One month later the transmission went completely out! My mechanic told me that Nissan had a problem with that year & model & the price for a new transmission was $4200.00 When we called the dealership to ask if they could help in anyway. We were just told Nothing they could do!!! I would NEVER recommend them ever to anyone!!!,1.0
3,"August 31, 2016","I was visiting TX to  meet family members. As me and my family was looking to buy a Chevy Truck from CT. We decided to check the prices in TX, so finally stopped at Mineral Wells Chevy. Not only we were given a complete knowledge of the truck but they gave us more money for our trade. Keeping in view their professional approach without any pressure, we bought our truck from them with excellent interest rates. 
Great Job Guys !! Keep up the good work. Thanks to the owner Mr Khan, who is just a very humble man. I would highly recommend this dealership to everyone for their next purchase.
God Bless",5.0
