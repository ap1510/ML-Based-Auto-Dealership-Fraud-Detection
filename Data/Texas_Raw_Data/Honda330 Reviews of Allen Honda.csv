2,"February 11, 2020","We went to have our car serviced and were looking at cars while passing the time when Bob McGill came over to say hello.  We had worked with him before, but were not ready to buy yet.  When we asked about any used vehicles, he said one had just been taken in and was being checked out.  It happened to come out of service before we left and we drove it and liked it.  Rusty helped negotiate the price then Shirley Macik handled the financial paper work.  I have worked with three other Financial Directors at local car dealers and Shirley was by far the most professional and friendly of any that I have met.  It made the buying experience much more enjoyable and I look forward to working with all three again in the future.",5.0

They even service my Toyota Tundra since the Toyota dealership lost my trust.

4,"January 25, 2020","I wasn't sure what to expect as I had never bought a new car before. Juan McCullough was super friendly, down to earth, knowledgeable, helpful, and patient with me. He went over my options with me and never got frustrated with all the questions I had or when I kept asking him to repeat certain things. I feel like a I got a great deal on my new car and I couldn't be happier with every staff member I had the pleasure of meeting. I want to give a shout out to Shirley Macik for making all the paperwork I had to sign understandable and for taking an interest when I mentioned my brother's medical issues. Such a sweet lady!",5.0
5,"January 10, 2020","Valerie found the 2020 CR-V with the exact features I wanted. I purposely requested a 2020 over a 2019 model because the 2020 Driver's Information Screen was bigger which meant the Back-up camera screen would be larger. I also preferred the 2020 body design. One of my favorite features is the front seat power adjustment which not only moves the seat forward/backward, but also raises it so I can finally escape the glare of the afternoon sun! Yeah! 

Shirley explained all aspects of finance so there were no unanticipated surprises. We got a great deal and she made the process very easy.",5.0

7,"November 19, 2019","We have worked with Bob for at least 12 years. He is a stellar salesman.....and more!. He always is willing to help. Even if it is a service issue, Bob is often my first contact. He is always willing to help.",4.8
8,"October 18, 2019",I cannot even begin to give enough compliments to this dealership! Shirley made my buying experience amazing. She helped to make the financial part of the buying process a walk in the park! Her dedication to helping meet the needs of her customers was apparent the moment I walked into her office. Thank you for everything!!!,5.0
9,"October 16, 2019","The salesman did not know much about the vehicle. He stated we could negotiate some, but turns out that was only a couple hundred dollars. The usual ""let me go talk to my manager"" deal. Kind of sad, this place felt like a Ford dealership, other Honda dealerships we have bought from were much better. No one explained about perks included with purchase like Sirius, Kahu and how the limited warranty works. The vehicle was not well detailed, very dirty under the seats.  The dealership also uses an automated email system with a fake employee named ""Faith"" that asks if you are having problems, If you reply you get a generic ""thank you for your response..."" Very doubtful we would ever buy another vehicle from them.",2.5
10,"October 01, 2019",Walked in on Monday morning to look at a few Honda Accords. Bob McGill greeted me and helped me find the car that I wanted with no pressure while providing a pleasant experience. ,5.0
11,"September 21, 2019","I can’t rate this dealer high enough! I was looking for a gently used King Ranch Expedition and came across one here. Being from the DFW area I was a little hesitant not looking forward to the drive to check it out. No problem.  Keith shot videos and sent to me. We had several conversations and then the deal was done. They gave me a $12,000 free bumper to bumper warranty on a 2017 truck. I was ready to drive down to look at it and they drove it to Dallas! The father/daughter team that delivered the truck was so sweet and we had the deal completed in 15 minutes.  They followed up with a phone call to make sure I was happy as well. As a 60 year old woman my only concern was the technology of the radio.  I figured I would wait to get my son to help me, but no, they kept taking care of me. Keith offered to take another video and send it to me walking me through all the steps!  I have purchased many cars in my life, but never have I had an experience like this. I can’t tell enough people about this perfect experience.  Do yourself and check them out. You won’t be disappointed!  ",5.0
12,"September 06, 2019","My second time to buy a car from Allen Honda""s  Bob McGill. Such a positive experience. Bob, Shirley Macik, and Jason Haywood made things as smooth as possible. Brandy Kauder was great  helping set up some detailing we wanted added. Once we bought the  car, Bob's excitement at explaining all of its amenities made you realize just how passionate he is about the product he sells. Would recommend this dealership and Bob to anyone looking for a pain free car buying experience.",5.0

17,"August 27, 2019","If you are looking for a great experience in purchasing a new Honda, look no further than Allen Honda. Spent my wheels going to almost every dealer in Houston. I was told to call Bob McGill with Allen Honda, and instantly got the price I was looking for. Overall experience was excellent. I was pre-approved with USAA for a great interest rate, but Shirley in Finance was able to get me 1.9 percent from Honda. ",5.0
18,"August 05, 2019","We have purchased three cars from ""Honda Bob"" McGill over the years. Unlike my experiences purchasing vehicles from other dealerships, I never have any anxiety sitting across the desk from Mr. McGill. His positive, helpful, and genuinely kind attitude goes a long way and I am more than thrilled to recommend both him and Allen Honda to everyone I know.",4.8
19,"August 04, 2019","Thank you Rusty, Junior and Shirley for a great car buying experience.  There was never a moment that was not professional and courteous beyond expectations.  You worked to get me the car my wife dreamed of.  I will never forget how excited she was.",5.0
20,"July 29, 2019","In the last 35 years, I have bought 11 new Honda's from Allen Honda, and their star salesman, Bob McGill. I can not say enough about the quilty service I have received from Bob and this dealership.

It has been an absulty fantastic experience.

Working with Bob is not like dealing with a salesperson, but more like dealing with a friend.  He is helpful to the max, but never pushy. His knowledge is beyond measure. Bob is an excellent salesman, who not only knows his product, but also knows his customers well. He always helps them get the best deal possible.

Over the years Allen Honda service has always been dependable, honest, and prompt.  I can't imagine dealing with any other dealership.

24,"June 17, 2019","An outstanding buying experience at this dealership. Their personnel, particularly Mathew Cox, Jason Haywood, Shirley Macik, and Nick DeLeon were very knowledgeable of their part of the Allen Honda operation. In addition to this, the attitude that was displayed by these individuals would make anyone feel at ease here as if you were talking to a close friend. I made the remark that it seemed like everyone at the dealership was happy.",5.0
25,"June 13, 2019","I purchased a CR-V from Allen Honda today.  The experience start to finish was excellent.  Salesperson, Junior, was knowledgeable and took his time explaining features.  Rusty gave me a quote over the phone.  He did not ask irritating questions like ""what number do I need to do to put you in a car today"".  He is a straight shooter that gave me a very good price and didn't vary from it when I arrived.  Great dealer.  I will purchase again from them and would recommend them to you.  Everyone that I dealt with were first class!",5.0

27,"June 03, 2019",The people at the dealership are very informative. I feel that I was given a very fair pricel for my trade-in auto. The salesperson took all the time I needed to explain all the aspects of my new car to me. It was just a nice experience and Bob is a great salesman.,5.0
28,"June 03, 2019","We found a car online at Allen Honda and after talking to Cassi Rowe decided to drive a little over 2 hours to see it. I am so glad that we did! Cassi was so friendly and so easy to work with. Mrs. Shirley, the finance manager, was so nice and friendly as well! This was by far the best car buying experience my husband and I have ever had. It was such a blessing! We highly recommend Cassi and Allen Honda!!!   ",5.0
29,"May 22, 2019","I'm an out of town parent of an A&M student.  I was in the market for a preowned Acura MDX and thought I'd check out the local dealerships while I was visiting.  Allen Honda had what I was looking for, so I decided to check it out.  I was politely approached by a salesman name Henry Gerdes, who assisted me.  After all my questions were answered and a test drive, I decided to make an offer.  I'm really glad I did!  Great salesman, great staff, great car at a fair price and most of all, a great experience!  Nice job Henry and thanks for your service!!  You deserve a raise!   - Jack M.",5.0

31,"April 27, 2019","Time for another Honda so it was time to call Bob McGill.  Our family has bought several cars from Bob because he is always a pleasure to work with and always so polite and professional.  As a recent single Mom it was nerve racking to buy a car, but Bob made the process so easy.  Also Katherine helped with the door edge guards and she was very knowledgeable.",5.0
32,"April 15, 2019","We have bought several cars from Bob McGill over several years and have never been disappointed over any purchase. They take the time to do the right thing and make sure you are satisfied from the purchase down to the driving off the parking lot.  Every person in there was caring and worked above and beyond to make sure we got what we wanted at the terms we wanted.  We will continue to buy and send to Allen Honda because  all our past purchas3s have been top notch.

36,"March 27, 2019",Thank you Allen Honda for a great buying experience. Henry listened and asked good questions to find out what our goals were. He had to look deeply into the inventory but came up with a vehicle that was very close to our desired price and condition. There were no surprises in the closing and we had already worked out the costs before going to closing. Thank you again Henry and Allen Honda. Jay R,5.0
37,"March 24, 2019","We’ve been part of the Honda family for three years now. When the time came to buy a truck, we knew exactly where to buy it.  It doesn’t matter the reason for the visit. It is always a friendly environment. ",5.0
38,"March 14, 2019","My 1 star rating is for the salesman Junior, NOT the dealership. My No to recommending this dealership applies ONLY to the salesman Junior.
When I came in and met Junior, I told him that I was NOT buying that day. He didn’t listen and tried to pressure me to buy that day. LISTEN to potential customers! I wanted to talk prices, he wanted to sell right then. So because he wouldn’t listen, I played his little game. When I said at the last minute that I didn’t like the price, he got somewhat belligerent and huffing and puffing about it, “I thought we had a deal”. He also bragged about being the number one salesman in the state or wherever, and how many vehicles he sold last month, etc.  Personally, I cannot stand people that brag on themselves. Leave your ego at home! Needless to say, I bought my new 2019 Ridgeline RTL-E from another dealership. I have no complaints with Allen Honda personally. However if you choose to buy from them, avoid Junior like the plague!",4.0
39,"February 27, 2019","Last week, I got a 2019 CR-V from Cassi Rowe of Allen Honda in College Station.
Cassi Rowe is an excellent dealer.
During the entire purchase process, she not only offered the best price but also did everything she could do to satisfy the customer.
Although there was a little issue with my new car, she showed responsibility by trying to solve that problem for the car she sold.
These are the reasons why I highly recommend Cassi Rowe as an excellent dealer in College Station.
If I get a chance to buy a new car again, I will buy a car from Cassi Rowe without hesitation.

Bob answered all of my questions and explained everything to me regarding my

42,"January 11, 2019","We paid what we thought we would have to. All the things you can buy that are extra was told to us, but not pressured to buy anything. I really liked that. Bob McGill is very professional as well as the others that worked there. This is our 3rd Honda we have bought from him. There service department  has always been good too. That is another reason we go back. ",5.0
43,"January 08, 2019","This is my second Honda to purchase from Mr. Bob at Allen Honda.  Since I already had a Honda, some things were still the same.  However, Mr. Bob pointed out all of the new safety features and answered all of my questions.  He treated me as if I was his only customer.  
Shirley closed the deal and gave me options, such as:  warranties and protection plans.  

After the deal was done, I explained to Rusty there were three reasons why I returned back to Honda.  For sales: it's Bob McGill, he's a top notch sales person.  For finance: it's Shirley.  Her years of experience really shows in the appreciation she shows for her customers.  For service: it's Tammy.  No one can touch her appreciation for customer service.",5.0

45,"January 03, 2019","My experience purchasing a vehicle from Allen Honda was like one I've never had before, from a dealership or private party.  It was simple, easy going, pressure free, very comfortable and unusually satisfying.  The price was incredible, the customer service was undoubtedly best in class and second to none.  My vehicle is amazing and I'm so happy.  I waited a few weeks to fill this out to be sure any follow up or anything after the purchase that I needed was accommodated.  Everything was indeed accommodated and then some.  I have and will continue to recommend this dealership to anyone looking to purchase a vehicle.  I drive 2 hours to get there and will be coming back for my next vehicle.  Thank you so much Allen Honda for standing out and providing an amazing service and experience for me!

With gratitude,

47,"December 09, 2018","This is the second time I came in to Allen Honda to have routine maintenance performed on my car, only to drive away in a new vehicle. I loved the HR-V I bought from Matt Cox in 2017. I love the CR-V I drove away with the other day even more. I refuse to buy a car from anyone but Matt now. He’s honest, forthcoming, always tries his hardest to get me what I want in a vehicle, and goes out his way to make the car buying experience painless and short. He is the greatest! I’m grateful for people like Matt at Allen Honda. He always goes above and beyond the duties of a salesperson. I’d consider him a friend. Albeit one that I see every year! :)",4.8

49,"December 03, 2018","My wife, myself and our 3 grown children and their families have purchased 5 vehicles this month. We have purchased other vehicles there in the past and always have had great sales people. 

But I just wanted to brag about our sales rep. Cassi, not only did she answer all our questions or found out the answer. Always a quick reply from a text or phone call. As I was taking the stuff out of my old vehicle and putting it in the new one, she removed the county disposal sticker and put it on the new one, something I would have over looked, not only was that a nice jester, it goes way above and beyond great customer service!

I can't say enough great things about the financial team, especially Shirley, she works so hard to get you the best deal, she takes time to answer any and all questions, she really is concerned about the customer!

So if you in need of a vehicle, I highly recommend Cassi and Shirley to help make you dreams come true!",5.0
50,"November 02, 2018","I have purchased a lot of cars in my time and it was always a bad day.
The sales and finance people at Allen Honda make it a fun and quick day.
They do not waste your time with the standard let me talk with my manager BS.
The finance manager got right to the best deal and did much better than my old standby USAA which I have been a member for over 50 years.
I highly recommend you visit Allen Honda if you are looking for a car and talk with Cassi, Junior and Elton.  They will make you a happy buyer.",5.0
51,"October 20, 2018",I contacted the dealer through email and Faith got back with me immediately by email and phone call. We talked about price and the car I was interested in and she emailed me back with we can make this deal happen. Chip sales manager was great offered to send my car to me (which I am 2 hours away). I came in and Bryan Smith helped me get into my car great salesman! Told me all the options and showed me how to operate everything. Signed papers with Shirley and we were out the door within an hour! I highly recommend this dealership they went above and beyond for me and my busy family! They really made me feel like family! All the other dealers near me could not make this happen. They just wanted to haggle and waste my time but not Allen Honda!💕,5.0

53,"October 18, 2018",We recently leased our second vehicle from Allen Honda. Prior to three years ago we had not been to Allen Honda but after getting our first lease with them I would highly recommend the dealership.  Everyone we encountered in the process was friendly and very knowledgeable.  Angie Schrick was the sales person that helped us and we could not ask for better service.  We have nothing negative to say about the entire process.  ,5.0
54,"October 08, 2018","My partner purchased a used vehicle from Allen in early 2018. I was with him when he very explicitly discussed NOT purchasing a warranty from the finance rep. He stated this multiple times and was told by the finance employee that he was not purchasing the warranty.

A few months later, he discovered they signed him up for the warranty. It is now fall of 2018 and Allen Honda has been a NIGHTMARE to deal with. They won’t give us the contract that he signed, which we want to inspect to see exactly where it was he signed for the warranty (we believe they forged his signature), they have bold-faced lied about processing a reimbursement check, have withheld information, and still have not fixed the cosmetic issues they were supposed to fix after purchasing the vehicle.

This company is so incredibly dishonest that it is unfathomable, and Mr. Allen should be ashamed of how his lying employees and how his company treats people.  ",1.0

Thank you Ms. Schrick, job well done!!",5.0
57,"September 01, 2018","Honest and Genuine Customer Service!!

The dealership has an ambiance that is positive with the absence of the pressured sales and aggressive approach of most dealerships. I was not approached by hungry sales staff pestering me; an important quality to this dealership.  I like to look at inventory without interference. I was asked if I needed anything and to let them know when and if I do.  Once I was ready, sales agent Mr. Kyle Regalado and Chip Clester, the gentleman in the finance department both assisted me. Instead of the unapproachable and oftentimes hidden behind the scenes finance guy ready to maximize on their profits, Chip willingly and actively assisted Kyle to accommodate narrowing my selection.  I was comfortable in their care. I admit, I was a bit indecisive, however, they were patient with me, and demonstrated a genuine concern for my needs. Elton Duff in finance closed my deal, this guy is a riot.  He is a very enjoyable character to say the least. Last, Mr. Junior Mpamah went out of his way while I was walking out the dealership to state that they appreciated my visit and purchase with Allen Honda, and mentioned that he knew me from around C-Stat.  A memorable experience and a super cool crew.
It is with my highest recommendation that Allen Honda be your end all be all for your automotive purchasing needs. Whether it’s new or used cars, these guys are second to none. I literally got the ""Deal of the Century!""  Ask for Kyle in sales, and for Chip to do the finance work.",5.0

He ended up buying the car and we left extremely happy.  This is a Great Dealership to visit.  ",5.0

Even my friends cannot believe the friendly support, honesty, and courtesies that Tammy and the Allen Honda service team provide! Allen Honda and Tammy have my absolute trust.

70,"May 01, 2018","In April of 2018 I purchased a used 2013 Nissan Rogue from Allen Honda that was certified vehicle for my college daughter.  Ten days later as she was on her way home to the DFW area she broke down on Hwy. 6 about 20-30 minutes from Waco on a Friday afternoon around 5:00pm.  I immediately contacted Allen Honda and was put in touch with Josh in the Service Dept.  After realizing her road side assistance was not available yet due to the time frame of the sale, he scheduled a tow truck from College Station to the Marlin area where she was stranded. Since it was after 5:00 pm and by the time the tow truck could get to my daughter and return the vehicle to the dealership he gave us his cell phone number so that she could contact him when the vehicle arrived after hours and he would meet her at the dealership and put her in a loaner vehicle.  The problem ended up being the transmission which Allen Honda replaced with a new one with warranty at no cost to us.  Josh and his team went over and beyond the call of duty!  I highly recommend Allen Honda!!  Can't thank them enough for how they handled the situation!",5.0

The other staff at Allen Honda was excellent as well. From everyone just greeting us if they walked by or asked if we needed anything. The Business team was able to handle all paperwork very effieciently and promptly, and the added accessories we had installed was done very quickly and she broke down the cost per item as well as install cost for us right then and there.

The agreement I drove 3 hours for was to match the out-the-door price quoted by another dealership and discount the price by the $100 referral amount they were applying to my purchase.  The other dealership included standardized accessories, but salesman David stressed that Allen Honda included an 80K mile maintenance warranty and said his ""manager promises a good deal on your trade in"".  After I was on my way, David reneged the maintenance warranty, saying they couldn’t provide it when price-matching.  Then when we got there, he also claimed not to know the Financing Dept. wasn’t matching the $100 off and we were told our trade-in was worthless to them, receiving NO offer. They had had all the information, including VIN, for our trade-in vehicle for a week. Two additional meetings we offered opportunities for him to stand by his agreement and he wouldn't.

I tried to circumvent the system by texting my questions to Allen Honda in Bryan/College Station Texas. To my surprise and delight, Allison was honest, helpful,  patient, and respectful. She made an appointment for me to meet with Matt Cox, who,  to my amazement, actually knows his product line, actually listened to my input, found exactly the right car for me, and introduced me to Shirley ""Magic"", Finance Director extraordinaire.

A little history:  At Tomball Dodge, I was recently treated in a manner in which I hope nobody is ever treated.  My experience there was unlike anything I've ever dealt with.  It was so bad, that I returned the truck 3 weeks later, and received a refund.  They refused to perform any of the minor repairs that were part of a written contract when I purchased a truck.  Their customer service doesn't exist.  Allen Honda has  made me completely forget about that poor experience at Tomball Dodge.

I was introduced by a friend to Rusty Skinner at Allen Honda.  He's the general manager, and let me just tell you, the guy is AWESOME.  He is literally more concerned about how happy his customers are, than he is about making a buck.  Trust me, dealerships will always make money, but he will sincerely make sure you're happy with your purchase.  He's more than honest, and has his staff trained very, very well!  I just can't say enough good things about Allen Honda.  

Overall, he has made it very clear that he wants me to be 100% happy with my purchase, I got a MUCH, MUCH better deal, and am happier with this business than I have ever been with any other business of any kind.  

If you're in the market for a new or used vehicle, do yourself a favor and go to Allen Honda!

Thanks again, Rusty and staff!

I've actually been a loyal Allen Honda customer since 1995, when I moved to College Station from the Chicago area and needed service for my well-driven '87 Accord, and the Service department treated me as if I were bringing in a brand new car right from their own showroom floor!  So, when I was ready to buy, there was no question about where I was going ... and, over the years I've gone back again, and again, and again to Bob McGill, whenever I was in the market to buy.  And, I've referred many friends and colleagues to Bob.  I have the highest regard for his knowledge and how he has worked with me through the years, whether pre-owned or new vehicles, to meet my needs and circumstances ... and, always, his no-pressure style exceeded my expectations!  The team worked with me for almost a week as I considered CR-V vs Pilot, AWD, colors etc. to get me into the right vehicle that would make me smile!  Bob is focused on his customers and not ""the sale"" per se, and that's what makes him such an outstanding salesman, and a Leadership salesman with a loyal client base.

After an hour and twenty minutes I went to check on the car. No one in the service department could tell me who my service advisor was, not even the man who checked me in.  Stood there for ten minutes and watched the circus. Finally Tammy told me she had my ticket and needed to talk to me about some service and maintenance work that I needed to have done on the car. I told her no thanks I needed to get to work. She seemed rather put out and told me that it would take a few minutes to process my paperwork. Ten minutes later my paperwork was ready. Waited outside another five minutes for the car. FINALLY a polite young man brings the car to the front, tells me thanks and have a nice day. Get into the car and it smells like cigarettes!!! My mother in laws accord stinks like cigarettes!!!! For some time now weve been taking all our Hondas to a shop run by one of Allen's mechanics, Raymond Monroe.

118,"September 14, 2016","I've been going to Allen Honda for over 20 years. I've only purchased one car from Allen (a Honda Civic over 20 years ago), but I have had my other Hondas serviced here over the years and checked out new cars many times. The sales staff has always been very friendly. So I don't have any issues with sales and would still consider Allen for a new Honda purchase. At least until today.

Their service department needs help. I'm not sure what is going on over in that department, but the quality has deteriorated the last few years. Recent examples: a service adviser trying to tell me I needed a timing belt change even though my CR-V has a timing chain, not a belt. Another time the service adviser said I needed to replace the battery, which I declined. I took the battery to an auto parts store to be tested, and it was fine. The last several times I have had my cars serviced, they did not wash them. The cars are older, and one doesn't look so hot anymore, but every other Honda dealer I go to always washes the cars after servicing them. Someone left a streak of grease on my headliner by the sun visor. Once, the antenna was unscrewed and left in the passenger seat after service. Not sure why since I did not ask for the radio to be checked, and they did not wash the car, so I don't know why they would remove the antenna. These are all small things, but indicative of the sloppiness/shadiness that pervades their service department. Today was the last time I will go to Allen for service though. I went in for an oil change and to see if they had time to perform an alignment and check my brakes or if I would have to schedule for those. I parked in the breezeway and saw the service adviser was busy with another customer. After waiting a while, I went into the office. Everyone was busy at their computers so I waited. No one asked if I needed help. Then two customers pulled in behind me, and another service adviser came out the back and rushed by me to help the guy that had just pulled in behind me. I figured that guy had an appointment, so I didn't say anything, but then I overheard that he was a walk-in as well. So I waited some more, and then the other service adviser came in and started helping the second guy that had pulled in behind me (another walk-in). At that point I just left. No one ever spoke to me or asked if I needed help.

The new building they are constructing next door looks like it will be nice. I just hope they give the service department a good overhaul when they move over there.

131,"August 10, 2016","Taken my car to Allen Honda 4 times in the last 5 years to have my a/c repaired. They have patched it up just enough to make it work for a little while while charging me several hundred to over a thousand dollars. Just took it in and I was told it would be $2000 to replace the condenser (this would be the 3rd one).  I told them not to fix it as I don't want to pay that kind of money for a part that keeps going out. When I arrived to pick up my car they charged me $90 just to test the a/c. Even though I had already paid $90 for the same test plus a few hundred dollars for the supposed ""repair"" a few months ago.   I won't be back and I probably won't buy Honda again because I don't want to have to drive to Houston every time I need service. ",1.6
132,"August 10, 2016",I was once told that honda salesmen didn't have to work because Hondas sell themselves. It was from a salesmen at this dealership over 10 years ago. I have been to this dealership twice before in my life and I told myself I wouldn't come back. The person most interested in selling the car was the finance dept. I bought the car but it was an all day event. I would have left but I was tired of looking for a car. I never met the internet sales person thst I started out working with. She just sent me to someone else and I never heard from her again. I will update in 6 mths to let you know if all promises and suggestions worked out.  Service department is my major concern and I think that might be the highlight of my deal. Hopefully I can increase the score at that time. They said I can refinance later. I started out with onr interest that was supposedly approved 3 to 4 hours later I ended up with and interest rate that was double the amount we had agreed to. My crefit rating had slipped downhill but the interest rate actually doubled in tge time it took to get from car.sales to finance.They told me that the car wasnt certified when it had certified wrote on the plates and windows. So they gave me the certified rating back as a perk (?) So was the car actually certified? I couldnt tell you.I have no idea what happened to that deal. They said they would fix the chips in the paint. To be continued.......,2.5

Once the decision was made, again Rusty served our needs personally.  We were joined by Shirley Macik, Finance Director, who worked to obtain a marvelous rate and financing, far better than we had thought.

137,"August 01, 2016","As a Dad with a daughter away at college I needed a dealer I could trust and that would just ""get it done"" when she needed help.  My first encounter was with the service department when her 2008 Honda Accord had some issues.  Tammy just flat took care of my daughter, called me and kept me informed as to the status, and reassured us that everything was fine.  

When my daughter had an accident at the beginning of summer 2016 we went to CS to replace her car.  We went to 5 different dealers to look at different cars and came back to Allen Honda and bought a 2016 Accord.  They were the 1st and last place we went.  Absolutely the most professional and kindest staff, great value on the new car, and again assured us that our daughter (and her parents) didn't have anything to worry about with service, etc.

Last example.  Today my daughter was on vacation and landed out of state to find a text from her roommate saying her windows were all down for some reason (possibly her key fob was pushed in her purse) and rolled the windows down.  No spare key at house.  I called David the service manager and Rusty the GM.  They took care of it immediately to be sure the windows were up, car secure, and everyone assured.  

I've bought a lot of cars and deal with many companies.  This dealership and their team are simply THE best.  (especially when it comes to parents needing to be sure our kids are properly treated and not cheated).  Great job team Allen!

214,"December 16, 2015","The biggest thing I will mention first is that full respect was given to my wife. With other dealerships the salesperson talked directly to me, and not my wife. Sam with Allen Honda talked to both of us equally, and physically faced my wife when addressing her. This is what professionalism looks like. Sam did not begin by forcing us into a car or showing us the best model he thought we should see. He asked us questions, found out what we were looking for, asked us what was important to us, and then learned a little about us through friendly chat. By the time we went to explore cars he already had an idea of what we were looking for. 

The overall experience was very pleasant, and everybody at Allen Honda was fantastic... from the salesman to the financial writer to management. Sam took the time over 2 days to answer every question we had. We test drove the vehicles we had narrowed things down to, and we were able to come to a decision that my wife and I both agreed upon. To our surprise it wasn't even a new car, but a 2013 model. However, it had everything we were looking for and was absolutely beautiful. Between days 1 and 2 we researched everything Sam told us and it all checked out. We selected the 2013 Honda Accord EX, which comes with a CVT transmission. This was new technology to us, but Sam did a great job explaining it all to us. 

My wife and I could not have asked for a better low-key, no-pressure-to-buy atmosphere with which to purchase our car. If you are looking for a new (or used) car, please go to Allen Honda. Honda's are amazing cars by themselves (we also own a 2007 Honda Accord that just keeps going and going), but the staff is AMAZING!",5.0

I have finally learned to stop bothering with other dealers and go straight to Allen Honda.  This place has a culture unlike any other dealership.  They will do whatever they can to put you in the vehicle that you want but they won't play games or pressure you into making a decision.  Megan went above and beyond, even contacting me after the sale to make sure we were happy with our purchase.

Appreciated the offer to take the Subaru home and drive during my normal day to see if it met our needs. Honda wanted us to be excited about our vehicle for the long term.

Pricing. No games. No time wasted. No push. Felt like I could focus on the purchase of the car. Not the emotions of the dealership.

After sell. Megan has contacted us during the time period most buyers have second thoughts about a hasty decision. We have not had those second thoughts. I have enjoyed sharing my adventures with the Subaru with her. 

The dealership was awesome in working with my schedule and never reflected frustration when I was unexpectedly delayed from arriving on agreed meeting time.

235,"October 09, 2015","I could write a small sized book but I won't. Let me just say that Allen Honda in College Station, TX is one of the best. They are straightforward, knowledgeable, polite and down to earth practical. Honestly, they could have tried to sell me a tricked out 40,000 car and I would have probably listened but they didn't. Judging from my experience with another dealer in town, Allen Honda is more focused on great customer service and repeat business rather than volume and getting you out the door.

Deb Nigh, from Allen Honda, helped me get out of a giant rotten pickle that another dealership had put me in because of course I wanted to try out buying my first car on my own and at the end of the month (which, is apparently a nono for inexperienced buyers since the sales pressure is so much more than usual). Deb, Jason and Kat helped me with getting a great Civic that fits my family, is easy to drive and has incredible gas mileage. They took care of every step for me and were so nice that we asked why they were helping us out to such an extent. Their response was that they knew we are planning on being here for the long haul and wanted to create a good relationship so we would continue to be their customers. 

Whether you're a first time car buyer or a seasoned pro, I recommend Allen Honda. The no pressure and no nonsense experience is one of the best and is the reason we'll be buying Honda's from Allen Honda from now on.",5.0

238,"September 28, 2015","I was interested in a used vehicle I saw online and I contacted internet sales.  Megan Wells responded to my inquiry in a very polite manner letting me know she was available if I needed any assistance.  Since I was undecided on what I needed she walked the lot with me and explained the pro's and con's on each of the vehicles.  Once I found some vehicles I was interested in she let me take them for a test drive without making me feel like I was being ""watched"".  When I asked for a few minutes alone to look at the vehicles she let me be, but still made herself available when I needed help.  I asked for cost to own estimates of a few cars she gave me a breakdown of short-term and long-term costs.  Once I was ready to decide, Megan was again very cool.  She was not pushy at all.  

I really feel that Megan Wells treated me like we were family (or she would advise her family the same way).  This was the fisrt time that I have left a car dealership without feeling unsure or second guessing my decision.  Next time I am looking for a car for my family or a freind is looking for an good place to go, I will drive them to internet sales to talk to Megan Wells.  ",5.0

He was happy to show us multiple vehicles and explain the same things several times.  Then we left to look at a couple of other dealerships and his attitude was one of the major reasons we chose to return to Honda.  Of course we loved the vehicle, too, but the relaxed atmosphere was just so outstanding it won us over!

The finance department was also impressive!  It was so streamlined - we only signed a few papers and finished the whole process in about 5 or 10 minutes!

249,"August 14, 2015","Narrowed down the car I wanted and found all available within a 300 mile radius of me. It's a reasonably difficult to find car and there were only about 4-5 within the radius that weren't massively overpriced and had the specs I wanted (2014+ Volvo XC60 T6). Allen Honda had one of them, so I sent their internet sales department a message. 

Very quickly, maybe within minutes, I got a message from their internet salesperson Megan Wells. She said we could text message to discuss the vehicle, which was great for me, so all our communications over the next week or so were via text. It was an extremely easy way to do business and responses to my questions typically came within seconds over the course of me looking at cars. 

No phone calls, no emails (except a few giving me the Carfax/other info), just dealing via text message. Everything was documented on text, it was great! There was no question about what we talked about or pricing because it was all there. 

We worked out an awesome out-the-door price that no other dealer could match (actually, it was the best price I could find nationwide on this year/model). I took the 1.5 hour drive to College Station and the car was ready and waiting for me. I had texted her all my info and when I arrived, all the paperwork was filled out and waiting for me. It was such a painless process, I sent her a text saying when I would be there, the car and paperwork were ready when I arrived. After a short test drive, I signed the paperwork and wrote a check. Easily the quickest in and out I have ever had when dealing with a car dealership. 

Comparatively, I was talking to some other dealerships, trying to work out prices before heading out to pick up a car. Some required I call to really get any info, which was time consuming. Some dealt over email, but took a day to respond to questions, etc. It was a chore dealing with other dealerships. I appreciate that Megan was agile in dealing in newer ways of doing business, she was professional, nice, and gave me lightning quick responses consistently. 

My only hiccup was with the dealership itself. All other dealerships I had been dealing with said I could just leave a relatively-small deposit to hold the car for me. Allen Honda would not budge on this. I would have happily put a 20% deposit on the $30k car to hold it until I could make the drive from Houston to College Station, but they wouldn't do it. So I kind of had to make the drive hoping the car would still be available (it was, thanks to Megan!). 

Otherwise, totally happy and hope my next car purchase is this easy. ",5.0

Nate Allen was very accommodating and let me take out both by myself for lengthy test drives. I decided I preferred the EX-L and we negotiated what I thought was a fair price. While I wasn't overly enthusiastic about what they allowed on my trade-in, overall I thought the net amount I paid for my new car was a better than average deal. And the financing I got through Honda was at a much better interest rate (0.9%) than my pre-approved loan through my bank. Nate and another person went over the features of my new car (there was a lot!) and told me I could call him anytime if I had call any questions later.

In our past experiences both in purchasing new cars and test driving cars, we never had an experience this positive and we credit that to Lucas and the general no haggle and customer centric environment at Allen Honda.

I saw several people look out of the service office into the bay where I was yet no one came out for quite some time.  Then, I waited 2 and a half hours for an oil change. They told me it would take an hour and 20 minutes.  I also asked them to do a tire rotation which they refused to do, saying the wear on my tires was even. I just had my tires replaced 6000 miles ago because the wear on all four was so bad which they never told me about until they were unsafe to drive on. And of course they wanted me to buy the tires from them. Also, the last time I went in for an oil change, they told me I needed a new timing belt. I did not have the part replaced because it was going to cost over $800 to replace. This time, they did not tell me I needed a new timing belt. How do I need it 3000 miles ago and suddenly today I don't? I don't trust the people at this Honda dealership. The only reason I put up with it before today is because it was the only Honda dealership in College Station.  But after today, I will be taking my business elsewhere.

322,"October 12, 2012","We bought our first Honda (ever) while living in College Station.  After moving back to Texas from Colorado, we bought a Civic to drive for the family use for a year then to hand off to the oldest daugher to drive to TTU in Lubbock.  We liked it so much we bought one a year later for the next daughter with the same plan of put 15K to 20K miles on it as the family car and send her to TTU in it.  Except now we were living in Houston.  Our dealing with Jason and your dealership were so favorable that going anywhere else for a Honda was never considered. 
So now with the kids in school we are a car short, and again, we drive up from Houston to drive a few cars with Jason and decide on a 2 door V6 Accord.  Quick and clean deal worked out with no headaches.  Kudo's to Jason. Very nice car.  I give the two Civics a rating of 10 each and the Accord will be one of my favorite vehicles ever, I am sure.
I am afraid GM/Ford/Dodge are off my vendor list.  The value for the dollar is just not there.
Honda's and trips to College Station to purchase them are the way were are going from here on out.

From our very first purchase in 2006 until now,( 2 vehicles later), Jason has remained attentive, accommodating and sincerely appreciative of our patronage.  When we go to the Dealership it is more like visiting a good friend(s)than a stereotyped car salesman.  We don't dread going there for any reason as we have at other dealerships in the past.  Whether it's been for an oil change or to buy a new vehicle our vists are always a pleasurable experience.  I've always felt that one's perception of a business or company was nothing more than their perception of the people they've met there.  Because of Jason we have a very high regard for Allen Honda.

329,"April 12, 2006","My wife and I were on the lookout for a second car. We had dealt with the Toyota dealer in town for our new car, loved their products, but hated their pushy, slimy business attitude. This time we decided to check the local Honda dealer, and were pleasantly surpised with their attitude. Allen Honda is easy to work with, the employee we dealt with (Horace) is very honest, and he did not try to show us more expensive models than what our limit was. He also bent backward to find the best product for us. Finally, we got an exremely good deal on a 2001 Odyssey. The whole experience was great, and we recommend this dealer. In fact, if we ever buy a new car we will probably not look further than Allen Honda.",5.0
