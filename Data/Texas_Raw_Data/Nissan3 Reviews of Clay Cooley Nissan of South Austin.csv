0,"April 15, 2018","I bought a truck, the salesman said they would detail it and get it all cleaned up.  Also the oil was at 30% life remaining, and a couple of the tires were missing the valve stem covers.  Little stuff.  I called for an appointment to have this all done, was told I didn't need one for detailing, just come on by anytime.  I drove 23 miles, was rudely ignored for 20 minutes by the service people, (even after I got out of the car and stood by the kiosk looking right at them!) when I finally was able to get one to help me he told me I had to arrive early in the morning, leave the car all day, and bring a ""Wheeoh"".  (This turned out to be a work order from the salesman who sold the car, cutely called a ""We Owe"").  So I would have had to drive over to the sales dealership, find the salesman and get this form, (and at no time did the service flack offer to phone the salesman and have it faxed over), and then come back another day (another hour driving through Austin) and leave the car all day.  For a washing and an oil change.  I suspect this is how they get out of honoring their commitments, by making it way too inconvenient.  So for $37,000 I got one key to the truck ($190 to get another), 2 out of 4 tire valve stem covers, elderly oil, and I get to clean the thing up myself.  Aaaaaand, they (service) were really rude.  So, yes, I think one star.

2,"July 28, 2017","I had a very pleasant experience buying my first car today. My sales professional, Seyed Mirashrafi did an amazing job explaining the whole process, while his manager made sure I left with the right price. I've been to many dealerships in town and going there was the right choice. ",5.0
