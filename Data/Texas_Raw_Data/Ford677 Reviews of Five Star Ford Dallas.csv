1,"June 26, 2020","I think car shopping has a negative stigma, and my wife and I have had a bad car shopping experience with a Ford dealership (not this one) in the past.  I must say, however, that this experience was relatively painless.  This location is absolutely beautiful, and has a large selection.  Anna was nice and obviously very good at what she does.  We don't buy cars often, before this, it had been 11 years since we stepped into a dealership to purchase, and I'm glad we ended up here.",5.0

The whole building was very immaculate and clean. The young lady that assisted me with a loaner vehicle was Donna. She was awesome to deal with. My whole experience was top notch. Highly recommended dealership!

4,"May 15, 2020","Everyone that worked here was so amazing. They all helped me get into a vehicle even with my credit issues. But I can express enough how amazing my salesman, Laray Wilson is. He helped me so much and made the process so easy. He went above and beyond anything that I could have asked for. He always kept things straight and told me exactly how everything was going to go. He is a straight shooter and I loved it. I will go to him from now on!",5.0

6,"May 02, 2020",Once I got to the dealership the sales manager did not provided an offer or deal for the vehicle I was interested. All he did was talk about random things and other vehicles I did not care for. I never had such bad experience at a Dealership like I had a Five Star Ford Dallas I felt discriminate ATT Raul Munoz.,1.4

12,"April 15, 2020",Joe and I are good friends and he know's I've been wanting a GT for a while. He found one in Kansas city that I really liked and we transacted everything over the phone. I went to the dealership then to finalize everything. Joe made the process SO easy and probably one of the easiest guys there is to work with. I recommend seeing him,5.0

17,"March 05, 2020",I have bought and had my car serviced starting with Lee Jarmon Ford.  On March 3 I had an appoint to service my car at your new shop.  I drove in the service bay area at 3:30pm and waited in my car for 15 min. no one came to help me. Finally I got out and went in side where the men were sitting.  Still no help.  Finally Ben as if he could help.  He asked if I had an appointment and I said yes at 3:30.  He said I did not have an appointment and there was nothing he could do.  I spoke to the service manager and he said that an appointment only ment it was a drop-off time.  I have purchased two cars from Five Star Ford and have never been treated like this.  They were very rude and did not care if I had my car serviced or not.  I hope you can pay for your new facility (which is very nice) when you have such poor service.  I guess you just have so much business that you don't need any more.,1.0
18,"March 04, 2020",Great service and attention to detail from not just one person but from everyone I met.  They really work hard to make it a smooth and easy process.,5.0

20,"March 02, 2020","We bought a used car from Five Star and after a few hours it started having a minor problem. Even though we had bought it as-is and the dealership wasn't in any way required to help us out, they took it in to have their mechanics look at it free of charge, they were extremely helpful throughout the whole process. This is the place to buy your car, they are honest, trustworthy, and provide a great serivce, can't recommend enough.",5.0
21,"February 28, 2020","This is my second vehicle purchase from Five Star and it was as straight forward and  easy as the first. The end to end buying experience was stress free, and both the staff and facilities were first rate. Coming in without an appointment, Joe was quick to assist, letting me test drive a couple of cars while my own was valued. There was no pressure throughout, and I completed the deal a few days later, after some negotiation. Even the finance process was straight forward, something no one relishes. Thanks. ",5.0

24,"February 05, 2020","Gary in financing is a liar. We negotiated a lease buyout on a 2017 Ford Mustang Ecoboost with an extended warranty that was supposed to come out to $432 for the plan. The paperwork he gave me has the plan marked to $1,433, in addition to a bogus finance charge on top of my Credit Union's APR.

Overall, have been scammed for almost $2,500 in extra charges, due to deceptive sales tactics, and will never do business with this dealer again. The service department is a joke as well, as Brett Ingersoll, my sales rep, lied on behalf of service department representative Mark Gray, saying my car needed a $500 repair that was covered under Powertrain and Emissions warranty.

Horrible, horrible people. I have wasted a month's worth of Saturdays, two  times being put into a loaner and have dealt with their deceptiveness on a buyout that I was pre-approved for outside of the dealer, and ended up financing outside of the dealer.

If Ford wants to retain any future opportunities for mine or my family's business, they can reach out to me and let me know. In the meantime, I hope each of these men enjoy their monthly bonus. It's no wonder how they are grand opening their new dealership today, with the extra charges they build into a simple lease buyout. Shame on me for putting any faith in them.",1.2
25,"January 27, 2020","I was considering buying one of this dealership's used vehicles from out of state; never been to it, all communications via phone/email. Google and Yelp reviews are available on the web; seems like an average franchised dealer. I came into contact with Joe Crawford via one of dealership ad/sales platforms(Trucar, Autotrader, etc.). Asked Joe for a quote/offer sheet on the vehicle I was interested in, got it right out to me; I decided on an on-site PPI and Joe coordinated the inspection process at dealership site, let me know when inspector made appointment and did inspection; all this over a few days time. Although I ultimately decided on another vehicle from a different source if I were to be considering another vehicle from this dealership I would prefer to work with Joe Crawford.",4.4

37,"December 28, 2019","If I could give this zero stars I would. I've only had my car for a little over 5 months. It has been nothing but trouble. This was ""suppose"" to be a certified vehicle. Which was explained to me by the salesperson. Whose knowledge of cars are zero. I learned after just 6 weeks of having the car that i needed a front end alignment.  Then one of the tires kept going low. Needed a new tire 237 dollars. I don't think it's even a new tire.. Then the trim on my back passenger door keeps falling off. Still waiting on that to come in that I told them about in November. Smh!!! I didn't have this much trouble with the 2007 escape I bought in 2010. Don't get me wrong I love my car it's just been too much. My next car will definitely not be a Ford!!!!!!!!!",3.2
38,"December 23, 2019","I recently purchased a vehicle from Five Star Ford in Plano. Shawne and Pete assisted me with the purchase of a new vehicle. I was very specific in what I was considering and within a few days, they located a vehicle. I test drove the vehicle and it was exactly what I was looking for. Shawne and Pete were extremely knowledgeable about all the vehicles and I never felt pressured. When I get ready to buy my next vehicle, I will go to Five Star Ford in Plano and request Shawne and Pete.  Great experience from start to finish.

The employees of Five Star Ford are probably the best I have ever dealt with. My sales person, Becky Cunneen, has become a close contact and was able to put together a great deal with my trade in. Anyone looking for a new vehicle needs to visit and Five Star Ford and give them a chance. Ford has an outstanding product and the dealership was far better than any Toyota dealer I have ever been to. Looking forward to getting my all electric Mustang in the future.

Joey O’Connor, the Performance Sales Manager, was so much fun to work with and made us feel like we were his only clients, when in reality he was delivering multiple cars to multiple buyers in the same morning.

61,"November 19, 2019","I had never purchased from here before but the experience was excellent. My salesman Joey was excellent and very personable and friendly.  Really enjoyed working with him. The only poor experience was with finance. The people were friendly, but it left a poor taste that the interest rate that they offered was 2 full points higher than what I got on my own. Maybe, I’m wrong, but I feel like I’d qualify for the lowest with any lender and it just seemed like this was shady. ",5.0

73,"October 25, 2019","I was looking for a newer truck to replace my worn out 2003 Chevy 4x4 PU.  After searching online, I found a few used F-150s (already owned a 2003 F-250).  After seeing several lemons, taking several other used trucks for unimpressive test drives, finding a possible replacement and then enduring numerous vehicle sales and finance peoples’ pitches, hearing asking prices higher than advertised online and generally given the run around and verbal games, I called it a day.  

I finally found a really nice-looking replacement, a gently used/new 2019 F-150 Lariat right down the street at the new Five Star Ford Dallas dealership near UTD.  

When I went in to take a test drive, I met Pete Restivo, Internet Sales Manager.  Pete was welcoming and eager to go with me on a test drive.  Since I felt the asking price was higher than I thought appropriate, Pete presented my purchase offer to his management.  After several iterations, we finally reached an acceptable agreement.  While we were waiting for the paperwork to be completed, Pete took me on a tour of their new facilities, including introducing me to Parrish Ganakos, Service Advisor, their service bays and explaining how to navigate the service environment.  Pete also introduced me to James Doriawal, Aftermarket Manager.  James explained what aftermarket items were available for my truck and how to obtain when I decided to purchase.  Before completing the purchase, I sat down with Alex Gonzalez, Finance, to complete the finance paperwork.  A fellow veteran, Alex was patient, clearly explained all the options and answered all my questions.

When I went in to pickup my new to me truck, after having the windows tinted, Pete was there again ready to take time to assist me.  Before I drove off the lot, Pete, stepped me through (new to the current generation of computerized vehicles) some of the trucks features and how to operate several systems.  He made sure I was comfortable before I drove off the lot.  Additionally, they have every other Saturday morning classes, led by Michelle Larson, to familiarize/train newbies like me on the computerized systems in the Ford vehicles.

In summary, I highly recommend the team at Five Star Ford Dallas, off the George Bush Turnpike, near UTD.  Be sure to ask for Pete Restivo.  He will treat you right, make sure you find the vehicle you want, at the right price and ensure you have a highly successful and satisfying purchasing experience.

Lastly, Scion took the time to review all my manuals and help me set up my Ford Pass. During the set-up, we were unable to get the technology connected correctly. Michelle Larson was kind enough to help troubleshoot and fix the issue with a system reset.

He showed us our options and was honest about how much he thought we’d be able to get on trade, and was patient with us as we discussed our options between brand new and used 2017 or 2018 vehicles. He put together pricing sheets for every option we threw at him, including leasing, and let us go back and forth with our decisions. In the end, we went with a used 2017 Explorer and are so thankful we did. Joe was there with us till the end, which is impressive since we were there for about 6 hours.

My trade-in was valued extremely fairly and met exactly what I wanted for it. LaRay was easy to work with throughout the entire process.

203,"November 25, 2018","I bought an Escape in 2013. I can honestly say I bought my first lemon. After an engine, both front axels, 3 transmission repairs, 4 recalls I was at my wits end. So when the transmission started slipping, 4 weeks ago i tried to get it repaired at three local shops. No one would touch it because it was a problem transmission and they said I should get Ford involved. I took my car in and drove it with the Service Manager. One more time he told me that there was nothing different than others he drove. Two weeks later the transmission would not go into gear. I took it in and told John to get it up and get Ford involved. I wasn’t driving it any longer. He gave me an Edge loner. So John calls me and starts down the path that I needed a new transmission and he had quotes, and that the front axel was causing the transmission to leak. The axel that was replaced. Unbeknownest to John Becky called me and started talking about selling the Escape to them. John never mentioned Ford, never discussed the problems that they had had with my transmission, just wanted to get the next service sale. Didn’t listen to a xxxx thing i said about the LEMON I HAD. I feel so cheated by the Service Dept, that if i thought i wouldn’t go to jail, i would spend a day kicking ases up there. THEY ARE THIEFS IN THE SERVICE DEPT. 

Setting them aside, Becky and i worked a deal where i could stuff the lemon and buy the Edge i was driving. She was top shelf! Best car sales person I dealt with anywhere.

The moral of my story is Becky was able to help me dump the lemon and move on. If she hadn’t, i would still be fighting with Service. ",1.0
204,"November 25, 2018","I hate buying cars. It’s a long drawn out process where half the time I don’t even drive off in the car I came in for.  Charles changed everything and was such a breath of fresh air! It all started when my husband and I were searching for a good deal on USAA where we came across a Ford Escape. It wasn’t even a minute after we clicked on the search button when the phone starts ringing with Charles on the other line ready to help us. First of all, my husband and I are very busy and Charles was the first to understand that. 

He handled EVERYTHING online for us! I was able to send him everything through email and if I needed anything I could get it done through text message. We agreed on price and told Charles we only had an hour and after that we were leaving. Charles assured us both that everything will be done at the price we discussed. At first I thought it was all fake and was waiting for the typical car sale but my husband and I decided to give Charles a shot and made what he called a “VIP Appointment” with him that afternoon. 

When we showed up, talk about FIRST CLASS SERVICE! He had the vehicle we WANTED parked up front ready for us to take home! My husband and I sat in the tv room where Charles brought everything to us! The vehicle was priced at EXACTLY what he promised us and we signed right there. After signing, Charles introduced us to Steven in service who is our go-to-guy for all our oil changes and service. After meeting Steven, we met Ben Perry in finance who was so amazing and helpful. Ben got us taken care of quickly and was very efficient. As soon as we were done, Charles was waiting for us outside with two sets of keys and taught us everything about our vehicle. 

We told Charles that we could only stay an hour but we didn’t mind spending an extra 30 minutes with him. He wanted to make sure we understood how to use our new Escape. He hooked up both my phone and my husbands and even fixed it here we could start our car with our phone! It was an amazing experience and I’ll definitely be back every time I’m ready to purchase a new Ford!

260,"June 06, 2018","Good Morning.
I wanted to let everyone know how extremely happy and satisfied I am with the high level of quality, workmanship and attention to detail that Bryan Garrison's entire Paint & Body team demonstrated on this repair.  After experiencing some damage to the front  edge of the hood and front bumper on my 2008 Shelby GT, I started researching local shops.  Ultimately, I was referred to Sam Pack's Five Star Ford by Aaron Shelby, a family friend.  From the beginning, my service adviser, Danny Campbell took fantastic care of me and my vehicle.  He assured me that his shop would work their hardest to restore my car back to its original glory.  He also kept an open line of communication throughout the entire process.  The Paint & Body team at Sam Pack's Five Star Ford - Plano provided nothing less than the world-class service I expected.  - R. Flores",5.0
261,"June 05, 2018","Everyone we worked with was professional, conversational, and willing to work with us. They genuinely fought hard to get us a great deal along with extra bonuses. We are very thankful for their dedication to their buyers!",4.8
262,"May 31, 2018",Anna was so great! She was so fast and responsive to my needs and got me a beautiful car. I began searching online that my car had been stolen. I didn’t think with my credit history that I’d have any luck or getting a car that I wanted but to my surprise the team was amazing!!! Never felt pressured or lied to and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. They even had lunch!!!! I thoroughly recommend them to any and everyone! Love my car! ,4.0
263,"May 31, 2018","I'd spent a day or two researching vehicles in the area, and after a few others fell through, we ended up at Five Star Ford as a last ditch effort. I couldn't be more happy because of it!

We were immediately greeted by an AWESOME salesman, Louis, who was very friendly and eager to help. I already knew what car I was interested in and its location on the lot, so we headed over. He promptly scanned my license and was back with the keys to the vehicle in under 5 minutes. He gave us a brief tour of the outside of the car and we headed over to the service area so that we could swap places for my test drive.

I was worried that the test drive would feel overwhelming, distracting, or a bit like a driving test, but Louis made it so easy. He highlighted all of the features of the car and guided us along the route like a pro. I immediately knew that this was the car for me and we soon returned to the dealership for the completion of my test drive.

Upon return, he began to show how everything worked, but unfortunately the trunk decided it didn't want to open. He promptly called over a member of the service department who took a look. They went ahead and ordered the part necessary to make the repair and assured me that I wouldn't need to worry about paying for the repair. 

We went inside and began working on financing paperwork, etc.. For such a stressful process, both as a first-time car buyer and just in general, Louis just made everything so easy. While the process itself did take quite a few hours, but that's partially my fault for having no credit, the time flew by due to Louis' friendly personality and great conversation. He also assisted in helping me switch my insurance and update my policy.

Finally, the financing people came by with my final paperwork. Everything was laid out perfectly, even better than previously discussed. I expected to be lucky to pay it off within 2-4 years, but I'll have the car paid off in a year with a lower payment than I anticipated, too. Erin from Finance was INCREDIBLE! A signature here, a signature there, and we were out the door! 

Louis walked us outside and my car was sitting there, ready to go! He handed me the keys and let me know they'd be in touch once the necessary part came in to repair the trunk latch and that they'd also be giving me a car wash at that time. It was Memorial Day weekend, so we did have to wait a bit, but the service department just reached out to me yesterday and I already have an appointment for 9 AM tomorrow. 

I can't recommend this dealership enough. TV, movies, etc. always amp up car dealerships to be scary places, with salesman hounding you and pushing you to spend more, which is something I was terrified of considering I knew what I wanted and what my budget was, but this was not my experience at all. I will always recommend Five Star Ford now to my friends and family. I have a feeling that I will be a customer for life. 

Thank you Louis and Erin (and everyone) for being so incredible. I love my car! ",5.0

I was skeptical before going because the car was EXACTLY what I wanted and at a price that could not be matched, and I just knew it had to be too good to be true- that there'd be some catch, and I'd leave disappointed.  Upon arriving, we were warmly greeted and shown the car immediately. Michael was knowledgeable, answered all of our questions, and walked us through the whole process. There were no surprises- I got exactly the price advertised and the staff got me the best financing possible.

328,"June 28, 2017","First off I would like to say I'm extremely thankful that Chris Sloat has returned to the dealership; he is the best service adviser I've worked with in town; including my visits for other vehicles to Honda, Lexus, and Infiniti.  Welcome back Chris!  As always, the welcome, scheduling and getting my vehicle through service was great.

What I would recommend to the ""service department"" is to pay attention to details.  Some folks like myself care for their cars appearance as much as the regular service.  We would never consider taking our vehicle through an automated wash; complete with brushes, beating straps, rouge broken spray heads, etc...  For this reason, I always request ""Please (PLEASE), no wash for my vehicle"".  Again, while some may appreciate the ""50 cent"" drive through water blast with a blow dry; not me.

For whatever reason; almost without question my vehicle ends up in line to be run through the car wash.  I often waste time outside so that I can run out and tell someone to NOT WASH.  Today I missed the line (there was no line for car wash) timing and sure enough; my truck gets run through the wash.  

I did note Chris ""having a discussion"" with someone in the back (without my complaining); which again I appreciate; but it just does not seem as though he should have to manage the part of the service experience.

Six years old, just turning 100K miles; I'm fortunate to have a truck that has little in the way of door dings or other blemishes (the sales folks often ask me for a trade in) and I'd like to keep it that way without worrying about a ? 10-15 year old car wash? machine beating and brushing.

They gave me a free oil change and detail. They filled up my gas tank and they also replaced my cabin air filter at no charge. My service rep was great and they continued to stay in touch after hearing of how bad the purchase of my vehicle had been. They stand behind their work and if something goes wrong they find a way to treat the customer right. I was shocked and impressed with how the customer service team and the Service Dept. at 5 Star Ford of Plano took care of my needs. I got a great deal on the car. A very good price for certified pre-owned. And they also have a great shuttle service with nice drivers if you do need service.

He listened to our needs and showed us the perfect car for our daughter.   We enjoyed working with Chris so much that when it was time to buy a car for my wife we didn't hesitate to go see Chris.  We drove out with a '15 Escape and my wife couldn't be happier!  Now the Focus is having some transmission issues so the next step will be Five Star Ford Service.  I hope our experience will be as good as the purchase of our vehicles.

337,"November 04, 2016","I've always been one to use a dealership for my service needs; hoping to get recommended fluids, factory parts when needed, etc...  further, manufactures and dealerships always push owners for ""qualified service""

I've been coming to five star ford before it was owned by Sam Pack and have been generally satisfied. 

Lately the time required just doesn't seem worth it any more. I sit here waiting on an oil change, inspection, and battery replacement having been told 1 - 1.5 hours. I had to inquire on the vehicle as it sat untouched in a stall for the first 1.5 hours. Getting addressed now, but will likely be 2.5+ hours to get in/out. Seems too much for routine maintenance. 

Advisor was nice enough to throw me a bone and said xxxx do the oil change for free. Nice gesture, but I'd really prefer the ability to get in and out quick. 

Is there a dealership that can keep up w customer service?  While waiting I called Bob Tomes Ford and inquired on their ""quick lane"" wait time for oil change; was told 3 hour wait!

I really feel dealers service departments should be able to keep up with their sales volumes.

419,"February 15, 2015","I visited Sam Pack's dealership in Lewisville last week and dealt with Mr. Zack Perez. He was great to work with, but the vehicle I was interested in had too many miles for me to get financing on. So, I was looking forward to visiting Sam Pack's dealership in Plano today. 

My wife and I located the pre-owned vehicle we came to the dealership to find. We went inside and were greeted by Ms. Erin Kemper. Ms. Kemper was a true blessing to deal with and she is an incredible asset to Mr. Pack's company. Ms. Kemper did an excellent job showing us the vehicle and providing answers to our questions. I felt she also took our deal seriously and presented it on our behalf to her managers.  

It just so happened that a second vehicle was traded in today and it was just what I was looking for my youngest son. An old Bronco that had some mechanical issues, but would be a great project car for me and my son to work on together. 

So the deal I offered was the asking price for the pre-owned GMC pickup and the Blue Book value of the Bronco. They had the Bronco listed at $6,900 - look up a 1993 Ford Bronco's value and see what I mean!  Plus, this Bronco had some concerns as far as mechanical problems go. 

The deal seemed good to everyone until it moved further up the chain of command. My deals were rejected and I was told that the Bronco needed to be sold at the listed price. So, in the end, we put in a lot of time and effort and left disappointed after offering an honest deal. 

I can't say enough good things about Ms. Erin Kemper and her service to us. I was afraid that possibly my position in law enforcement may have had a negative effect on the final decision maker. Otherwise, I don't understand what happened to our deal and why it was just rejected without any further effort to work out a price. ",2.5

After meeting with several other Ford dealerships in the area, this was the only experience that didn’t portray the typical ‘car buying anxiety’ in working the sales teams.    LaRay spent a late evening going through what I wanted in a new truck as well as working to get me the best value for my trade-in.    

Fast forward a couple months when I was ready to complete my purchase I called LaRay and made a point to stop in a meet with him again.   On the scheduled day LaRay had to be out of the dealership and as a result instead I met with Erin Kemper.   Talking through what I had found in local inventory we acknowledged that Five Star Ford Plano did not have the truck I was looking for.   However, I had found it through research at another dealership.   I let Erin know and planned to meet with LaRay again the following week.

As planned, I talked with LaRay late on a Wednesday and on Thursday I was driving my new F250 home.   My work schedule is very hectic and LaRay’s commitment to work with me when necessary was greatly appreciated.  In addition to getting the best sale price and best trade-in amount out of all the local Ford dealerships, the experience in working with the Five Star Plano team was second to none.   Though not my local Ford dealership I have made the decision it will be my service dealership for all future needs.   Thanks LaRay and Erin and the team at Five Star Ford Plano.

I have been actively searching for about a month and had a frustrating experience with another dealership where the deal fell apart at the last minute. I experienced the exact opposite with Five Star Ford of Plano and I had an outstanding sales person in Crystal Burtron! Buying a vehicle from across the world is a complicated matter, but she was thorough, patient, and made this process very easy. She answered all of my questions and was very accommodating; she went above and beyond of what I expect from a sales person. She sent me additional pictures of the vehicle, provided service records, and we negotiated a great price that was under my budget and about $4,000 less than what the other dealership wanted. I am very particular about details and she ensured I was a happy customer. I am unsure who the manager was I spoke with, but we discussed some minor contract revisions. He too was very accommodating and made the changes I requested with no issues. The paperwork was sent to me via UPS Express, signed and returned, and now they are even delivering the truck to my parents home for me (at a small cost). I am planning on keeping this vehicle  (F150 Platinum) for at least 10 years, but if I am ever in need of another vehicle Crystal Burtron will be my first call.

We were very particular about the vehicle that we desired for our growing family, and when we found it online at Five Star Ford we contacted them right away. Kevin Quesenberry was my initial point of contact. Right off the bat, he was very helpful, very respectful, and promptly responded to our inquiry. We were able to do a lot of the initial work of valuing our trade-in through email, which was really convenient. The thing that really set them apart, in my mind, was the way that they helped us once we arrived at the dealership. We were not able to get there before Kevin left for the day, so out of respect for him and the work that he did on our behalf, we were not planning on making a purchase until the next day when he would return to work. However, Erik ensured us that Kevin would receive credit for the sale, which he did, and Erik took great care of us the rest of the way through the purchase. We were very impressed with Erik - he even let our two year old son play with his computer mouse (which doubles as a race car). At one point, unprovoked, another staff member brought a balloon and gave it to our son, which he absolutely loved. It's these kinds of things that really set Five Star Ford apart from other dealerships that we've dealt with in the past. There are many more positive things that I could say about the staff and our experience with them, but I'll simply end my review by giving my strongest recommendation. We loved dealing with them, and will be back when the time comes to purchase another vehicle. ",5.0

I asked him about the Lincoln MKS that was on the internet and he immediately took me right to it on the parking lot.  He clearly knew the merchandise available there and the location.  He was informative about the car without being pushy, kind without being fake,  very helpful and professional.  He answered all my questions and began the paper work for my purchase.  He worked on getting me the best deal he could and called in a manager to help who was also friendly and helpful with an even better trade in price.  When I went to another individual for the closing paper work, he was exceptional also. Wow, I have never had a better car purchasing experience.  What a team!

The name of our salesman is not on any of our paperwork.   I think his name is Michael.   His initials for sure are MM and he lives in Rockwall.   He has a nice looking family.   Anyway he was very friendly, not the least bit pushy.

482,"January 06, 2014","We had the best experience possible in buying a new vehicle.
I discussed cost and quality of the Ford Escape Titanium with Erik over the phone and he was very positive and eager to answer any questions I had about the vehicle. 
Erik sent me a quote within minutes of talking and we made arrangements to meet at the delearship on the same day. He told me that the quote would not change and that the car would be ready for a test drive as soon as I got there. After having a bad experience elsewhere, I was skeptical of both comments. 
True to his word, the car was ready to go when we arrived and he showed us many of it's features and functions as we drove the Escape. Erik was knowledgeable and answered every question we had. He knew the vehicle very well and made us feel comfortable to drive it both on the street and on the highway.
Once we were back at the dealership, we were ready to discuss purchasing the vehicle. Erik gave us the same price as the quote with no hidden fees, and this was the best part of the entire experience.  We had met with several dealers and had come to expect the hidden fees and the sudden costs that were added because we didn't qualify for certain rebates. Eirk was able to get us a price that was more than reasonable and he did this without tricks or stressful pitches. He was relaxed and confident, and this made us at ease with such a large purchase.
We did get some add-ons from the friendly Butler sales woman  and insurance/add-ons from the friendly finance gentleman. We didn't do this because we felt obligated- we did it because what they said made sense. The sales team, overall, was a pleasure to work with. 
We would recommend anyone looking for a vehicle to stop by and talk to someone at 5 Star Ford.

I went in to have running boards installed, and took my contract to have it explained. I also took a newspaper advertisement from North Central Ford, advertising a 2013 F-150 Super Crew, for $22,981(the same truck I purchased). I paid $25,449, a difference of $2,468. Mr. Flatt took the advertisement, came back and proceeded to inform me he was not sure how they could offer this price.

This truck is the sixth vehicle my wife and I have purchased from your dealership. I can't help but feel like I have been taken on this most recent purchase. Instead of asking me how or what would make me feel better about overpaying for my truck, Mr. Flatt only handed me a dealer invoice sheet showing me what ""you paid for the vehicle."" 

I found it extremely insulting that this tactic of telling me you took a $700 loss was supposed to make me feel better or sorry for taking advantage of Five Star Ford in Plano. There is no way in hades, your dealership paid $32,935 less hold back net costs of $1036, making the actual cost to your dealership $31,899 for my truck.

I am extremely upset at my most recent purchase and I will unfortunately have to service my vehicles at your dealership until they are paid off, but this will be the extent of our relationship.

At first, their customer service seemed to be above par.  I had made appointment with a used car salesman to look at, test drive and hopefully purchase (cash/trade-in) a 2005 Honda Civic LE Coupe for my daughter.  First, he ensured the car was still available, then he went and looked at it for me and rated it an 8+.  I felt like I had found the perfect car for my daughter, because it was a 1-owner coupe with low miles and was within our budget.  I told him that it would be around 7:30 P.M. before we could get there, because my wife didn't get off of work until 5:30 P.M. and it was a 1 to 1 1/2 hour drive in rush hour traffic.  He informed me that his colleague had a client that was scheduled to look at the same car around the same time and asked if I wanted to hold the car with a $500 NON-REFUNDABLE deposit.  I declined since I was unemployed and couldn't afford to give $500 away to a car dealership, in case we couldn't reach a deal.  At 6:15 pm, we were on our way to Five Star Ford.  At 7:00 pm, the salesman calls to inform us that his colleague's client had rescheduled their appointment for the following day.  I let him know that was good news and that we should arrive the dealership, at 7:30 pm.  At 7:20 pm, 20 minutes later and a few miles from the dealership, he informs us that the car was sold.  He began with a slight chuckle, what I assume were nerves, which only made the situation worse, because we had high hopes that this trip to Five Star Ford would put an end to our 4 week long search for a used car.  A range of emotions came over us, because we couldn't believe the dealership would treat customers that way, especially after having them drive an 1 1/2 in rush hour traffic. The next day I called and spoke to the Director of Sales who was aware of the situation and offered his apologies.  He informed me that the problem was caused by a breakdown in communications.  All along I wondered why the dealership couldn't have made an effort to contact me instead of me contacting them.

505,"September 02, 2013",Terrible customer service when trying to buy a new truck. I visited this dealer 3 times. Only once didn't anyone bother talking to me. When the new sales guy came to talk to me he had no interest in selling me anything (not really sure why he works there if he doesn't want to sell). He couldn't answer most of my basic questions about the truck and was very standoffish. Seemed like he was more interested in me leaving so he could go back inside in the Air Conditioning. ,1.0
506,"August 30, 2013","Jose Campos, Sales Consultant was extremely knowledgeable, professional and very pleasant to work with during the buying process of our new F150 Platinum.  Actually, we have been treated very well as respected customers by everyone we have encountered at Five Star Ford Plano thus far.  We began the buying process over the internet via the dealer’s website and all the details on pricing, rebates and specs for the vehicle were well disclosed up front prior to us arriving at the dealership for a test drive.  Two other dealers did not disclose all the details in my interactions with them via their internet.  Actually they overstated the discounts/rebates in order to get me to the dealership.   It was very deceptive and disappointing.  That was NOT the case with Five Star Ford of Plano and Jose Campos.  Working with Jose and Five Star was all very straight forward from the start all the way through taking delivery of our new F150.  ",4.8

Everyone was very friendly and professional. I highly recommend this dealership. The only complaint that I have is that our monthly payments were never discussed until we already made the deal. We loved the car and we knew it was in our price range so we were going to get it anyway. It would have been nice to have a little more communication about the price and monthly payments more for my peace of mind. But don't let that stop you from visiting and seeing what they have to offer. Everything else was superb.",4.8
509,"August 02, 2013","I was excited to see that Sam Packs in Plano had a older Toyota 4Runner listed online at a great price. I called on the morning of 7/27/13 to ensure the car was still available before making the long drive. I spoke to Chase Hall (I believe I'm correct on his name, he isn't listed in their website). He said he would check and call me back. Sure enough, a few minutes later he did and informed me the truck was still there and that he would make sure it was out front when I arrived. I told him where I was coming from and when I should be there. I made the long drive (130 miles, taking 2 hours and fourteen minutes, per MapQuest).

When I arrived, he informed me someone else was closing a deal on it.......... I wasn't upset with them for selling it; that's what they do. I hadn't signed anything, paid a dime, or put down a deposit. From that standpoint, they did nothing wrong. What I was upset about is that the salesman didn't call me to inform me that it had sold. Remember, he had to call me back when I was checking to see if they still had it. He had my cell number and knew how far I was coming from to look at it. If the buyers were already working on paperwork, the sale hadn't just happened when I pulled up.

Because he didn't bother to inform me, I spent four and a half hours driving (a total of 262 miles) for nothing (and paid tolls on the Bush Turnpike). I'm at least thankful it was a Saturday morning; traffic was light. Maybe they this is a great dealer to purchase from and/or get service done. I can only speak to my limited (but negative) experience. I will say that, if the 4Runner drove as expected, they had it listed at a steal of a price (it was exceptionally clean for it's age). ",2.8
510,"July 30, 2013","I had told Erik Faulds, one of the Internet Managers, that I have been a long time Chrysler-Dodge customer and my last 6 cars/SUV's have been Chrysler or Dodge. Plus, I am a long time customer of Huffines. My intent on getting a new SUV was to purchase one with lower MPG than I was getting from my 2008 Dodge Durango with the 5.7L V-8 Hemi. I was also seriously looking at the Chevy Equinox or GMC Terrain, but needed something that could pull my 3,000 lbs. boat. Was about to purchase a 2013 Chevy Equinox with a 3.6L V-6, but had a very bad ""haggling"" experience with the Sales Manager at Huffines. So I walked out with the intent to purchase from another dealership. In the meantime, I started looking a little more closer at all of the FORD products, and especially the Explorer. Found the Explorer I liked with the XLT package and the ability to tow 5,000 lbs., and wanted to see what kind of price I could get for the 2014 that Five Star Ford Plano had in stock. That is when I got an email and call from Erik Faulds. Pricing looked really good, but I wanted to test drive and I had not one trade-in but two. If I like the Explorer, and I was able to work something out with my trade-ins, then I was ready to buy. To keep this short, let's just say that Erik and the Team at Five Star Ford Plano came through for me in a big way. They got me everything that I asked for, and got me out of a bad situation. I went to finance with Ken Fields and even had a ""Blank Check"" from Capital One, but Ken got me a better deal and saved me even more $$. Very excited about my new 2014 Ford Explorer XLT, and very impressed with the efforts from Erik and group at Five Star Ford Plano. Looking forward to a very long term relationship now with Ford and Five Star Ford.",5.0

A few minutes after our arrival we were greeted by Brian. Brian discussed our various options then turned us over to Jeff Blake. Jeff set us up in a F150 Platinum and reviewed all the features on the F150.
We drove the F150 for a couple of days then returned to the dealership with the F150 Platinum. 
I had not told Brian I would be coming in but within a few minutes of my arrival I was greeted by Jim Burmeister, Jim Passmore and Donnie Harmdierks. I explained that I had come over on Sunday and looked at the various F150's and wanted to take a closer look at a Lariot I spotted on the lot.
Donnie brought the Lariot up for my wife, Jeannie, and I to look at and drive if we wanted to. Donnie reviewed the various features and ask if we had any questions or if we wanted to take the Lariot to drive. I told him I just needed to think about it. I spoke again with Jim Burmeister about the advantages of the Platinum compared to the Lariot. I left the lot telling them I would be in touch the next day.
I let them know I wanted the Platinum and Jeff called me to ask whyen I wanted to come get it. I picked my new F150 Platinum up that afternoon and once again Jeff covered all aspects of F150 and told me about the service department and other services at Five Star.
I met with Ken Fields to sign the 400 documents, or it seemed like that many, and Ken made the process painless.

518,"May 26, 2013","Why was I satisfied at 5 Star Ford of Plano with my new truck purchase; ? Because other dealership salesman like Grapevine Ford and Carrollton Ford wanted to play the 2-3 hour game of cat and mouse with back and forth price negotiating! A consumer's time is valuable.  Also, as a credit worthy consumer or a consumer with 50% down payment in my case that is presented & known upfront to a salesman, I should expect a serious professional bottom line price that is acceptable to the dealer within 5 minutes of a sit down to committ to purchase.  

Plano Ford Internet Sales Crystal Brutron & Director Jeremy did just that! I made an offer on exactly what I wanted and how I wanted it and I got the most straight forward acceptable dollar counter offfer rebuttal that was very close within 3 minutes with a rationale of why on their bottom line. .  It was truly a ""no haggle"" experience!  Furthermore, I wanted a few features on my vehicle that were not on the lot & the sales person was perceptive & keen enough so say ; ""we'll build it for you!"" yuup, just like you want it with the same factory/dealer incentive money. No other dealer offered that!  Locating was offered with negative results, but Crystal said, let us build it!  Everyone there was laid back.  The finance department did me right by explaining the Ford Motor Credit Finance incentive money workings and fairly sold me a 6 year 100,000 extended warranty.  

The parts department too was fair on accessory pricing and install..

The treatment I recieved more than compensated for the fact that the Dealership itself needs updating.  The carpet is out dated, soiled, torn and worn.  But the atmosphere of the staff made it like home!  They could use a free pop corn machine.

521,"May 14, 2013","I brought my Mustang GT in for service.  The car was diagnosed with a sensor problem on the first visit but the part was not in stock.  I noticed excessive mileage driven while the vehicle was in their possession.  I did not bring this to their attention.  But while the vehicle was in their possession, they damaged the driver door.  I took my vehicle back for the door repair, at their cost, while the sensor was to be replaced.  This is where the problems began.  First, the door repair was very sloppy, the paint was rough and had runs in it.  I requested the work to be redone.  It was redone but it still had some small quality issues with the work since the contour of the door was still not per the original.  Second, I noticed that vehicle was missing 1/4 tank of gas and the mileage driven was over 100 miles.  I am positive of the fuel and mileage of the car since it is a garage low mileage vehicle.  I asked why there was so much mileage and gas used on the vehicle and was told that they have to run the car ""some"".  I stated that I beleived that this car was running excessive, especially since the problem was already diagnosed on the first visit,.  I believe that quite possibly my vehicle was out driven for a joy ride.  My reason is that 100 miles is a lot of miles to test drive a vehicle especially since they had already tested the vehicle during the intial diagnosis visit.  Of course the servcie manager and I never agreed to agree.  I will never use this dealer for service or body work again.  One final point, I took a previous Mustang to this dealer for paint work and when I picked it after they were done with the job, the courtesy driver that brought my car to me did a 'burnout' with me standing right there looking at him.  Obviously, he didn't see me.  I made him go and tell his manager what he did with my car but I told the manager that he didn't need to be fired.  The body shop manager was very apologetic.

 I pulled in and met with service advisor Thomas Bellah. Explained what I needed, he took the car back to have the techs look at it so that we could get it ordered. I was not planning on actually getting this fixed today and was in kind of a rush, because I needed to get to work.

I was being a little difficult with him because I knew they were busy, and I really did not want to have to wait.

Tom is being very understanding and patient with me the whole time, says he will go get my car for me so that I can go. I am standing there waiting, and other service advisors are checking on me to make sure that Tom is taking care of me.

553,"December 21, 2012","I was very impressed witht the manner by which this purchase was addressed! Right down to the smallest detail staff was on top of all activities associated with this purchase. 
I was particularly impressed with Corey White keeping me in the loop. I never had to guest or wonder as to the status of the delivery of my vehicle. 

AS you are aware, the Fusion Hybrid is a technological advanced automobile and, as such, requires a great deal of technical knowledge to operate. Corey was able to explain all operating functions of the car with ease - no guessing!

The General Manager, Brian Huth, set the ground work for this transaction and made sure that staff operated within these parameters. Without his direction this purchase would probably have not gone as smoothly as it did.

Overall, staff exceeded my expections with respect to their actons in consumating this purchase. 

Thank you for a great job! Gail Brooks

568,"October 19, 2012","In my online search for a new car, I found the perfect model waiting for me at Five Star Ford. I requested an eQuote through their site and immediately received a call from Joe Bethel with Internet Sales. He quoted me a lower price than what was listed online, which was already the best deal going with all Manufacturers and Dealerships out there, so I made an appointment to go check it out in person. After driving the car, we sat down to go over the price he quoted me and found he was willing to take even more off the price. I didn't even have to ask or haggle! Joe made the deal effortless and in no time I was in the Finance office signing for my new car. I was in and out in an hour and a half. By far, this was the fastest car deal I've had. I have purchased a lot of vehicles in my life but would say without a doubt that working with Joe and the rest of the Five Star Ford team was the best experience I have ever had!

Joe took us in the office, took our offer for approval, 10 minutes later returned to say it was rejected.  We stood firm, thanked Joe and left.  We visited two other dealers and learned quickly that the best offer was with Joe at Sam Pack.  We returned to Sam Pack, Joe showed us their invoicing and an Edmunds report on the value of the truck.  The value was $2000 below a trade-in value for the truck.

572,"October 05, 2012","!!!!!!!!!!!!WARNING!!!!!!!!!! I was in the process of buying a 2006 Infiniti qx56 listed for $20,945 using my 2004 Cadillac escalade as I trade in. My car nada value is $10,000 for fair trade in, they were giving me $6,250 for it with a $5,000 deposit. When I got there the salesman told me walk in price was $23,000 but it was clearly posted for $20,945 on the window sticker. It had a funny noise when it started, had a mechanic look at it said it was a timing chain tensioner need to be replaced ($1,400 parts&labor) so the used car manager dropped the price to $16,995. So I decided to do the deal, bad idea!!!! After having the car for a few days I noticed a funny rumble comming from the rear of the suv. Had crest Infiniti check it out and said it has a leak and if not fixed soon it can cost $2,500+ to fix. I told five star ford about it and said its a used car and is sold as is and that they need more bank statements for financing. I had given them 3 months bank statements and blacked out my account number bc I don't want anyone trying to spend my hard earned money. The finance manager Jeff told me he needs my account number and I said no, he told me he would not do the deal unless he had the account number. I told him that's fine that I would bring the truck in on Saturday and he said that's fine.  So I get home that night w my wife and 5 children and after dinner I went out side to get my 8 month olds formula and baby food out of the diaper bag in the suv and the truck was gone. When I asked my wife if she was playing a joke our daughter told us that a strange car kept driving around. I called jeff and asked him why they came and picked it up and never even knocked on the door or called to tell me he said its not his consern. My wife had wrecked her car a few days prior to this and the ins. co. was in the process of fixing it so the Infiniti qx56 was our only transportation since I used our other suv for the trade in. We have 5 kids, 2 of which are in car seats which were in the qx56 when they picked it up. This dealer ship left me and my family stranded at our own home!

Paul patiently helped me through several visits I made to the dealership, always answering my questions, never being pushy. Paul was always there to serve the customer. One day when he was helping another customer, Paul asked Ken (the Used Car Manager) to help me and Ken was a great experience as well. It was primarily because of these two and their customer service that I purchased my F-150 Lariet. Prior to making the decision to buy this vehicle, I'd spent two weeks and about 40 hours visiting dealerships and test-driving 10-12 vehicles. So, I had a pretty good grasp of what I wanted and I'd had a lot of exposure to varying dealerships and sales representatives.

Paul and Ken are great when it comes to product knowledge and customer service, both of which are far more important to me in the long run that just price.
I highly recommend Paul, Ken and 5-Star Ford in Plano.

Shandon even got us a loan car for a few days while we waited for a new car to be ready.  David Geary helped us with a few dealer added options to take care of our car that we had not thought about but am glad he suggested them.

At the end of the day you want to buy from people that aren't trying to just sell you a car but help you get the vehicle that you want at a price you can afford.

I will always come to Crystal first with my car needs in the future - I plan to buy another Ford Explorer in the next 1 - 2 years. In short, Crystal is a role model for how car sales should be approached, and she is the reason I chose Five Star over Bankston for my car purchase.

We test drove multiple Mustangs, discussed the different financial incentives at length, and I never felt a hard push to make a decision I wasn't comfortable with.  He was always friendly and candid which I greatly appreciate.  Jim Burmeister met with me each time I visited the dealership which really reiterated how involved the entire team is when customers walk through the door.  I was beyond impressed when Jim mentioned that I could qualify for a discount just because of where I work.  Knowing that kind of partnership exists will definitely send me and my friends back to Five Star Ford for future vehicles.

When it came time to purchase my Mustang, Gary was terrific in outlining all the additional coverages available, as well as walking me step by step through the purchase/finance agreement.  Thanks to his help, I know exactly where how we ended up at our final price.

In general I was hard pressed to find a dealership that compared.  I test drove all the major competitors' vehicles and discovered that (A) none of their vehicles could compare to the value I got with my new 5.0 mustang and (B) the shopping experience wasn't nearly as positive as what I got at Five Star Ford of Plano.

I can't reiterate enough how much I enjoyed my experience and working with the gentlemen listed above.  Every step of the process was seamless and I'm so happy with my new car.  I'm really lucky that there's a company in town that not only caters to high performance vehicles (I love my 5.0 GT!) but is also professional, friendly and extremely outgoing.

604,"February 15, 2012","As I said before most people dread going to purchase a car.  A few weeks before I purchased my Expedition I came into 5 Star to test ride a F150 and a Expedition.  Jason Graham was the person that helped me out. At the time I was driving a 2008 Chevy Avalanche. I want to let you know I liked that truck.  He thoughly went over both vehicles.  We also talked about the Chevy's that were out there now. Never pushy. On the F150 we ended up test driving the General managers truck because 5 Star did not have any of the F150's that I was looking for on the lot.  Obviously, you guys are selling a lot of trucks.  Both vehicles drove great.  Electronics in both and what Ford was offering was very impressive. I was concerned about length of vehicle.  I wanted the F150 with that ECO boost engine.  Very impressive information from Jason and the video concerning pulling capability and gas mileage.  Side note that engine needs to be in the Expedition also.  Well the F150 was almost 13 inches longer than my Avalanche.  It would not fit in my garage.  I was not sure about the Expedition.  I shook Jason's hand and said I would think about it.  A few weeks later I came in on Saturday with my wife.  We talked to Jason about my concerns about the Expedition. Reminder, I really wanted the F150 but it was to long.  He showed me an Expedition EL.  We drove that.  I loved the drive and it was actually just a hair shorter than my Avalanche.  He allowed me to take to my house in Plano and it fit better in the my garage than my truck.  We then figured out the model I wanted with all the things that I was looking for.  You did not have one on the lot.  He found one in the Metroplex and would try to get it that day.  I told him Monday was fine.  I came back on Monday finalized price and trade in.  In all it took half the time that it taken to purchase my last two Chevy trucks.  I have told others of my experince of purchasing a vehicle.  Hopefully, Jason and 5Star will get some business from it.

605,"February 14, 2012","David was very helpful; explained the basics of the new Escape during a walk-around and drive (many differences from the 1996 Explorer with 214,000 miles I traded). He and the credit manager I worked with were both outstanding representatives for 5 Star Ford.

Additional note: 2 people in my office had purchased vehicles from 5 Star in the last year and highly recommened them....another reason I shopped here.",5.0
606,"February 13, 2012",My experience with 5 Star Ford of Plano was extremely easy & they were very informative. Michael & Jim helped me to find the best option for me in a truck. I have typically been driving a F-250 and the new F-150 EcoBoost looked like a great option for me. I am extremely satisfied. Brian also reviewed several different options for me in regards to buying -vs- leasing. This was very informative and allowed me to make the right decision for me. Thanks Again for everyone's help.,5.0
607,"February 10, 2012","I had been looking at Ford Explorers for my son, and saw another one at your store in the paper, I pulled up your web site and found the one we bought. I called and got Corey, and he went out to make sure the vehicle was actually there ( I had a bad experience along these lines at Ford Country in Lewisville) He called back within five minutes, to say yes it was there. We came over, and were greeted at the door by a very friendly gentelman, and directed to Corey. We had to wait until Monday to finalize everything, and had a bit of a problem with finding financing, but Corey kept me up to date with all that was happening, via email. My son loves the truck, and hope it gives him good service for a long time. Thank you for caring enough to follow up.

608,"February 07, 2012","As soon as we pulled up, Paul was walking out.  We came in looking for a car that was sold earlier that afternoon.  Paul tried to find a car that would meet our price range, and did more than that!!! He exceeded our expectations and found the P-E-R-F-E-C-T Car for me.  He made everything so easy, and did not pressure me like most car salesman.  He was honest, easy to talk to, and so helpful in making everything work out to meet our budget.  He was wonderful, along with the rest of his crew who drew up all the paperwork and had us walking out the door with a BEAUTIFUL car in less than an hour.

609,"February 05, 2012","Having thought long and hard about acquiring a Mustang, I went to Sam Pack's Five Star Ford.  I'm very old-school about things like customer service and quality of products and was completely impressed with all of the gentlemen who helped me at this dealership.  After test-driving a couple of vehicles, Mike found the one that truly satisfied my soul.  Then he went to bat for me and got a reasonable trade in on my used vehicle.  He kept the whole process easy and pleasant, introduced me to various people at the dealership that I would be coming into contact with, and made sure I was well taken care of.  When I went back a couple of days later for the Sync class and to get the windows of the Mustang tinted, I was delighted to have some time with Kevin who showed me hands-on how to use the nifty features of my new car (that's how I learn best!)  Kevin and I had a long talk about customer service and how important it is to any business.  Thomas got my window tinting done beautifully and I didn't have to sit around after the class and wait for it to get done.  I just couldn't be any happier with my total experience at Five Star and would send any of my family or friends there.  As a matter of fact, my sister bought a Fiesta there a few months ahead of me and she's the one who referred me there!  ",5.0

611,"January 30, 2012","Went in to get some information.  David Denton gave me all the information I asked for without any pressure to buy.  He asked me about the price range and loan terms I wanted.  I made it clear to him that I was only looking for information at the time because I wanted to save for a bigger down payment to lower my monthly payment.  He knew that I was very interested in a used car on the lot and asked if I would be willing to buy the car that day if he could get me the terms I wanted with no money down.  I said, ""Yes,"" and after a few minutes, he came back with an offer that met my terms.  Within 3 hours, I had the car that I wanted with the loan payment terms I wanted for a better price than I thought was possible.  Gary Scott also sold me on the warranty that I was dead set against because I have had bad experiences with high costs and low coverage before.  He sold me the extended warranty that I wanted at the price I wanted to pay.  Great car-buying experience!",5.0
612,"January 17, 2012","Buying a car from a dealership is about their people.  With Jim Burmeister it was like buying a car from a life long friend.  Jim searched and found me the exact truck I wanted, there was no uncomfortable negotiation at all, he told me what the dealership could sell the car for, and explained to me what add on's (extended warrantee, etc) I should buy.  Being a 30 year VP of Sales I appreciated his easy going, down to earth nature.  As long as Ford has a car I want...I wouldn't buy it from anyone but Jim.  Being a manager Jim had Tim Grinolds handled many of the details.  Tim was extremely friendly and helpful as well.  Great buying experience, all my family and friends will be encouraged to use Jim!

I felt my needs were respected and there were no ""deatlership games"".  I got a very good price, incorporating Ford Corp allowances and dealer discounts.

David Denton has integrity, knows his cars, takes ownership of his customers, and is a pelasure to do business with.",4.6
627,"November 21, 2011","Even the General Manager ignores the customer at this Ford dealership.  With so many Ford dealerships in Dallas Fort Worth I would suggest to avoid Five Star Ford in Plano at all cost.

To start, the dealership is in horrible disrepair.  The showroom, is dark and musty.  It looks more like a used car dealership slinging beat up PT Cruisers. The carpet was torn and stain from what I assume were leaking vehicles. This place is a far cry from a business I want to spend $20K with.  However, I do have to give them credit.  They way they present the dealership is accurate with the service you will receive. 

My Ford F-150 has a very simple problem...the brakes moan and squeak.  Everyone has experienced this in their car, a Ford or not.  It happens and it is a very easy problem to fix.  My truck is still under the manufacturer's warranty so I contacted Five Star Ford of Plano to have this problem corrected.  Unfortunately, it was all downhill as soon as I pulled in the service bay.  In order to get a work order started I had to track someone down to help me.  I explained my problem and I was told, it could take up to two days to hear anything back.  There's the second sign.  When I asked why so long to just hear back, he just said ""I'm backed up.""  

I received a call the next day.  Under promise and over deliver!  Nice!  Turns out they did nothing for my brakes.  I was told that they could not do anything for me and that my truck was operating under ""normal Ford specifications.""  It is obvious that common sense is not employed at Five Star Ford, because if it was then if my truck was ""operating under normal Ford specifications"" why would I bring it in?  Free coffee?  Nothing better to do?  I need someone to talk to?  I contacted the Service Manager and he was of less help.  He told me ""with 34,000 miles on your truck, there's not much we can do for you.""  He obviously forgot that Ford has a 36,000 mile warranty so kindly reminded him.  We went back and forth and he refused to help any further.  Ford has set the minimum for ""Ford specification"" and it is Five Star Ford of Plano's decision weather to commit to the minimum or go above and beyond to keep their customers for life.  They are 100% committed to being the minimum.  So I contacted the General Manager via email six days from this post and I still have not heard back.  Now, my simple, simple brake problem has been turned into a much larger issue because no one at Five Star Ford of Plano gives a shit about their customer or their product. 

I leave you with this...if the Service Manager and the General Manager (people in leadership roles) refuse to properly service or acknowledge their clients why would anybody else in their dealership do any better.  Great example of lead by example, because no one there cares.",1.3
628,"November 15, 2011","We are a repeat customer to Five Star Ford.  Our previous experience was great, so we returned to work another deal with Andrew on a new car.

He helped us with both deals on both of our cars and made the finance paperwork very easy and speedy.  Much appreciated from these two folks.",5.0
629,"November 15, 2011","Tyrone and Joeseph were very professional and informative. They did a great job of explaining everything to me about the features of and available options on the F150.

Rick Glover, the finance manager I worked with, was straightforward with my wife and me.  He also made us feel comfortable with the process.  He explained every option very thoroughly and the prices were all fair.

Tom Bella, a services manager, helped me with getting my Fusion tinted.  The first tint job bubbled a little in three windows.  Tom asked me to bring in the car to have it totally redone.  At that time, he provided me with a car to drive so I was not inconvenienced by the tint redo.

656,"July 13, 2011","My Focus stalled on the way to work and I had it towed to Five Star Ford of Plano on Thursday morning to be repaired.  The tow truck took it in at 8:30 in the morning and it sat outside until after 5:00 p.m., at which point Greg Hampton, service advisor, phoned me and left a message stating that they had just moved my vehicle into the shop with a forklift.  Friday I was unable to receive an update on my vehicle due to failure to reach Mr. Hampton.  I got voicemail every time I called.  By Saturday I was still unable to reach him.  He was off work and the tech assigned to my car was also off work and nobody at the shop knew anything about my car.  The notes in the computer just said, ""Disabled vehicle.""  Monday morning...again, I could not contact Mr. Hampton.  At lunch time I finally learned through a third party that they had diagnosed the car as having a dead battery and possibly a bad alternator and was given an estimate for repair that was high because he claimed that the axle had to be removed to reach the alternator.  I had it towed to a different shop because it all sounded fishy and the lack of being able to reach anyone for information had me concerned.  At the other shop it was quickly discovered that my ignition was locked.  When Mr. Hampton was phoned to ask why that wasn't mentioned to myself, the tow truck company or the shop I sent my car to, he stated that they it was working fine at his shop...that he personally had turned my key and put the car in neutral to push it into the shop.  Funny...not what they had told me about how my car got into the shop and my car is a STANDARD so you don't need to turn the key to put it into neutral.  When he was called out on this fact, Mr. Hampton UNPROFESSIONALLY said, ""Good luck with that."" and hung up the phone.  The new shop diagnosed my car correctly....the positive battery cable had an issue which impacted the battery.  I only needed the battery and the cable replaced and since there was one in my vehicle trunk they used that.   The alternator was not impacted and they told me that the alternator is on top and there is NO NEED to remove the axle to reach it if it ever does need to be replaced.  Hmmmm....so the labor on this job would not be so much if it is not as difficult as Mr. Greg Hampton stated.  The lack of integrity and professionalism he displayed was highly upsetting to me.  Trust is something you EARN with proper treatment of customers as well as honest repair.  Customers should be able to reach someone at a shop when their vehicle is in the shop.  You don't earn trust by handling business in this manner.  To have someone of this character representing the company is shameful.  I hate to think about how many others have been treated in this manner and remained quiet.   I am highly disappointed with the way this was handled.  By the way,  I had the tow truck billed through Five Star Ford of Plano and was charged $114.75 for this when the car was within 2 miles of them.  Towing from Five Star Ford of Plano to the shop in Lewisville was only $91.  Wondering why such a big difference exists when the second tow was 20 miles.......  Do your homework and take your car to a reputable and HONEST dealer and not this place.  If you must take it there....I do not recommend that you deal with Greg Hampton. ",1.0

660,"June 28, 2011","Purchased a Boss 302 from 5 Star Ford in Plano.  Corey White was my Sales Representative.    I had called Corey based on an e-mail I received stating that they might have the vehicle I was looking for.     From the start, Corey was extremely attentive to my needs and got all of my questions answered.   We had a verbal agreement on the vehicle within 2 phone calls.

It is very apparent that Corey is a car guy.  His knowledge of the vehicles was deep and he truly cared that my needs, questions, etc were addressed.   As a car guy myself, I find it a great relief that I was dealing with someone who understood where I was coming from and not just shooting sales jargon at me.

I see Corey as a great resource for 5 Star in Plano and have recommended my friends contact him when looking for a new performance vehicle from Ford.

Overall the dealer was very friendly.  Corey took me to meet each of the people I dealt with on the phone as well as all the managers.   Definitely made me feel at-home there.

Financing (Bryan) was very helpful and found a better rate then I had walked in with.

I sure wish 5 Star was closer to Denver!

Thanks again to Corey and 5 Star for my new Boss 302!",5.0

663,"June 21, 2011","Eric and Rick made this experience as easy as the could. The time crunch I had around getting to work and then test driving made the crunch even worse. Rick made the financiing aspect simple. RIck gave me the best price and got me approved. Eric was very knowledgable around the vehicel I wanted and the one I was trading in. He showed me the trade in process and the value of my Truck. this was i nice clear way of doing business with out all the back and forth BS at most dealerships. (just give me the best price and the best terms and they didnt waste anyones time!)this was a nice experience all the way around. Just the way I like it!
Make sure to tell them both thank you from me.",5.0
664,"June 14, 2011",Joe did a great job differentiating the various models I was interested in.  he listened to my interests and needs and found the right solution.  I felt the pricing and trade-in process was fair and left the dealership without any remorse over the purchase.  Joe even got my wife excited over a new F150 Lariat when all I've heard about for years was her desire to buy a Honda Ridgeline!,5.0
665,"June 13, 2011",My first communication was online and I went in to follow up in person. The first person I met was Tyrone and we went for a test drive and did the deal in record time.  Very nice folks to do business with!,5.0
666,"June 05, 2011","Our experience with Chase was excellent.  He was professional, polite, knowledgeable and worked to help us get the Edge with the equipment we wanted.  The finance manager was also helpful, explained everything and was easy to work with.  I hate the car buying experience but overall this was the best experience I have had.  My husband enjoys the ""negotiating"" - I don't - but this was not what I had experienced in the past.  That is why I gave you a good rating and would recommend the dealership.

Now for the facilities.  As I said in my earlier survey attention needs to be given to the condition of the showroom floor.  The carpet is shabby, the offices with the large aluminum wrapped air conditioning coils do not make a good impression.  You are selling a quality product and your facilities.  Customers are swayed by impressions and perceptions.  If the dealership looks shabby then they don't equate the product with quality.  I would hope that Mr. Pack would devote some money to re-furbishing the dealership.  Make the offices customer and salesmen friendly.  ",5.0
667,"June 01, 2011","My salesman, Chase Hall, was very professional and courteous.  He did not hit me with any sleazy sales tactics that I have run into at other dealerships.  I am completely satisfied that I received the best possible deal on my new F150.  The finance manager, Rick Glover, also did a great job of simply informing me of warranty and aftermarket options, without any hard-sell games.  These gentlemen provided me a great experience, contrary to what I was prepared for from my experience at other dealerships.  I will definately recommend these people to my friends and family.",5.0
668,"May 27, 2011","The sales person, Michael Clayton, was a pleasure to work with.  He handled all my needs, was prompt returning calls and made sure he went above and beyond after the sale.  Everything was done without a lot of pressure including the financing.  The price was negotiated and there were no ""hidden costs.""  I also drive a F-150 so this makes two Fords for my household.  This will be my future dealer for all my Ford needs!",5.0
669,"May 16, 2011","The sales experience was great, however the radiator on my brand new Escape did not work and had to be replaced.  This was very inconvenient and disappointing.  I'm just glad I noticed it over-heating before it became an even bigger issue.  I think they should replace the vehicle in case there is lasting damage!

670,"May 16, 2011","The best dealership I have dealt with. 
Your employees made the buying experience easy and pleasureable. I Would highly reccomend and purchase again.
From start to finish and sign up, it was an enjoyable buying experience. I came into the dealership with a sheet listing the Explorer options and codes of everything I wanted on the car. Jim took the sheet and came back in about 5 minutes with an offer which we negotiated to a price comfortable for both of us. Took about 6 weeks for delivery and after pickup, I couldn't be happier. 
Look forward to the service experience too.",5.0
671,"May 14, 2011","The customer service was great.  I decided to go to this particular dealership because my mother was buying a car from Tom Bellah, and she recommended him to me.  He was extremely friendly and really helped me out with the whole process.  He is extremely knowledgable when it comes to the car business.  I feel that if I went to anyone else, I would not have gotten as good of a deal on my car.",5.0

David was very helpful and truly wanted to put me in a vehicle that was best for my new family.  David also made sure that he worked with me on pricing and had everything done and ready for me to drive off the lot when I arrived the next day.,5.0

674,"May 04, 2011","The overall experience was exceptional. The only reason for not giving a 5 across the board is for the QoW section as there was a slight issue with the tires. This was more mechanical and not related to the sales team. It was also on me, as the customer, to ensure I was fully satisfied prior to leaving. Only one tire was replaced instead of both causing an uneveness in the ride but I did not thoroughly follow up on both tires prior to leaving. 
In general, outstanding sales team and by far, the least pressured I have ever felt at a dealership. No hassles or badgering. Just straight, to the point information without beating around the bush. 
Great Job.

675,"April 26, 2011","I had a very good experience with Five Star Plano, Rob Groves was great. My only negative was that the dealership was so busy on Saturday morning when I went to pick up my vehicle that I didn't get very much info as I had not seen the vehicle prior to Saturday morning. That was not anyone's fault, in fact it is great for the dealership that they were so busy.

I would not hesitate to go back there to buy another vehicle or recommend the dealership to others.   ",4.6
676,"April 08, 2010","Recently I took my car for a bumper repair. The service manager Keith appeared to be a good and reliable man, so decided to get the repairs done there. Repair itself was average. I had to work with them to get glue off and put the bezels better.

After the repairs, went there to pick up the car. As the rental agency is not on the premise, I had to park the car, when I went to return the rental. When I came back noticed that the rear door on driver's side had a big dent. We had inspected the car just before and there were none.

They park dealer cars/trucks next and there is no separate area for customers themselves to park safely. There were 2 trucks parked on either side and it was clear it was door from one of the trucks that did the damage.

Spoke to Keith. He completely denied that they were responsible and would not pay. This dealership hires others that do dent work to come in and repair. He told me to contact them directly. I insisted that they pay at least half. Then when the repairer came in he spoke to the guy inside and came up with an exorbitant amount of which half he would pay. Even half of the amount was much higher than what cost me when I got the work done with another repairer directly.

THIS DEALERSHIP USED TO BE RODEO FORD AND GOT CLOSED DOWN. PROBABLY FOR A GOOD REASON.

UNLESS YOU NEED MORE DAMAGES ON YOUR VEHICLE THAN YOU WENT IN WITH, DO NOT GO TO THIS DEALERSHIP FOR REPAIRS.",1.8
