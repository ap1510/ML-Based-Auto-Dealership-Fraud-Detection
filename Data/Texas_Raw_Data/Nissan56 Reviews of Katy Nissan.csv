However, didn’t realize that we have the VEHICLE CARE PLAN , and got charged for the service. I didn’t mention it, thought would be “on file” in my account in your system.

24,"September 17, 2019","Scheduling service on my vehicle has been frustrating since the dealership changed from AutoNation.  Turns out the online scheduling isn't accurate and the service technician that was randomly chosen is no longer with the dealership.  When I arrived for my ""scheduled"" appointment and mentioned that I had an appointment with the specified service tech from online, I was looked at like I was crazy.  Not a good start.  There is also not a good system for taking customers in order of arrival.  It has been frustrating the past two times I have been for service. I can say that Roger was good to work with once I was acknowledged.

If the online system is not accurate or used TAKE IT DOWN.",3.4

33,"August 23, 2019","Chad Ford with Katy Nissan made my week! I had a HORRIBLE experience with another Nissan dealer in town off 610 two days prior where they tried to pressure me to buy on the spot and then tried to force me to pay more 2 days later and then hung up on me when I told them I would only pay the original amount we agreed to. Chad followed up with me, matched their price no questions asked, and had it ready for us when we showed up. Great customer service. Will definitely return for my next Nissan purchase. ",5.0

45,"July 24, 2019","My wife and I was shopping around for a Murano and basically called every dealership in Houston. We got the runaround from every dealership except Katy Nissan. My wife told them on the phone that we wanted to be in and out in an hour or so and their very best price. When we got to the dealership, we took the car that she chose for a ride, returned and our paperwork was basically waiting for us. No pressure or hassle. I definitely recommend Katy Nissan. This is our second car that we bought from them.",5.0

47,"July 23, 2019","I flew from New York state because they had the exact truck I wanted, and at a price good enough to justify the trip. They had no problem dealing with me from across the country and worked to accommodate me, even picking me up at the airport. I didn't feel like I was getting the run-around like I had at the last 2 local dealers I tried. This was my first almost-new vehicle purchase, and I'm glad they made it go smoothly. James was great to deal with and I highly recommend him. ",5.0

51,"March 11, 2019",They scam you on cars and customer service. I will never buy another Nissan nor recommend to anyone. They are horrible!! They are very very bad!!!,1.0
52,"February 09, 2019","Back in 2016 I bought a platinum Murano from the previous owners of this dealership.  Since then, there has always been excellent service at a reasonable price.  But this weekend something unexpected happened - I had an issue with the transmission on my Murano.  

Most service departments at other Automakers' Dealers would jump on this type of opportunity to bill people. The Katy Nissan dealership fixed the problem with a software update.
There is NO other dealer in the Houston or Texas or even the United States with this level of honesty.
Thank you.",5.0
53,"February 02, 2019",Great Dealership and great staff! Sales team is honest and up front. Definitely the best place to buy a new or pre-owned Nissan! Keep it up Katy Nissan!,5.0
54,"January 14, 2019","I had my 2008 Nissan Titan towed to Katy Nissan last week because the electrical system had shut down.  I asked the Service Department to put it on a diagnostic machine to let me know what was wrong and how much it would cost to fix. 
I was called the next day and told it would be over $1,600 to fix my truck.  Included in the proposal was a new starter with a cost to install of over $1,200, with 4 hours of labor.
I informed them that I had replaced the starter two weeks earlier and done it by watching YouTube and it took just 2 hours.
I went to the dealership to request an opportunity to speak with the Service Technician to get a better understanding of what was in the diagnostic report.  When I arrived I was informed that a report was not run and that the Service Technician had reviewed the situation and determined what was needed.
I had my truck towed back home and replaced two parts totaling less than $50 and the truck runs great.
I saved over $1,450 by not doing the repairs they recommended.  I wonder how many people accept their ""general"" assumptions about their vehicles and pay 10X what they should?  
Buyer beware!!!!",1.2
55,"December 02, 2018","Steering wheel lock issue required the vehicle to be towed to the closest Nissan dealership.  Advised they could definitively determine issue by removing anticipated defective part and plugging in the new part.  15 minutes later I was advised this was the issue and for $1,100 (parts $~700) and labor (2 hours ~ $320), they could fix!  When asked how you could diagnose in 15 minutes yet require 2 hours to fix I was advised: ""that's what the book recommends the job should take"".  Not OK!   ",1.6
