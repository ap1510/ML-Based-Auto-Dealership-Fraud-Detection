If they tell you they will call you when it's ready or the parts come in, don't hold your breath. If you use this dealership's service department, be ready for a headache. ",1.0
1,"December 06, 2017",I purchased my dodge ram 2500 from Joel Perez and his staff there at Ram Country in Del Rio. It was a surprisingly good experience and they made me feel very important and were attentive to my needs and not theirs. Ruben Chaves was a big help and Joel is a great person who goes above and beyond to make your feel special!!,5.0

3,"December 07, 2015",I highly recommend Ruben Chavez for your buying needs. He gets you what you are looking for and doesn't try to talk you into something else. He will work with you to make sure you are completely satisfied with what you are buying. ,4.8

5,"May 18, 2015","It's really funny.  Ruben is in Las Vegas and has been since Thur.  We were totally lies to by Ruben when he told us we were approved for a 2012 journey for 500$ down.  We live 70 miles away and drove all that way, filled out the approval forms and did all that all the while they sold it the day before.  We had been setting this deal up with Ruben and were told it was ours.  Only to have Ruben text us and say sorry first come first serve.  We were lied to repeatedly at this place so dont waste your time. ",1.0
6,"May 18, 2015","Super thrilled with the service I received! I love cars, and I frequently like to trade in for a new vehicle. With that said, you can imagine the negative equity I had acuired. Other dealerships didn't want to even work with me, but this place didn't even think twice about helping me get into a new car. They did everything possible to make sure I got the car I wanted. Amazing people, excellent service!! ",5.0
7,"April 01, 2015","I traded in my car for a 2014 Ram 1500, and the whole experience was perfect. Happy faces and intelligence is what comes with the dealership. Karla was a huge help and found me the perfect deal for my trade in. I would DEFINITELY recommend purchasing your next vehicle from Ram Country. My truck is perfect, and I can't be any happier.",5.0
8,"February 15, 2015","Always helpful but never under any pressure to buy,
Worked out a deal where our payments are within our budget.
Ram Country sold 6 vehicles that day so it took over 2 hours to complete the paperwork.

9,"January 26, 2015","We were going to have to purchase a warranty for the truck real soon, but instead of that we purchase a new truck. A deal you would not want to leave. We love the new truck. All you need is just a little faith and watch God work. The service is always the best, they really care about the customer. They go out of there way to seeing that the customer is happy. I love this dealership .",5.0
10,"April 22, 2014","My wife and I were looking at purchasing a Chrysler 300 for some time now and finally the timing was right. We were going to purchase from a dealer further away because we were told that we could find a better deal. Well that better deal was almost $9,000 above dealer cost!!! Started looking at Ram Country where we were treated very well. So much so that we purchased a brand new 2014 Chrysler 300S with less than 2,000 miles at an outstandingly low price that was just $1,500 over dealer invoice and well below the average consumer price. Vehicle was in the color we wanted (both interior & exterior) and flawless. We were treated in a timely manner and both the sales and service team were extremely helpful in answering any questions I may have had. I even had the windows tinted free of charge from one of their sub-contracted support businesses. I am very happy with my purchase and also with the professionalism presented by the Ram Country staff in it's entirety.",5.0
11,"September 26, 2013","I was negotiating with the dealership about a vehicle I found online. I sent photos of my trade-in which is in excellent condition, but the dealership only offered the ""ROUGH TRADE IN AMOUNT"". I  then found out that the previous day the vehicle had been sent to auction. I was very disappointed. I was going to purchase the vehicle out right because it was priced very well and even make an 850 mile trip to pick it up. Oh well---- today I purchased a different vehicle online from a dealership in Oklahoma and they allowed me $3000 more for my trade ----- sight unseen. Turned out better for me anyway.

Just make sure that the vehicle you are negotiating for is actually on the lot!!!",2.3
12,"December 22, 2012","Searched for a new Toyota Tundra on the Internet. I was contacted by only two of the dealerships in my region. Sammy, Internet sales at Ram Country called me and asked what I wanted. I told him ""Tundra Crewmax 5.7L, red or black"". Sammy guided me to the webpage and while he was walking around the lot, explained the major differences between each of my picks. We settled on a Texas Edition because of Sammy's recommendation, and Sammy's knowledge of the Toyota rebates available. It was priced to give the most bang for the buck. I told him I had the invoice, so please give me a no-nonsense quote and I'd wire the money right then. Sammy gave a very fair price and offered to deliver the truck. I was going to be in town later that week, so I said wait. In the meantime I got financing from a big lender. I asked Sammy if he would beat it, and he did. The day of delivery, the truck was detailed and all of the paperwork was properly prepared. The staff there gave me a quick walk-around, explaining all of the features and hooked up my phone to the hands-free feature. Overall: No-nonsense, relatively transparent, professional, and quick. They know how to sell a car over the Internet.",5.0
13,"April 22, 2010","On 4/19/10. On this date I went to RamCountry Toyota to get my inspection done.  While there Sandra from Toyota services took my truck to the service dept. At that point I went shopping around to lot. During this time Sandra came up to me and asked for my insurance card and i gave it to her for the inspection process. I was approached by Felipe and test drove a Dodge Truck.  They did their best to get me approved but unable to that day. I then went back to Toyota to pick up my truck I ended up waiting for more than 30min cause they couldn't find my insurance card. Sandra stated that the sales rep (Felipe/Julio) had it. They were paged and no answer. About 20min later Sandra told me that they (Felipe/Julio) didnt answer. She had the nerve to ask me if i wanted her to call my insurance company to get another copy of my insurance card. I told her i was going to Dodge side to ask Felipe and Julio in person. They went to lunch. I got a hold of them on their personal cellphone and they stated that they never got my insurance card. I then called Sandra and she said that the inspector placed the card in my cup holder and of course nothing was there.  I later called and spoke to Toyota Sales manager Steven and told him what happened. He asked for my cell number and was going to contact me when he found it. A few minutes later he calls and leave a message on my voice mail laughing and stated "" what type of ring tone is this"" continued laughing. That is why I will never give this company my business and recommend others to shop else where. They are so unprofessional and imature.",1.6
14,"November 19, 2009","We had a very awful experience here.  The not-so-friendly service manager, Carlos, kept trying to charge me an extra $89 ""diagnostic fee"" even though I was having them do the repairs.  When I came to pick up the car the fee was not on the bill, so I assumed that he realized it was a bad policy because I was paying $320 for the repairs anyways.  Wrong, they made the bill wrong and keep calling me asking me to come back and pay more.  

Like one of the other reviewers, we also found the grime all over our steering wheel from the workers too lazy to wash their hands.  ",1.4
15,"September 26, 2009","This dealership was very unprofessional from unexperienced sales force that knew nothing about the products they sell, to a very angry sales racist sales manager. I was there to buy a new toyota tacoma and couldn't have any of my questions answered. I spent almost all afternoon there where I believe they wasted my time. I finished up my time there by stopping by the dodge store to pick up a couple of brochures for the dodge dakota in which I was comparing the toyota. While I was on the showroom, I was shocked when I overheard the apparent manager making extremely hurtful and deliberate racial jokes concerning african americans. I was appalled. If someone would say such horrible things about another race while customers were there, what does he say when we are not. I cant believe a person like that would even work there, let alone be in charge. After I did a little snooping around I came to find out that this mans name was Larry Benton.
   I just want to let everyone in and around Del Rio that looks are definitely deceiving at Ram Country. Very Very unpleasant experience, and I hope all our local friends at the Border Patrol, Laughlin AFB, all Military, and Law Enforcement are made aware of this and avoid shopping there.

16,"December 14, 2006","As the only option in a town that severely lacks the concept of SERVICE, I can honestly say that I'd avoid these guys if at all possible. They were not exceptionally helpful with my warranty complaints and couldn't even put the proper weight oil, that I specifically requested, in the vehicle. In my multiple service visits, I often ended up with shop grime on my steering wheel. Basically, after the amount of money I dumped into this stealership, I've been left with a bad taste in my mouth. They don't even seem to realize that they're representing the quality of the Jeep brand...poorly at best. Luckily, my new dealer in Oklahoma ""gets it.""",2.6
