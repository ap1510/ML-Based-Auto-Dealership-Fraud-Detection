0,"October 26, 2019","We considered trading our Countryman for a Convertible. We went on a very cool evening. We worked with Will Davis, an impeccable young man. Because of the weather he volunteered to bring the car into the showroom for us to take a look around it. He was wonderful during the entire experience. Because of this gentleman we have switched our service to this dealership. It is refreshing to see a sales representative with this level of customer service. ",4.6
1,"May 08, 2019","Thank you for getting my mini ""Jenny boo "" back on the road and running like a champ.   Fidel made right on his promises and Valentin and I are very pleased with how she's running now... we appreciate how thoroughly you addressed our issues.  Thanks again. ",5.0
2,"January 13, 2019","Over 20 years I never stepped into a dealership all my vehicles were thru a broker to avoid the hassles of the salesperson. I meant Will Davis and he made my car buying experience an great time with his patients and was able answer all of our questions. Anyone I know looking for a mini I would recommend Will Davis for all your needs. 
Thanks again Will. ",5.0
3,"September 16, 2017","I provided the problems I was experiencing and left my car.  They provided an Uber ride to a nearby mall and in a little over an hour I received an email with reported problems, what needed to be done, what they could do while my care was there....not much as most parts needed to be ordered, i.e.)  tail lights, window motor..etc.  They did have my 3rd tail light which they installed.  All day and I got a third tail light.  I asked for an appraisal as I might consider buying a new Mini...they forgot to do that until I got back to pick it up so another 45 minutes went by...someone asked if I might consider trading my Mini in (I was actually hoping to do this) but when I stated I would be interested in one of their cars...it was all the way across the lot and no one was really motivated to go get it.  I guess business was TOO good and no need to sell another Mini.  I won't be back....for needed repairs and/or my next Mini.  I WILL purchase another Mini...but not here.  Repairs $2600.00....Trade in offer $2000.00.  2004 Mini with 63000 miles and in good to excellent condition!  Geez!!!!",2.2
4,"April 28, 2017","The staff were very helpful, and answered all my questions! I never had any issues and negotiations were very quick. I filled out my paperwork the day after I first spoke to the service rep and drove away in my brand new car that evening!",5.0

6,"March 08, 2016","There isn't enough kind words about my experience with MINI of Clear Lake.
I had so many frustrating experiences trying to trade my car at previous dealerships until I come across MINI of Clear Lake.
My sales lady Rachel Jansma come through with what I thought was impossible. She took upon herself to do all of the work of the trade basically over the phone since I live so far away. She also got my figure per month to the penny for what I could afford. She made my experience wonderful and with no stress.
I would give this dealership a 100 star perfect rating if I could. 
I hope who ever reads my review that this helps to go buy a car from this dealership. You will not be disappointed.",5.0
7,"September 14, 2015","I took my 2015 MINI Countryman for service on a weird noise on the rear passenger side of the car, and it had been annoying me for a while since this is a new car and I did not understand why it was so loud.  After I took it in I was informed there was in fact a “report” that this model has this problem.  I left my car and they had it a little over a week.  A few days later after I had the car the noise came back and I called to let them know.  They asked me to bring it in again and informed me they did not have a loaner for me to use, just to “come leave it here if you like”.  The first time they “worked” on my car it took them a little over a week and I was not going to be without a car for another week due to their error.  Finally got some help a couple of weeks later and they were able to get a loaner for me.  I mentioned to them the first time I took the car in they damaged the door panel and they agreed to replace it but it was on back order so it would “take some time”.  I took the car in yet again and they once more kept if for over a week.  I picked the car up and was told “there is nothing wrong with the care, it is just one of those things”, and that the technician had “hammered” the part into place even harder! I went home with no gas in my car yet again (the first time the car was at 0 miles till empty and this time at 17 and I was told “she was sure I dropped it off with no gas”); door panel still not replaced as it was in “back order”.   Long story short, I was called to let me know the door panel was in and to take my car in.  I informed them the noise was still there and the last time they worked on my car they did not connect the light on the top so it doesn’t turn on.  Another week went by and I went to pick the car up on 9/12/2015.  I was told they could not “recreate” the noise and to please drive it with their foreman (arrogant guy who thinks everyone should know about cars apparently).  I drove with him and not even three minutes into the drive the noise was “recreated” at least 4 times.  His reply was “That?,  I can’t do anything better than that, some chassis noise is acceptable!”.  And that was that!  Horrible customer service, I felt talked down to, I even felt mocked because of the “noise” I kept hearing.  I guess the problem with my car is not a problem at all for this dealer!  But for MINI as a company it was since they made an actual “Report” that this problem was present with this model.  Will definitely not recommend anyone I know to do business with them!",1.3
8,"August 29, 2015",I had a fabulous experience with Rachel. She got me set up before I ever met her. I had many questions and uncertainties and she patiently addressed everything. ,4.8
9,"July 10, 2015",I worked with Rachel at Mini Cooper of Clear Lake.  She was very helpful!  I wS s first time car buyer and she was very patient and kind to answer all my questions and concerns.  Since I lived far away they even brought the car to me!  Really great service!  ,4.6
10,"April 24, 2015","Whether you're buying a new or used Mini, do your research. Mini does not stand behind its product or its customers. Do not rely on the name Mini alone because it means nothing. Many models are full of serious defects. So whatever you do get the longest warranty possible. We unknowingly bought one of those defective models. It's been in the shop over a dozen times since we bought it less than 2 years ago, including 2 total engine rebuilds. Caught in a trap, any money we might be able to save for a down payment on a new car is impossible because it's all going to Mini for repairs. To make matters worse, the cost of the techs' mistakes are passed onto you, so always check their work before you leave the shop. The company is not looking to attract loyal, lifelong customers. Sure, the representatives are courteous but are there only to ease the high prices and half-assed maintenence you are about to receive. My goal is to get rid of this Mini and never ever buy another one. ",1.8
11,"March 24, 2015","firstly I would like to thank Dittie Gattis for being such a wonderful agent, made my very first purchase easy, Worked with me from beginning to end, and I suspect she even went beyond the scope of her duties, she did an awesome job, truthful and genuinely friendly, had the best experience at this dealership. Recommended to all, if you're thinking of buying a mini, this dealership is the place to be. ",4.8

14,"February 18, 2015","I traveled all the way from WICHITA FALLS to do business with Clear Lake MINI, the reason is simple.. Best price, best trade offer, best deal anywhere around. Rachel, my sales woman, was professional, polite, low pressure, very informative & not just a great believer in her product line, but she drives a nice MINI too.  
I would buy from her again, in a heart beat. If any of you MINI fans out there want one, or want another one, contact her right away!!!! You won't regret it. 
I bought this car for my wife on valentines day, she loves it!! Great cars all the way & this dealer has one for every budget too. If I won the lottery, I would buy a fleet of them for everyone I know.
I am looking forward to the next one some day. Rachel, you & your people 
are the BEST!!",5.0

The is documented problem with sensor interference from cell phones placed in seat. Dealer tried to charge us 500 to inspect problem and accused us of spilling water in seat.

16,"August 23, 2014","I stopped by just to show my mom the car that was on my wish list for my birthday-Christmas gift to myself..I spoke to Ms. Dottie Gattis and she was extremely helpful.   Needless to say a week later, I 
was back driving off in my new 
Countryman.  That was the best car buying experience EVER!  ",5.0
17,"July 09, 2014",Dottie was fantastic and amazing to work with!!  She had the deal ready to go by the time I got there.  She was prompt and professional at every step of the way.  Dottie took the time to make sure I was happy.  She was very personable and I would do business with her again!!  :D,5.0
18,"July 08, 2014","Dottie is the essence of professional representation for her company.  She never pressured us in any way, just answered every question and let us take our time with our decision.  We were particularly impressed with her after the sale also.  At a time when many car salesmen just whoosh on to something else, Dottie took the time to make sure we were completely familiar with the new Mini features, and had everything we needed afterward.  We felt she was building a relationship for the future, and she is definitely someone we will look forward to dealing with again.  We have already recommended her to friends.  ",5.0
19,"July 07, 2014","My husband had seen a low- mileage mini advertised and wanted to look at it.  I stopped in to the mini dealership and was immediately greeted by Dottie.  I explained what we were looking for and she grabbed the keys and we went for a test drive.  She told me about the 'newer' mini features--as we were purchasing this one to take the place of our old one.  I loved it so she started the paperwork when we returned.  As I was driving home, Dottie completed the paperwork and the sale of the car w/ my husband.  Dottie is wonderful to work with!  We will definitely look her up next time we're looking for a mini-and will most definitely refer our friends her way!",5.0
20,"May 03, 2014",Dottie is fantastic!  Loved my experience! Highly recommended for first time MINI prospects. Ask for Dottie she's very personable. Can't wait to get my next one.,4.6
21,"April 25, 2014",Dottie was fantastic at keeping us up to date on the production and delivery of our new mini.  She was excited about the car as we were.,5.0
22,"April 25, 2014","I was introduced to the Mini Brand by the most friendly staff I've ever purchased a car from. The sales person who helped me was Dottie Gattis. She has such an energetic and professional approach that you cannot help but catch the fever for the brand. She guided me through all the models until I settled on the perfect Mini for me, a 2011 Mini Cooper S Hardtop. I loved the car so much that I know have my second Mini, a 2014 Mini Paceman, the S of course! I feel like one of the family since my first introduction to the Brand and Im sure I will look to purchase another and I will certainly stay with Mini of Clear Lake!

23,"April 23, 2014","Made the long drive, and was openly welcomed.  Thought we knew what we wanted.....left with blue, but indecisive.  Returned and choose red.  Staff was understanding and looked to please.  Wife loves her new Mini!  Now shopping for a second one for soon-to-be new driver in the family.  Recommending another trip to Mini of Clear Lake!",5.0
24,"April 23, 2014","I went into the dealership without a clear idea if I was going to buy a car or not. I was with a family friend and I just wanted him to see a Mini up close. Dottie met us at the door and I felt comfortable with her immediately. She spent HOURS with us looking at every type of Mini on the lot.  She was great at showing us all the fun things that are standard with Mini.  Long story short:  I left there with the hottest, fastest, coolest light show Mini Coupe anywhere.  I love my car! 

Also, there was a tiny imperfection in the roof paint of my car. Dottie told me that the dealership would take care of it. I left that evening without any paperwork to confirm her promise to me. I contacted her a week later and she made all the arrangements for me. I was given a loaner car and the personal number of the man that was doing the work. He did a spectacular job on the paint--you cannot tell there was ever a problem with the paint. It was done quickly and followed up by Dottie after everything was complete.

There is something really great going on at that dealership and I'm really glad I stumbled in...

25,"April 23, 2014","Over the last several months, I have been shopping for a vehicle to replace my presently leased VW EOS.  I considered Honda, BMW, Hyandai, Cadillac, Ford, GMC, Chevy and MINI.  My interest in MINI was prompted by my son's prior experience with two MINIs and an incredible salesperson, Dottie Gattis.  He purchased his first MINI from her then returned to purchase the second.  The service he received from the dealership was a factor in his return for the purchase of the second MINI as well.

After driving a MINI Countryman, I was sold!  Moreover, each time I encountered customers in the MINI dealership, they actually congratulated me on my purchase and said that I would never regret it!  That is an amazing testiment to the car.  No only did I hear this from folks, but those who had previously purchased a MINI from Dottie sang her praises as well.

So, far, I love my Cayenne MINI Countryman!  Thanks, Dottie!",5.0
26,"April 22, 2014","Why you should buy your MINI only from this dealership!   Upon arrival I was greeted by Dottie W. Gattis with a smile.  She asked what type of MINI we were  looking for.  At that point, we were not really sure.  She pulled keys to different types of MINI to give us some ideas of what they offer.  At the end of our conversation, we knew what we wanted in a MINI. It was not easy to come to a conclusion with fifteen year old twins.  She made excellent recommendations for us from a parent point of view.  She went out of her way locating the MINI with the exact details that we wanted.  Dottie kept me updated every step of the way.  Once we were ready to pick up our MINI, she had it washed, gassed up and waiting for us inside their showroom.  The whole buying experience was easy and very pleasant.  Dottie is very professional, experienced and always looking out for the customer. After the purchase, she contacted me to remind me that she is there and ready to help with any questions that we might have. ",5.0
27,"April 01, 2014","This was the best car buying experience I have had. It was wonderful going into a dealer and actually being treated as a customer, not as the next victim in the commission war. They have an atmosphere that lets you look at a vehicle without the usual assembly line push I have experienced at other dealers. MINI of Clear Lake wants to sell cars and they truly want you to be satisfied with your purchase.

My Salesperson Dottie is the best, she made me feel like family and still does even after the sale. She answered all my questions and will definitely go the extra mile to make sure you are completely satisfied. I never felt pressured, always felt my wishes were being considered and knew I was a valued customer.

Would I buy another vehicle from MINI of Clear Lake? Yes 
Would I recommend asking for Dottie? By all means.",5.0
28,"March 31, 2014","LOVED, loved, my buying experience here. I worked with Rachel over email and met with Dottie for the end purchase. This was the most hassle free, stress free buying experience and by far the coolest layout of a dealership I have ever been in. I swear if I could have bought every little accessory, or every dang car in there I would have. I highly suggest to anyone that is looking for a MINI to head over to Clear Lake and meet with Dottie you will truly enjoy it. ",5.0
29,"January 15, 2014","Great, easy, straightforward purchase process. Dottie was great to work with and very knowledgable of the vehicle. Received a great finance rate....better than I could do through my own bank. Paperwork was done, car was cleaned up and I was off the lot quickly. ",5.0
30,"November 26, 2013","I contacted Mini of Clear Lake to talk to a sales person before I visited the dealership.  Rachel Jamsma answered all my questions and I made an appointment to meet her at 3:30.  Rachel met me at the door and we test drove several Coopers.  I decided on one and the financing process was quick and easy.  
I have visited Mini of Clear Lake several times for maintenance and service.  Everyone is exceptionally nice and friendly.  I am so glad I purchased my Mini from Rachel at Mini of Clear Lake.",5.0
31,"November 20, 2013","I had an excellent experience working with Rachel. This dealership was hundreds of miles further than my nearest dealership (Baton Rouge), but was well worth the drive!",5.0
32,"November 19, 2013","Went in for service, ended up purchasing new car.  absolutely happy with it.
dottie in sales was terrific and gentleman in service was so nice.
will definitely go back as our needs change.  there was no pressure and i
walked away with exactly what i wanted.",5.0
33,"November 18, 2013","Dottie was very helpful and not at all pushy in our first visit to the dealership After deciding that the car we initially looked at would not be what my wife was looking for, she was still nice enough to have the MINI I eventually purchased ready for a test drive before I arrived at the lot the second time. Since my spare time is limited, this was extremely important to me. All other contact with this dealer (financing, delivery, etc.) have been exceptional as well.",5.0
34,"November 18, 2013","I love MINI of Clear Lake.  I shopped all three Houston area MINI dealerships to get the best price.  After making about 10 visits across several months to the MINI of Clear Lake dealership, Dottie was still excited to see me and welcomed me every time.  She was the first and only salesperson I could remember by name after visiting all 3 dealerships.  I knew when it cam time to order my perfect Mini Cooper S Convertible Dottie would be the last call I needed to make, and it was! Thanks Dottie for taking the time to speak with me on every visit and sharing your own personal MINI experiences. 

Sincerly,
Mike F.",5.0
35,"November 18, 2013","Best experience at a dealership ever.  Have bought approx. 12 new vehicles in my life and Mini of Clear Lake is hands down the number 1 dealership in my mind.  I will be hard pressed to go to a different dealership.  From the no pressure experience when I first came by to look at Mini's, all the way through purchasing and servicing our new auto, Mini of Clear Lake shows true professionalism and the customer service is unparalleled.  Its always nice and impressive for your name to be remembered when you walk in the door. 

Dottie Gattis has a customer for life.

36,"November 18, 2013","First of all, my experience with Ms. Gattis was very positive the minute I walked in the door.  She was professional, extremely knowledgeable, and thorough going over the vehicle's numerous features.  I would definitely go back to her for future purchases!  As far as the price goes, I know I got a good deal because the Mini Countryman I bought had low mileage and was completely loaded with extra features such
as rally lights, bonnet stripes, and heated seats.  Overall, I would certainly recommend Ms. Gattis and Mini Clear Lake to friends, family,
and acquaintances. ",5.0
37,"November 18, 2013","Clear Lake was the third Mini dealership we dealt with in search of a new Mini Countryman. The first two were too lazy or incompetent to search the country to find exactly what we desired: make, model, color, etc. After our first call to Dottie, she went searching and found exactly what we wanted. The car was not even in the US, but she tracked it, kept us informed as to its location, and made this the most satisfying purchase.

38,"November 18, 2013","I had an awesome experience at Mini Clear Lake.  My salesperson, Dottie Penn, spent the week looking for a great deal for me and stayed in constant contact with me throughout my entire shopping experience.  She made sure I got exactly whatI was looking for at the price I needed.  She has stayed in contact with me since I bought my Mini and has always been ready to help with anything I've needed.  

I highly recommend this dealership to anyone looking to buy a Mini and ask for Dottie if you go.  She's amazing!!",5.0

40,"November 17, 2013","This was, hands down, the best car buying experience of my life.  My wife and I purchased a new MINI from this dealership in July.  My brother has two cars which he also got from this dealership.  Rachael assisted us with our purchase and made sure that we got exactly what we needed in a car.  I would certainly buy another car from them and would say that anyone in the area who is considering a MINI should go there first.  ",5.0
41,"November 16, 2013","I purchased my MINI Countryman in April 2013, my MA Rachel dealt with me for over a year, she and Victor answered all my questions and help me find just what i was looking for. Shelby was new to the floor when i picked up my MINI but she was great as well!! 
I took my car there a few times for a car wash and the maintenance department was great! 

Thanks MINI Clear Lake, i will definitely be back! ",5.0
42,"November 16, 2013","My wife and I have both bought MINIs from Rachel this year and we couldn't be happier! The staff is super friendly and always make sure you're comfortable during the buying process. Rachel sat down with us and made sure we got exactly what we wanted from our cars and followed up with us about a week or two after the purchases to make sure everything was going well. Mike in service is a pleasure to work with as well. While buying my Countryman my wife's low tire sensor was tripped in her coupe due to the cold weather and Mike grabbed it, filled up the tires, and got the washed while we were taking my test drive. I really enjoy coming here, and if we need to add a third MINI to the family I will definitely be back :)",5.0
43,"November 15, 2013","I live in Wichita, KS where there is no Mini dealer.  I searched the US and found the Mini I wanted at Clear Lake Mini.  I contacted them and made an offer, which they agreed to.  All of the details were completed online and via email.  I flew in to Houston, met with Rachel for about 1/2 hour, then drove away happily in my Mini Coupe.  The entire experience was so easy!  I would gladly repeat the entire process again just to avoid the dealer ""sharks"" here in Wichita!  Thank you Clear Lake Mini.  Thank you Rachel!",5.0
44,"November 15, 2013",We made SEVERAL trips to the dealership before we bought our Mini because we just couldn't make up our mind. We wanted something sporty but not crazy expensive. Rachel was very patient with us and never pushed us. She offered several different styles for us to drive. She made us feel like it was totally normal to visit a dealership as often as most people go to their favorite restaurant!  We finally decided on the cutest ice blue convertible Mini Cooper and we just love it. My husband drove racing cars when he was much younger and he loves the handling of the mini and says he has found the joy in driving again! Rachel still stays in touch and makes sure we are still happy with our purchase. We love our MINI!,5.0
45,"November 15, 2013","I live in New Orleans and was visiting family. I went into the dealership to browse and left with a new convertible mini. There were some factory ""hiccups"" with the vehicle; however, I have never experienced such extrodinary customer service. They loaned me a vehicle to return home and returned my vehicle to me in New Orleans at my home. It was transported on a truck to avoid mileage and made arramgements to pick the loaner up from me at my home. They were prompt in diagnosing and fixing the problem with the vehicle. Except for having to wait a few days for my vehicle, I was not inconvienced at all. ",5.0
46,"November 15, 2013","MINI of Clear Lake took excellent care of me in my recent purchase of a MINI Cooper Hardtop.  I designed my MINI on the miniusa website, and chose to have MINI of Clear Lake be my dealership.  My motoring advisor, Rachel, contacted me via email and we were able to work out all the details online. I met Rachel in person a few weeks later once my MINI arrived, and she showed me all the particulars on how my new MINI worked.  Overall, I had a very pleasant experience and highly recommend Rachel and MINI of Clear Lake for your motoring needs.",4.8
