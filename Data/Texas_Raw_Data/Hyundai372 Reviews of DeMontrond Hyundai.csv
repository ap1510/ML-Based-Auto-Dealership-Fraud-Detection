5,"April 30, 2020",Syed made buying my first new car a very easy experience. He patiently allowed me to test drive over 10 vehicles and never pressured me to make a choice. He allowed me to do it at my own pace and was always there to answer any questions I had about the different models and trim levels. He worked very hard to get a payment I was comfortable with and even though I didn't purchase a car the first day-he continued to be polite and respected my wanting to sleep on it. He called me the next day and I told him which car I wanted and he had the car and all the paperwork ready for me when I arrived. He was great with my kiddos and my mother-in-law too! Thanks Syed!,4.6

8,"February 29, 2020","My husband and I have bought many cars over the years dreading it each and every time. Lucky for us, his background allows him to wade through the BS and get us what we want.

We wanted to look at and test drive a Palisade and the dealers within the area didn’t have any. (Ron Carter said they did, we made an appt, drove 50 miles only to be told they didn’t have any. Never going there again.) I got an email from JAMIE BATEAST setting up an appt as they were getting one in. We had no intention of buying that day, just looking and test driving. Jamie is so professional and knowledgeable and she doesn’t do a hard sell because she doesn’t have to. She lets the product sell itself. It did and we ended up buying it that day. If all salespeople were like her, buying a car would be a pleasant experience. She is an incredible role model for young girls and we highly recommend her. Brad was also great to deal with and we appreciate his integrity. 
We love our Palisade!",5.0

44,"April 19, 2019","Syed and Jacob helped me find the perfect car for me at the price I needed.  Syed asked questions as to what I was looking for and heard me when I answered.  DeMontrond, in Texas City, was my first stop in my quest for a car and I purchased the 2nd car that I saw and drove. I never purchase anything this quickly not even a pair of shoes, so this is a testament as to how well Syed listen to what I communicated.
Syed and Jacob were not pushy and that was a very important quality for me. Syed  answered all my questions and was very thorough and patient in explaining the features of the car. 
I started looking for a car dreading the process but Syed and Jacob made it a wonderful experience and I am thankful for them.

There was no pressure, ever during the process shich I really appreciated.  Everyone was super friendly and went out of their way to make my experience as easy as possible.  I got an incredible deal and I love my new car.  The service department is fantastic.  Just had my first oil change and the technician sent a video text to give me an update on the condition of my vehicle.  I love the service I’ve received at Demontrond.  This dealership is superior to any dealership I’ve encountered and I have purchased many vehicles.  Demontrond is the only dealership I will use from now on.  ",5.0
50,"January 06, 2019",I started going to this dealership a few years ago because the Hyundai dealer I had bought from had a horrible service department. I’ve had great experiences with the service team over the last three years. Yesterday I had my Tucson appraised and spoke to the sales department. Syed showed me the new Santa Fe and all the safety features. I was so excited but it was a little over my budget. The salesman Syed and sales manager Brad worked on the deal last night and this morning. They were actually able to work with me and get me in my dream car. The whole experience was unlike any other car buying experience. They were very straight forward and able to explain the different options. I am thrilled about my new purchase and although I am planning on keeping this car for awhile I will definitely be returning to Demontrond for future purchases and the service of this one. ,5.0
51,"December 19, 2018","I went to DeMontrond after reading great reviews of the dealership. I already signed up for a test drive online. When I arrived at the location, I was greeted by a very friendly and caring sales associate, Teri Goebel. She helped set up the cars that I was interested in test driving and patiently explained the special features of the cars during the test drive. I did not feel pushed to make any purchase. When I expressed an interest in buying additional parts for my new car, Teri happily contacted the parts department and took me there. The parts staff is very friendly and helpful. He placed the order for me with a great discount. Teri also introduced me to the friendly and knowledgeable service staff to answer my questions about the service schedules. At the end of the day it started to rain while I was waiting to pick up my new car. Teri offered me water and snacks while she ran back and forth to set up my new car. Finally Teri showed me to my new car with her gigantic umbrella and happily saw me drive off in my brand new car!",5.0
52,"November 29, 2018",We let Jamie know what we needed and she got it for us. Easy as that. She knows everything about her vehicles and she had no trouble getting us the financing we wanted. We spent hours at another dealership and got no where close to the deal we got from Jamie at Demontrond! We are so pleased with our buying experience!,5.0
53,"November 23, 2018","I went to DeMontrond with no particular vehicle in mind to purchase. Getting a new vehicle was a surprise gift from my parents so I was excited and openminded. My dealer, Teri Goebel was extremely patient with me and my parents, and over a 2 day period we narrowed my search down to a new Hyundai Tucson. I couldn’t be happier with my new ride and the experience I had a DeMontrond was beyond excellent. Unlike other dealerships, we experienced no pressure or haggling from the staff.  I feel DeMontrond is a great place to buy a vehicle and furthermore, they have an excellent service department. I know this because my previous car, a Hyundai Elantra, was purchased and serviced there too. ",5.0
54,"November 20, 2018","Having been a 7 time Hyundai owner over the past years, DeMontrond Hyundai has far exceeded any dealership we’ve bought from.  Syed, Brad, and Kim are three of the most professional, courteous, and personable individuals we’ve worked with in the automobile industry that are very sincere in what they say and do. No stress, no pressure, no hassles....just straight up and down to earth honesty and a really great price. Everyone treated us with 5 star professionalism. You come away feeling like you’ve known them for a long time. ",5.0
55,"October 14, 2018","Syed Zaidi was very helpful and knew all about the vehicle we wanted.  Also checked other dealerships for the color we desired.  So far, absolutely nothing negative to say about dealership or Syed Zaidi.",5.0
56,"August 31, 2018"," DeMontrond Hyundai had a Porsche Boxster on their lot and I went to take a look. 

Ended up working with Teri Goebel who was fantastic. We took the car out for a couple of test drives. She was very friendly and even helped me get a little bit better at driving manual! They even had the car detailed and washed for my second test drive. Everyone I met along my way was very nice, not pushy, and were sincerely trying to help me find exactly what I was looking for. 

Overall it was a great experience.  Searching for a new car can be frustrating sometimes but there are fair and decent dealers around if you look hard enough. I would recommend Teri and  DeMontrond Hyundai to anyone.

58,"August 01, 2018","2 weeks ago we purchased a Santa Fe Sport from this location. The staff was welcoming and very professional. We weren't exactly sure which model to chose and had a lot of questions. Mr. Syed Zaeidi was extremely helpful and gratefully cleared everything up for us thoroughly. It makes a big differences when you have a cooperative salesman who guides you in the right direction before making such a big decision.
We were impressed by his kindness and professionalism even after we received our new car the following day, where he took from his free time ( he had that day off) and came specially for us to go through the features of our new car and to explain the maintenance schedule, the blue link app and a lot of other stuff to us in detail.
We love our new car and are very happy with our choice. Hyundai's cars in general provide a great range of high quality vehicles with top ratings and affordable prices. The paperwork preparation and sale process was also smooth and easy. We even spoke to the guys from the insurance section there and decided to change our current insurance and go with their offer. Exceptional costumer service! I would highly recommend this dealership.",5.0
59,"July 31, 2018","The sales team was very helpful.  Syed Zaidi went out-of-state to find the perfect vehicle to fit my needs.  It was difficult to find a KONA with all the features that I had requested.  He kept me informed at all times. The sales manager was very cooperative, as well.  ",5.0

Everyone was very nice, helpful and not pushy like all the other places.  They gave us a very good price for our vehicle and was able to take it home with us the same day.  Will definitely use them again in the future.  Well worth the drive.",5.0
62,"June 14, 2018","I was there to have oil changed, fluids topped off, tire rotation, and filters checked. I would like to say I was very impressed on your service manager that checked me in David Wolf, not sure on spelling of last name. He was very polite and friendly. I just wish that your mechanics would vacuum vehicles just a service, like many dealerships do. However the only complaint I have is a lady long brown hair first office on left from service area, her and a older man with a mechanic uniform in my opinion were entirely to loud. For a good 20 minutes while we were sitting waiting on our vehicle. Thankly Mr. Wolf was so polite and friendly that, this time I ignored it. So thank you Mr.David Wolf sorry if your name is misspelled, but it was a pleasure and I hope your company recognizes the skills for professionalism you have. Hyundai I hope you recognize this employees and consider having your mechanics take that extra step to vacuum your customers vehicles. Also think your location could afford to have simple snacks for your employees and customers, again like many dealerships.    Thank you Dawn Davis",4.4

I was not sure if that would work for me but we looked at it anyway and I was surprised to find just how easily I could afford the new car. They were so helpful with the whole process and I was able to buy my wife the car she has wanted for a while. I'm so glad I chose to stop there first. I am telling all of my friend about this dealership and recommending it so highly. I can't thank them enough for all they were able to do for me.

Michelle did not give me the back and forth, I offered what I thought was a good offer and she countered with what I thought was a fair price.

Mr. Syed was sitting at the next table and suggested to mention and sign the price that we wish to offer. That was helpful and the deal was done.

77,"January 25, 2018",Courteous employees.  Much of the interchange between dealer and customer is aimed at protecting the dealer and shifting liability to the customer.

I have went into my garage already twice just to stare at the car and blink feeling so blessed. After shopping around and doing my homework I'm just so amazed at how easy and fair everything was.

After all papers were signed and the car was mine, instead of saying ""Thank you"" and sending me on my way, Sheri spent at least another 30 or 40 minutes sitting in my car with me explaining, familiarizing, and showing me how to access and use all of the ""bells and whistles"" in my new car.

108,"September 26, 2017","My wife and I are previous Hyundai owners and previous/current DeMontrond customers. We required a new vehicle due to Hurricane Harvey and Sheri Ferguson, our sales rep, was very attentive and compassionate.  We have always received excellent service from the sales staff and DeMontrond and Sheri continued that experience. I am a bit nit-picky when it comes to cars/features and she was more than patient with information, test drives, etc. If fact, I have already referred someone to her, although I don't know if they followed up with her.  Regarding vehicle service: Back in 2015, when I purchased by first Sonata, the service department was less than desireable, but managemen did show concern and did insure my satsifaction (I preferred to do business with their service department because the dealership is close to home and to maintain the Warranty Forever program). Well, over time since then there has been TREMENDOUS improvement in the service department and I am more than satisfied with my Service Advisor, David.  Re: the Warranty Forever program: I put quite a lot of miles on my car, so this warranty program is of value to me. Additionally, I've found that DeMontrond's service rates are competitive with private shops and, if I have a choice, I'll choose a factory trained technician over a private shop every time. The only service I have outside of DeMontrod is tires and wheel alignments. Also, since I get my service at DeMontrond, their system automatically checks for any recalls needed for the vehicle, so I know my vehicle is up to date for all updates/upgrades.  I am happy to recommend DeMontrond Hyundai at every opportunity.  If you'd like a personal recommendation, I have given Sheri Ferguson permission to give out my phone number if necessary.",4.8

I never even considered going somewhere else to get new cars. I was so sure that I had Geico make my check out to DeMontrond. Going into these purchases I was freaking out. I did not have anything but that Geico check to put down on all three cars. My salesman Mina was incredible. He managed to calm me down keep me focused and very late last night we left with 2 out of 3 cars. (thanks to everyone who had to stay late) And as usual hiccups happen at finance. That is when not only did Mina shine but Michelle (finance) exceeded all my expectations. I know without a doubt that when I return to get our third car (my mother-in-laws) I will receive the same great service.

I had purchased my first SantaFe from this dealership and thought being a repeat customer would mean something. They told me that they would call me - never did. I went online to inquire about two vehicles and no one ever contacted me about them. So, I decided to visit DeMontrond. BEST DECISION EVER!!!

I have spent hours writing glowing, heart felt reviews of the DeMontrond Hyundai car dealership only to mysteriously lose them because my internet skills are sorely challenged.  This , therefore, is my short but sweet version.  I have kept at it for two days because they accomplished what had seemingly become the impossible dream and deserve to have their praises sung!  I had been searching for a car to replace mine that had suddenly and unexpectedly died from Galveston Island to the middle of Houston and had been ignored, laughed at, mislead, manipulated, and out and out lied to by the best(WORST) of them for almost two weeks.  Then I was welcomed to the Texas City DeMontrond dealership where my faith in professionalism, honesty, courtesy, and humanity was restored.  Here I was treated with the utmost respect.  I was listened to and taken seriously by a team of professionals who seemed more like friends and family than strangers. Sales Professionals David Suthon and Tiffany Suarez worked in concert with dealership owner and General Manager Byron Johnson and Hyundai Sales Manager Adrian Genovese to make my impossible dream come true.  Against all odds they found for me the perfect car (brand new 2017 Hyundai Tucson ) for the perfect price (I'm  a retired middle school teacher on a fixed income, enough said)!  And as if this wasn't enough, the Texas City Demontrond dealership and family blessed me with their gift of a ""Forever Warranty"" which covers the powertrain (transmission, engine front and rear wheel  drive) for as long as I own the car at 100% of parts and labor anywhere in the USA!!  And all  I have to do is take care of my car, whice I always do any way!!  Oh yes, and if you are wondering, of course I also have the full and extensive  Hyundai  Vehicle Warrenty!!!  I still have to pinch myself to make sure this is real!  Hyundai Dealership, crew, and family, you are my HEROS and are what all other dealerships should aspire to be!  Thank you!

When we came back, he wanted us to go to Jaimie, not because he did not want our business, but because he wanted us to have someone who was more experienced than he was. And his sacrifice gave us a wonderful young woman who delivered just what we wanted without us feeling anything but wonderful about our purchase.

Jamie Bateast was a joy to work with!!!! She seems like a friend. Her genuine warmth made us want to come back to her for our car even after we looked at numerous dealerships.

When I walked into Demontrond, I knew exactly what I wanted and told Jamie. She checked and found they had what I wanted on the lot. Jamie then promised straight forward pricing and she delivered. She asked what I wanted for my trade in, and gave me exactly what I asked for. I did not feel the need to try and play the ""car buying"" game where we go back and forth between sales rep and manager. I knew that the first offer they gave me was fair and did not include any discounts that would be taken away later due to them not fitting my situation. After making my intentions clear, no one attempted to add any additional services or warranties. If they would have attempted, I probably would have walked out and went to another dealership. No funny business going on at Demontrond, everything was very smooth and I walked out knowing I got exactly what I wanted, for a fair price, from friendly people.

The service and collision department here are a joke. My Equus was sent here for repair and it took over 2 months to complete, all the while I had to chase them around to get answers about the status of my car. Alton refused to return my calls and was extremely rude when we had to pop in unexpectedly to see what was going on. I can't believe he called himself a manager. Week after week went by with no communication. Our first inspection of the ""finished"" car was a disgrace with scratches on my new bumper and a very poor paint job. Alton could really care less about our displeasure with the vehicle, explaining to us that if we had a problem we'd have to take it up with someone else.  We're patient people and can work with those who work with us but the poor attitudes on top of the poor work ensured that we will never return here nor recommend this dealership to anyone. After being transferred to collision, Joan was a little easier to get ahold of and much better to work with than Alton but she still didn't keep me in the loop unless I called her myself. This repair job took entirely too long and no apology or valid excuse was ever offered. What a shame! ",1.0

312,"January 31, 2015","...you've been to another dealer...You'll be glad you did!!

My wife and I actually won one of those prize cars you see offered in the mailers from time to time from another dealer. We wanted to trade it up for a Sonata, but in all honesty, they treated us very rudely during that process. I think they were upset that we won the car.

In any event, they extremely lo-balled us on the trade-in value of the prize car and really wouldn't negotiate much on the upgrade. So, we went down the road to DeMontrond, who gave us 50% more on the trade!!

Enter Christian Kopeck: A delightful man who looks like he can't be more than 15 years old. But don't be fooled: He is a very thoughtful, intelligent, sincere man who served our country honorably in the Nave and is currently in the National Guard or Reserves. The experience at DeMontrond was LIGHT YEARS better than the other dealer up the road. No pressure, honest pricing..no going back and forth games with the sales manager. AND, once we agreed on the price (i'm not sure what happened, but I think they found some other rebate that applies), the final price was LESS than what we agreed on!!!

We told him the price we needed to be at to make the deal and he and his sales manager came back ONE TIME with a price that BEAT our requirement. ""Nuff said, I would say. And, Christian was there EVERY step of the way, even coming in on his own time to be sure he delivered the vehicle in a proper, professional manner and made sure the dealer add-ons we negotiated were installed promptly and properly.

I would HIGHLY recommend this dealer over the Hyundai dealers in the area. And they have my name and number and have my permission to give out if you want a personal reference.

Oh, one more thing: The finance process: BEAUTIFUL!!!..While the gentleman DID try to up-sell a couple of things (that's his job, after all), it was pleasant and with no pressure. AND....he came down to a reasonable price on a couple of things we were looking for. By the way: I know the standard theme is to NOT buy an extended warranty, but with the new cars today the likelihood of something going wrong will be some sort of electronic/computer oriented item which are quite expensive to fix. For that reason, we went wwith the extra warranty, on which the finance guy (I can't remember his name...Dane??) negotiated down the price with us.

Finally, you can't beat the Warranty Forever deal. Simply have your car serviced according to the manufacturer's schedule and the power train is covered for life!!",5.0

Jeff introduced himself the first day we visited and told us not to hesitate coming to him directly if we encountered any issues or concerns.  When it came to pricing, Demontrond was honest and upfront and did not try to add unneeded accessories or gimmick protection packages.  The entire process was smooth, and an altogether different experience than one would expect from other dealers in the area.  Don't let a free Saturday lunch or other gimmicks down the road keep you from a great deal.  Michele and the Demontrond staff will take care of you and you will not regret stopping in!  Don't waste hours looking for the right deal when Demontrond can do it all with one stop.

They had the car for 29 days (giving it back to me twice, unrepaired, during that time) before finally towing it to Ron Carter to get properly repaired. Not once did their service advisors call with a status other than ""it's ready to pick up"", car was returned filthier than it was when they got it, appointments were not honored, paperwork was screwed up and not even provided, and advisors are apparently unpunished over such poor customer treatment. Dana McCans, the service manager, was the only one to communicate (after 19 repair days and much frustration on my part) but does not seem to hold employees accountable. General Manager Melissa Demontrond apparently doesn't care to improve her dealership; two phone calls went unreturned.

329,"August 07, 2014","I went to a large Hyundai dealership in the ""just looking"" process.  We actually found what we liked, but they started crunching numbers, and shifting numbers, and trying to sell the ""monthly payment is"".  The bottom line is I could not get an answer on the price of the car, and we did not want to buy it today.  This went back and forth for over an hour with at least 3 offers from the dealer.  

SO THEN, I sent DeMontrond an email stating what I was interested in.  The responded quickly and politely.  They asked if and when I wanted to come take a test drive.  I showed up and was greeted pleasantly and since I had told them what vehicle I wanted, she grabbed the keys and said ""let's go drive it"".  I was pleased when we returned, so she asked Jeff to give me a good price.  He sent over a sheet of paper that spelled out the MSRP, what discount I was receiving, and the bottom line for the vehicle.  His first offer was less than the other dealer's third attempt.  I thought it was the right price, and I asked him was this a ""one time offer?"".  He said no, it is good until the end of the month at which time Hyundai may change their incentives and he could not control that, but we definitely did not have to do the deal today.  I also mentioned that I had already pre approved a loan from my credit union if that would be alright.  Jeff said that is fine, but he would like a chance to see if he could do better.  I came back the next day, and he had beat my credit union interest rate by almost a half a percent, which over a 60 month loan makes a difference.

I went to the finance department, signed some papers, he gave me choices of different warranty upgrades, but said no big deal if I just want to go with the deal on the table.  No pressure, but I was made aware of what was available.  We signed, and drove off in about 25 minutes.  

So now I feel like I can look forward to taking my vehicle back for any help or services I may need in the future.  Not a feeling of dread that the other dealership gave me.  I big thumbs up to this dealership!",5.0

Gave us info to carry death benefit insurance and denied it the next day.  Argued with us that he had not told us something that he had. Ended up financing with someone else and not with company financing.  Max was fairly new in job and so maybe he will improve his customer skills and be more knowledgeable in the future.

Met with Michele and explained what we wanted and color, she brought it out and we test drove it. No wandering around the hot and humid lot checking out models required. Michele started the paperwork to provide us a quote and contacted Chris for internet pricing. Amy in financing found what interest options we were comfortable with and got us what we needed to be very happy.

We will definitely recommend DeMontrond telling everyone it is worth the trip from Round Rock to League City! I actually have already recommended DeMontrond to my hairdresser. We had looked at Hyundai here in Round Rock but the salesmen were so rude, we wouldn't go back; therefore, we drove 4 hours to buy our car! 

We found the car we wanted on the internet, called and talked to Jeff Cole about the details.  The car was everything he said and we felt more than what we expected.  After we made our decision, we made an appointment with Mallory.  She was both pleasant and efficient.  

When we arrived at our appointment, on time, our car was ready, paperwork was ready and Michelle met us at the door, ushered us in, gave us a chair, water, and a BIG smile!  Jeff Cole came over to visit with us and explained that even though we had talked with him on the phone that Michelle would be taking care of the paperwork and explaining the details of the car.  It was more like visiting someone's home and we were made to feel right at home immediately. Everyone, even those we weren't working with, greeted us with courtesy and a smile.  That is so very important!  Another nice thing that occurred is the owners saw us on the lot and came out of their office to greet us.   We couldn't be happier with our Santa Fe and we will definitely be back to DeMontrond Chevy, next door, later this summer to order our 2015 Corvette!

340,"April 16, 2014","My husband and I were looking for a new vehicle and were ready to make a purchase. We originally looked at another brand but had a terrible experience at their dealership. We waited several days and then decided to check out DeMontrond Hyundai since it is in our local area. My son highly recommended a Hyundai since he owns a Sonata. We were intrigued with the 10 year warranty so stopped by to look at the Santa Fe models. While we were looking at the first car, Jon Rosson greeted us and asked if he could help us. We told him what we were looking for and Jon made several suggestions. He was very knowledgeable about the models and features and patiently allowed us to test drive as many vehicles as we wanted. Jon treated us like valuable customers and made us feel very at ease. 

We finally narrowed our choice to two vehicles and met Jeff Cole, the Manager. We told Jeff that we were not interested in haggling over the price, but asked him to bring us the best deal for each of the vehicles and then we would make our decision. Before we made our final decision, Jon asked us if we wanted to take a look at the program car that Jeff had been driving since it had all the features we were interested in except it was silver while we were wanting white. We looked at it and instantly knew this was my new car! It had all the features we wanted, including the navigation package and the panoramic moon roof! Jeff brought the paperwork and we agreed on the very fair price. No hassles, no bickering, nothing hidden and we felt like valued guests! By the time we finished the paperwork, we realized we had kept them past closing time, but they never said a word about it. What great customer service! 

Next we met Amy who again made us feel comfortable. She had the documents ready to sign and explained all about the warranty. Before we knew it our vehicle was ready for us to drive home! 

I was really dreading the whole car buying experience based on past history and on our experience at the other dealership. I can't thank Jon, Jeff and Amy enough for making this car purchase a relaxed, hassle free, honest and genuinely pleasant experience!  I am a very satisfied Hyundai customer!

When I got there I met Chris, they had the car up front for me and after a test drive, I decided that was the one. They stuck to there price they offered me with no add-ons and no tricky switch's.

Once we had zeroed in on my choice they located it and had it to me when I told them I needed it.

They were very respectful with my decision and Amy would touch base via a email every month or so, which I really liked.  

After my car broke down again, it was the first call I made was to Demontond, no question as to where I would buy my car.  As with the first time I went there, it was a great experience.  The atmosphere is one of no pressure and inviting.  I like the fact that the sales people are not like sharks and I feel like they were looking for my best interest, not just selling a car.  

Michelle is very personable, knowledgeable, and professional.  She let me test drive every car I was interested in and was very helpful in weighing the different features.  My credit is not the best, but to them, I was just as important of a sale as someone with outstanding credit.  They made the process so easy.  I went and looked on a Saturday, and bought on Monday.  Jeff was very helpful in helping me along the process.  Amy made signing all the paperwork absolutely painless and gave me all the information I needed. 

 I just can't say enough about Michelle, Jeff, and Amy.  They made me feel like the service doesn't end with purchasing my car, the great service will continue with the maintence of my Hyundai as well.
