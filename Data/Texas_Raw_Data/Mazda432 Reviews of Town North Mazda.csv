0,"June 26, 2020","Richard made sure I was well informed and well taken care of throughout the whole process! My father and I went together in the beginning to pick out something that seemed practical and fun after having been in a car accident that ended with a total loss. Shortly after though my dad had a heart attack resulting in hospitalization for a few days. Even so, Richard made sure to check on us and see how we were doing and gave us his full support. Richard is not only an amazing salesman but he’s a good friend! Thank you so much! 

Ps.
Craig is the MAN! He also made the purchasing process easy. He answered all the millions of questions I had with grace and patience, and a few jokes too! 

I will be returning for future purchases as a loyal customer! Thank you for all of your help! ",5.0

3,"June 17, 2020","I came in for a test drive and to fully understand the vehicle I was strongly considering. I had an appointment with a very knowledgeable and courteous man, Terry McElroy, who put no pressure on me to buy but instead spent time getting to know and show me the driving characteristics of my 2020 Mazda CX-5.

At one point Victor came to us to show us our old air filter and ask us if we wanted him to change it.  That was much appreciated!  It's nice to be ""asked"" instead of ""told.""

We love this place.

21,"May 07, 2020",Town north Mazda never disappoints! I love the timely and efficient service. I bought my car from them almost 2 years ago and will continue to do all of my service at the Richardson location. ,5.0
22,"May 01, 2020","They actually treated me respectfully and spoke to me like a person, unlike most dealerships I went to. They worked with me on my trade-in until I was comfortable, and were patient while helping me. Dylan was knowledgeable and professional. I will definitely shop there again in the future and ask for him again because I felt that he worked hard for me. The finance guy Frank was super nice and took his time explaining every detail to me.

25,"April 19, 2020","I must say every time I bring my vehicle to Town North Mazda be serviced, I experience good customer service. But my most recent visit on Friday, April 18, 2020, changed good to GREAT. 

During a time of a worldwide pandemic, most of us are (in some way) on edge, but this didn’t stop the service department at Town North! I dropped my vehicle off for a standard oil change, and arrived 15 minutes before close to pick it up. I was given full detail of a SEVERE issue with one of my tires and the “low health” of the others. 

Both Mike and Herald put their commitment to service and my personal safety above and before “their closing time.” I was advised of a current promotion and took advantage of it. 

But wait.......there is more! While awaiting the arrival of the tires, I was given a loaner vehicle on the spot (one which I’m now considering a trade in for; I understand the sales tactic! Haha). It doesn’t get any better than that. 

For the life of my Mazda (or another one), Town North is the ONLY place I plan to do business. I feel respected and valued as a customer, and that is the foundational check box when considering my patron loyalty. Additionally, I can TRUST Town North to do the right thing. A job well done!",5.0
26,"March 27, 2020","Brought our 2016 Mazda 3 in for an oil change at around 27,000. All went well but was surprised to be informed that we already needed rear brake pads and rotors. I have never had to replace pads and rotors at such low mileage. We did buy the car used from Town North at around 24,500, so we are not sure how the brakes were treated by the previous owner. Still seems like low mileage for new pads and rotors. Just my opinion.",5.0
27,"March 27, 2020","Minor trim issue with just purchased 2016 CX 9 was evaluated and treated rapidly.  I appreciate the friendly and attentive service.  I especially was impressed with the video of the evaluation and text contacts.  Very cool.  Looks like two screws placed rather than original trim holder.  I don't know, but this may be stronger than the original design.  ",4.6
28,"March 25, 2020","Hello,
My service and service advisor Railynne were excellent. This was my first time at Town North. I usually use Mazda of Mesquite because the location is close to my job. I called Mazda of Mesquite and explained my situation. The lady I spoke with told me there were no appointments available to fit my needs.
When I called Town North and spoke with Railynne, she eased my fears and concerns and told me to bring my car in without hesitation.
Town North addressed my car situation with great service and compassion.
Thank you,

32,"March 10, 2020",I left message for Victor on a Saturday that I had a blowout and was on my way to the dealership. He already had my paperwork started before I got to him. He went ahead to put the spare on as I had wanted the wheel refurbished. With the amount of driving I generally do he did not want me to be unsafe so he gave me a loaner. He called every step of the way and gave me the cost of repairs. He made it easy and he was available in a pinch. I was extremely grateful. ,4.8

45,"January 19, 2020","Worked with Victor Bernal setting up check. Cris conducted inspection. Result was no leaks. Cris completely cleaned the car underneath the engine to check. For the first time, received the e-mail with the video of the inspection. Outstanding! Cris talked me through his process of cleaning and checking while showing the video. Easy to see what and how he checked everything. Made me very comfortable with the result.
I have worked with Victor for many years. Has always been helpful and professional in servicing the car and looking ahead to preventive items. 
Don't think I could get service this consistently good anywhere else.
Thanks very much.

53,"January 01, 2020","Very friendly team. Excellent service from salesperson Ashot Galoyan and General Manager Alex. Absolutely no pressure. I was shown all cars on back parking, told about features and packages. My selected car (trim, color, package etc) was not in dealership in that time. Alex found such car in other dealership, reserved and delivered it next day. Ashot spent much time to  explain me details of design and operation. Ashot and Alex are very friendly and professional persons. I am absolutely satisfied with their service.

93,"July 26, 2019","After quite a bit of research on compact SUVs, I narrowed my list to three, including the Mazda CX-5. My wife and I visited Town North Mazda about a month before we needed to make our purchase. Our sales pro, James Fuquay, was the definition of a product expert. We reviewed the various trim levels and decided to test drive the Signature Edition. We were up front about our timing; that did not impact in any way James' attention to detail. He reached out to us one time after our visit to make sure we had all the information and experience with the car we needed. After visiting the other two dealers, comparing the plusses and minuses of each car and dealership, and approaching our purchase deadline, we went back to Town North Mazda. We set up an appointment with James and in less than an hour had a 'done deal'! The F&I experience was painless... and James did a terrific job through the sales process all the way to his vehicle delivery training. Can't recommend James enough... and the CX-5 is as fun to drive and as nice a vehicle as any we have ever owned. Kudos to Town North Mazda, James and Mazda... very much a great car-buying experience.",5.0

I’ve used their service department for oil changes, and love the ability to make an appointment online. i also suffered some body damage when I hit some debris on the highway.

They did draw out the buying process and had everything in order when we went to drop our trade in and get the CX-9.  Not totally in and out due to state documents, but would have been without those!

108,"April 18, 2019","We needed to buy a new vehicle to replace our worn out van.  Searching online as most people do now, we found a Mazda CX-3 that we wanted to take a look at.  We contacted Railynn online and setup a test drive for Saturday afternoon.  Arriving at Town North, Railynn was engaged with another customer and she introduced us to Neal.  We drove the CX-3 and, while it is very nice to drive, it was a little too small for us.  So, we took a test drive in a CX-5.  This was a better fit for us and what we were looking for.  We took a break for lunch and left the dealership.  I wanted some time to review the CX-5 alone because I had not done any research on that model.  Later in the day, we called Neal and asked if the red 2016 was still available.  It was and we went back for a test drive.  We liked the vehicle and started proceeding forward.  The only issue was that it had not gone through the inspection process.  There were a couple of small items we had seen that was going to be fixed during the inspection.  So, we had the option to complete the sales process (Saturday night), but we would not be able to take the car until Tuesday.  

Beginning after 7 that night, we signed paperwork with Frank and finished after the dealership had closed.  

Unfortunately, the actual pickup of the car was delayed until Thursday.  When I finally arrived to pick up the car, I will admit I was not in the best of moods of the constant delay.  Railynn met me in the sales office and was very upfront and honest with me.  She said the delay was caused be miscommunications between service and sales and took complete responsibility for the problems and then not being able to relay correct information to me.  Not only was she honest with me, it was obvious that she was upset with the confusion.  Seeing someone who truly shows commitment to her customers after the deal is done is wonderful.  It's that above and beyond that everyone who is in sales claims they do and, obviously, Railynn and Neal take it to heart.

211,"October 27, 2017","I had been helping my mother buy a new car to replace her 11 yr old, 200k mile Honda Pilot.  We settled on the Mazda CX-5, and used the internet to find the exact trim, color, etc.  We have no Mazda dealers nearby in E. Tx so I had been dealing with several dealers on the phone and email.  Town North came in $1000 less than the offers from Tyler, Shreveport, Longview, etc.  They even agreed to throw in extras like a bumper guard and all wx floor mats (no charge) after we had settled on a price.  

They knew I'd be driving my mother across the state to buy from them, and it seems the sales mgr. Christian Pritt had no hesitation to entice us that far.  I was leery that there'd be some slick big city sales tricks (a ""bait and switch"" perhaps), but they never came.  Arthur Arce was a very helpful salesman, and did everything necessary to process us through quickly.

I saw no hint of the usual car sales tactics that I was receiving from dealers closer to home.  Just a straight forward transaction.  This dealership has my highest recommendation, and I will be traveling to buy from them again!

A big PS:  They didn't try to blend and confuse the numbers with financing/trade in, etc.  The finance man didn't try very hard to push the extra add ons. He just mentioned them, and when turned down, moved on.  And I (NOT they) initiated the trade in.  The big surprise was after we had a deal on the new car, Christian came back with an offer to match our highest previous bid on the Pilot, which was way more than I expected to get for it, especially from a dealer!

Overall, dealing with Town North Mazda was a VERY pleasant surprise and welcome experience.

242,"September 06, 2016","Our experience with this dealership was horrible. They tried to stop us from doing comparison shopping at another dealerships by lying about extra charges and service fees. The salesman claimed he's a ""nice guy"" but rudely implied that we couldn't afford the vehicle we wanted, and said with a disdainful attitude that we were ""buying too much car for your [our] budget,"" which is incredibly offensive. However, we only asked for $100-200 off the vehicle so that we could both be satisfied with each other's business. We don't think this is an unreasonable request. 
The manager even further lectured us with a patronizing attitude saying he's never seen people negotiate like this. So we walked out and they chased us back with an offer to talk about the price. However, once we were back the manager humiliated us with his awful attitude. It was a really uncomfortable and humiliated shopping experience. We would not recommend anyone work with such a disrespectful and patronizing dealership.

Edit:
First, I received a reply from the manager on google review of the dealership with my name spelled wrong, something that apparently shows how careless and unconcerned this place is when dealing with customers. His response indicated and criticized that we negotiated and compared prices, which is absolutely normal and every would do if you are going to spend $30,000. I have abundant car purchasing experience for myself, my family, and my friends. I have never seen a salesperson or manager criticize a customer for comparing or negotiating price with such a bad attitude. 

While we were trying to go to other dealerships to compare prices, they attacked the other dealership by saying that they would up-charge us with other hidden fees and even ran out of the door to our car to tell us the other dealership doesn't have the model we wanted, which was a total lie since we just saw it right at the other dealership. 

Third lie, after we came back to work on price with Town North, we politely attempted to establish the customer-seller relationship by deducting $200 without any accessories asked in our price. The manager rudely refused, so we walked away again without any hesitation. The manager replied to our review on google saying that as we started to leave, ""his salesman asked if it's okay if he pass his pay of $100 to us so that he can take care of you [us]."" This is completely a lie, as his salesman again ran out to our car to offer us his $100 commission. All of this process and voices were clearly recorded by my dash cam, however this manager is misleading and dishonest on google reply. We never asked the salesman to take off his commission or pay for us. He offered this by himself. 

So, finally we walked to give them last chance and asked for $200 off and once again, the manager patronizingly and disdainfully dismissed us. All of the above is true, we are more than happy to provide our dash cam recording to prove this manager's dishonesty. We would warn all of our friends, family, and everyone of this dishonest dealership and disrespectful attitude towards customers.",1.0

When it came to negotiations, he was prompt in his responses via email which made the whole process painless.

He had this air about him that was as if he didn't really need the money, but was working at the dealership just because he enjoyed it and was trying helping people find what they're looking for in a vehicle. This made me feel a lot more at ease through the entire car buying experience; I definitely felt that he was looking out for my best interest instead of just trying to make a buck. The cherry on top is that the sales manager and finance team were able to get me the car I wanted at a competitive price and at a lower interest rate than the other dealerships.

in the finance office, where the person ""explaining"" the paperwork felt compelled to speak so rapidly
as to be incomprehensible for the most part. Strange, as we were the only customers closing, with no one else apparently waiting. If I had not purchased many cars in the past, and been fairly familiar with the procedure, it would have been an intimidating and disconcerting experience.

He asked Arthur Arce in sales to show us the vehicle and we were so pleased with the way he explained the features of the car.  In the meantime, Alex put the figures together for a deal and, believe it or not, gave me the keys back to my current vehicle!  We told Alex we would have to consider the deal and would get back with him.  To our surprise there was absolutely NO pressure.  He thanked us for coming and told us to let him know if we had any questions or if there was anything else we needed.

After researching the car I wanted on the Internet, I emailed the Dealer and received a response within a few hours. I set up an appointment to come in and see the car and perform a test drive.  The staff was very attentive, friendly, non-pushy.  The two employees I worked with were very knowledgeable about the car and answered all of my questions. They even advised against certain add-ons they believed were not worth the extra cost (I purchased them anyway). After my test drive we discussed price which I found very competitive for both the new car and my trade-in. Within an hour or so, I drove off the lot with the new car.  Usually meeting with the Financing office is where the hard sell is made.  Although prepaid maintenance and a 5-year warranty was offered, there was no pressure to purchase them.  I was fortunate not to need to finance the car and was out of the Financing office in 5 minutes.  Yes, I said 5 minutes.  The experience was outstanding.  I sent a friend in to the same dealership and employees and they had the same experience as me.  I likely will be purchasing another care this year and plan to go back to the same dealer.  I have no criticisms to offer!  If you are interested in purchasing a Mazda, I recommend you look no place else.

280,"May 08, 2015","Excellent car buying experience.

First thing I appreciated was that they do not do what many new car dealers are now doing and adding $2k-$3k of ""dealer options"" (read garbage you don't need) to every car that comes in so you have no option of declining it.  They will only add what you request them to add.

Second, they seem to have the lowest prices of anyone in the DFW area.  I used the TrueCar app, and their dealership consistently came in well below all the other dealers.  They gave me a fantastic price without me ever haggling for it.

Even though they were giving me a great price, they worked really hard to find the exact car I wanted since they didn't have one on their lot.  They sent someone down to Austin to get the car I wanted, no questions asked, no additional fee charged.

When I arrived to sign the paperwork, they had everything ready to go in a very short period of time and within just a few short minutes, I was in the finance office.

Their finance guy worked with me to get a low interest rate, and actually took no as an answer when I didn't want to buy extended warranties or any other ""add ons"".  That alone is become a huge rarity in the car buying world.  Most places spend a HUGE amount of time trying to convince you why you need to buy an extended warranty or gap insurance or scotchgard, or whatever else.  Refreshing to find a place that didn't.

Salesman was fantastic to deal with.  Took me on test drives and then let me get back with him when I was ready to make a purchase, rather than incessantly calling and bugging me and pressuring me to make a deal.

All in all, a great place to buy a Mazda!",5.0

286,"March 25, 2015","We went to Town North Mazda in February, knowing the model and trim style we wanted. (2016 CX5 2WD Touring) We looked at cars, and our sales consultant, Richard Blye, was very helpful. He showed us several trim levels and talked to us about each one, but as we explained why we did or did not want certain features, he did not try to pressure us to change our mind or take an in-stock vehicle that was different than we desired. We weren't ready to buy the first time we came in, and Richard totally understood. He did ask for our name and number, and he texted us to let us know he was available whenever we were ready to buy. He did not text multiple times - just once so we had his number. We then configured the car on the internet, and all the other dealers put high-pressure email campaigns on us to come see what they had in stock, since none of them had that particular car in inventory. We also got an email from Will Miller and Alex Tsvang, but once we let them know we had already been talking with Richard, they just said, ""No problem. Call Richard whenever you are ready and we will honor the internet price."" When we were ready to buy, we contacted Richard and told him the exact car we wanted. When we got to the dealership, we found out from Alex that the car was in their inventory, but not yet on their lot. He asked if we wanted to look at a Grand Touring model, but we didn't want leather. So he said, ""No problem. Let me check how long it would take my driver to get that car here."" He was able to get it before noon the next day (I'm assuming it was at the Houston customs port). Meanwhile, we got a promotional email via email offering another $500 credit through March 21. We couldn't pick up the car until the 23rd and had not yet signed any paperwork, but Alex still honored the $500 credit since the car was already on the way to us. Both Alex and Richard were attentive, helpful, friendly and low-pressure. They told us options, but never pushed us. When it came time for the paperwork, I expected dozens of papers and an hour of paperwork along with the high-pressure pitch to buy extended warranties as I had experienced at other dealerships. But not at ALL! We got the paperwork done in a very short time, and it was clear and simple. Overall, everyone here was great and the whole experience was comfortable.

I had the opportunity to look around and see what I liked first and then ask for help. They were considerate, polite, and very honest (rare experience for me); even considering that I shop around for the best deal to get exactly what I want. I felt like it was about me and not just the dealer trying to get a commission out of a sale. I test drove the CX-5, played with all the buttons and features, and asked tons of questions.

I was promptly greeted and met by Will in a timely manner. He was very friendly and accommodating and took a moment to listen to what I was looking for before showing me anything. We then went over to a desk to discuss options for financing or leasing and I was given information on both options with which to make my decision. The whole time Will was helpful without being too overbearing.

After making my decision Will gave my information to finance to work with and, while waiting, Will spoke with my family members and I just to make us feel more comfortable and welcome. Once we heard back from finance I was able to finish the paperwork and receive my car. I was keen about mentioning a free tinting special they had going and Will made the call to get my windows done which took about 2 hours off site as this was a Saturday. Once the car was done I was given the key and told to enjoy which was a given at that point ;)

Overall I felt very comfortable at Town North due to a very relaxed and welcoming environment.

304,"October 15, 2014","I am a military member who worked the price through USAA/True Car and had it shipped to me (I did the shipping) as I am stationed in Alabama.  I could not find the car/color Mazda 3 s Grand Touring that I wanted within 250 miles. So I used the Mazda web site to find the exact match and then re-used USAA/True Car to find a dealer, in the Dallas area there were 4 and all in were in the USAA/True car program. Initially Town North was in the middle of the prices so I started with the least expensive. I am not going to name the dealers on prices but after 4 days the 1st dealer finally said they could not do the deal with me not coming into the dealership which I made clear I was interested in their ‘delivery’ option.  I then tried the most expensive, they were willing to match the lowest price if I sent the price sheet to them, but after 2 days they too said they needed me to come in even though they also advertised 'delivery available'.  I then sent my info to the remaining 2 dealers in the middle, Classic of Denton’s salesperson was rude when I asked the question if they required me to come in through their Chat system. Then I got to Town North, Will Miller was very good, looked into it and said they could do it. At this stage I never even asked if he would match the lowest price. I had all ready looked for this vehicle and knew it was nearly $2,000 cheaper than my local dealer and almost $1,500 less than anywhere in Southern Alabama. I did see a pop-up on the Town North website that said I could save $1,000 for a loyalty bonus and to ask, so I did.  Will said he could save me $750 if I financed through them. I got a 1.74% rate a bit more than the deal at USAA through the car buying program but well worth it.  So I got this vehicle at a great price and with great customer service.

However, although I was told I might get more for my 2010 Mazda trade-in than we talked about once they saw the car, they dug in their heels and would not give a dime more than the lowest amount we talked about. The car's trade in value according to Edmund's Black Book was quite a bit higher than they were willing to pay. I am disappointed about that. Everything else promised by the dealer was honored.

I was surprised and disappointed to learn this dealership's service department in not open on weekends. That being the case, I will be servicing the vehicle at a dealership that is open on Saturdays. Also, difficult as it may be to believe, this dealership does not have a car wash machine. I was told all cars are washed by hand, which takes about 30-45 minutes. That means if my car was brought in to be serviced and I waited for it to be completed, the car would not be washed in a timely manner, if at all. While I do not know for sure, I can't believe this is the norm in the industry. My previous dealer, from which I purchased in excess of 10 cars, is open on Saturdays and will would wash my car whether brought in for service or not.",5.0

Customer service:
Before I and my wife bought our cars at this dealership we visited one of Honda dealerships.  People there was very pushy, and were going back and forth to their manager many times before could give us a final price. We had a feeling that they just playing with us to sell the car more expensive. At Town North Mazda we got the price we liked right away, and it was lower than Honda's with the same options in the car.
Quality of Work:
I and my wife got cars we wanted the same evening we came to buy them.
Friendliness:
As I mentioned above people at another dealership were very pushy and we had a feeling they just want to rip us off. At Mazda it was completely opposite. Nobody pushed us to buy anything, and we could see that people were honest and sincere with us.

405,"April 01, 2013","Shady, intentionally deceptive sales practices.
Below is the list of “Must Haves” and “Likes” I brought with me to the dealership; I met with Phillip Cashiola and he and I talked at length through each of these items. 

1.	Specific to the Mazda, we discussed the difference between the 2013 and 2014 being the engine / pick-up. I explained that I absolutely wanted the 2014 – which he agreed with since I was coming off the CX-9.
2.	Luggage rack and/or Trailer Hitch – I explained that it was a must since I was giving up the room of the CX-9. We will definitely have time when we need extra luggage space (including the weekend after I picked up my new car). 
3.	Homelink mirror – I explained that I had not been without a homelink mirror in the last 4 vehicles – so no longer even had a garage door opener as an option. He assured me all the Grand Tourings would have this – (and even covered the feature during my car walkthrough).
4.	Remote Start - this was very important if I was going to have leather seats again, as my office recently moved to a building with no covered parking. I would have gladly taken cloth seats – but they weren’t an option with the other options I requested. When I explained this to him – he said not to worry about it: I could have it added after market for less than $200 (while true for some vehicles - this is NOT accurate for the push-start Mazda class – which he should have known! Quotes I have received are way over this!) This feature was STANDARD on the competitor models I drove.
5.	Automatic rear door – obviously I expected a Grand Touring to come with this option – as it did with my CX-9. Phillip said that it wasn’t even available on the CX-5 because the hatch door is light (not heavy). That really has nothing to do with it – it is about convenience to handle it remotely and without using your hands. BUT since that is a Mazda design issue, I let it go. This feature was also STANDARD on the competitor models I drove.
6.	He also mentioned that there were no memory seats in this car. I figured that would be OK since I am usually the only driver anyway – but, not only can I not set multiple memory positions, it doesn’t hold mine! I have to reset it every time I get in.
7.	And then there was the keyless entry decision. While he did say I would not have it, I never realized how I had come to depend on it with my CX-9! Wow – having to work a remote to lock and unlock the doors is so out of habit for me. But that is an item that I acquiesced to – so my bad.

Reality:
After the beating of two hours there – Phillip handed me a vehicle description sheet and asked “if we can get you a car with these options, would you buy it today”? I again reiterated “so – the only things that are missing are 1) keyless entry and 2) the navigation system.?” He said yes. “And it has a luggage rack?” – again he pointed to the luggage bars and said “yes”. So I said yes – I would take a vehicle that had all those things – I did NOT say I would buy THAT vehicle; nor was it put to me that way! But – since he had me initial that sheet – he told Christian that I agreed to buy THAT car (which I NEVER would have, since it was a 2013!)

Then I made the crucial mistake – agreeing to sign papers before seeing the car. My gut knew better – but I had NEVER been taken advantage of by a dealership (and I have personally leased all of my own cars since 1988). Plus – this was the ONLY time I had ever repeated at a dealership – so what could go wrong??

Well – to start off with: 
1)	The car delivered to me was a 2013. I had ALWAYS said only a 2014!
2)	There was no homelink mirror- again had been assured that it would be there. And he even covered it in my car walkthrough (which he did inside the building – not the car; probably because he knew he did not deliver the correct vehicle I asked for).
3)	There were running bars on top – but no “cross bars”? Having never needed a luggage rack – I didn’t realize there was a difference. So at that point I had no way to store luggage on top – and a girls’ trip that weekend for 4 women! 
4)	And of course – there was no remote start: and now I can’t afford to get one because they are NOT less than $200.
5)	I had to spend $40 getting a new remote for my garage door at home just to get in.
6)	And regarding financing – the “agreed to price” at most should have been  $28,580 sticker – and I would think a returning customer would get a break off that (since I even got offered discounts at the other dealerships where I had not purchased before). Yet – on my paperwork the price apparently went up to $29,275 – which again was my bad; I did not notice before I signed. But that little $700 increase was DEFINITELY in bad faith!

I feel utterly humiliated. I am now the official poster child for being taken advantage of at a dealership: the one that I did repeat business at! Wow!! 
I have tried to get past it – and chalk it up to my own fault. And while I am ashamed that I was not looking for the worst in people – I certainly hope that Christian and Phillip are also ashamed since I believe they KNOWLINGLY delivered a car that I must now live with for 3-1/2 years that does not meet my expectations or needs. In a time that should be so happy – something to really enjoy (as I usually would) – that has all been taken from me. 

And when I returned crying to the dealership the next day – I had one question: did they INTENTIONALLY sell me the wrong car – or were they just not paying attention when I explicitly stated I only wanted to look at 2014s? – They refused to answer that question – only Christian kept continually pointing to a sheet I had initialed (which I was told meant I would buy a car with those options – not THAT car!).

When I complained up to management - I have not received any contact to try to understand or rectify my situation.

Very sad. Learn from my mistakes. ",1.4
406,"October 08, 2012","I went with a friend to this dealer for a warranty battery replacement on a Mazda with less than ten thousand miles.  The vehicle battery had died on a warm summer evening and required  being jumped.  The next morning the vehicle was sluggish and repeatedly went dead on hills.  A nearby oil change franchise ran diagnositcs on the vehicle and they reported it having a weak battery that required replacement.  They documented their findings and instructed us to go to a dealer for warranty repair.  

This seemed at the outset to be an easy problem for the dealership to resolve   We waited 90 plus minutes for them to run diagnosticcs. Upon which time they advised the battery was fine according to their instruments.  The dealership then did a test drive with my colleague in which the vehicle failed repeatedly.  The dealership first stated this was due to driver error.  When this wasn't acceptable we escalated the problem to the service department supervisor.  He was confrontational from the outset first stating they couldnt recreate the problem and refused to replace the battery.  He then stated it was unsafe for his employees to test it on a hill and recreate the issue.   Ultimately he came up with multiple excuses to avoid replacing the battery.  He advised us to go to a competitor Mazda dealership to have the problem addressed.  

Given this was the most basic problem to solve.  Just a new battery that is under warranty on a nearly new vehicle.  This should have been a simple resolution.  The customer service at this dealership was abysmal.  The service department manager refused to advise us who his supervisor was.  The service department manager was discourteous, confrontational, aggressive, made little eye contact and made no effort to seek a solution.  It was clear his only agenda was to defer us to a different dealer.  

This was a very poor experience.  I highly recommend seeking another dealer both at purchase and at warranty service.  ",1.0

I paid for the new battery and was told the check engine light was just because my gas cap wasn't turned tight enough.  They turned the light off and fixed the tail light and off I went.

3 weeks later my check engine light came on again along with my gas cap is loose light.  Also, the tail light they fixed had actually fallen off the car.

As soon as I pulled up the sales person asked from my DL and insurance card, had me sign one form and told me bye. The car was dirty (crumbs in the cup holder) and dust everywhere and he only gave be 1/4 tank of gas to drive from Richardson to Arlington and back. You got to be kidding me! The following day when I spoke with his manager, the manager seemed surprised by the sales person behavior and told me he would make it ""right"" when I brought the car back in. My husband and I went back into the dealership the next day hoping to get good service. The car deal was done because my husband really wanted the car for me however there were issues with the windshield. The dealership offered to fix it, with a promise to have the car detailed and with a full tank of gas. When they delivered the car to my husband, it was just as dirty as it was when we took it back, with only 1/2 tank of gas (which we had put in there ourselves). The excuse was that it was raining hard and the window company told them not to clean the inside of the car because of the treatment they did to the windshield. They can't be serious. Rain or windshield repair has nothing to do with a tank of gas or even wiping down the seats or the cup holder. I will never buy another car from the dealership or recommend them to anyone.

I happened to come across the Town North website by accident, and boy was I glad I did. I sent an enquiry email about a special on the site, and had a very prompt reply from Christian, answering my questions and inviting me to visit the showroom.
My wife and i went along that evening and had the pleasure of meeting Mat. We explained our situation, that we saw the offer, and would like a test drive, but were not going to buy that day. He couldn't have been more helpful and courteous. The best thing about his style was that at no time did i feel that we were being ""sold to"". He listened to everything we said, and answered all of our questions, without ever ignoring them so he could get his sales pitch done. 
After the drive, we met Christian, and both he and Mat helped us with finance and other queries we had. We left the office very happy with the service we had received.
After test driving other cars, we decided to go with the Mazda. When I rang Mat to confirm our interest, he made the rest of the process so easy.
I will say that it was not at all intimidating or pressurized when we went back to do the deal. Everything was presented and explained very clearly and simply. Lisa in the finance office was very straight and down the line about our options. She, like the other, did not try to oversell or push extras on us. I felt she was very honest in her answers to our questions.
All in all, it was a very pleasant experience (as pleasant as making that monetary commitment can be!). 
I would have no hesitation is sending any family or friends to deal with Mat. In fact I have already suggested to my sister-in-law that she looks at the CX-7.

This dealership seems very family oriented and family friendly.  I had a long discussion with Christian about work life balance and the care they give their employees.  
Lisa in finance was very helpful and shopped around for the best rate for me, even though I had a rate through Texans.  She also offered me advice on warranties.  She was very helpful and I trusted her input.
I also like the personnel in the service department.  
I highly recommend this dealership and would gladly do business with them again. ",5.0
419,"June 28, 2010","Working with Matt Daggs was great. He is so energetic. He listened to what we were looking for in a new vehicle and recommended what might interest us. He was extremely knowledgeable about the features on the vehicle, both standard and optional. We had fun discussing price with Chris Pritt. We think we got a good and fare deal on the price. Even though we were already pre-approved with another institution, finance worked to see if they could get us better financing. This is our second Mazda from Town North. Victor Bernal (our service rep) has always gone above and beyond when ever we needed service on our vehicle. We returned because our first vehicle from Town North was a quality vehicle. When we needed it, Victor was a wonderful service rep and I am keeping him.",5.0
420,"June 25, 2010","I had superb, attentive service from start to finish.  Everything promised was delivered without drama.  Will Miller made the sale, Christian Pritt stepped in to finalize the pricing details, and Craig Morris handled the financing paperwork.  Very pleasant experience all the way around. I would definitely recommend this dealership.",5.0
421,"June 15, 2010","The dealership did a great job with my car purchase. The matched and beat the price that Freeman Mazda had offered me. It saved me the trouble of driving all the way to Irving. It was a Saturday at 6.45pm and the key staff stayed behind to complete all the paperwork and had me out the door by 8pm. I had heard bad reviews about the dealer from several people and was really hesitant about buying from them. But, it turned out to be a good experience.",4.2
422,"June 11, 2010","Matt was wonderful, knowlegdeable and very helpful.  I will definately by my next Mazda from him.  Craig and Lisa were also very helful with the financing portion on the purchase of my 2010 Mazda Miata.  It's so fun to drive, having a blast with it!!!",5.0
423,"June 11, 2010","Great experience!  Worked with Matt Daggs who focused first on helping me understand the quality of the Mazda6 I bought, followed then by the appropriate price negotiations.  Matt and Alex Tsavang offered me reasonable pricing alternatives.  Assertive but not pushy with a clear motivation to work with me in order to make the sale happen.  Matt had the right amount of sales aggressiveness combined with the willingness to negotiate.  The financing process went smooth, without the familiar uncomfortable final push to sell you everything else.  Today I took it in for plates installation and some customization and had zero issues.  The service department was both helpful and accomodating.  Town North may not be the biggest Mazda dealer in Texas, however they certainly treated me like one their biggest customers. Overall one of my best car buying experiences.  I would recommend Matt Daggs any day!   ",5.0
424,"June 06, 2010","Overall we had an extremely positive experience.  Our salesperson was knowledgeable, helpful, and very accomadating. He never pressured us and made the experience positve. From the test drive to the financing, we had a great experience.  Our car was ready when promised and he even helped me sinc up my phone.  I love my new car and have already recommended Matt and the dealership to several people.  In fact my parents haven't bought a brand new car since 1960 and are considereing coming to Matt.   ",5.0
425,"June 05, 2010","I just moved to the Dallas area and needed a new car.  I was able to test drive a few cars while renting them for work but most of my car shopping had to be done without a car- obviously not the easiest thing in the metroplex.  I spent a good couple weeks getting internet quotes from every dealer in the DFW area.  

Will Miller was the person I worked with from Town North Mazda.  While the initial quote he gave me was not very competitive next to some of the others he did tell me that at anytime I could come in with a quote from another dealer and he would without a doubt beat it.  After getting a reasonable price from some other dealers I decided to stop by Town North (since it was the only one easily accessible by public transportation) to see how serious Will was about price matching.  I showed him the quote and he came back within a minute and beat it.  No questions.  No hassle.  

Next we had to actually get the car I wanted.  I admit I was a bit picky in wanting a manual in a certain trim and certain color.  Even though there were almost no cars in the area with my preferences Will and his manager Alex said they would see what they could do and they let me borrow another brand new car until they could get the car I wanted on the lot.  Will apparently worked with one of the other people at the dealership (Christian I believe) and after working the phones for 8 hours plus they finally found the exact car I wanted...in Austin.  

A day or two later the guy brought the car up from Austin and I went to pick it up.  Even though I wanted a manual transmission I had never actually driven a manual before.  Will took time out of his day and gave me a much needed lesson on how to drive a stick shift. It was completely unnecessary on his part but totally appreciated on mine.

All in all I had a very positive experience with this dealership and their salesmen.  They didn't use some of the pressure/sleaze tactics I saw at some other DFW dealers.  Everything was very upfront and honest.  There was some pressure in the finance booth to get a warranty but nothing unexpected or out of the norm.",4.6
426,"June 01, 2010","I purchased a new Mazda 3 from Town North Mazda, specifically, worked with Will Miller and was extremely satisfied with his outstanding professionalism and the overall purchase process.

Initially, I worked with Will over the phone and once we had agreed on a price, we set a time to meet.  Once my wife & I arrived at the dealership, Will greeted us and escorted us to view the available models (exterior/interior colors).  Once we decided on the exact Mazda 3, Will took us back to the showroom floor and made us feel comfortable and offered us free drinks (water or soda).

As Will worked through the purchase logistics, he would re-visit us to keep us updated on what steps have been completed and steps still pending. Before we knew it, the car was detailed and ready to drive home.

Prior to this purchase, I have never owned a Mazda. However, based on my experience yesterday, I am certain once I am ready to buy another vehicle, Town North Mazda will be on the top of my list.

427,"April 17, 2010","I received a quote from the Internet Sales Associate named Will. He agreed to beat a quote I had received from a competitor by $200 plus offered to provide Satellite installation for $399 (invoice price for this option). Will provided a written confirmation of this quote, which was itemized via email. I had the final ""out-the-door"" price confirmed via email as well. I paid a deposit of $500 to lock this price and to order the desired car (a 2010 Mazda 5 Grand Touring in red) and the car was shipped from Houston, TX to the dealership in Richardson, TX. On the day of delivery (4/17/10), I was told the install of the satellite system could not be done until the following week because the dealership would have to order it, despite being assured by Will prior to our arrival that the install would take place on the day of delivery. Despite the inconvenience, I agreed to pick up the car on 4/17/10 and to bring the car back for the install of satellite the following week. When my family arrived at the dealership, Will took some of our information and told us the finance dept would be with us shortly to receive our payment (we were going to pay in cash for the amount in full). After waiting for almost one hour, Will returned to us explaining that his manager would not be able to honor our agreement. When my husband asked to speak with the manager, Alex Tsvang, he confirmed this stating that ""the other manager who approved this price made a mistake"" and that the amount we were quoted in writing could not be honored. He said he was willing to accept the agreed upon price for the car ($22,399) without the installation of the satellite system. We told him that this was unacceptable and that they were violating a written contract. He said he would not make any money on the deal and claimed he would be fired if he sold the car at this price. After some words about the meaning of honoring ones word, we left the dealership.",1.8
428,"April 02, 2010","Bad experience from start to finish!
Here's my advice for anyone buying a Mazda in the DFW Metroplex: DO NOT do business with Town North Mazda. They’re either dishonest, fail to back up their promises, or both. Here's a brief chronicle of my misadventures with these people...
In doing research, Will Miller at the dealership quoted me his ""best internet price"" on a CX-9 Grand Touring. When I later tried to get more information about the vehicle and its options, all my calls and emails went unanswered. See, I had made it clear to Will in my one conversation with him (and also in my follow-up phone/email messages) that I wasn't coming into the dealership until I had arrived at a firm price on a vehicle they had in stock. 
So their lack of response made it seem they didn't want my business unless they could get me on the lot -- perhaps to upsell me on options or trim lines I didn't want. Maybe they thought they could get more money from someone who just showed up on the lot?? That's how it seemed and that’s my guess as to what was going on.
Two days later I got a call from a sales manager at Town North (can't remember his name) who said he was following up to an inquiry I had sent through Mazda’s main site. I told him I already had a quote on a car but couldn’t get anyone to call me back. Then he told me the vehicle in question was not on their lot. He said it may have been sold, he wasn't sure, but he could NOT offer me one at that same price. At this point, he tried starting the haggling process all over again. I told him it didn't seem honest to quote a price on a vehicle that mysteriously vanished. He assured me his people were honest but he still could not offer me the same price already quoted. I told him I’d be working with another dealership.
It was at this point I did some research and discovered the other bad reviews of the sales experience at Town North Mazda. Apparently other people had similar distasteful experiences. I should have gone with my gut and avoided these people.
About a week later I got a call from Frank at Town North, who explained he got bored working in finance at Town North and was now in sales and was following up on leads. I told him I had already had a bad experience with his dealership, but he promised he would be very attentive. So we started working on a price. I wasn't able to get the price or color I wanted, but we finally arrived at an acceptable deal on a white CX-9. This was Mar. 30, one day before Mazda's sales incentives were scheduled to end.
So I gave Frank my credit card number, to which they charged $500 to hold the vehicle. He promised it would be waiting for me, detailed and ready, and asked if I could come in the next day (Wed., Mar. 31). I told him it would be difficult due to some work obligations. He said it should not be a problem to come in Thurs. or Fri. to pick up the vehicle.
The next day (Mar. 31) I called and told him it would be very difficult for me to get away from work that day to finalize the paperwork, but I would do it if absolutely necessary. He spoke with someone else and confirmed it would be “no problem” to come in Friday. He said they would “back-date the contract or do whatever was necessary” to make sure I got the deal we had agreed to. 
So today I called before heading to the dealership, just to make sure they had the car ready. At this point I learned that Frank is no longer with the dealership. I was forwarded to Jamie Petree (new car sales manager), who was clueless about who I was or what deal I had made. I gave him a brief history of my deal with them. After some checking, he confirmed they still had the car in inventory but it had NOT been reserved for me and certainly was not sitting there waiting for me to come pick it up. I told him that as far as I was concerned I’d already bought the car since they took my deposit money. He said he’d have to call me back.
Will Miller later called and told me they would NOT honor the price I had agreed to because Mazda is no longer offering the same rebates. However, he said if I still wanted the car they’d be able to let me have it for $1000 more. You can imagine my reaction. They made a deal with me and took my money, told me when I could come get the car, and when I’m ready to pick it up, suddenly the price has gone up $1000. I couldn’t believe these guys were serious but they were. 
So what were they willing to do to make me happy? Will said he may be able to throw in some free window tint (which they were already offering for free anyway). I told him to refund the $500 and that I would be using every outlet I could find to tell people not to do business with his dealership. He didn’t seem to care.
So in short, these guys made a deal and buying arrangement s they wouldn’t back up. They took my money, told me the deal was done, and then suddenly upped the price. 
Don’t do business with them.

429,"April 11, 2007","My dashboard had been damaged when my car was broken into.  I decided to get a new one from the local Mazda Dealership here in Richardson, TX (Town North Mazda), so I scheduled it for them to install the new dash and to also check out a weird noise coming from the rear end. Well, they took 5 days to do it and when I went to pick it up they did not know how to re-install the GPS Radio back into the dash, the radio did not work one of the 'A' pillar covers was not reinstalled correctly, one of the defroster vents was broken, the radio antenna cable was damaged, the dash did not fit correctly and the GPS antenna wire was not tucked away and was laying across the dash, they left something inside the dash that rolls across it every time I make a sharp turn and the instrument panel lights do not work.  The Service Adviser (Victor Bernal) told me that they would pay to have the radio re-installed correctly.  I took it to the original installer (Circuit City) and after 4 hours and $200 later it was back to normal.  They also told me that the noise coming from the rear end was from my front brakes, so I had them fix those even though I found it odd that I was hearing the noise from the rear.  Now the dealership is not honoring paying for the re-install of the radio and they are calling me a liar and a fraud and say that they told me that they could not deal with after market radios.  This they told me when I went to pick the car up, not when I dropped it off.   They also ended up charging me double the labor rate for the dash install; this has been confirmed by the service advisor Victor Bernal.  They in effect charged me the mechanical rate when they should have been charging me the bodywork rate for the dash.  The noise from the rear end was still very apparent when I picked up the car; they never even drove it and decided I needed brakes.  I believe I have been defrauded as I never got my old parts back and do not believe that I needed brakes and now it is going to cost me more to fix everything they have broken in trying to do repairs to my car.  I have filed a BBB complaint as well as an FTC fraud complaint.",1.0
430,"July 03, 2006","I went in to ask a pricing on a new RX8, all I got was NOTHING but complete rudeness!  The sales rep was obviously more concerned about going home than making a sale.  He wouldn't even give me a quote!  Basically told me to get out because he wasn't interested in pulling out my credit record to make me an offer.  Asked him if he would at least give me a ballpark figure, his response, ""we don't make ball park figures.  we only give exact numbers.  now get out, I want to go home.""   
Let me tell you something, I work at Microsoft as a manager, and I make more money in one damn month than that moron will make in a year, and I find so damn hard to believe that he would actually go and treat a seriously potential buyer as badly as he did.  I can not believe that he is still working there.  But the bad thing is that he's not the only bad sales rep, I spoke with another rep online via emails, and that rep was just as bad.  These people have NO IDEA what customer service is about.  Or how to make a sale in general.  I DO NOT recommend anyone go here.  WORST place to buy a car.  might as well go and steal a car, you'll have a better time explaining yourself to the cops than you would trying to buy something from these idiots.  
If you are looking for a place that has GREAT customer service, try Freeman Mazda.  They are absolutely woderful.  Treat you complete respect, will do EVERYTHING they can do to answer all your questions and really know how to make each customer feel like someone and not just some joe blow.
