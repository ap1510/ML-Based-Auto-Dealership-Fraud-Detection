0,"May 05, 2020","Excellent truck buying experience from start to finish. Located a vehicle online, and was very impressed by the extra photos they posted. Truly showed every aspect of the vehicle. Outstanding sales and finance staff. I drove in from out of town and they made sure I had everything I needed. Super friendly, small town dealership experience with the professionalism you’d expect from a much larger shop.",5.0

5,"April 21, 2018","I have a 2016 GMC Denali 3500HD with less than 25000 miles brought to dealer with steering box leaking and a lot of play in steering and while the truck was in for service I let them do a oil change and lube. They replace steering box and change oil. Picked up truck and drop off my 2014 GMC  pickup for a/c blowing hot air. Still had play in steering. Got under truck to take a look, notice steering box leaking grease and no boot covering shaft coming out of steering box, splash plate covering steering box area was warped on one side and bolt hole areas were cracked and fracture, and truck was not lubed during oil change. Returned truck to dealer to get above fixed. They now said it’s was a wore out idle arm so they replace it and adjusted toe. They replace boot on steering box shaft (which they forgot first repair) and splash shield.did not lube truck again. Play in steering gone but now have a vibration in steering wheel witch I didn’t have before. Without them test driving now the problem is my tires.  Being a xxxxxxx to prove a point I went to a tire dealer and purchase 6 new michlen tires (1800.00) same as tires that come on truck witch only had 25000 miles. Return to dealer made them test drive and they said problem still tires and they need to do a 140 dollar road balance. And ask when do I wanted to make a appointment. The service advisors can do all this without checking the work already done by a mechanic that can’t even replace parts without forgetting some. And as far as getting it lube you have to tell them 3 time. I only asked twice because they do not grease unless told to. It’s my mistake to think they would lube truck when paying 225.00 for a lube and oil change without being told to grease grease certs. Quick lube did it for free. A/C on 2014 another long story.",1.6
6,"June 06, 2017",I bought a used 2014 dodge 2500 from Gulf Coast Chevy. On the test drive the check engine light came on and they promised they would fix it so i went on and singed the paper work. 2 weeks later they told me it was ready. I picked it up and the check engine light came back on. I called several times and let them know even texted the sales person and got no response. Mean while i was left with a $1500.00 repair bill on something they assured me would be fixed. ,2.0

8,"November 07, 2011","Tommy went out of his way to help us find a truck that would have enough power to pull our trailer. When the first truck didn't do the job he found us one that would. He was very polite and friendly and Ken & I will buy another vehicle from him when we need one.   
 Thank Tommy for your help, especially with the running boards. Couldn't have done it without your help.
