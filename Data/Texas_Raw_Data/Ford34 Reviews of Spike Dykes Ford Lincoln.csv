18,"March 04, 2018","The dealershinp ,sales dept. And service dept. All rate high but there is not any satisfactory  waiting area for sales or service.  There is no showroom area either  and sometimes  getting  out of the weather can be a positive  thing in sales.",4.4
19,"March 04, 2018","I had a blow out on a 2017 Fusion that didn't have a spare tire . I called Ford fleet cars as I was in my company vehicle and I followed the protocol that we have to take in this instance . After the tow truck towed my car approx. 5 miles to the dealership my car was dropped in the middle of the lot and I went in the explain to Shane my issues  . After I explained it to him he stated "" I sure hope that we wont have to replace your tire because I don't think we have any "" . So sure enough after the tire is removed he states that the tire has to be replaced and he was going to the back to see if he had one . ( I have been at the dealership 1 hour at this point ) . sure enough Shane comes out and states that he doesn't have one and that he is looking around town to see if he can find one . Mind you I am from Lubbock , TX and was stranded in LaMesa TX . So as we approach 3 hour mark I am approached by Shane and he says that a tire is coming from Lubbock that is 1 hour away with a driver and that once he gets there they will replace . I am highly frustrated at this point as I have now been there 4 hours . As I waited after that conversation I was later approached by a manger I assume and he says that the driver they thought was in Lubbock and had the tire just showed up and didn't have the tire so we are now at the same point we were at when I arrived . The solution that we finally came up with was to go down to a parts store and purchase a plug for the tire to get me home . Never once did they offer to take another tire off another car nor a loaner . The tire was plugged and I left the dealership and headed to Lubbock . After I arrived I parked my car with intentions of taking it to Pollard ford here in Lubbock as I knew the plug was only to get me home . Of course when I wake up the next morning my car was on flat and had to get a ride to work . I then had to come home wit ha air tank to air the tire up just to get me to the dealership and have it changed . Needless to say I will never use a Ford dealership with my personal vehicle because if this was my personal vehicle this type of service is uncalled for.  ",1.6
20,"February 23, 2018","They were quick, good communication, helpful, and friendly.  They help line up towing of my vehicle and then provided a car runner back to my home town.",5.0
21,"September 19, 2016","Let me start by saying that I have always hated buying vehicles. Of all the things that have caused grief in my marriage, buying vehicles is easily at the top. Apparently, we have just been buying vehicles in the wrong place and with the wrong people because in the last couple months, we have bought multiple vehicles from Spike Dykes Ford in Lamesa. Our experience with the dealership was the exact opposite of any vehicle-buying experience we have ever had. The employees that we worked with had great work ethics, customer service and personalities. It was a pleasure, and we are already spreading the word.",5.0
22,"August 26, 2016","The customer service was wonderful and purchasing a vehicle with Spike was the best decision I've made! They made my purchase hassle and worry free. I HATE dealing with car dealers, but Felix Medina restored my confidence. I highly recommend Spike for your next vehicle purchase and know I will be a returning customer!",5.0
23,"August 24, 2016","Just bought a new F150 from Spike Dykes in Lamesa, TX.  My salesperson Mike Steward was great, we did everything online and all I had to do was sign and drive.  The price was really good and finance went well too.  There were no gimmicks like nitrogen in the tires for $500 or extra cost for valueless items like clear coat protector or undercoating. The finance manager didn't push any add-ons either (that was a first for me).  Really a breath of fresh air not to have extras pushed on you at every step of the buying process. Spike blows away the local dealers in San Angelo hands down.  Worth the trip!",5.0
24,"April 01, 2016",The people at Spike Dykes are friendly happy people that help you find what you need. They were patient and didn't force me into buying anything but we came to a deal on a 2016 F150! I've bought there before and happy I went back again!,4.8
25,"January 07, 2016",Quick and friendly buying experience. Felix and Joe even helped me unload everything from my old truck to my new truck. Couldn't be happier!,5.0
26,"December 24, 2015",Mark Ray is a great sales person. I have purchased many vehicles from him and he is the best. Darin Eply is also great! Everyone there treats me with respect. I highly recommend this dealer.,5.0
27,"December 20, 2015","The sales staff and management are a step above the rest. They went beyond my expectations when not only selling us the exact car We wanted by bringing it in from out of state, but also dealt with a very difficult warranty issue. The GM personally took control and resolved the issues and compensated us for our weeks of disappointment and aggravation. Two thumbs up. ",5.0
28,"November 18, 2015","The salesman found the exact truck I wanted when other Ford dealerships in Lubbock could not.  He made sure that is was loaded exactly as I wanted, arranged to get the truck to me asap.  A very nice clerk brought all the papers to Lubbock for me to sign and the next day another person delivered my truck and made sure I was satisfied.  I have never had a dealership work this hard to sell me a truck.  Actually they sell was easy, I knew what I wanted and they found it.  They did all the running so I didnt even have to leave my office.",5.0
29,"November 04, 2015","My friend referred me to Darrin and the Spike Dykes team.  It was a real favor.  I was treated right, offered every courtesy and given every opportunity to try out the truck.  Options were explained well, and the videos were a great help in understanding this new technology.  OVERALL GREAT EXPERIENCE.  LOOKING FORWARD TO A LONG RELATIONSHIP.",5.0
30,"November 03, 2015",Tommy Brown offered the best customer service by far! The whole staff did a great job handeling this deal. Spike Dykes in Lamesa has earned my loyalty as a customer!,5.0
31,"November 02, 2015","I actually purchased my vehicle while getting my hair done at the salon.  I found it online, contacted the dealership, and within just a few minutes I completed my purchase.  Mike made everything so easy.  He even delivered it to my house so that I could surprise my son with his new truck later that night.  I will purchase my next vehicle from Mike at Spike Dykes Ford Lincoln Mercury.  It was the best experience I have ever had purchasing a vehicle. ",4.8
32,"July 23, 2015","Got my transmission serviced and when I got home it was leaking real bad, took it back next day they said they fix it for me and got home same leak I don't think they touched it the second time worthless mechanics ",1.2
33,"August 03, 2013","Went to this dealership to buy a new Ford. After showing them a quote I received from another dealership for the truck I wanted, Peter said he would try to match the deal. After making me wait over an hour, he comes back with nothing even close to what the other dealership was offering me. He even had the nerve to tell me the only way they could come close to the quote I provided was I put me in a used truck.  This place doesn't want to give good deals and likes to give customers the run around. ",1.5
