0,"May 31, 2020","I visited Huffines Hyundai Plano recently and took delivery of a 2020 Sonata SEL. My sales consultant Tom Chu was great. He was very personable, efficient, knowledgeable and friendly. 

From test driving to financing took about an hour and a half. I was not ""stuck"" at the dealership all day and I loved it. 

Excellent team of employees!!! I'm coming back for the G70 next!!!!",5.0
1,"May 15, 2020","The dealership in general was very welcoming without being too ""salesy."" We had a wonderful experience and ended up wit the car we wanted at the price we had in mind. Tina was very welcoming and new a lot about the 2020 Palisade. She gave us a full run down of all of the features before we headed off for the test drive. This helped us to get the most out of the test drive. She was patient with all of our questions, and made sure we felt comfortable before we signed the dotted line. She even helped take pictures with us in the new car! If you visit Huffine's, be sure to ask for Tina. She will take great care of you!",5.0

3,"April 30, 2020","I did my research, contacted many other Hyundai dealers in the area, and ended up working with Sean Napoles at Huffine's Hyundai in Plano after finding other salespeople were too pushy, not knowledgeable, and did not follow through.  Sean was the complete opposite ... he was easy to talk to, he clearly listened to my needs, he was more knowledgeable than any other salesperson I have EVER dealt with in my over 40 years of car buying, and he paid attention to the details, delivered exceptional service, and facilitated a great deal. Sean is a really nice person to work with.  I will definitely seek Sean out in the future and return to Huffine's Hyundai when I'm in need of a new car in the future.  .  ",5.0
4,"April 30, 2020",I recently purchased a 2019 Santa Fe from Tom Chu and this wonderful dealership. Tom is the most caring and knowledgeable sales associates that I‚Äôve ever met! His professionalism and expertise is second to none! My wife and I are grateful to Tom for his assistance and follow up after the sale. I highly recommend Mr. Chu and Huffines Hyundai Plano to anyone who may be in the market for an excellent vehicle purchase experience.,5.0
5,"April 30, 2020",What a pleasant car buying experience this was!  No pressure to buy - let us test drive as many vehicles as we wanted until we made our decision.  Drove away with a beautiful Black Forest Genesis G-70 and couldn't be happier.,5.0
6,"April 30, 2020","Great experience from the start. Sean found just the car I wanted and made the entire experience easy. Since I have purchased my Elantra GT,  I have brought it in for a tire check and oil change and everyone was pleasant and took quick care of me. When I buy another, I definitely plan on coming back to Huffines Hyundai Plano. And ask for Sean.",5.0

11,"March 03, 2020","Like most people I dread the new car buying experience, but I had no reason to be concerned with Huffines Hyundai. Tina, my sales person, was extremely organized and professional. And best of all, she listened to me. She answered all my questions, sold me what I wanted and did not push stuff I didn't want. The Finance department was equally good. They informed me about their offerings, but listened when I said there were things I did not want.

I got what I wanted and spent less time doing it than with any other dealership I can remember (and since I'm in my seventies, I've dealt with lots of dealers over the years). Thjis was a car buying experience that almost makes me look forward to buying another car (I'll actually wait a few years until the next time). I heartily recommend Huffines",4.7
12,"February 27, 2020",Always a pleasure to take my car in for service from making the appointment with the friendly voice on the other end to the courteous and prompt reception upon arrival. ,5.0
13,"February 12, 2020",Nathan was excellent and took care of my car the moment I walked in to the service center. He is very good and explained the problem and called me back with updates and suggestions. I saved his no for future trip. Hopefully I don‚Äôt have to go back :). ,5.0
14,"February 10, 2020","Just purchased a 'new-5119 miles' loaner car for my wife.  Huffines prides themselves on a 'low price guarantee' based on integrity according to their website.  I found integrity lacking.  The finance people were nothing but lacking in integrity. After review of the edocs given after the sale, I found most forms are not complete.  The sales tactic included payment info prior to repeated requests for an interest rate offer to both the sales person and the finance rep.  Sales person committed 3 years maintenance program free and finance said it did not apply to my purchase.  After having the sales person come into the finance office and apologize for his 'mistake' we informed him that was not acceptable.  I have deep reservations concerning the service contract that was provided based on this initial lack of integrity. ",2.0
15,"February 10, 2020",Joon Lee was my salesperson.  He was very knowledgeable not pushy and kind.  I will recommend him to all of my friends and family.  Everyone there was great and smooth process and I love my new car. Thank you Joon and Huffines.,5.0

21,"January 20, 2020",Friendly service and fast turn around on my first service visit.  Comfortable seating area.  Wandered over to parts for a question and they were very helpful. Very good experience!,5.0
22,"January 20, 2020",Love my new car!! Our sales guy (Jonathan) made this one of the best buying experiences here! This is the 5th car we have bought from Huffine's over the years and this was by far the easiest and best!,5.0
23,"January 18, 2020","I am a first time customer to your service department. I called and spoke with Dan about my repair.  He helped me over the phone with some basic troubleshooting to make sure I really needed to bring my car in for repair. He was very pleasant to work with and kept me updated the entire time. He even set me up a rental car at Enterprise beore I even got there. I will be requesting him in the future!

 My only complaint is about the receptionist.   I had never been to your service department before so I parked out front and walked in to the service department.  The receptionist was on her cell phone so it took a minute for her to look up and acknowledge me.  I told her at that I was here for an appointment and she rudely told me that I needed to pull my car on to the drive.  I asked her why and she told me that ""that's just what we do here"" and she got right back on her phone.  I do not feel like I was treated fairly in that situation as a new customer.   There were several options she could have offered. Such as, walked me over to my service advisor or had the porter pull my car into the drive. I do not feel like it was necessary for me to walk in the building and then have to walk out  and pull my car on to the service drive for me to be acknowledg'd by your staff.

 Nonetheless,my experience with Dan was great and by no means is the receptionist's lack of customer service  a reflection on him. I do however recommend more customer service training for your less experienced personnel. ",5.0

28,"December 31, 2019","Christian Lewis was my sales associate from October 2020 (time of my initial inquiry about a new Palisade), through reserving a vehicle early November, until date of purchase Dec 24, 2019. He was very prompt in addressing questions along the way, when I had requests ahead of time he was prepared when the vehicle arrived having addressed my requests, and the closing process was scheduled, easy, quick, and low pressured. Christian took his time in going through all features of the vehicle, was knowledgeable about them (and I note it is a new model), and he patiently answered my questions. I would also like to acknowledge Tina who took me on a test drive when Christian was unavailable. She was also knowledgeable and helpful.  This is my family‚Äôs 2nd purchase from Huffines Hyundai, and I trust not the last. ",5.0
29,"December 30, 2019","The sales associates are nice and knowledgeable but beware putting down a ""refundable"" deposit.  Our plans changed and we cancelled our hold on a vehicle.  Even after visiting with the salesman in person, and getting an assurance that the refund would be processed, it has been a month and the ""refundable"" deposit still has not been refunded.  Think really hard before putting down a deposit with these folks.",4.0
30,"December 28, 2019",Best car buying experience! Sean was so knowledgeable and made us feel so comfortable in the buying experience. Christie in finance was so sweet and that was the fastest I‚Äôve ever signed on a car. I live the advanced technology and going paperless. The dealership was beautiful and everyone was so friendly. We will be sending everyone we know to Huffines for a car. ,5.0
31,"December 26, 2019",Update in my experience. Its now about 6 weeks after and still having worsening issues with my head unit that randomly xxxxs off and makes loud buzzing noise. Finally get a hold of dealer and parts have been there for i sont know how long but they have forgotten about me. I have moved so can go to another dealer but now have to wait again for parts ordering because the advisor mario told me they wont send to other dealers. Which is strange because i know other hyundai dealers have bought parts off nearby dealers for cars. Maybe huffines just doesnt like other dealers at the expense of their customers needs. ,1.0

37,"December 06, 2019",I had a good experience purchasing the 2020 Hyundai Sonata.  I recommend customers schedule an appointment with a sales rep. Coming into the dealership on Saturday without an appointment resulted in a wait for a free sales rep. Arriving on a weekday with an appointment resulted in a better experience for me. ,5.0
38,"December 05, 2019",May take a little extra time. But they get it right. Always best to listen to the customer - most know their car and what‚Äôs going on,4.0
39,"December 01, 2019","The entire team (sales, finance, and management) was friendly and courteous throughout the entire process.  Negotiations on a new car are always a bit tough because a new car is such a big purchase.  However, I was always treated with respect, kindness and understanding through the whole process.  They knew I wanted a great price and worked to make it happen.  I got a great car at a great price.

Thanks to Cristina, Tom and the whole team at Huffines Hyundai at Plano.",5.0

42,"November 05, 2019","My interaction with Spencer was seamless from the beginning. I had already researched and picked which model I wanted, which was the Hyundai Elantra. Being that it was my first car that I was buying completely on my own, I was nervous that the process may be a long and tedious one. First meeting, I only wanted to test drive and see the car in person.Spencer didn't badger or pressure me into trying to buy that day. He gave me a bit more info and let me know he would contact me in a few days to see how I was fairing in the decision process. Instead of flooding my email and phone like other dealerships I had visited, he checked in twice over the span of a week and offered some additional assistance which I greatly appreciated. Pushy, overbearing salesman work my last nerve but Spencer was fantastic and I went in that following weekend to buy my car. Entire process took less than an hour and I got the car and payment I wanted with absolutely no hassle! Incredible! Frank was just as quick and efficient while completing my financing and I was out of there in no time, new car keys in hand. I would highly recommend Spencer and this dealership to anyone and everyone. Thank you Spencer and Huffines!!",5.0

44,"October 15, 2019","I went in with a quote from AAA/ true car discount. They still use the good guy / bad guy technique. Andy So was my salesperson- he was friendly  but used the hard sell  today only deal , everything was no problem. Then when I went to finance with Frank he played a harder, it is a problem game. should have walked out, when your are in moment you forget you can always do that.",1.0
45,"October 15, 2019","I knew what car I was looking for; however, I had a few questions about it.  Salesperson Thomas Chu was very helpful and knowledgeable.

47,"October 03, 2019","I had not been car shopping in 12 years but was forced to thanks to another driver totaling my beloved, but old, car! After researching many different vehicles, I decided on a Tucson and headed to Huffines because of their excellent reputation. Both Ammar and Ken were very patient and thorough in answering my questions. Ammar was exemplary in explaining the car's features and has followed up with emails. I found the price negotiation to be honest and fair.",5.0
48,"September 30, 2019","We were shopping for a new vehicle and decided to stop at the first dealership - Huffines Hyundai. We had not planned to purchase a vehicle that day because we were just going to shop brands. When we walked up to the showroom, we were greeted by Ammar Diab who offered to help us. I told him we were brand shopping which would have normally discouraged a salesman. Ammar was not discouraged. Instead, he offered to show us a new 2020 Tucson, point out all of the features, and take us for a test drive. After driving the vehicle, we were sold on a Tucson. I have never enjoyed the car buying experience because of the price negotiation with a dealership. I told Ammar that I wanted the best offer from the sales manager for the car and my trade-in. If we liked it, we would buy. If not, we would move on. The price that was offered was more than fair so we purchased the vehicle. 

Ammar also took me back to meet the service personnel, and he has followed up with emails to offer to help or answer any questions. We have also received follow-up emails from the sale manager and the service department. This was by far the best new car buying experience my husband and I have ever had. We would highly recommend Huffines Hyundai.",5.0

53,"September 01, 2019","The worst Service Department it's crappy , I left my car 32 days to be fix the Driver's seat and was not fixed. It's not the first time I take my car to be fix for the same problem and every time they come with a different outcome.
But this last time was on 08/29/2019 I received a call from the service adviser to bring my car to the dealership because there was a Hyundai engineer that will check my car and I left the car I took a picture to the Odometer and also I have a Dashcam and the next day I received a call from the same service adviser saying the engineer made a Test Drive and was not able to duplicate the problem \.
But wait How come he made a Test Drive and the Odometer it's showing the same mileage as when I left the car?
Also the Dashcam do not show any activity during the day I left the can and the next day.
This is incredible how this dealership Lie to their customers to get out of the problem.
I will never recommend this dealership for their service department they waste your time and lie.
I
My car has the problem since new and it's being there more than 7 times and every one of the times they lied to me inventing that they change seat when it was not, that they changed the seat frame when it was not , that they changed the seat cushion and it was not changed.
I made a complain direct to Hyundai but it looks they protect their partners the dealerships and they do not care for the customers who in reality we are the consumers.
I'm looking to Pursuit Legal action, because this is not acceptable I paid $28000.00 for a car and they gave me a jerk.
I will give less than CERO STARS but system doesn't let me do it.
Take your vehicle to other Dealership fro Service if you really want to be sure that they will service your car promptly.  ",1.0
54,"August 27, 2019","First stopped by doing research. Our sales associated, Jonathan Cruz, did a great job showing us our desired cars and discussing trim levels. Informed him I was not ready to buy for 2 weeks. No pressure from him. Reached back out after 2 weeks. We quickly reached a deal and was out of the dealership in under 90 minutes. No hassle. Pressure free!",5.0
55,"August 22, 2019","Everything went well for me. Buying at your dealership was my first pleasant car buying experience. Honestly I arrived hesitant and concerned as previously had bad experiences treated by sketchy sales men at other dealerships but to my surprise I received the best treatment by your transparent professional sales and finance departments. 

Found no hassle pricing, no pressure due to up selling something I don't need, got the right car at the right pricing. 

I've been always in love with Hyundai but not with dealerships....now that changed this weekend; you guys will become my one stop shop to update my vehicles. I am happy that ran into Huffines and have stopped hunting for an honest dealership.

Kudos to Christian Lewis and Frank (finance manager) .

59,"July 24, 2019"," I‚Äôm like anyone and I hate the whole car buying experience, but I have to say this was different!  My salesman was Jonathan Cruz.

He got me exactly what I wanted without any fuss or problems!  

From the moment I stepped through that door, to when I left with my new car,  I was treated very well!

So imagine my surprise when they started grinding and squealing. Had I'd known my brake pads needed replacing, I would have made them a priority versus the 60K MI service. 
Also, why don't techs put paper covers on the seats and on the floor? My armrest was severely scuffed up when I get my vehicle back today. Why? The I interior of these cars are where the customer spends a lot of time and the techs get in there and dirty up things. It's areas like this where particular attention to detail should be present and they are not. Please meet with your service staff to step up in these areas immediately. The dealership overall is very nice and clean and open and airy. It's cool to have a large area to wait in instead of being forced out into a showroom where the cars for sale sit. 

Thank you and until my next appointment. ",5.0

94,"March 20, 2019","I tried to buy a used car from this Huffines location in Plano. I have previously bought two new Hyundai cars from this dealership. I had been servicing 3 currently owned vehicles here for the last 9-10 years. I had dealt with Walter in used car sales to purchase vehicle for my daughter. All was well (or so we thought), we picked the CPO vehicle she liked and did the paperwork. We paid and took possession of the car on 3/16. Drove away, daughter tried to pair her phone to what was described to us as the HANDS FREE calling system. It turns out that this was misrepresented, it is only hands free to answer a call, to make a call you have to use your hands to utilize the touch screen/radio panel and dial your number; NOT SAFE. We immediately contacted Walter, who at first insisted it was hands free, told us to bring it back in and he would show us. Turns out I was right, Hyundai, Carfax and salesman all showed this as hands free system, but is not. Walter showed us a different car, a little more expensive but true hands free calling. I am thinking that since this was a clear misrepresentation by the sales staff, there will be some movement on the price or some accommodation made. I wasn‚Äôt expecting it for the same price, but I assumed it would come down a little bit, BOY WAS I WRONG! I attempted to speak with the PreOwned Director, Robert Spriggs. I started to explain the situation and that I am a repeat, loyal Huffines customer and explain what I was hoping for. What a waste of time, he is without a doubt, the NASTIEST, MOST UNPROFFESSIONAL  AND generally UNPLEASANT individual it has ever been my misfortune to deal with. There was no discussion, no back and forth, no apology, no nothing; just a take it or leave it attitude, so we left it. I guess his business is so good, they did not need mine. I encourage you to avoid this establishment. There are a multitude of dealerships to bring your business to where it will be appreciated, unfortunately, this is not one of them. I did speak to the General Manager of the Hyundai/Chevy Huffines Plano site, Mr. Roosevelt May the next Monday. He was very nice and apologetic but it was too little too late at this point. We had already purchased a different vehicle at a different dealership. For less than $1000 more than what Robert Spriggs wanted to charge me for a 2 yr old vehicle with almost 40 K miles on it, I got my daughter a brand new vehicle with 8 miles on it and a full warranty! I will be taking my business elsewhere and would encourage all who read this to do so as well!!!",1.0

I called them asking and they said that they don‚Äôt keep that part in stock and would have to order it,but that it would be covered under warranty. I bought a new car in the mean time and I wait another two weeks no response I call them again they say to come in I show up wait for an hour and a half before they notice me after helping people who arrived after me. Then they tell me the part wasn‚Äôt ordered and that I needed to bring the Elantra in for them to replace the visor. After another two weeks I walk in on a whim and buy the visor for 106.00 and left in my new car to replace the visor myself.

100,"March 01, 2019","Our family has been loyal Hyundai customers for several years now. We are on our 3rd and both of our kids own Elantra's. We have been to three different Hyundai dealerships, all of them were exceptional. So when my son took his car to your service department, I was not worried at all. Now I am baffled at the poor treatment in the service department. He had an appointment scheduled in advance, he dropped his car off and returned to find out not only was his car not done, but he had to come back because, ""they can't get to it till Friday."" So they gave him a ""loaner"" car that he now has to pay $50 to use because of their mistake. So as a recap, he took time off work to deliver his vehicle, he coordinated a ride to and back from the dealership, he called service before returning to get his vehicle, he left the dealership with his broken car, had to bring it back several days later so he could pay an additional $50 for their mistake. We only hope and pray the vehicle is done today. I have directed him to use the dealership in Mesquite from here on out. We will still buy Hyundai's, but we are sad about this service department.

We had things to do else where so we left and came back at about 2pm. The car was NOT done and Dale was at lunch. No one knew what the status  of my wife's car was so another member of Dales group came out and said it must have been delayed due to an unexpected longer repair on another car.

I was waiting in the lobby and he randomly walked up to me asking me questions about what company do I work for , how long have  I been with the company and also what was my job description. I didn't get his name but he was a taller guy whose office was behind the receptionist desk. I didn't like being questioned like that at all especially by some random employee. Other than that my experience was great  and I will refer  Rochean Spencer and you guys to my family, friends and coworkers. ",4.6

165,"May 21, 2018","Genesis Sales Representative Andy So is a certified Genesis G90 sales person.  This means that he knows EVERYTHING about this vehicle.  I did my own research before I decided to purchase this wonderful machine and Andy told me things that I hadn't uncovered.

I had called other dealerships and visited one but I felt most confident with Andy.  Huffines Hyundai in Plano is a well run and very accommodating dealership.  The facility is top notch and what you would expect from a luxury dealership.  

They are tough price negotiators but in the end I'm satisfied with my purchase.

So I am doubly grateful the guy in McKinney was such a jerk. When a customer says no it usually means no.

I was looking at the option to purchase RAV4 at the same agency I took the Camry, however, RAV4, isn't one of the leading in its class, so, I was checking other agencies, all of them where dishonest about their price as public in their web site, as they added their dealer ads, which made the car cost much more for things I really don't need (and probably cost almost nothing to the dealer). When I came to Huffines Hyundai I was pleasantly surprised to find an honest dealership. Sean, the sales person was the first sales person to show me the web site and walk me thru with the cars they have (all other agencies were either not sharing this information or just offered me what they wanted to sell most). The cost was transparent, without surprises, just excluding the TTLR, however, it was missing the 24 maintenance package which was offered to me freely by other agencies. I found this a bit disappointing at first, however, after negotiation we came to terms. Finally, I bought the car and financed about 40% of the car value with more than acceptable APR (better than I got from other agencies).

But for some reason, it always seems to take hours to actually buy a car. There were the obligatory 2-3 trips between us and the manager during the price negotiation, which is tiresome. We went in with what we thought was the fair value (based on TrueCar, Edmunds, and KBB), and after these several back and forth trips, they eventually agreed to our price.

When I asked for Jon, he came to meet with me quickly and was extremely patient with me during the entire process (asking me about my old car I had wanted to trade in to what kind of car I was looking for, etc). He took the time to look at many different kinds of hail cars and other cars with me and worked really hard to get the price that I had wanted along with lowering the monthly payments to an affordable range. Jon ran back and forth many times to work with my terms and price range. Overall, my experience with Hyundai and Jon was excellent and I would highly recommend him to anyone.

370,"July 13, 2017","We came to the dealership on Friday 6/30 at 6:00 PM. Due to the sale person wanting to sell the car in June we got stuck until past 11:00 PM. We felt pressured and when tried to leave and say we will come the next morning to sign the paperwork we were led to believe the deal will not be available. Due to the late hour and being tired I ended up not paying close attention to the paperwork and missed one detail that ended up costing me close to $1700. Couple days later when I realized that I called but basically was told deal is a deal and they will not do anything to rectify the issue.  I feel that the dealership took advantage of the time of the month and me wanting the car which left me with bad taste on how I was treated. That will effect me when I will be looking for another car which might be another Hyundai. More than likely I will not come back to that dealership for another vehicle.

 7/19/2017 - Update
I received a phone call from the general manager, Roosevelt May. I have explained to him my concerns and why I was not happy with the experience. He was very accommodating and understanding. That evening I stopped by the dealership and I had a check in the amount I felt I overpaid (almost $1700). This quick action  and understanding from Mr. May changed my opinion about the dealership and if and when I will be looking for another Hyundai I will go back to Huffines. That showed me they care about their customers and will do anything to keep or make them happy.",3.5

376,"July 12, 2017","We recently traded up from a 2015 Hyundai Santa Fe to a 2017 Hyundai Santa Fe. However, before deciding on the new Hyundai from Huffines, we visited several other near by dealerships to make sure we didn't over look some similar crossover SUV's (Jeep, Nissan and others) After comparing their performance, options and most were priced higher for less quality and interior space than the 2017 Hyundai Santa Fe! So it was not hard to choose our second Hyundai Santa Fe - It has only been a few short weeks, but we love it and named her ""Ms MoneyPenny"" Thats 007 James Bonds assistant - sorry we name our cars!  Thanks HUFFINES HYUNDAI",5.0
377,"July 12, 2017","Before travelling to the dealership I asked Elise Miller about one specific car.  She said it was still available.  However, when I got to the dealership she told me that it was sold the day before.  Obviously one can't be true.  Now, over a week later I see that same car is still for sale on their website.  So I know that she lied to me when I was at the dealership.    Also, I asked specifically about incentives that I would be getting with my purchase.  She said that I they would be applied.  When signing the paperwork I fell for the salesperson tactic of pushing papers in front of me saying ""just sign here.""  I should have been more diligent.  I didn't get the discount for financing through HMF like I should have.    I'm content with the car and the price I paid.  However it is frustrating that I didn't get the car I wanted because I was lied to by the salesperson.  It's also irritating knowing that I paid more than I should have.   That's as much my fault though I guess.  I would consider buying from Huffines in the future but I would never deal with Elise Miller again.  In my experience she isn't trustworthy and doesn't do what she can to make sure the buyer gets the vehicle that they want.",2.2

He is probably going to be the only sales person that I will work with for future purchases, and Huffines will be the only dealership that I will go to. The warranties are amazing, the prices are fair and there are no hidden ""dealership fees"". I couldnt have asked for a better first time purchase experience.

Milo Jackson was my service adviser on a recent trip to the dealership. I had asked for his card on a prior visit after witnessing how he treated his customers. Let's just say that my previous advisers either left the company or had a poor disposition. He made a great impression, just by listening to him explain things to others. Women are often treated as if they don't know anything and are pushovers. Not the case with Milo. He took the time to explain the situation with my vehicle and for the 1st time I actually believed what he was saying was accurate and honest. He was professional, sincere and had a great attitude. This dealership is very lucky to have such a knowledgeable and caring employee. I have referred 3 people who all bought cars at Huffines in the past year and plan on referring them to Milo for their service.

506,"April 13, 2017","I was a returning customer, and recently purchased a Tuscon from the same sales person I had previously purchased from. I also recently refereed a friend to this dealership, who ended up purchasing a Santa Fe. Last time the salesman was great. This time he was not. Please see the following reasons why I will not purchase another car from this dealer, nor will I ever refer another friend:  1. He gave me a price and did not explain to me that the number we agreed on was dependent on me qualifying for a loyalty rebate of $500. Instead of just eating the $500, I ended up having to spend $250 more than we had agreed on. This made me VERY mad.  2. After all was said and done, I was pissed about the $250 extra I had to pay, but still wanted the car. THEN, the number the salesman sent to finance was $500 more than we agreed on. If I did not catch the error, I would have been out that $500!! 3. THEN when the vehicle arrived a few days later (they did not have the color I wanted), it did not have a cargo cover. I was told the car would have EVERY feature the car I test drove had. The test car had a cargo cover. When I asked if I could have a cargo cover, I was told I would have to pay $190 EVEN THOUGH IT WAS SUPPOSED TO COME WITH THE CAR.   Mike Manfred was very friendly the last time I worked with him. This time it was clear he only cared about making a sale and didn't care that it was a HORRIBLE experience. Still can't believe he didn't get me a cargo cover that I was promised and seriously expected me to pay $200, even after I already paid $250 more than our first agreement!  With all of this said, Kyle in finance was a joy to work with.",1.4
507,"April 12, 2017","Buying from Jon at Huffines was incredible. He's been great and supportive and helped us get what we needed.

706,"September 08, 2016","I started the process of looking for a new vehicle when I had to replace the second motor in a window in my car and got fed up with fixing it all the time. I knew I wanted a crossover, so I did some googling and found that the Hyundai Tucson had the highest safety ratings in its class. I liked how it looked and it was at a price point I could afford, so I knew that's what I wanted. I decided on a trim and a color and then contacted dealerships to figure out an OTD price and take a test drive. Huffines Hyundai in Plano had good reviews and fairly close to my home, so we test drove there and then didn't really communicate any more with any of the other dealerships because we were so pleased with the service at Huffines.       The salesperson was friendly and enthusiastic and so willing to do anything to get me into the car that I wanted. We did have another offer from a different dealership and Huffines was able to match it; we were happy to not have to go back and forth on the price too much.       The finance office was great as well. We were told what all of the extra options were and when we said ""no, thank you"" they took the paper off the table and we didn't have to discuss it at all again. There was no pressure, just nice people who wanted to make sure we and our new vehicle we taken care of.       My husband was expecting to be at the dealership for 6 or more hours, but we got there around 11am and left before 1pm.

709,"September 01, 2016","I purchased my vehicle two years ago and had an excellent experience with the dealership. My experience was so great that I took my vehicle for routine maintenance since then even though the town I live in is 60 miles away. At the last week of June a service staff pointed out damage to my vehicle. After confirming this damage with my insurance, I noted that Huffines and insurance had alarming differences in price estimates. I scheduled an appointment with the Huffines full body shop back on the first week of the July and they informed me that due to the large number of vehicles that my appointment would be on the last week of July. On the last week of July, I turned my vehicle in and was informed that it would be a week. I was told by my insurance agent that they didn't even start my vehicle the same day I turned it in despite me having to wait three weeks. I let them know that I didn't anticipate that length of time and previously scheduled an appointment with the service department at the end of the week for a state inspection. The full shop body staff member, John King, had told me that they would turn my vehicle to the service department for a state inspection while they were working on it. I had reminded him about the inspection on three separate occasions since my vehicle took four weeks to finish and he assured me that it would be done. I know that a few of the delays were due to my insurance but it was primarily due to Huffines full body shop. When I did pick up my vehicle, John King told me that he forgot to do the state inspection. I was very patient over the past four weeks especially after being promised repeatedly that my vehicle would be done only to be disappointed. I had only asked for that one thing. Mr. King had me go to the service department who almost turned me away due to claiming that they met their maximum number of inspections for the month. Then they told me that it would be a two hour wait. It is fortunate for both parties that they were able to complete the inspection and at a quicker time that they anticipated. This is one of the reasons why I am giving two instead of one star. Another reason is when I contacted the service department today about a related issue, I received helpful advice from a kind staff member. ",3.2

736,"August 13, 2016","To start off, I want to state that we have 2 Hyundai's and love our cars. My Father in-law just bought a new Genesis Sedan. It's a fantastic vehicle.  The cars are undoubtedly one of the best values in the market today. Generally speaking, the quality of the vehicles are good.

In the event your Hyundai does have an issue. I would NOT recommend the Huffines dealership for repairs. The Service managers are nice enough, but the mechanics in my mind are completely incompetent and borderline idiots. To date, I've taken my Azera in twice for two different issues. I've spent about 5 hours waiting in the waiting room for the 2 different things to be fixed, and they were unable to resolve the 2 issues on two different occasions (2 wasted trips). 

My daughters Accent has an issue that it sometimes won't start.  We know it's not the battery as we were unable to jump the car, even with a good battery. The service center manager recommended jiggling the steering wheel to get the car started. After 30 minutes of fooling around with it, the Accent finally started. After several hours of waiting in the service center waiting room, the fantastic mechanics told my daughter she had a bad battery (WTH?). They charged her $100 for a new battery, not covered under the warranty. Never in my life has jiggling a steering wheel been a battery issue (incompetent!). Instead of fixing the issue they sold her something she didn't need.  2 days later, she was stranded again, 6 hours from home with a car that won't start. More jiggling of the steering wheel required. Again today, same issue. Car won' t start, even with the BRAND NEW new battery. Thanks Huffines Service Center!  

We will be trying a different service center, and I hope and pray we're able to find some competent mechanics that can fix their cars.

To sum it up, we've had 3 visits to Huffines Service center, and 3 complete fails.
One of the fails even cost $100 for something not needed.

Very sad.",2.4

I brought my car in at 8:00am that morning. The service technician assigned to me was not in yet, so I would have to wait until he came in. Dan Turk, my tech came in at 8:15 AM. I informed him I would also like them to look at the engine noise in my car. Without going into excruciating detail of the numerous calls I had to make, people I had to talk to, issues getting a loan car, constant delays and broken promises, I finally received a call Wed, Aug 10 saying the issue with my car and the claim on my warranty was denied and I needed to contact the extended warranty company. After speaking with the warranty company, I once again went down the track of trying to reach Dan and would finally reach him today Thurs, Aug 11 at 11AM. I told Dan I would pick up my vehicle during my lunch break at 2:30 and asked if it would be ready. He confirmed it would be. Of course, it was not. When my car was finally ready at 3:30 PM, I started to drive away and realized they had cracked my windshield. It is a 6+ inch crack! The different people I had spoken with over the course of the last 4 days all came out at once, Tony, Ruben and Dan to look at the vehicle. Although it is clear Dan did not mark my vehicle had a cracked windshield when I took it in, Tony has stated Huffines is not liable and said as a ‚Äúfriendly offer‚Äù he would cover 50% of the windshield replacement.

868,"May 04, 2016","We bought our first car from Huffines used car department in 2009. We went there originally mainly due to convenience as we live close by. We had such a good experience and got such a good deal, we went back a year later and bought a new Hyundai from them. Again, it was a quick, low pressure, pleasant experience, and we feel like we got a good deal. Unfortunately, a hail storm totaled one of the vehicles this year, and so we decided to go back again, because we loved the previous Elantra, and decide to look at the new 2017 models. My wife took one for a test drive and we decided to buy it. I had done my homework beforehand, and said that I didn't want to spend a lot of time haggling. I offered what I knew was both a good deal for us, and a fair price for the dealer based on my research, and had the offer accepted without any fuss. We signed the paperwork and were out in about an hour and a half after getting back from the test drive. We were offered the usual paint/interior protection packages and extended warranty, but there was no high pressure to buy them. We've also had our maintenance performed at Huffines, and have used their body shop several times, and have been very satisfied. We tend to keep our cars for a while, and Hyundais are reliable, so we aren't in the car market as often as some people, but when we are, it's good to have a dealer close by that we can trust for a good deal.",5.0

The process was completely painless -- everything worked out via text message so that all I had to do was show up to sign the papers to a deal that had everything I wanted and drive away in my new car.  He was friendly, efficient, and helpful - never pushing me, and paying close attention to what I wanted out of the deal. 
 Today, when my new Tucson had an ""idiot light"" come on and had to go in for unexpected service, I went in to see Frank, and he was fantastic again.  He recognized me immediately, gave me 100% of his attention, and went above and beyond to make sure I had a great car to drive while they work on the Tucson.  It's this kind of customer service -- remembering faces, being an attentive listener, going above and beyond to make sure that needs are met both before and after the ""deal"" is done -- that makes me so glad to have purchased my car from Huffines Hyundai Plano.

954,"January 20, 2016","I am very upset about the poor quality of service that I am receiving at Huffhines Hyundai of Plano.  My parents and I have bought vehicles from Huffhines Chevrolet and Hyundai multiple times.  The Huffhines name usually stands for quality.  The service department of your Hyundai Plano branch is very disapointing.  In the beginning it seemed okay when I purchased my Santa Fe in 2013, but it has steadily declined.

Last November I realize that the service manager had a stroke, and the delays and confusion I experienced from your service team were understandable.  The problems I experienced at that time were resolved. 

Now, I am not sure how to proceed to get adequate service on my Santa Fe rear lift/tailgate issues.  I made an appointment to get the rear lift repaired, and back in December I was told it was a two hour job.  I scheduled it for 1/13/16 with Ken Rosales.  I called and left a message the week prior to this appointment with the receptionist that I wanted to speak to someone about the rear lift since I had just brought it in during the summer (2015) for the same issue.  No one called me back.  I then called on Monday 1/11//16 and spoke to Ken Rosales about my concerns that the hydraulics aren‚Äôt being fixed correctly, and I wondered if there was a known  issue on the Santa Fe model.  He explained that only two providers make the hydraulics, and that the cold weather affects them.  Interestingly, most every person I know has a similar type of car (Hyundais and other types) with a rear lift, and I don‚Äôt see them getting hit in the head every time they try to use the rear of their car for storage, groceries, etc.... At that time, Ken also assured me that when I brought the car in on Wed for my scheduled appointment it would be fixed.

When my son and I arrived at 2pm for our appointment on 1/13/16, two other people came to the car to help us, and then Ken was sent out.  He remembered talking to me about getting ‚Äúconked‚Äù in the head over and over.  At that time my car was taken back to the service bay--- presumably to get the rear hydraulics replaced.  After one hour, at 3pm, Ken came to tell me that unfortunately, they did not have the parts needed to repair my car.  Why wasn‚Äôt I told this at 2pm when I arrived? Or on Monday, 1/11/16,  when I called and spoke to Ken Rosales over the phone??  I really don‚Äôt think this is Ken Rosale‚Äôs fault, and he was very nice in all our interactions.  It seems it is a management problem involving inventory, communication, or something?  I can‚Äôt believe that there are so many vehicles these days with rear lifts, and yet this is a problem.  And how do you not check to see if the part is in stock?  

When I left Huffhines service department at 3pm that day, Ken told me the parts would come in ‚Äúin a couple days‚Äù , and  he ‚Äúwould call‚Äù me to set up a new time for this repair.  As of today, I have received no phone call, email, etc‚Ä¶.from anyone at Huffhines Hyundai.  I am very upset about this as we have done business with Huffhines for years. We are still driving our 2000  Suburban from Huffines Chevrolet. We had a great experience with Mike Manfred, our salesman, at Hyundai, but I feel these issues with your service department need to be addressed.

957,"January 13, 2016","I have purchased several cars from Huffines Hyundai and other Huffines dealerships prior, and for the most part i have been very satisfied. My last experience however was not good. On 1/2/16 I scheduled a service appointment online for 1/11/16 at 5PM.  Confirmation code X032T22130. When I went to the appointment, the service adviser there told me I did not have an appointment. He would work me in in a couple of hours. But, I had an appointment! He then told me that appointments don't mean anything except to put you in front of the walk ins. Really???? I could not wait that long for them to get my car in, so i left. I have sent an email to the person who sent me the confirmations. No response. I went to their web site and filled out the ""Contact Us"" page. No Response! I did an online chat with a person who assured me someone would contact me. As of yet No response! I can only conclude that the service department does not care about their customers. An appointment should be respected. And, my car still needs an oil change.

1/18/2016 - I am editing this review because I went in to the service department on Saturday morning. I got Brad as my service adviser. He was Great. He took care of the service I needed, and got my car back to me on time. He was very professional and polite.He turned a negative experience onto a positive one. I will be asking for him from now on. Thanks Brad.

Arrived Wednesday 7 am got the car Thursday 6pm and no communication, no call backs, made two trip there concerned about what the problem was. Is this an overbooking problem? I also never heard others in the wait room complaining before. I have this year in the Chevrolet and Hyundai locations. I like the remodel to the building but not to the service level. I used to recommend you to everyone since 2010, now I believe cannot do that until I see a change back to the excellent service level I used to experience.

He then patiently guided us to see all the cars in the parking lot that might meet out needs. With the help of his rich knowledge of different packages, we were able to finalize our selection quickly. After the test drive we got our new car. Now 3 weeks later, we are very happy with this new Sonata ECO (1.6-liter turbo engine). It is very powerful, yet with good fuel-economy. Officially published numbers are 28 mpg city, 38 highway. However, as I regularly travel over a 50 miles highway trip, I was able to test my new car's fuel-economy. I often got over 40 mpg highway (highest one being 44.3 over a 50 mile trip), and over 30 mpg combined highway and local roads. Very happy with it.",5.0

1073,"July 16, 2015","First of all, this is my fourth Hyundai, and the third one from Huffines. I Had been told by two dealers that I would not be penalized for early termination since I was so close to lease end, so we went in, and picked out the Sonata Sport that my wife wanted.  We got to finance, after waiting two and a half hours,  and found I was being charged $1450 negative equity.  While I was only taxed on the difference after trade, I paid about $650 less in tax, but still will pay $20+ a month more in monthly lease payments.  Jeff (Cooper?) in finance called yesterday with a paperwork problem.  When I explained my dissatisfaction, he looked at original lease and told me he thought I should qualify for no termination fee since I only had three remaining payments on the original lease.  If salespeople at dealerships had not told me what they did, we would have just waited a couple of months.  After waiting for over 2 1/2 hours to get into finance, they were ready to close, we were more than ready to get out of there, having been at the dealership for close to four hours,  so probably should have said right there ""do it over, or we'll just wait.""

1117,"February 14, 2015","The sensor that regulated the lights in my dash had some kind of short. It was a simple problem and easy to fix only took about 20 mins the day they finally got the part in. My first trip mark said he was convinced it was a loose battery cable,I told him I didn't think so, but they took it back and ""tightened"" the cables. Said they couldn't replicate the problem and gave me my car back. The problem was not fixed so I made an appointment to bring the car and drop it off so they could try to replicate. This time I spoke with Thomas, though Mark was handling my car, he could clearly understand the problem when I gave him the same description and told me it should be fixed quickly. After 8 hours I called for an update on my car and was told they would be keeping it overnight (this had never been mentioned as a possibility, they don't give loaner cars, and I only found out because I called to check.) The next afternoon I called to check on the progress. My car was still not ready and they had to order my part. Had they looked at it at all I could have picked it up the day before. Thry scheduled someone to pick me up from work to get my car, and he was almost 45 mins late. Another service person came to give me my keys and i noticed a big chip in the paint on my drivers door handle. I called Mark and he said he would take care of it, because the other person said he couldn't help me, but he would tell Mark what he saw. After about a week I called to check on the part being in. Still never getting calls from Mark. I made another appointment to get the part replaced and at that time had my handle looked at. They replaced the part and said I would have to come back another time to get my handle replaced since it was too chipped to buff out, on my brand new car. I waited about a week and called back a few times to get ahold of Mark, usually being told he was on lunch no matter what time I called by the rude receptionist, Mark later mentioned he hadn't taken a lunch the last three days when  I finally got him. He did call once about another week later saying the handle was in. I returned the call and got the handle replaced while I waited. Everything is now fixed, but I had to make several extra 40 minute round trips to accomplish something that should have taken 30 mins max, maybe 2 trips since they didn't have the part. What is the point of making an appointment for 9am when they don't even look at your car until the next afternoon. I was very disappointed in the whole experience. Mark did apologize, but I felt like I had to work very hard to get anything accomplished.",2.6

The manager (whom I did not meet) told him to find a car I loved and to make me a good deal. They did. I appreciate the professionalism and the kindness they showed me.

Informed him that I do not have time to continuously bring my car in for the same issues. He advised me to bring my car in again on January 5th. I once again drop my car off in the morning.

I called Mark at 5 pm to determine the status of my car, after being on hold for several minutes I hung up to call once again call to speak to my rep about the status of my car repair. Mark informed me that they are still working on my car that the mechanic is on the phone trying to troubleshoot my car's issue. I informed Mark that I would like a call back prior to closing to inform my about the status of my car if I was to keep it there. He did not return my call, and I am without any status to the conditions of my vehicle. I'm frustrated beyond belief because my time is being wasted, and Mark has displayed nothing but poor customer service to me since the first time I took my car to Huffines Hyundai. The lack of follow through is nothing short of unprofessional, I have a full time job that I have to leave to follow up constantly about the status of my vehicle because of Mark's lack of follow through.",1.2

He listened to what I was looking for in my new car and gave me different possibilities. He even let me bring a suitcase to make sure the trunk would work for my needs. I had lots of questions and he answered them all. I was dreading the process of purchasing a new car but Jonathan and the financing department  made the process smooth. I appreciate the fact that I was not pressured into anything. I made the decision on my own and a good decision to choose Huffines.

Even when my original financing plan hit a snag (my bad) the F&I team found me alternative financing from an established, national lender at even better terms that I originally had when I walked into the dealership.  We financed my wife's through a different lender altogether and had no issues. They managed the different deals fluidly without any complications.  We will definitely return to this dealership for service as well as purchasing any new Hyundai vehicles.  

Before we committed to Huffines, I had contacted some other Hyundai dealerships in the area during my initial research.  I was glad to report to them that I purchased (not one but two) from Huffines in Plano.",5.0

I came in to talk with them about the Vehicle Exchange Program I had been contacted about while having the routine maintenance done on my 2013 Elantra and honestly, I didn‚Äôt expect it to be something that I would be interested in. After all, I had a very good car with low mileage that had been taken very good care of. But after having my questions about the program answered by Ashley Maya, I went ahead and decided to talk to a salesperson. Thanks Ashley, you did great and I appreciate you! Once I met Malia, I was once again treated like more than just a walking dollar sign. I was treated with respect and kindness through the entire process. While negotiating the sale, I also was able to meet with the Sales Manager, Ken Winston. Here‚Äôs where I thought the real pressure was going to come in. I readied myself for the hard sale that only a seasoned car salesman knows how to apply but, no?! Ken was helpful, knowledgeable and as interested in helping me feel comfortable with the sale as he was in helping his salesperson make the sale. We agreed on a number that I was comfortable with and all seemed right with the world. But I know what comes next. The F&I Guy. This is about to get real. Again, no pressure?! He did show me a few things for my car that would increase the payment we had talked about, but I let him know that the number we were at was where I needed to stay and he helped me out. Thank you Chris Berry, you batted cleanup and knocked it out of the park. Although all these people made the entire buying experience a great experience, I do especially want to thank Malia for her patience and her professional friendly approach.

Malia  Penington greeted us as we began walking towards the Santa Fes . She showed us a few of them, but we decided that they were not what we were looking for. She then showed us a 2014 version of the car we were already driving, the Elantra. We LOVED it! Malia asked us what she could do to put us in it. We told her and she did it. We have never been as impressed with a car sales person as we were with Malia. She made sure we were happy with the deal we got, threw in a few extras and showed us how all the new features worked. She even stayed very late to make sure the deal went through. In short, she made us feel like part of her family. Some of our friends have asked us where we got our car. When we told them about our experience there, they said that they had heard that about Huffines. We will highly recommend you to anyone that asks us where to get a good deal on a car. We will definitely come back when we are ready to buy another vehicle.

We never made it to the other Dealers.  Why?

Our experience with Frank White was, well, quite impressive!  He was at ease working us through the stages of the ""buying experience"" first by greeting us without pressure, then sitting us down to listen and write down what was important to us for our next vehicle.  He then proceeded to bring a vehicle to the front for our viewing and eventual test drive.  He made us feel comfortable, understood our needs because he listened, and carefully, yet casually worked us through the stages of the process until we landed a great car at a great price!

1135,"March 24, 2014"," 
I don‚Äôt normally write happy 5-star reviews.  And I really hate the car ‚Äúbuying‚Äù experience. 
  
Yet, here I am on my own time, writing a Happy 5-Star review, because... 
  
I am happy to report I just bought a brand new 2014 Santa Fe Sport 2.0T 
SUV, last Thursday, March 20th.  Purchased from Mr. Mike Manfred, at Huffiness Hyundai Plano dealership.  It was an unusual car buying experience which ‚Äúpositively surpassed‚Äù my expectations, and countered my long term car buying dread.  
  
In my 28 years of adulthood I have negotiated/purchased 33 automobiles.  I averaged 1.5 car purchases a year for family/relatives since 2005.  So I‚Äôm no newbie when it comes to buying cars. Yet in all these time, I have not really ‚Äúenjoy‚Äù a single purchase experience.  Until now.  
   
I walked into Huffines Hyundai Plano dealership last week just wanting to browse. To see how different colors actually looked like nearing sunset on the Santa Fe Sport.  I‚Äôm not crazy and my time is indeed expensive... I was doing extra research because this time I‚Äôm buying a car for my WIFE.  Mr. Mike Manfred greeted me, then kept a respectful distance, which I really appreciate by not having a sales person trying to ""size me up"" or ""make a deal"" when I am not ready, yet.  Later when asked, Mike proceeded to show me the finer details of Santa Fe Sport which I didn‚Äôt get from studying HyundaiUSA website: LED light illuminates both front door handles upon approach (fancy cool!), driver can still operate all 4 windows even when window-lock is engaged (awesome!), rear window mesh sun shades (wife/kids pleaser!), etc.  I was impressed a sales person actually took the time to really learn the minute details of the vehicle he sell. 
   
I returned with the Wife next day. Mike did the impossible: he spend more than an hour with my wife, not trying to sell her the car, instead Mike patiently listened and respond to all the eccentric questions my wife throw at him: ‚Äúthis rearview mirror seem smaller than on my old car‚Äù, ‚Äúcan I disconnect/reconnect the power to BlueTooth completely due to EMF concern?‚Äù, ‚Äúcan this car clear a piece of brick in the middle of the road‚Äù, etc.  My wife is fully aware of her own eccentric ways and appreciates people who exhibit patience with her. That same night my wife decided she like and want the new Santa Fe Sport, and I should buy it from Mike Manfred. 
  
‚ÄúMike is a patient man with good manners, he earned our business.‚Äù the wife decreed. 
  
Not so fast, I said.  What if the dealership won‚Äôt bargain on a vehicle just 2nd year into new model cycle? What if I cannot get a good discount off the MSRP? What if dealer low-ball my trade-in to the level of insult? What if financing gave me a high interest rate?  Alas, here comes the part of car ‚Äúbuying‚Äù experience that I dreaded. 
  
None of the above concerns happened; this dealership did not attempt any of those tricks. And they did not try to sell me frivolous items like paint sealant, fabric protectant, weather sealing, or pin-stripping.  Mike quickly brokered a fair and amicable deal between my tight budget, and dealership‚Äôs need to make money.  I got all the manufacturer incentives without needing to ask or fight for it. I got the dealer installed accessories I wanted no extra charge. Then I got a dealer discount that I was happy with (yes, I researched TMV).  Last but not least, the financing was done right, too.  No tricks, no deception, no hidden profit padding. 
  
I drove out the dealership that night with my brand new Santa Fe Sport 2.0T.  I wasn‚Äôt exhausted, my intelligence wasn‚Äôt insulted, and I wasn‚Äôt ripped-off.  I felt happy, excited, and falling in love with this brand new SUV we just bought. 
  
I got the car my wife want, at the great deal I want.   Tonight I am superman! 
  
 
Thank you very much, Mr. Mike Manfred, and Huffines Hyundai Plano. 
You‚Äôve earned yourself another long term customer.

I test drove both the cars for a decent amount of time and was happy with the oppurtunity. I had been to number of competing dealerships around the area and none of them were friendly with letting me test drive on different terrains (neighborhood roads, freeway etc). Huffines Hyundai understood my requirements, budget and interest and helped me out at every step of the process from test drive to comparison to purchase. I finally bought the 2014 Sonata.  Mali'a spent the necessary amount of time to clearly explain the various aspects of the car and helped me out choose a model and package that fit my budget. The entire sales and finance team was friendly. By the time I had completed my purchase, it was 10:30 PM.

The car I just purchased was my first solo car buying experience (with nobody along who had more experience with the process than I do) -- I was nervous about it, and I did a lot of reading and research, trying to arm myself against what I imagined would be a lot of pressure and sneaky tactics, but in the end, it went a lot more smoothly than I thought.

Adrian greeted me and immediately set a tone for our conversation that was cordial, informative, and non-intrusive.  It felt far more like a conversation with a friend than a sales process.  What a refreshing difference from the usual auto dealer interaction!  Adrian helped me compare the Azera and Genesis models, including test drives of each and a detailed tour of functions and features.  He also talked about the service intervals and took me to the Service and Parts Departments.

Once I had decided on the Genesis, Adrian was very effective in getting all the paperwork initiated, and accommodated my strong preferences on information privacy.  The finance people took it from there to overcome the challenge presented by my blocking of access to my credit data on all services, and to explain the various warranty extensions.

Additionally he was very helpful both during and after the purchase on answering any and all questions I had regarding the operations of all the myriad computer operations of the vehicle and even synced my phone with the car computer for me.  Although I don't anticipate, at my age, buying another new car, if I do I would most definitely ask for Mike again.",5.0

1172,"October 03, 2013","My wife and I have been loyal buyers of Hyundai over the past 20 years. In recent years we had several unfortunate circumstances that hurt our credit and the Hyundai Sonata that my wife was driving was 10 years old and reaching the 100,000 mile mark. We knew that it would be difficult to get another car. We were right. We had gone to several Hyundai dealership pick out the car and color we wanted only to be told we did not qualify. Finally I had reached out on the internet to find a dealership that might be able to help us in getting a car and 1 being Hyundai. We received an email from Jonathan Cruz at Huffines Hyundai in Plano, Texas to stop by to see if they could help us get the car of our dreams. 
Jonathan Cruz had no idea that we were current Hyundai owners or our circumstances. So we went to see him and he was busy at the time so he had Frank White help us. To make this story a little shorter, they were both very encouraging and helpful thru the whole process, not only were we able to get the car we wanted, but they were able to get us a good interest rate and payments we could afford. Thanks to both Jonathan Cruz and Frank White for working with us and being honest and respectful in getting a new car a reality. My wife is now in her new car which will go for another 10 years/100,000 miles and we our both very happy and satisfied loyal Hyundai customers.

1181,"March 11, 2013","Huffines Hyundai Plano was an effortless and completely satisfying buying experience. I began my search for a new car looking for a reliable vehicle at a great value to replace my aging previous vehicle. My parents had trusted Huffines for years for their vehicle-buying needs, so they introduced me to Walter to help me get started. Walter understood exactly what I needed‚ÄîI was looking for reliability and value over extra features‚Äîand helped me choose just the right vehicle for my needs, a certified Chevy Impala. 

Walter went above and beyond to make sure that everything was done to ensure my satisfaction with the purchase, keeping me posted every step of the way as we worked through the process of determining financing and everything else that was involved. As a part-time student with a full-time job, I wasn't able to make it out to the lot to close the deal right away, but he was patient and found a time that worked for both of us. When it came time to sign, he even came up to the office early to fit it into my schedule.

The car was in great shape when I got it, and offered all the features I needed with extra on top. Walter was right when he told me I'd love it. Plus, it's Chevy certified with a year bumper-to-bumper warranty‚Äîwhich came in handy when the drivers' side heater unexpectedly gave out shortly after the purchase. I gave him a call, he had the part ordered, and I brought it in a few days later to get it fixed with no hassle whatsoever. I didn't even have to sign anything.

I have no hesitation about buying another car with Walter at Huffines. The dealership works with the best, and I know they'll stand behind the vehicles they sell. I expect to be back for my next purchase.",5.0

I get there the next day to pick it up, they want over $1200.00. Needless to say I was rather irked. The service guy who helped me was gone for the day and unreachable by phone, the service manager does nothing to help other than say ""well, we can't take the new parts off your car"", looks me up in their system and informs me that I haven't been in there for work in 3 years (I do oil changes and minor maintenance myself), and as such he can't ""give me a break on the price"".

1185,"July 23, 2012","Having purchased several vehicles in my day I will say without any apprehension or reservation that buying a car from Huffines Hyundai, and specifically Douglas Peyton, is by far the best car buying experience I've ever had!

Douglas never gave off the impression that he was a Car Salesman just trying to make a buck -- completely opposite; Douglas made us feel welcomed.  He took the time to ask the right questions AND THEN listened to what we had to say.  Unlike other experiences I've had where I was being ""steered"" in the direction the sales person wanted me to go.  Douglas took the information we gave him and then made suggestions based on that intel.  Additionally, Douglas' knowledge about the Hyundai models is impressive.  Again, he took the time to show us EVERYTHING the Santa Fe had going for it -- no minor detail/feature was ignored.  By the time we test drove the vehicle I/we (my wife and I) didn't have that unfamiliar feeling you usually have when test driving a car; we felt comfortable.

Finally, the actual sales process... AMAZING how Douglas worked FOR us, and not just for the benefit of himself or Hyundai.  He went above and beyond the call of duty to get us a great deal, and because we would be considered a ""challenge"" credit-wise, the end results were awesome!

Douglas, Roosevelt, Shane, Donna, and the entire staff at Huffines Hyundai, THANK YOU for making this an unforgettable car buying experience!  If you're looking for a new car, go see Douglas Peyton, he will treat you right.

Sincerely,

Robin Cruson",5.0
1186,"July 22, 2012","Huffines Hyundai and Douglas Peyton are like two peas in a pod. Here‚Äôs why:

     Working with Douglas Peyton is a breath of fresh air.   My husband & I went into the dealership thinking that we would give it a shot despite our bad credit and see what happens.   Douglas was positive, personable, and confident salesperson which surprised me.  I felt relaxed and cared for by him which is refreshing in the car sales business.  His professional attitude and helpfulness helped me feel comfortable with the entire experience.  Not once, did he talk down to me as if I didn‚Äôt know anything about cars or money.
     Douglas knows his product.  He introduced us to the Sante Fe and all the bells and whistles that came along with the model.  When we test drove the car, he encouraged me to test out the car limits. It felt a little like we were doing only what the professional drivers do on TV commercials. For example, I punched on the gas up to 40 mph and slammed on the brakes without holding the steering wheel to see how the car responded.  It was amazing because the car didn‚Äôt feel like it was going to stall our or veer out of control.  The, what I call, pivot turning in circles was way cool.  (Note:  We were in a safe area with no other cars or people around. :)) The Santa Fe is a wonderful ride and we absolutely love the car we drove home with.
     Another aspect of Douglas and Huffines that we liked was Douglas‚Äô, the general manager, and the finance team worked for us rather than for Hyundai. They made sure that we were getting a fair deal on our 2007 Ford Focus trade-in and that we received financial breaks on the purchase of the Sante Fe which is helpful when we are trying to repair our credit. If you have ever experienced poor credit score rating and have been working hard to repair it, you will agree that this is a breath of fresh air. Douglas made sure that we all were in a win-win situation and I thank him for that.  He wasn‚Äôt going to let us leave until he was satisfied that we were all happy.  We even got financed through Hyundai at a lower interest rate than the other creditor which is a feat all on its own since getting ‚Äústore‚Äù credit can be tricky. 
          Thank you Douglas! It‚Äôs been a pleasure meeting & working with you!

I have never bought a car from Huffines before.  When arriving at Huffines, Robert was with another client, so he had Leon help us.  I can say Leon was great, helpful, friendly, and patience.

1196,"May 24, 2011","On May 23, 2011, we purchased a 2011 Hyundai Santa Fe - our fourth Hyundai and the third purchased from Huffines Hyundai Plano. . We first came to Huffines Hyundai in 2007 on the recommendation of the Hyundai Regional Sales Manager. We were shopping for a new Hyundai Santa Fe. Based on previous experience, we wanted a full-service dealership with their own (not sub-contracted) maintenance and body shop. Huffines met that requirement. When this purchase was completed, we were quite satisfied with our first buying experience at Huffines. We were treated with courtesy and respect and received what we considered to be a good deal. 
Nevertheless, when it came to be time to trade for a 2009 Santa Fe, we shopped approximately 8 Hyundai dealers in the DFW area. At each dealer, we compared their sales techniques and offers to our previous experience at Huffines. After all was said and done, we purchased our second Santa Fe from Huffines Hyundai Plano.
Two years later, we were in the market for a 2011 Santa Fe. This time, we went directly to Huffines Hyundai Plano. Our experience this time compared favorably with our first two. Again, we were treated with respect and were offered what we considered to be a good deal.
One thing worth adding to our report. We live north of Fort Worth. We willingly traveled more than 50 miles and bypassed several Hyundai dealers which were closer to our home in order to purchase this car. To us, the distance traveled is worth the buying experience offered By Huffines.

Mr. Henderson was the Sr. Tech working on the suspension issue/noise on my 2001 XG300L.
  
I came in during lunch so I expected to leave the vehicle in Huffines' care the afternoon while I waited in the lobby.
Troy Ngo is one of the trusted service advisors I have always used and so he explained that it would be some time as the tech was heading to lunch.
I said, that's not a problem I expected to be here for 4-5 hours as I couldn't get in earlier this morning.
 
We went through the explanation and write up process. I went to the lobby to wait.
Well, in less than an hour, Troy said that everything was good to go and that he was putting things back together now.
 
I was pleasantly surprised so I inquired as to who the tech was.
He gave Mr. Henderson's first name and I said well tell him thank you for his selfless act of postponing his lunch to handle the problem.
Upon completion, Troy and Ennis both came out and Troy introduced him.

This time, I got to shake his hand and express direct thanks for his above and beyond effort to satisfy a customer.
He nonchalantly shrugged it off and said, ""It was no problem"".
But I had to say no, it was a big thing so I wanted to meet the tech who made such a gesture.
I completely understood the lunch hour and I can not for certainty say that I would not have said, it will be here when I get back; I'm hungry.
 
So at this time, again, I say thanks Ennis for you being on the staff at Huffines for quickly rectifying the situation and giving me my day back.
If no one has told you in a while, I will:
 
You're the man.
 
And as always thank you Troy for your excellent customer service and assistance.
 
Thanks Huffines for having a technician on your staff that does the little things like this for your customers.
Hyundai, this is why I will be a member of the Hyundai family for life and my wife is becoming a convert to through the durability of my car, the
actions and experiences I have from the Hyundai events and the experiences I come away with from Service calls.

He finally admitted that he never had a car he &amp;quot;reserved&amp;quot; for us. That car was never &amp;quot;coming&amp;quot; and It's unlikely to get that car at all.
- Robert Roman took our credit card as a deposit for the car that never existed!
- Robert Roman led us on for days giving blatant lies about car that is &amp;quot;coming&amp;quot; while that car never existed in the first place!
- Robert Roman tried to impress us by showing all great reviews on this website. Trying to appear friendly. I guess there's no such thing as honest salesman.
Basically he was telling lies and leading us on. Preventing from going to other dealer and getting the car we wanted. He was trying to benefit his own business at the cost of customer's time and satisfaction.

What's worse after this review I was contacted by dealership manager Roosevelt May and he was trying to downplay this as ""miscommunication""! There was no miscommunication.

I had driven a 2002 vehicle to the dealership and planned to drive it home before Ken entered the room.  Ken's entrance reminded me of what I disliked about dealerships and sales people.  I won't repeat what I said to him.  Apparently Mike and Ken knew the quality of dealership and calibre of staff there, the brand and the product better than I.

He swept me away from my activities to go car shopping; something I detest more than anything.  I was grumbling and cranky when we arrived at Huffines.  Salesman, John Davis met with us to share his knowledge of the new Hyundai Elantra that hubby was interested in.  John was friendly and had been tipped off by my husband that I disliked the entire car buying processl.  John did not pressure me into car talk, but instead asked me questions about what my interests were, about my children, vacations we had taken...all the while walking me around the different Elantras on the lot.  He shared about his family too and we had a genuine heartfelt conversation in and out of my husband asking the car questions.  Eventually we got to the official test drive and John opened the car door for me so I could get behind the wheel.  He was thoughtful, would ask me questions regarding the car, careful to not do a typical car salesman pitch.

Long story short, we bought the car that night.  John's sales manager, Ken Winston was great when we got to the final negotiation amount.  Throughout the negotiation process, John Davis would ask if I was comfortable, making sure we were fine.  He joked with us about children, living in our community and more.  The car buying process that I so dearly detest became a fun evening of getting to know everyone on his team.  John made sure we met the general sales manager, Roosevelt May and Darren Medefros, the financial manager was so very personable and professional.  Before we left the dealership, we were also shown the service department.  In fact we left with a sense that the team at Huffines Hyundai really cared about our well being.  All were very knowledgeable, professional and kind.  

Huffines is a family owned dealership that puts its customers first.  The dealership team made us feel like part of the Huffines family.  They put the exclamation point on being dealer professionals.  They make a wonderful first impression in dress, manner and friendliness.  Not once did I feel a sense of ""pushiness"" during the process.  

We are enjoying our new car and we have adopted the team at Huffines into our car family.  After the great experience I had buying our new car my attitude about car shopping has improved 100%.  Thank you Huffines, John, Ken, Darren and Roosevelt.  I highly recommend this team to anyone and will definitely buy my next car from this amazing dealership.",5.0
1206,"April 08, 2011",Robert is fabulous! He made this the best car buying experience ever! For two months he has worked with me to get just the right vehicle. I love my 2011 Elantra! Everything he said he would do he did. I will be bragging a long time about his attentiveness and courtesy. He kept me informed regularly on his progress and delivered what he said he would. When my car finally arrived he closed the deal for me effortlessly. I am impressed with his customer service. He even gave this lil old lady a big hug! Great Job Robert and Hyundai!,5.0
1207,"April 05, 2011","I am happy to say that this is the second vehicle that I have purchased from Huffines Hyundai in Plano in the last 1 ¬Ω years.  This vehicle was for my wife who has very definite demands as to the type of vehicle that she wanted.  Mr. Donahue and Mr. Winston were very amenable to my point of view as to the ‚Äúpackage‚Äù and accessories that I wanted on this vehicle.  I buy my cars ""on-line"" to avoid the face to face hassles.  I was told by sales people at 3 other Hyundai dealerships that ""they lying to you"".  ""No dealership can sell you the Sonata Limited for that price"".  ""They will raise the price when you walk in the door"".  I am happy to report that the ""Nay Sayers"" were WRONG!!!!  As a matter of fact they were willing to listen to and better the price that I had received from another dealership.  

Not only will I purchase another vehicle from them, but I also have ALL of the service on my 2 Hyundai‚Äôs (2011 Sonata Limited & 2008 Veracruz Limited) performed by their fantastic service department.

THIS IS HOW CAR BUYING SHOULD BE!!!!!!!!!",5.0
1208,"April 04, 2011","I walked onto this lot with my husband to look at a buying a car for myself. We had just returned a used car at a different dealership due to many issues and was relieved when our experience here turned out so much better. 

Robert Freeman was the first person to greet us out on the lot and I had no more doubts after he showed us the two cars I was interested in. While the Elantra was impressive for a compact sedan I fell in love with the Tuscon and found one with all the features I wanted. Hyundai's standard safety features were just the icing on the cake. 

After deciding on the car, we went back inside and filled out the paperwork. While we waited for financing (it was a busy Saturday night so understandably busy) Robert talked with us and offered us refreshments. 

I drove off after a total of 4.5 hours with a brand new car I love. After my husband returned his car from the same used dealership we had issues with before, we came back and bought another car from Robert. We are excited about our new cars and thank Huffines Hyundai Plano and Robert for such a great experience!",5.0
1209,"April 04, 2011","My wife and I both purchased new cars from this dealer. My wife first, then I went back a few days later. We worked with Robert both times and we were very pleased after leaving on both occasions. The prices were right were we expected them to be after research on the internet.

We did have a bit of a wait waiting for financing (just due to the large number of people there buying cars), but Robert offered us snacks and water and stayed to chat with us most of the time we waited. Also once we got to meet with financing, things were quick and easy.

Everyone from sales to finance to the maitnance department seems knowledgable and willing to help. 

I even had question about my car last weekend and stopped by to ask. They answered my question quickly and helped me sort out my problem. 

I recommend this dealership to anyone looking to buy a new Hyundai.",5.0
1210,"April 04, 2011","This car buying experience was the easiest, fastest and most pleasant. The Huffines Team were all very helpful and informative. We spoke with Jonathan be for arriving at the dealership, we arrived at noon and drove off with a car at 3:45. We brought our 4yr old son with and he was very occupied with the kids area and friendly staff.",5.0
1211,"March 27, 2011","My family contacted Mike via e-mail. He had answers to my questions. Answers that were up front and honest. Called me back when i left him a voicemail. Also, he called to follow up. Upfront honest pricing. Easy to work with. Very knowledgable about my car. Also, a great finance team. ",5.0
1212,"March 26, 2011","	On 12/22/2010 my wife and I visited your Plano showroom to look at the Hyundai Genesis. There we were met by Mr. Eddy Erangey who showed us the vehicles available and took us for a test drive. I had done a lot of research and was pleased that the vehicle lived up to all I had read. After ¬†negotiating with Mr Erangey and Mr Winston we decided to purchase the Pearl White Genesis 4.6 we were then introduced to Ms Rodriguez who helped us through all of the financial arrangements. We left that evening behind the wheel of our new Genesis, both happy with our purchase and happy with the fair and professional treatment by your Plano team.
	For the next 3 months we enjoyed every minute behind the wheel of our car and bragged proudly to all who would listen about the incredible car we had purchased and about the wonderful experience we had with Eddy and the rest of the Plano team. Then on the evening of March 19th my wife and I were involved in a horrifying collision with a pick up truck that ran a red light. We struck the truck at 55 MPH. Miraculously we escaped with relatively minor injuries although our beloved Genesis was doomed to the salvage yard.
	This was when I called Mr. Erangey who sprang into action. Mr Erangey made arrangements with Mr. Winston to acquire for us the exact same vehicle and they agreed that they would match our earlier price. This afternoon we again met with your team and took possession of our new Hyundai Genesis exactly the same as the previous model. As I set behind the wheel I realized how lucky we were to be behind the wheel of such a beautiful and safe vehicle but more so how fortunate we are to have met and made friends with such a wonderful caring group of professionals. I would also like to mention Mr Darren Medieros who helped us with the financial arrangements today as well as Mr Leon Abezguaz who did the delivery on the car today. You are very fortunate to have such a stellar group of individuals as part of your team",5.0
1213,"March 26, 2011","Researched on Internet and was contacted by several dealerships, but Huffines Hyundai was the only one that bent over backwards to find the 2011 Sonota Limited that my husband was looking for. I first dealt with Roosevelt May, General Manager, then was introduced to Lamar Rogers, who also helped us get familiar with our new car. Mr. May was wonderful in communicating with me when he got the car. Mr. Rogers showed us the features of the car, and even hooked up our cell phones to the Bluetooth in the car. Both were exceptional in customer service, making sure we got what we were looking for and in the end, we came back 2 weeks later, and I traded in my 2009 Toyota Corolla for a new 2011 Hyundai Sonota SE. I hated the drive and traffic getting to this dealership, but it was well worth it! I tried to buy from a local dealership in Tyler, but they apparently were not interested in having our business. You will not be disappointed with the service and personal care you are given at Huffines. We would highly recommend this dealership. Like I said, worth the drive!!!",5.0
1214,"March 22, 2011",Great expierence. The usual back and forth on price. Physical facility of dealership needs updating. Appeared drab and univiting.Salesman was very detailed and explained all the functions of the vehicle. Process was delayed somewhat since we purchased a vehicle deliverd that day.,4.8
1215,"March 08, 2011",We had a great experience with the team at Huffines Hyndai.  They stayed late past closing to get us what we wanted.  Chris Carlson was very professional and straight-forward with us.  He offered us much more information about the car than we would have normally expected and is sending us a replacement part for free.,5.0
1216,"November 24, 2010","Mu husband had communicated with Dan previous to our arrival at the dealership, and Dan was professional and courteous so we decided to visit the dealership.  The price Dan provided to us via e-mail for the 2011 Sonata Limited was also lower than others we had contacted, and Huffines had exactly the color we wanted.  When we arrived at the dealership, Dan greeted us and located the exact car we were interested in.  Dan was very respectful of our time and sent us on the test drive while our trade-in was being evaluated.  When we returned from the test drive, Dan began the negotiation process, which was very relaxed and respectful.  Dan worked very hard with his finance/sales manager to come up with an acceptable price, which they did.  We had been pre-approved for the 2.9% financing so that process was very simple as well.  We were debating between the Sonata and a similarly equipped Honda Accord and decided we need to step away and evaluate our choices before purchasing.  Dan respected this and gave us our space with a calm, courteous manner.  I would HIGHLY recommend him and Huffines to anyone interested in a Hyundai.",5.0
