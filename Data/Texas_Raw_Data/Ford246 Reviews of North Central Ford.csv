5,"May 19, 2020","I purchased the maintenance plan on my F250.  Everything was fine until I got to 50k miles, where I was then told (it's definitely not clear in the contract) that I have a certain amount of services and then my plan is over.  No big deal, you can't have an indefinite plan, totally understood.  I take it back for my next oil change at 57k miles and i'm told the plan is over at 61k miles.  Different than a set number.  Still, not that big of a deal, a little gray but I know.  Not a lot of caring from the employees delivering that news, but I was informed.  Fast forward to Covid19, 61,500 miles I take it in because Texas had a Shelter in place order.  Was told no way was the plan still good, no flexibility, no empathy.  During a pandemic, and in a tough place for everyone, North Central Ford is there with their hand out and not willing to bend at all for the last service on a plan they probably over charged me for in the first place.  The attitudes didn't help the situation at all, if youre looking for a business to have a good long term buying and service relationship with, this is not the one.",1.8

17,"March 19, 2020","Thinking Ford would find several issues that needed to be token care off.  Minimal service required for trip.  Great.
Roy reminded me of broken rear tail light crack. Told him to replace it now; he did and picked up my truck the next morning.
Have been a Ford Truck Man for many years.  When time to replace truck, I tell myself to check other trucks.  I almost did the last time.  I had made up my mind to get a Ram this time, but I made myself go look at the Ford 150 before deciding.
One look and forget Ram; Ford 150 again.

24,"February 16, 2020","Subject: Proceed With Caution

North Central Ford of Richardson has a great selection, friendly staff, and overall fair experience during the purchasing process. This appears to be window dressing for an incredibly poor post purchase support experience.
TLDR: Nice before cash in hand. Curt and dishonest after the sale.

While I was considering the vehicle I purchased, I expressed concern about maintenance history and inspection of the vehicle. Their listing photos showed a warning light on the dash, which wasn't lit when I test drove the vehicle. So, I asked what the issue was and whether it had been resolved. 

I was informed that this light was due to tire pressure, which was thoroughly inspected while the tires were balanced and rotated. I was told not to worry, and that the dealership moves more than 400 cars monthly - so rest assured that they're incredibly thorough and all maintenance was up to date.

Less than two days after my purchase the light came back. I took the car to my local Toyota dealership and was informed that:
The engine thermostat needed to be replaced.
The tire pressure sensors were deffective.
Engine fluids needed servicing and had not been maintenanced on schedule.
Oh, and by the way... There was no way they could have balanced, rotated, or otherwise inspected the tires as the rims were locked on with incorrectly installed lug nuts that would need a specialty tool to be removed.

I contacted the dealership - wanting them to resolve the issues. They had stated they had resolved all of these things and completed an inspection - an obvious lie.  No one I spoke to including the General Manager cared about me at all - remainign completely indiferent about how their dishonest dealings had impacted me. The only person who showed any sense of human sensitivity and willingness to help me was the Used Cars Manager: Billy Plasket - and to him I'm grateful.

Billy agreed to have the car serviced in their service department again and also by Discount Tires - where the tire pressure monitors were to be replaced.  At least the two tire sensors that had low readings.  Upon inspection, Discount Tire discovered one of the rear tires was not road worthy, and had rotted so poorly in places that they were for concerned for the passenger's safety. Additionally, the other tires were so worn that the entire set of four would need to be replaced to match the fourth new tire. And to top it off, the spare was rotted and not road worthy and it's tire pressure monitor was also dead. But... They did a thorough inspection right?

I believe Billy advocated for me - but I'm sure the indiferent General Manager overrode him - because North Central Ford of Richardson declined to replace the tire and dismissed the concern for safety for me and my family. They insisted they had done all they would.

To date I'm left with the cost of five new tires, three tire pressure monitors, plus gas time and energy ALL ... On a vehicle I was assured had been thoroughly inspected. I suspect somoene simply cleared the error code long enough to get the car off the lot so somone, unfortunately me, could be taken advantage of. 
This is shameful.

I'm an honest, hard working, single mother. I saved for several years to pay cash for a new car for me and my family. Not only did I not get what I paid for; I got a financial liability I can't afford and a car that put me and my children at danger as we drove on the highway with rotted tires ready to blow underneath us. I'm not sure how these people sleep at night, but I'm sure it must take zoologic doses of tranquilizers to quell the shame of scamming those who already have so slim of margins.

If you insist on buying a vehicle from this dealership, do yourself a favor... Have an independent mechanic perform an inspection and pull historic code readings from the computer to see if they've tried to cover any errors they would rather not rectify. Or, save yourself the time and keep on moving. Look elsewhere for integrity and ethical business dealings.",1.0

37,"November 07, 2019",The finance team at this dealership is full of crooks. They blatantly lie about the service policies they sell you and as soon as you realize and fill out the paperwork for a refund you never hear back from them.

39,"October 08, 2019","Saw a used truck I liked on the website. Sent an online inquiry to verify if the truck was still available.  Got a nice email and text from Josh confirming it was.  We discussed a mutually beneficial day/time to come by for a test drive (I live about 30 miles from this dealership).  Drove the truck and really liked it.  Got a trade-in quote for my current truck and some estimated payments on financing the difference.  

Went home and talked with wife.  We'd been badly burned on a used vehicle a couple of years back by a different dealer, one who hid some serious issues.  As a result, asked Josh if we could get a mechanic to check it out.  He welcomed it.  

The mechanic showed up and Josh pointed him to the right truck, and they had a great interaction (Josh is a very personable and down-to-earth person).  The mechanic gave me a clean bill-of-health, so Josh and I coordinated calendars again for me to come in and finalize the deal.  

I got a good truck for a fair price, a respectable trade-in value, and a reasonable financing deal.  My total in-person time at the dealership was probably about 2 - 3 hours across the two visits (and some of that was the test drive).  Josh was great at communicating electronically, which was ultra-convenient (especially since I live so far away from the dealership).  

I have nothing but good things to say about my experience with North Central Ford, and will recommend them to others.",4.8

I then saw grease foot print/shoe marks on both the driver and passenger side door thresholds from mechanics get in and out of the vehicle. My sunroof is repaired and working properly, but I will need to take it back to have them clean my headliner and visers.

60,"March 15, 2019","I took my 2014 Ford F150 with a 5.0 V-8 in for service. On the prior Saturday the truck would not start although the starter would crank (and my battery was replaced in October). After trying off and on over about an hour it surprisingly started. Later on Saturday the red battery light came on from time to time while driving. I fired the truck up a couple of times on Sunday without any issues. As I was driving to work on Monday the battery light came on again so I called Ronnie Ralph with North Central Ford who has been my go to Service Adviser for 20+ years and took the truck in to have it checked. (The check engine light never came on during this process.) 

Ronnie and the Service Staff were not able to replicate the problems I experienced over the weekend. But they were able to quickly diagnose that I needed to replace the alternator. Ronnie also noticed when he looked at the truck when we were checking it in that the coolant reservoir looked empty; and, they further diagnosed that there were a couple of holes in the coolant reservoir, that the water pump was leaking, and the main water hose from the radiator to the block was leaking. The Service Department also noted that there was a service advisory for the fuse link to the starter, examined the link and recognized the fuse link was starting to melt and required relocation. (Fortunately, I purchased the extended service policy on the truck so I had to pay a deductible plus the cost of the hose.)  

Ronnie and the Service Staff were able to identify all of the issues with the truck, get everything repaired, return the truck to sound running condition, and even return what was a dirty truck when I dropped it off as a clean vehicle. I have been driving the truck for a couple of weeks after the repairs and everything runs like new with no other problems. I am sure that someone else probably would have only keyed in on the electrical system because that was the focus of my complaints. 
But for Ronnie's keen eye and the Service Department's attention to detail I would have had to return another time to address the obviously impaired coolant system. 

Thank you Ronnie Ralph and North Central Ford!!!",5.0

After $900 of service and labor as I picked up the truck the Ac made the same noise and they made excuses that it was another problem. They never fixed the issue. They wanted me to spend another $500 to fix what I had requested in the first place. Do your job. Tired of Ford Service Department always squeezing more money out of their customers.

89,"July 24, 2018","I inquired about a pickup on line, they contacted me and I informed them I worked in West Texas and would let them know when I could come in. They contacted me again and again I told them the situation. Then a telemarketer called and I told her I hat d being badgered. About 5 days later I told them I’d be in to see the truck, which was still listed on their website. I got there and they said they didn’t think I was coming.

So I asked to see the truck. A manager comes out and tells me they cannibalized the truck for parts. I told them that would have been nice to know as we drove a long way to come see it. He said they had a different one I might be interested in, so I agreed. They can back and said that one was sold as well. They had one more I might like so I agreed. It was a nice truck, I drove it and checked it out and a deal was made. They sent it to the detail shop. Once the deal was done, which took three hours, the truck wasn’t ready.

After another HOUR I was getting irate, I mean, how long does it take to detail a truck? I finally took delivery, and drove home. They said in person and on the website that the truck was fully serviced. The next morning I checked tha oil and it was as black as fresh crude! NO WAY was this truck serviced!!!

And, the next day it broke down twice! The turbo hose blew off! Twice it blew off! 

I would not recommend ever doing business with these people. In fact, I would turn to public transportation before buying here! BEWARE! ",2.0

92,"May 23, 2018","DO NOT BUY A CAR FROM THIS DEALERSHIP. I will start by saying I was purchasing the vehicle from out of state, and so I had to ask relatives to take time out of their day to drive to the dealership and look at the car for me. Shortly afterwards, I agreed to buy the car. I spent time setting up insurance, and began the necessary steps with the Salesman, Hector Gomez, to buy the vehicle. At 10am the next morning, I was informed that the car sold to another customer. Little did I know, even after having agreed to purchase the car, it was still being shown to other customers—ridiculous! After speaking on the phone with the manager and verifying what was occurring, they informed me it was “standard business practice” to sell to a customer who is physically there in person over someone in another state—nevermind one who agreed to purchase the car a day prior. I was completely bewildered by this. They stood by this “business practice,” which I view as wholly unethical, and deem them as an untrustworthy dealership with shady business practices. After spending several hours with Hector, I was awaiting further instructions to wire money to them (and consequently stopped searching for cars), and they sold the car behind my back. They gave the initial outward impression of being friendly and caring, but in reality were unethical, deceitful, and entirely self-serving.  It was a significant waste of time, and I will not be granting them any business anytime in the future.

Off to the dealership. Wait in service drive for some time, but no one came out to assist, so I went in and was greeted from afar by one advisor behind a desk. Asked for the advisor who I was assigned, was informed he no longer worked there. Another bad sign, I was told to wait at my vehicle and someone (there are 5 or 6 advisors all sitting at desks not working with any customer) would be with me shortly.  Ok. 

So after sitting in the drive for a bit, I gave up and left.

After jumping through hoops to get to places, you know, like work, I really hoped the truck would be ready by noon the next day so I could get lunch this time around.

But nope, I missed lunch again and what's worse I was told that the technician had to leave and the truck wasn't fixed and I had to get it back.

133,"December 18, 2014","It was rather painless experience until I got my paperwork and discovered I was bamboozled by the finance guy.  It all starts with what a great price for this great car, so you think, then you go into the finance guy who has all the paperwork prefilled in for you.  He even knows you are going to accept all these needles options, as there is already an X in the accept box of each of these items. I am talking about products they put on the car, but they are invisible, things like PHAMPTOM FOOTPRINTS, $259.00,  then there is PERMASKIN, a clear coat, so you really can't say for sure if they actually put this stuff on the vehicle, $329.00,  Then there is GAP coverage in the event you total your vehicle and the insurance amount is less than your payoff.  How could this be a winner for someone who puts down 50% on the vehicle and in fact told the finance guy that he was planning on paying the loan off in 6 months?  why would any want that under that situation?  If the finance guy is a finance guy, then publicly respond to this with your justification of needing a GAP coverage when 50% down payment on the vehicle was made, and your were told of my intentions on paying the vehicle off in 6 months.  Now is your chance to put me in my place.  Anyways, $653.00 for GAP cancellation coverage.  Next, Easy Key care, you loose your key, they will replace it for free.  $329.00.  I probably would have jumped onto that one, as I have experienced loosing a key or two over the years.  But, for their tactics, I am canceling it anyways.  They could have made money honestly, but instead, they are greedy and just try to take everything they can from everyone knowing only a few will really ever know.  Then there is a DentCare program for which I have no paperwork on, but whatever that is, it was $674.00.  Finally, the is the Vehicle Service Contract, or the extended warranty.  It was never offered to me or suggested to me.  That one I had noticed and I was told it is required for financing.  He said don't worry, you can cancel it, but just wait 30 days before you do.  That option was $2,027.  So I acknowledge that I knew there was that in the deal, but none of the other slip-ins.  So buyers beware, caveat emptor, because the car I thought I was bargaining for contained none of the aforementioned items or accessories were listed on the window sticker.  But somehow, this invisible antitheft thing was installed on the vehicle while I must have been in the bathroom and probably occurring at the same time they were applying this clear coat protectant on my soon to be vehicle.  They probably employ Invisible Man at the dealership to put on these invisible products.  So the car listed at $23,000 was considered a fair value for the vehicle, but when you add $4,272 in crap, that is considered a good day for the dealership.
It has been 16 days since I have sent off these request for cancellations and they received them on December 2, 2014, yet they have failed to refund my money and have not even acknowledge receipt of the cancellations from me and letting me know that they are working on it.  For that reason, I am making everyone aware that as I now know, you don't have to accept these little warranties and insurances for financing.  Make sure you sit there and read every word of what you are signing.  

 Because of that, I have spent $45.00 in postage for signature confirmations on cancellations notices, and I am paying interest on $4,272 of crap I wasn't even told about, except for the extended service plan, but only after I discovered it.",2.0

137,"May 25, 2014","I leased a Fusion 2 years ago and it was time to lease a new vehicle.  I decided to upgrade to a 2014 Explorer.  The salesperson who leased me the Fusion, Kevin Mayes actually started calling me about 6 months before my current lease expired.  Candidly, as you know most salespeople don't do a good job with follow up so kudos to him.  We talked earlier in the week and when I arrived on Saturday he made the transition to the new Explorer as seamless as possible.  My wife even commented how professional he was and really appreciated the ease and the quickness of the sale.  In addition William Mills kept it fun and Jill and Shahan handled the financing and paperwork expeditiously.  Lastly, Kevin did a thorough delivery including offering to sync my phone.  My wife's lease on her Escape is up next year and we will definitely buy or lease all of our vehicles from North Central Ford. I suggest everyone to shop and buy at North Central Ford.  I promise you will love the True Price ""no hassle"" buying experience!",5.0
138,"March 19, 2014","As a paranoid, TNO-type of person, I had a great experience at North Central Ford selling my vehicle to them. Initially, I had showed the car to another dealership who made a enticing offer. I contacted Myrna of North Central Ford the day before about the vehicle and she gave me a call while being at the other dealership to bring my vehicle to theirs for appraisal. It was a decision I was glad to have made in hindsight as they made an competitive offer that eclipsed the previous dealer's offer. Throughout the selling process, a great, young man that is Ryan Mitchell assisted me through the whole appraisal and sales transaction. When an agreement was reached on the sale between me and the dealership my paranoid thoughts about getting scammed popped up. George and Ryan did a gracious job of calming my fears and helping me realize I was doing business with a reputable dealership. They were right. After the sale was completed. Ryan was gracious enough to give me a courtesy ride back home as well as a stop to deposit the check for the sale (which cleared the next business day). In summary, I would definitely do business with North Central Ford again.",5.0
139,"February 19, 2014","We had been in the market for a new vehicle for a couple of weeks when we came to North Central Ford. We had found a vehicle we were interested in on their website and came to the lot to look at that particular vehicle. When we arrived we found other vehicles that we had not seen online. We weren't on the lot more than a few minutes when we were greeted by Willie Causey. He was friendly and casual. We told him what we were looking for and he presented us with several options. The first was out of our price range, and once we told him that, he only presented us with options that were in our range. He did not push to get us into something more expensive. When we found one we liked, he went with us on a test drive and made good conversation with us. We felt like we were riding with a friend. After returning to the dealership we inspected the vehicle further. Willie was very knowledgeable about the vehicle, but in an effort to be thorough, we asked if it would be possible to put the vehicle on a lift in the maintenance shop to check out the mechanical condition. Willie made that possible and even had one of the mechanics come over and look at it with us and explain what to look for and where to look. After we were satisfied that it was the one we wanted, we went with Willie to discuss terms. Again, he was friendly and fair with us. He got us a great trade in value, and got us a great price on the vehicle. We were comfortable and impressed with Willie all through the process. If I could give him 10 stars, I would. He did an excellent job. We worked with Kevin Logan for financing. He was also friendly and very knowledgeable. He made sure to explain thing accurately and completely, and answered all our questions more than sufficiently. The entire process was pain free and very very positive. Even walking through the office we were greeted by other employees who were all friendly and respectful. Before coming to North a Central Ford, we had a very negative experience with a different dealership and we were very skeptical about dealerships. The people at North Central Ford restored our faith in dealerships. Willie even walked us through how to use all the new features on our new SUV. This dealership is a cut above the rest. A truly outstanding place to do business. I recommend considering this dealer to everyone who is in the market for a new or used Ford. We did not leave with the vehicle we came to look at, we left with a better one! Outstanding job North Central Ford!! ",4.8
140,"February 17, 2014","Most enjoyable car buying experience ever....went in to buy  a car for my daughter and her husband and ending up trading in my pick up too.  The guys were willing to do whatever it took to make both deals but there was NEVER any pressure through any of the process.

141,"January 31, 2014","Just wanted to do a test drive of a 2014 Escape.   The salesman Chris was very accommodating and respectful.  I did not feel pressure or impatience with my questions and my desire to only test drive.   He let me drive both an Edge and an Escape.   Later, the manager was polite and very engaging.   I was so impressed with the level of respect I was receiving, considering I had basically stopped by on the way from my swim workout.   I was not dressed like I had money at all.   A few days later the top sales manager called me and asked if everything went fine and offered me to come out for more test drives and even offered longer solo test drives if I was interested.   I can only summarize by saying, their professionalism and respect was more than I had ever imagined and if they had the car that was right for me, they would be the first to get my business.   The one thing the car industry is still short of are car dealers who respect customers.   This dealership is an asset to the Ford brand.   ....a good name is better than fine riches - Proverbs",4.8

146,"September 03, 2013","Norm is well organized and knows his material.   He is detailed.  I didn't have to play dealer sales games - he went thru all available incentives to make sure no discount was left out.  If I had any regret, it was not learning more about the options - it is much cheaper to get something like a tow package WITH the purchase, than aftermarket, for example.    I was so worried about price, I tried to turn down every option.   I did not even want satellite radio - I was very certain about this - but the model I wanted had it included so Norm tried to assure me I would like it.. and apparently the entire family loves it, along with the car.

Barb let me drive both, taking the time to discuss the features of each vehicle during our test drives.  Barb put me at ease, making me feel comfortable asking all sorts of questions. Barb was incredibly patient and considerate. She demonstrated her competence as well as compassion, as I tearfuly departed from the Malibu.

181,"May 08, 2013",I took my 2004 Mustang GT for diagnose due to check engine light turn which caused it to fail inspection (emission issue). The result indicates “Alternator” over charging issue. The cost to replace an alternator is $758 (2 hours to replace the alternator and one hour for reset the vehicle program). 1 hour needed to reset the program? I went to the dealer to ask for a copy of the diagnose report. Roy was out to lunch and one of his associate refused to provide me a copy. His explanation is that the work is done on an iPad and they don’t have the capability to print out a report.

184,"March 21, 2013","I went there because of a letter I received from them that they would buy my car above the book value. I went there and the guy was the most unpleasant experience I had since the beginning. He just took the VIN number and didn't looked at the car. He didn't even walked with me to his room. He sent me there and asked me to sit while he works on it. I was waiting there for 20 min and then he came to his room. Looking at me like I am a thief or something. 

Then he told me they are not interested as the car has so much history. When I bought the car I didn't know about the ""HISTORY"" so I tried to asked him more but he was like ""This car doesn't worth a dime"" and he didn't give me much information. He was behaving like I had 2 major accidents with this car and I wanted to rip them off. After having this unpleasant situation going on for like 5 min he asked me how much I want to sell the car. And I didn't have any idea, so honestly I told him I don't know. Then he told me that the price is probably like $6000. I was shocked as I bought the car $17000 eighteen months ago. Of course it was my first car purchase and it might not be the best price for it, but the car is still 2 years old with 25000 miles only. 

So I left this dealership and took the car to an independent dealer across the highway. They gave me a price of $13,000. They were nice enough to tell me that if I put it on Craigslist I can probably sell it for 14,500 to 15,000 too. I was so shocked by the Ford dealer as I was trusting them all the time and was taking my car there for service and oil change every 4000 miles. I guess you live and learn. My takeaway from this was I will never go to their store. And will advice all people I know not to get close to their dealership. ",1.0

188,"November 20, 2012","At 46 years of age, I have to state this has been my worst buying experience ever. As a Pastor starting a non-profit to assist formerly incarcerated individuals to find work, I needed a minivan to transport these individuals.  As a nonprofit, I had little money to make mistakes.  I chose not to purchase anything from the smaller side dealers and thought it would be worth the little extra to purchase from a larger reputable dealer.  I search for months in the greater Houston area.  Not finding much I branched out to the Dallas/Ft. Worth area. 

I saw a Ford Windstar that caught my eye at North Central.  I talked extensively with the salesperson over the phone about the vehicle for about two weeks.  With assurance I was informed that this is the vehicle to buy.  I then flew to Dallas to purchase the vehicle.  I inspected the vehicle to the best of my mechanical ability and noticed the radiator resevoir was horribly brown.  The sales person brought a mechanic over who took the vehicle into service but returned shortly and stated it just needed flushing. 

The sales person took me to autozone and I purchased the product for which the mechanic flushed the system.  During the paperwork process, I was brought into the office to sign the finance paperwork.  I asked them why have I been waiting for over four hours when I had already been financed with my credit union.  They informed that their financing was better.  IT WAS NOT!  I then informed them I wasn't here to finance but to buy. I found out later that autodealers often get points or kickbacks of some sort for financing customers.  Not sure about that. 

I finally left NCF to drive the 4 hours back to Houston at about 7 in the eve (6 hours after initially arriving).  An hour into the drive, the entire brake light system turned on so I immediately pulled over and called the salesperson and asked if I should return. He eventually called me back and said the mechanic said it would reset after turning the vehicle off.  It did so I preceded to Houston whereby the lights came on again.  A week later the vehicle severely overheated.  Taking it to a mechanic to get the over heating and the braking system examined, he informed me the head gasket was blown, the radiator was corroded and possible water pump.  I notified NCF for which they offered 500.00 on a 1200.00 overheating problem and nothing on the brakes (another 1157.00).  I got the complete intake system done along with a new radiator but could not afford the water pump.  The vehicle continued to overheat when the ac was turned on so I decided to then take it to Joey Meyers Ford.  They said the water pump was failing and needed to be replaced.  While Joey Meyers Ford really tried hard to work with me to repair the vehicle at little gain to them, I just couldn't afford it any longer.

I then called NCF and offered to return the vehicle and get something else.  They said it was after the 3 day return policy and couldn't accept it for which I said ""I would have returned it when I was an hour outside of Dallas if it wasn't for the salesperson telling me it's ok""  They did apologize but said it's a used vehicle but agreed to give me 1000.00 for the van and sell me something else.  That deal would have left me 4000.00 in the hold as I still owed 2300 for the van not to mention another eight hour drive to turn it in to them. 

After much regret, and needing to move on, I sold it to a mechanic taking a 3000.00 (total) loss and delaying moving forward with our nonprofit.  This has been a major nightmare. I agree it was a used 3600.00 vehicle and NEVER expected it would drive or perform like a new ford, however I would have thought that such a reputable dealership would allow their rep to be tarnished for what amounted to so much for me but, but literally pennies for them.  

On the positive, they appeared genuinely disheartened at my situation but (lol) not enough to do much about it.  I believe that their are dozens, if not hundreds of people that have had success with NCF, I just am not one of them.  ",2.2
189,"October 16, 2012","Policies, practices and procedures of this dealership are not customer friendly.  It was explained to me that they are part of a Big Corporation and that ""this is how we do it""...""unlike some of the smaller operations that have only 3-4 dealerships"".  I offered that perhaps they are too big to sell me a car.

I told them several times that I wanted to pay for the car with no need for financing.  After I accepted the deal they came back with a credit report and asked me to sign it.  When I asked why they ran a credit report the answer was, ""To prove you are who you say you are, and not a terrorist"".  I walked out.  

The next day I went to another Ford dealership ~5 miles away and purchased an identical vehicle.  The buying experience there was simple, pleasant and respectful.",2.6
190,"October 12, 2012",I was working with  Dwight Scott to cancell Extended service plan on a Vehice purched at North Central Ford. He did not performe his job in a timely manner nor would he return my calls. I spoke with him today and he raised his voice at me an stated he had a hundred things more important that mine. I told him Ford Credit advised me to call Customer Servive and he responded he did'nt care who i called. I have purched enough new for vehicles to be in Fleet. I will not buy another car from North Central ford as Long as he works there. He is rude and arrogent !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1.0
191,"September 04, 2012","I took our '07 Expedition in for a diagnostic check to help identify the reason for the ""jerk"" or ""missing"" that was occurring during normal driving conditions.  I agreed to the $138 diagnostic fee and was explicitly told that the fee would be deducted from the complete service ticket (free diagnostic) if we decided to have the work done at North Central Ford.  If we decided not to have the service completed there, we would pay the $138 for the diagnosis and were free to complete the service at the mechanic of choice.  It was diagnosed quickly through a computer check that we had 3 of 8 plugs misfiring and we needed to replace them as well and refresh the computer.  The cost was $345 for the plugs and tune up and another $118 for the computer reset.  If they broke a plug during removal it was another $99 per broken plug (max 3 or $297).  However when I asked that I wanted any broken plug to ensure I was not being taken advantage of, they agreed and we hung up to complete the work.  Within the hour I received another call from the service manager explaining the total cost was adding back in the original $138 from the diagnostic.  When I questioned him to understand how that $138 was being added back into the total cost I did not get a straight answer and was told that since I picked a ""menu item"" the diagnostic would not be credited towards the total ticket since the menu item already has discounted rates.  It became obvious at that point that they were not going to be able to increase the average ticket price with the $99 per broken plug because I wanted to see them and instead they were going to add back in the diagnostic fee of $138 to increase the ticket price.  When I went to pick up the vehicle I asked for a better explanation and after 15 minutes I did not get one and when asked to speak to a manager was told that was not an option and even if I did speak to one, he would give me the same response.  It was unfortunate to have this experience considering up to the shell game on the payment I had a good experience with quick diagnosis, an easy to understand fix and what I thought to be a reasonable approach to spending $138 up front for a diagnosis and the ability to get that credited if we had the work done there.  If indeed this is standard practice at North Central Ford it should be explained at every chance, 1)upfront that the credit is not for ""menu items"" and 2)at the time of making a go/no go decision to have the work completed there.  That may not have changed our decision for them to complete the work but the expectation and feeling of deceit would have been eliminated.  Even after a poor explanation from my service manager and a request for someone else to explain it, I was not given that opportunity and actually told it would do me no good.  Very disappointing and I would not recommend North Central Ford for service work because of the poor/deceitful communication and lack of customer service.",1.8
192,"August 21, 2012","Thank you Sean for listening to what I was looking for. I know plans changed from when I first spoke to you about 5 months ago. You answered all my questions, understood when I said I was not ready when I first came to get information. Again you listened when I came back to test drive vehicles and gave me information on other items I should look at.

Most important, when I had stated that I did not want to be contacted until I was ready to buy, you honored that. I think I heard from you or North Central Ford twice over the last 5 or 6 months and both times were just touching base and letting me know that when I was ready, you were there. That had more to do with me staying in touch with you and calling you on Saturday.

When I called you on Saturday when my current car started giving me issues and my plans again had to change, you came through for me. You did not try sell me a vehicle that was more than I could afford. You will be the person I contact when I am ready to replace the one I bought this Saturday, even if in the far distance future you have moved somewhere else.

199,"June 16, 2012","I came into the dealership just to look at some of the new cars in Ford’s line up and consider a few different options as a possible upgrade from my ten year old gas guzzling SUV. Doug spoke with me about the things that were important to me in my current vehicle and why I was so attached that I have kept it for so long. I felt he really listened and paid attention to the things that mattered the most to me when it comes to owning my car. Over the years, I have visited numerous dealerships just to brows and have often spoke with the sales reps about possibly changing vehicles which always lead to me being more satisfied to keep my current vehicle rather than take on a new car payment. Doug was diligent in his effort to find the right vehicle that offered everything I could ever ask for and more, and he also managed to find the right car that placed my payment within 1 dollar of my very strict budget confinements.  I was literally blow away by his professionalism and moved by his compassion. I felt like Doug actually cared about what I wanted and needed and he was so happy for me and my bride to be when we drove away in our new Ford Edge. He also took the time to walk us around the lot and introduce us to the service department manager and let us know exactly what to do in times of service repair needs and routine maintenance visits.

204,"May 31, 2012","I had a bad experience with this dealership.  I traded in a car and ended up owing the dealership 290.00 plus the spare key to the car I traded.  It took me a few days to locate the spare key at which time I mailed the key and the check.  During these few days I received threatening calls and demands.  They were going to come and repo the vehicle I purchased, never-mind the fact that they had possession of my vehicle.  They wanted me to give them a credit card over the phone which I refused to do because I had already sent in the check and key.

The other issue that I had was that it took almost 3 hours to complete the deal, 2 of which I spent waiting in a room for the finance guy, even thought I did pretty much an even swap.  I am a very busy person and this dealership has shown a complete lack of caring about anything but their bottom line.  I won't be back there, not even for service.",1.3

We narrowed down the choices to four and from those choices I was then able to make the decision for the truck I purchased. I've been told by others that most sales are on average four to six hours in duration so I've felt somewhat bad about using up all of Norm's day since he spent a good eight hours with me by the time all the paperwork was completed.

Well the guy told me to come back Saturday because he had to get someone to finance it. I go back Saturday and he tells me he cant get anyone to finance the car because it has too many miles on it, BUT he could put me in a new 2010 if I put down another 500 so I went and picked out a car and he said call him Monday and he would tell me if they could get someone to finance it. I call Monday...no answer...So I called back and he said he would call me back. Well he called back a couple of hours saying he still hasn't found out anything and that he would call back when he does. I get out of school and call him back telling him I wanted my money back because they were giving me the run around and he told me that he was going to figure out something and if not then he would give me the money back. He called me back saying come up there and they were going to close the deal. I went up there and the guy told me that I agreed to pay put down another 500 dollars for the older car when I didn't, I said I only agreed to do that if they were going to give me a new car. Well I went ahead and gave him the extra 500 drove the car off the lot later that day...The next day the car runs hot!!! I call the guy and he said ""well drive it up here and we will see whats wrong with it"" I call back 5 minutes later telling him I'm not going to drive the car back up there so that the engine could blow up on me, he asked me ""well the car isn't drivable?"" I said no its drivable if you want it to blow up on me, the dude was pretty much trying to force me to drive the car back up there which the place was no where near where my car ran hot. I told him to send a mechanic or a tow truck out there and he said that it would take 2 hrs and asked again was a sure I couldn't drive the car up there. Well he ended up getting a tow truck to come out and pick up the car like 2+ hrs later and I rode up there with a friend, they told me I had 3 days to decide if I didn't like the car because it was a policy but when I asked them could they put me in another car they refused too. They basically forced this fu**** up car on me and said that they couldn't give me another car because I didn't have any credit and that I could hire me a lawyer and try to file a law suit but if I did I was just wasting my time and money because I'm going to lose the case anyways.

The salesman and financing dept would never tell us what interest rate we were looking at.
I called back the next day, spoke to a director of sales and told them we had gotten our own financing. We wanted the same price on the car and the same amount for our trade in. we discussed the financing and he stated that they would rather finance and that he didnt like the financing we had because they had to pay a fee to the financing company. The director told me he would call me back. he called me back hours later to tell me they no longer accepted that financing.

238,"April 10, 2010","I originally visited the dealership to purchase a used vehicle that I had been looking for.  I found the vehicle, a mustang, on the internet it was exactly what I wanted so I drove out there with out calling because I felt the price on the internet was fair enough.  Not long after I got out of my car a friendly salesman approached me and immediately started telling me about the car and even showed me the carfax upfront.  He offered to take me on a test drive and told me about their complimentary service called ""the Edge"" I fell in love with the car on the test drive and we went inside to talk numbers.  I immediately told the salesman that I had never purchased a vehicle before and my credit wasnt perfect.  In order to save both of us some time he had me fill out a customer statement so I would know what my interest rate would be and therefore be able to quote me accurate payments.  Unfortunately my credit wasnt strong enough to finance a vehicle at that price and the only preowned vehicles that I could get approved for I did not take a liking to.  The salesman suggested a new car and told me about the special finance rates on new cars and about Jill the finance director.  Sceptically I followed him over to the new car department where he showed me a focus.  Definitely not as fun or pretty as the mustang but it is a decent little car and seeing as how mine was out of warranty it was still a better option than what I had and the payments fit my budget.  Jill was able to get me approved with little hassle on my part and got me a great rate as well.  She told me this will get my credit reestablished and so long as I make perfect payments on it for 2 years I should be able to come back and trade it in for what I really want.  North Central Ford was very friendly and helpful the entire time I was there.  I really enjoy my new car and will refer all my friends and family to visit them anytime they are looking for a new or preowned vehicle.",5.0

Sean met me on the front patio of North Central Ford with a warm welcome.
I wanted to look at the new crossovers - Flex & Edge.  We probably test drove
5 vehicles.  He was patient and knowledgeable which I like.  Price was easy sense I work at company that qualifies for special pricing + Rebates.  There were no add-ons to negotiate out of the deal and I like that as well.  I will buy my futures cars there from Sean.   ",5.0
240,"March 09, 2010","On Feb 1, 2010, my 2002 Mercury Sable Premium was in for Safety Insp & replacement of drivers side master window switch due to intermittent operation & Dash Brake light on,had come on earlier in making turn.  At 11:15 a.m. morning of drop off, I was called, told $348 to install new driver door master switch & get state inspection safety sticker because brake fluid added and dash brake light went out, therefore Safety was ok, also apparent that brakes in excellent condition.Car would be ready at end of day. At 4:33 p.m. same day told by Rep that car not ready for pick up as told earlier,"" needed to look into auto o'ver night"".

Feb 3, 2010-4:16 p.m. I was called, told brake light did come on, they must request that they ""go through"" & need to do additional diagnostic, need to do additional diagnostic time ""It is requesting additional information to go through wiring schematic, hopefully its a quick find. I could hardly beleive what was going on and I could not figure out what page of stupid I was supposed to be on that day. So I stopped by to try and get a better explaination. I was told I needed to authorize 2 more hours @$101 per hour. I asked if I was headed for a bill of $1000, to get my car back. I was told ""pretty much"" I authorized the additional time..What do you do..take the car out and go elsewhere and start over with more lost time from work!!! Now you might as well just drop your pants and not pull them up, because it's to be more of the same each time they call you at 4ish in the afternoon with more $$$ needs to pay to check..what you brought the car there for in the first place.

On Feb 4, 2010 @ 4:45 p.m.having no word from FORD I called them, I was told there was an internal short, Cost,an additional $853 dollars plus tax was needed to fix a fuse panel.  I told them to close up my car, I would pick it up before their close, to please save the replaced parts for me & be sure the bill was a line for line detale. I picked up my car to the tune of $881.79 dollars, same brake light on dash board illuminated. In the interim, I went on line to ask.Com pesented to two different FORD/Mercury reps what I was being told from FORD Service rep. I paid the fee for a response & got two (2) responses that acctually matched the fix that was done on my car at an out of town dealership.I was assured by both on-line mechanics, one directly, one in-directly that North Central FORD Service Dept was having a good ole time with me. My car was repaired at a dealership 52 miles away. 

Strange happenings to a one owner car thats serviced each 3k miles or less and has only the the best of service & genuine parts so far. From what I have come to know in many many conversations with co-workers and other repair shops, North Central FORD & (Five Star)aren't going to do anything, not one thing corrective, they don't care. Government bail-outs wait in the wings!!!!!!I will take this experience to FORD in Dearborn & where ever else I find. Thanks for your time.",1.6
241,"August 26, 2009","I've used North Central Ford service twice, both for the same reasons on the same vehicle, a 1997 Ford Mustang Convertible (V6). The first time they were able to fix the car for a somewhat reasonable price, although I still found it a bit high. Still, it was fixed and worked. This time, I sent it in for the same problem. Now, I'm out $500 and all I have is what is wrong with the car, not fixed for that price.

In both situations, we had a short in the wiring that was tripping the anti-theft system and keeping it from starting. It's been less than 12 months and they claimed to have a warranty on their work, but that's not how it ended up. Now, I'm out the $500 and to get fixed will run me another $1k - $2k. This was after an initial $99 upfront fee for just looking at the car and another 3 hours I agreed to since they couldn't find it in that initial inspection. So, I expect around a $400 bill. Instead, I was charged $450 and another $50 for 'shop supply fee'. They charged me for using shop towels and tools! This is on top of their $101 an hour service fee!

This is the exact reason so many companies an compete with dealers on service. Dealers have to find ways to recoup their costs by doing tactics like this that feel to the customer like they've been cheated. I know I feel this way.

I will never go back to this dealership again and I am pretty much of the opinion that if I ever have to use a Ford dealership for service again, I might as well just drop my drawers and pretend to enjoy it.",2.8
242,"March 25, 2007","Truly wonderful service dept    IF   you choose your Advisor wisely.  Charley is as good as it gets!  Even he is sometimes overworked so check with him frequently if the list is long.

The new training Advisors try to push service that is not really necessary or called for at the time. Charley has never ever done this.  He has been spot on with his calls for action.

This has been the best FORD service dept. I've ever dealt with.",4.8
243,"October 05, 2006","I bought a supposedly certified used vehicle from North Central Ford three months ago. In less than 3 months and 3000 miles, it has been serviced for 6 different issues.  The issues included a broken gear shift, trunk lining separating from the car, the lighter not working, a seat belt needing to be replaced and the window getting thoroughly scratched up every time it was rolled down. I met with the GM to discuss the bad service I received from their service department and exchanging the car for a comparable vehicle since mine was obviously not thoroughly check by the dealership. The GM would not exchange the vehicles and told me that if I were a man, I would not be complaining about the concerns I had with vehicle.  Citing his wife as an example, he said only women tend to make a big deal out of small issues like the ones I was having with my car.",1.6
244,"June 26, 2006","1st salesperson told me probably could not get me what I wanted for the price I wanted. So when i was leaving the manager approached me and said, we probably can. They wasted 2 hours of my time and 1st tried to get me to pay $45000 for a $23000 truck, then let me sit and came back with a $200 a month less payment which was still more than what I told them I could do. It was disrespectful like I could not use a calcualtor. Is the ultimate example of shifty BS car salesman. Horrible time wasting experience.",1.8
245,"December 15, 2004","Definitely low-ball you on your trade-in.  Way lower than any KBB or NADA even though the trade-in was a 2002 with only 25k on it.  They sold it 1 week later for 4K over what they paid us.  Came back to us with 3 offers for monthly payments.  Left after the 2nd then they called back and came back down.  Then....sneaked in a 3 year red carpet instead of the 5 year purchase.  By that time I was exhausted with wife and 11 year old at the dealer.  These guys are social parasites.  I'd put them 1 rung above lawyers.  Vehicle I could have paid 24K for cost me 34K.  Had to bring vehicle back twice because of repair promises not taken care of.  I love the vehicle but will never buy from Central Ford ever again...and neither will any of my friends, co workers or associates.             These guys throw minutae at you fast and do the bate and slip.  Beware of anyone from Central Ford Sales.   ANd no - I am not a disgruntled ex-worker.  Just a very dissatisfied patron soon to be ex.",2.3
