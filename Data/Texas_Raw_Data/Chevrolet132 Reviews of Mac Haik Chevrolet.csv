1,"April 18, 2020","Mac Haik represents the true definition of ""American Greed""!

I have been a Corvette enthusiast and owner since I was 19 years old. Over the last 45 years I have owned 8 Corvettes. I am currently driving my 2016 Z06, which is a fantastic car, but when I saw the 2020 and the price that GM announced they were going to sell this world class sports car for, I was excited.

On January 27,2020 I decided to pull the trigger. I was referred to Mac Haik and contacted them the same day. I provided my contact information and ask that they contact me upon availability of the new C8.

On April the 2nd, in the midst of the pandemic, I reached out to them again asking if a 2020 Corvette became available to please contact me, just assuming that someone sadly, may not be able to take delivery of a current order.

On April 4th, I received a text that one had become available. I immediately ask what I needed to do?

The next text I received, was disappointing to say the least: ""$10,000 above list bro""

I responded by offering to pay full list, but my offer wasn't accepted. 

In addition to not getting that amazing car, the other most disappointing part was that GM has produced a world class super car that is truly affordable.  They could have also been ""greedy"" and priced it much higher and still sold cars, but they didn't. They priced it where a current Corvette enthusiast could continue to drive the American Dream Car.

It's a shame, that a Mac Haik's greed kept me from having the opportunity to own ""my"" next dream car!

There are GM dealers that don't believe in this practice and when a C8 becomes available, I will own one!",1.0
2,"April 15, 2020",Wonderful customer service at Mac Haik Chevrolet! Everyone is always so friendly here not only when you buy a car but even when you take it to get serviced!,5.0
3,"April 10, 2020","Mac Haik Chevrolet has really blew me away with the way they provide the best customer service! I went in with a price in mind, I would not pass that price and unlike other dealerships they actually worked with me to stay under the price and offer me everything I wanted. They really go the extra mile to please the customers, I loved my new car buying experience!",5.0
4,"April 06, 2020","Just bought my new Silverado here for an amazing price! Mac Haik Chevrolet offers the best pricing you will not find anywhere else. I had gone to various companies before reaching them and really to save anyone time, they really work with you in order to receive the best pricing here!! I was able to be out within no time, very easy, stress free buying!",5.0
5,"March 09, 2020",Mac Haik Chevrolet has the greatest team! From buying your car to getting it serviced they do not disappoint. Just how they treated me when buying the car is the same way I was treated when going in for a service. They provide professional friendly customer service!,5.0
6,"March 03, 2020","If you are looking to buy a car you need to go with Moe at Mac Haik Chevrolet! He is sure to provide you with a great price and the most nicest service. I really liked the way he was able to consider my budget and work with it he did not try to up sell me into getting out of my price limit. He gave me everything I was looking for in the price I was looking for, I couldn't be happier with my new Camaro!",5.0
7,"February 27, 2020","Tracey in the parts department is the best employee Mac Haik Chevrolet has! He is always so helpful and provides the best customer service, whenever I am having any issue he is the guy I go to because I know how he will provide me with honest work. I have really grown to relay on him for anything that messes up in my car, he makes Mac Haik Chevrolet the best!",5.0
8,"February 23, 2020","There's a good reason there are so many 5 star ratings for this dealership.
Anthony was extremely professional and worked hard with us to get us the best deal on my Equinox, without being pushy or impatient on the sale. Josh was very welcoming and informative about not only the car buying process but the industry as a whole. Overall it was a true pleasure to work with Mac Haik and I will definitely be referring all my friends to this dealership. ",5.0
9,"August 02, 2019","If I could give them 0 stars, I would.

Very disappointed in the customer service and our purchase of a 2013 suburban. After they had our vehicle for 5 days to do the verbally agreed upon repairs to the interior, and a complete detail as if the vehicle was to go out to be sold, we arrived to pick up the car and not only was it filthy but half the agreed upon repairs were not completed. Unable to leave it, due to prior commitments, and the sales man and manager we dealt with were not present, we then had to deal with a second manager. I called and set up an appointment to return today. I arrived early and dropped off the vehicle (mind you of 11 days, we’ve had the car a total of 5, the rest they’ve now had it), and I mentioned a couple issues that arose while we had it. Minor (broken sun visors, and the drivers side handle broke on day 2 of having the car and needed to be glued back together if not replaced) but I asked if, due to the hassle of having to return a second time, after they had it for 5 days already and didn’t complete their end of the bargain, if they would handle those 2 small issues as a courtesy to us for all the inconvenience of not completing the agreed upon issues. The manager then told me that if I had issues after purchase, it was not his responsibility to fix them. I informed him that yes I understand that, however if his company had kept their end of the bargain and done what they were supposed to the first time, we wouldn’t be having this conversation and I wouldn’t be asking him to address these issues. He said he would see what he could do. We received a text, not even a phone call, around 5 pm today letting us know it was ready for pick up. Upon arrival, there was still dog hair and dirt and trash in the car, a few blatant issues I pointed out (oil on the side of the cargo area, blue marks on the inside of the hatch) were taken care of, but the filthy handles, dirt, dog hair, coffee stains down one side, greasy finger prints on arms rests, and the list goes on, was not done. Nor were the additional issues I asked to be addressed as a courtesy as we had to return. I was informed the manager had gone over the car with a fine toothed comb and then I was told “well this is a used car, everything isn’t going to be perfect” as if that was supposed to fly for them half-assing what they had committed to doing. Apparently to the Mac Haik staff, a used car is a trashed car and that should be acceptable. We are sorely disappointed in the subpar customer service and will never return. Find somewhere else who will actually hold up what they commit to, and take pride in their products, new or used.

One of their managers commented on my review elsewhere, asking for more information so he could remedy this. After emailing on July 21 (today is August 2), I have yet to receive a response. It seems they stand with their subpar service, and do not want to remedy this.

10,"July 09, 2019","Regardless if you buy a vehicle from them, they treat you like you have. Always treat you with respect and as if you are their top priority. Always keep you advised of status with timely updates. Not the type of service center to find ""upcharges"". They know their customer service and treat everyone as if they were family.",5.0

12,"April 09, 2019","Went in just looking to see what options I had, and Hector Acosta showed us all sorts of cars until we found the perfect one! He was super patient and helped me get financed on my first auto loan. Don't want to leave Mr. Wayne (used car manager) out, he worked to get us the best financing possible and made this all possible. Thank you both! SHOUT OUT to Hector Acosta his number is 281-467-9924, hope you sell lots of cars :)",5.0
13,"March 31, 2019",Ruhail and Brian worked provided great service. Process is a little slower than I would want but overall great experience. Internet inquiry process did not work I didnt get any calls after sending internet inquiry. I called dealership directly.,4.8
14,"November 14, 2018","My sales rep was Justin Watson, He messaged me when I was shopping online and he had no problem going and putting his “ hands on” the vehicle I found online. He had it up front when I arrived and made the process quick and easy!! Gaston was very thorough in his paperwork and even found me some more money off!! I would highly recommend this dealership and they have my business. ",5.0
15,"September 17, 2018",Ask for Stephen Rients. He is very friendly/helpful. Went above and beyond to help me find the perfect car for me. He was very patient and answered all my questions. It was definitely a great car buying experience. ,5.0
16,"December 15, 2017","We came in after our Internet search for a used car lead to McHaik Chevy. Met Max Dao and he was very nice and pleasant. He showed us the car, advised us on the features of the car and also showed us other cars in our price range so we know our options. We ended up with another car that had less mileage, leather seats, and a lot of nicer features for just a bit more. The sale was quick, no pressure, no back and forth with the “manager” and we didn’t waste a whole day there. Thank you Max Dao and the McHaik Chevy Used Car team!",5.0
17,"December 15, 2017",Ask for Chris A.  He is friendly and always willing to assist.  My service was fast and reasonable price.  Thanks service staff.  Happy Holidays. Denise Singleton ,5.0
18,"December 05, 2017",AJ was great. He was very professional and had me in my new vehicle and out the door very quickly. I will recommend Mac Haik to my family and friends. ,5.0
19,"December 01, 2017","Mark Bayoneto and Shawn Cranford are amazing!  Mark never gave up on me until I was fully satisfied with the deal.  It's because of him I decided to purchase again.  Shawn ensured top notch financial transaction.  He quickly and promptly followed up with with questions and concerns after the purchase.  He was the lynch pin for me in coordinating with other staff members, he never let up but pressed hard in spite of new customers he dealt with daily.  Both are highly professional, they put the customer first!!  Mac Haik should use them to train other staff members on customer service ideals.  Their customer service ideals are impeccable!  Strongly recommend Mac Haik's leadership provide special recognition to both of them.  RPP",5.0
20,"November 22, 2017",I was pleasantly surprised at the no pressure experience at your dealership.  The price was fair and competitive on the vehicle that I wanted.  Everyone was courteous and went out of their way to treat me like a customer.  My sales person Thomas Pina took care of business quickly and professionally.  I own a business and know what good customer service should be.  Very pleased with the experience at Mac Haik Chevrolet.,5.0
21,"November 19, 2017",Victor Cruz did a great job taking care of us. He listened to our requests and did the best he could making sure we left happy. ,5.0
22,"November 15, 2017","I bought a Corvette Stingray from Mac Haik and it was delivered to me with 1/8 of a tank of gas, non-functional washer system (also completely out of fluid) and a cracked fuel pump. It promptly cracked the windshield once it was parked in the sun. I contacted my salesman who was rude and dismissive of my concerns . Car was towed back to dealer for repairs after ONE day. It was returned to me and was dirty interior- stain on seat and had a service warning about the theft sensor. After further run around an d another service week, I took my car to Frede Chevrolet who fixed every issue and cared about my experience. I spoke to the GM of Haik, who informed me that no one ever wins Lemon Lawsuits and that I shouldn't even try. If I have another issue, I will have to sue. Nice to spend $75,000 and get crappy service. The GM did offer to pay one car payment in reference to my terrible experience. ",1.6
23,"November 11, 2017","Tony, our service rep, is always willing to help and tries to get us serviced as quickly as possible. Dropping off and picking up the car is hassle free.",5.0

25,"October 31, 2017","Wow is the word that expresses my recent experience.  I hadn't been to the Quick Service Dept in years- the remodeling was also quite pleasant. The customer service, expertise, professionalism of the staff that I had contact with was outstanding.  The low point was the long wait (1 1/2 hrs from 7:30 am to 9 am) for oil change and car wash.  My past experience with this dept was when they had the 30 minute service for the same work.  It is a disconnect for me that the wait time is so long and would deter me from returning unless I made prior arrangements to adapt to the wait.  ",5.0
26,"October 25, 2017","Mickeal Henry made my experience very easy with no hassles. It was a pleasure working with him as he is very knowledgeable about the vehicles that were shown. He was very patient and took into consideration the amenities of the vehicle I was looking for which in return made my final decision a breeze. Finally, a salesman that LISTENS!! Will definitely recommend to others.  ",5.0

29,"August 24, 2017","My wife and I purchased a 2017 Chevy Colorado last week. The process relly began weeks before. Looking on AutoTrader every couple of days to compare different types of mid-size trucks, dfferent trims, different price ranges. MacHaik was always near the top of our searches. I decided to inquire about a listing with MacHaik, and Paul Dodd responded quickly. He took time to explain everything clearly. Without him, I dont think a transaction would've happened. Because we were so well prepared, we were in and out after out 2.5 hours. Quick and easy, unlike the over 5 hours we spent on my wife's Nissan Rogue from Tom Pecock last year. Love my Colorado, and will keep MacHaik in mind for future purchases!",5.0

42,"May 18, 2017","I emailed about a BMW they had for sale and was messaged by the ""online sales manager"". His message was filled with grammatical errors and spelling issues. I may be old fashioned but if you are emailing a customer, make sure everything is at least spelled right! I explained that a BMW across the street had 20k less miles and was 4k cheaper. It took 5 emails for him to understand what I was saying. He sent rude snarky emails that left a less than desirable taste in my mouth. I would never use this dealership for any of my car needs!",1.0
43,"May 02, 2017","Horrible!! Please do not go here. We were in the process of purchasing a SUV, and they sold it out from under us regardless that we were there first. Very poor customer service. We will never go back there. This would have been the second vehicle we would have purchased there. I would highly advise to take your business else where.",1.0
44,"May 02, 2017",0 star rating is to high. Carmine was my salesperson. True definition of a shiesty car salesman. Calls everyday prior to purchase. Want answer your calls afterwards. Makes promises and doesn't deliver. Just plain horrible customer service. Steer clear of this place.,1.0
45,"April 19, 2017","This dealership is full of shady practices including putting a good deal up and leaving it after it ""sells"". Who knows if there even is a car for sale. They just want your number and want you to come in. I found a 4runner on Sunday and called Monday. They said it was sold Saturday which I thought was weird because I was looking pretty much every day. Then I saw the same listing on ebay motors which I placed a bid on. Lo and behold a salesman calls me and told me it was sold yesterday (Monday). Terrible practice. Terrible dealership.",1.0
46,"March 22, 2017","I am rating this dealership and staff 1 star only because it does not give me the option of rating any lower.  I was referred to Mark Bayoneto because I was in the market for a new Silverado 1500.  Through text, Mark painted a great deal which made me drive out to Mac Haik all the way from Pearland. When I visited the same weekend, the old ""bait and switch"" was pulled and was steered to a more expensive truck.  When I inquired of the vehicle that he initially had offered me first he stated that the price included a 2K off coupon that was only good the day we texted and upon further inquiry about the truck he stated it had been sold.  Come to find out that same day from his own system and confirmed 2 days later by his supervisor that the specific truck was still available.  Mark's attitude was very arrogant even stating ""it's the 18th day of the month and I've already sold 20 trucks so I know what I'm doing"".  He behaved like your stereotypical slime ball used car salesmen.",1.0

49,"December 02, 2016","Went in to buy an advertised 2013 Camero for $18K. Promised Service contract and 3 day return if not happy. Brought $5K down payment. By the time I was done with the Finance guy, the price had risen to $19K, the Service Contract cost me $2500 and when I took it home, I got an email 2 days later and salesman said it was an exchange, not a return. Went right to the GM and still got no help. These guys would cheat their mothers. All they wanted to do was hustle me out with an overpriced car and no recourse if unsatisfied. I'm scared to go in there for my 2 ""free"" oil change/tire rotations lest they screw me again. Stay away fro this dealership. They'll xxxx you. ",1.2

51,"August 23, 2016","My mother was just in last week to have her car serviced at Mac Haik Chevrolet on Katy Frwy.  She wanted an oil change. When her car was ready, she was charged $289. Apparently they slipped in a fuel system cleaning, tire rotation and balancing. After she left with her car, she got an error code that relates to her tire pressure sensors not working, I guess due to the fact that they rotated her tires.  Seems to me shop is slamming her for unauthorized work and creating other problems in the process.",1.0

53,"March 11, 2016","Worst dealership I have ever come across. Made the biggest mistake of my life by choosing this dealership. The service department is the worst. When they don't know how to do their job, they just hang up. They run and try to avoid problems. Every time my car has been in, it came back with more problems. I had to tow my car twice because of the poor job they did. Just please be careful!!!! ",1.0

55,"December 06, 2015",I was given a price on a brand new impala via text from a sales rep. Telling me that they could match and beat another dealerships price/deal. So of course wanting to save the money I went to them. When I got there after speaking with the sales rep about the price we spoke about on a new car. He then told me oh well for that price it would be on a demo car and could have up to 3000 miles on it.  So still thinking it's still a good deal I test drive and do paperwork.. as soon as I sat down  they switched my salesman to a younger lady. I think for persuasive means. Then another totally new guy comes and tells me that everything went thru but they weren't accepting my trade in but it's ok and I should default on the loan because GM's got my back. xxx?? Is this what you tell people? Default on your loan and take this one. Then to top it off they didn't even give me the price that me and the 1st sales rep. Agreed on in fact it was no where close 7 thousand more than the agreed price. With a high APR and monthly note... This was kinda sad to see how they were so eager to push such bad advice that could potentially ruin ones credit score and files and then push them out the door with such a bad deal especially around this time of year.. smh Don't shop here!!!!! I'm positive  by how this playd out. This happens to most customers who come here. Everybody I dealt with I felt was out to get me.. and I honestly just had a really awful  visit here. ,1.0

57,"July 09, 2015","THIS IS, BY FAR, THE WORST DEALERSHIP I HAVE EVER BEEN TO.

THE DEALERSHIP SAID THEY WOULD FIX THE VEHICLE BECAUSE I OWNED IT FOR LESS THAN 24 HRS AND IT WAS DUE TO THEIR NEGLECT, BUT WHEN THEY FOUND OUT IT WOULD COST $1,100.00 TO REPAIR, THEY REFUSED TO HONOR THEIR WORD AND WOULD NOT REPAIR MY VEHICLE. THEY TOLD ME THEY WOULD TAKE IT BACK OR I COULD HAVE IT ""AS IS"", BUT THEY WOULDN'T PAY FOR REPAIRS. THE MAC HAIK NAME IS NOT SOMETHING TO STAND BEHIND.

113,"March 11, 2015","Do enough research and you will see plenty of bad reviews on this place.  Do not go here! I went there to buy a car for my wife and after test driving it I gathered an OTD price on the vehicle and told him I'd let him know this afternoon.  An hour later I called the salesman back and WE AGREED on a new price for a 2014 black cruz LTZ.  I told him i would be glad to put down a deposit but he insisted I come back in with a check for the full amount.  (place was an hour away) When I got there, he sat me down with ""the keys"" on the table and we together spent at least an hour and half doing paperwork, taking a tour of the dealership ect. only for him to come up to me and say, ""hey the black one you wanted sold hours ago but I have the white one that was next to it, you want that?"" I said no, we agreed on the black one that we've been discussing all afternoon.  His response was ""its just a color I can do it for the same price"".  He then proceeded to fill my head with excuses and NO SOLUTIONS.  The sales person name was MELVIN JONES.  I put my trust into this person and he wasted my whole day.  Earlier when we were in his office he told me I could take the new car home that evening, after which I sent my wife a picture congratulating her on her new vehicle.  She was so excited. 20 min later i had to tell her the bad news.  Please don't do business with these people.  They care about you when you walk in with full pockets but if a problem arises NOBODY lifts a finger for you. I talked to the sales manager (Travis?) and he said he was taking notes and would call me right back but I still have not got a response.  I even talked to 3 different people asking for contact information for the general manager and nobody would give me anything.  This is unacceptable and wrong, this company clearly does not really care about there customers.  If that was not true, the end result of all this would have been different.. This is my first bad review I have ever written for anybody,  I just want to make sure nobody makes the same mistake i did by using this dealership.  Go elsewhere, why risk it?      -JOHN U.",1.0
114,"September 30, 2014","I called Mac Haik Chevy for service on my GM vehicle at the end of April to have the much-publicized ignition switch recall taken care of. I was told that they didn't have the parts in but would receive a phone call in approximately 2 weeks to schedule service. One month later I hadn't heard anything so I called to inquire about the parts. They still did not have them in.  Another month passed and I called again and left a message with the service technician with whom I had been dealing. No return phone call.  I called again three months later (five months after my initial request for service) to inquire about an unrelated service need and while I was on the phone, I asked if they had the replacement parts in for the recall. I was told they did. I was shocked and asked why I hadn't received a phone call to schedule the service. This technician told me they didn't assign the parts to anyone, that if had to call to schedule the service.  I explained that I did and that I was very upset that I had been driving the vehicle for 5 months with a supposedly defective part. He had the nerve to tell me that I had been driving the car for 5 years with no issues so I was probably fine. I was so angry, I got off the phone as quickly as I could so I didn't start screaming at him.  When I calmed down, I called the service manager and when I explained the situation, though he was apologetic, I was basically told that he would talk to his employees about ""using their words more carefully.""  Are you joking?  I will NEVER go to Mac Haik for anything ever again and recommend you do the same.",1.0

116,"July 30, 2014","I wish someone sold a time machine, because I would buy it.  I would go back a month ago, because that is when I started my relationship with Mac Haik and it has been brutal.  I went in and ended up purchasing two cars.  Both my husband and I were looking so why not just get it done all at one time.  I am sure our sales person loved it.  We ended up purchasing a 2013 Nissan Sentra and a 2013 CERTIFIED PREOWNED Buick Regal.  We loved our cars, but just like any used car there were a few issues that needed to be fixed.  Both cars are under warranty, so not really a big deal, and we were promised they were easy fixes.  We took the Buick in to get the passive key button on the driver’s door fixed, some weather stripping, and a rip in the driver's seat.  They asked us to bring it back on Tuesday because they have to get the parts needed.  The car was dropped off Tuesday morning.  They then kept my car for a week, and didn't have the consideration to call for status updates.  Finally a week later, I called and they said my car was ready but they had to order something else for the seat.  It will take a while, because they have so many recalls to worry about.  I don't really seem that this should make me wait, but that’s ok.  We got our car back, and the entire back of the seat is torn apart.  They didn't even try to make it look nice. I would have rather had a little hole that wasn’t as noticeable.  A week and a half later, July 16, I called inquiring about my seat.  They told me the seat is in, and I can bring it in.  Again, no consideration on their end to call me to let me know it was in.  My husband took the car in, and he was told it would take 30 minutes to an hour for them to put it in the new seat.  He sat for over 3.5 hours and when they finally finished, they had put a scratch on the center consol.  Oh accidents happen, they said they would order me a new one.  Again, I waited 2 weeks.  Yesterday, July 29, I called inquiring about my center console. Oh to my surprise, the center console is in.  Now for the 3rd time they had no consideration to call me.  Today, I took the Buick in to get the center console replaced.  I made sure I got a loaner car, so I did not have to waste another day.  I picked up the car this evening, and now it looks like they backed into something.  When examining the vehicle, I noticed the bumper's license plate was bent.  Being new cars, the license plate is only a week a half old.  I looked closer and there is a crack in the bumper and the exhaust is bent.  I called up to the service department and asked them what they hit.  I informed them that the license plate is bent, there is a crack on the bumper and the exhaust is bent.  He then told me all that was already there.  I bought this car as a CERTIFIED PREOWNED.  It went over a rigorous inspection. This would not have passed Buick's inspection.  I know I have not hit anything, and we park at the back of parking lots so we don't get dinged.  I trusted them with my car and I am lying?  Now, I have a new car with a cracked bumper and bent exhaust.  
I would recommend you not use Mac Haik for your service needs unless you want a reason to purchase a new car or make a claim on your insurance.

I was offer the camaro and told that the best they could do for me was xx,xxx and after being very firm with them about my prices I gave a little and decided to take the deal ""or so called deal""  later that evening I looked up the car online and discovered the suckered me into the listed price, not a discounted or haggled price the flat price on the listing (yes I agree this was my fault for not doing more research but after 4 hours, credit and deal was done before I drove there I was tired and hungry)  they washed the car while I signed my paperwork and when the car was brought to me I did a walk around and saw a few scuffs and door dents that I demanded be fixed and was told that they would most definitely be taken care of.

I emailed the salesmen on Monday and inquired about the body shop and scheduling the repairs as well as a concern that the AC did not appear to get cold and here we are now Thursday, and 3 emails later I'm not getting a response.

122,"October 28, 2013","Mac Haik as a dealership is being rated based solely on my experience with Kelly Ford. I will say I visited in person one of their locations when in Houston the month prior looking at used vehicles and was sorely disappointed with the interior condition and the listed price. I'm confident I wouldn't have purchased used from them. 

After searching through and dealing with no less than 40 dealerships, I decided on new. I found a large selection of new inventory. I also loved their ""drive out"" pricing. Sure the website list a low price with an asterisk ** that clearly says not all buyers will qualify for that price. However unlike many places, the incentives figured in for the low price, ALL apply to that vehicle. No I didn't qualify for all of the incentives on my purchase. But they let me haggle. =) Even better is they weren't rude, they took me seriously and did I mention, I was buying via a phone call out of state, haggling by email and yes they gave me a fair ""drive off"" price that was made better when it was added to a shipping cost. I got the best ""drive off and delivered to my door"" price. 

Again, all the credit goes to Kelly Ford who didn't demand I sit in her office to work a deal, was willing to negotiate and made my new car purchase beyond smooth. I'd buy from her again and hope she is always employed by a Chevrolet dealership. I suggest Mac Haik retain her as she is everything you want in a sales agent, supersedes the grimy salesmen(which do exist)  and levels above the good competition.  Oct 2013.",5.0

My intitial color was not availble at the dealership, but he and the sales manager asked me how I would feel about Ashen Gray Metallic.  After seeing a ZL1 in the showroom, I fell in love with the color.  I was supposed to pick the car up on Monday and I got a call when I was on the way to the dealership.  Tanny told me they were super busy and unable to get the car that day.  I would have to come back on Tuesday.  So I come back on Tuesday and lo and behold the car isnt the color I purchased.  Tanny told me there wasnt another AGM Camaro within 1000 miles and since black was my original choice they got that one for me.  I later found out there was another AGM in San Antonio.  When I asked them for some kind of compensation, they basically told me to take it or leave it.  I took it, but only because i believed there wasnt another Camaro in the color I wanted within 1000 miles and I really wanted a Camaro (more importantly i didnt want my old clunker back.)

The salesman I set an appointment with (dealership confirmed on the morning of the appointment) was on ""vacation"" when I arrived for my appointment. The specific vehicle I was interested in, and had verified with the dealership the day of the appointment, was not there and they didn't seem concerned at all that a $55k vehicle was missing. I even called the sales department from the parking lot of the dealership and they again assured me the specific vehicle stock number I was looking for was there. The whole thing was a bait and switch. Chevy needs to roll all of the cars off of this lot and bring in tanker trucks of SNAKE OIL, that's the only thing Mac Haik is interested in selling. I bought a new Tahoe LTZ the next day from a dealer with integrity, Classic Chevy in Sugarland. I only gave Mac Haik one star because It wont let me give them zero.",1.0
130,"April 28, 2011",I was in the market for a new truck so I stopped by the dealership and talked with a salesman.  He took my car to the used car department to get a trade amount and when he returned he offered me $4000 less than I ended up getting at another dealer.  Told me there was no way he could make a deal happen if I didnt put down atleast $5000.  He didnt ask me to come inside and never showed me a vehicle.  I went to a different dealership and got $4000 more for the trade and was able to purchase a vehicle with no money down.  Clearly Mac Haik didnt want my business so I took it elsewhere.,2.3
131,"December 14, 2010","Vety happy with my overall experience with Mac Haik Chevrolet. From the minute I walked in the door, any anxiety I had prior to meeting with them was completely gone. Absolutely no pressure and made me believe that not all dealers are the same. Really happy that I decided to buy my car from them.",5.0
