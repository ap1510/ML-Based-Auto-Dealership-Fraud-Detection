I would not recommend any one to that dealer.",1.6
1,"May 31, 2018",This dealership is beyond sorry words can not explain. I was originally sold the car I choose to be called in a week later for them try and put me in a smaller car they picked out. After signing all the paperwork and driving the car for at least almost 2 months I get a call from Mike the supposed to be sales manager who is a total liar. This guy told me he reworked my deal to get me a better one and if I could bring the car by it was total xxxxxxxx.I get there and they block my car in and literally left me and my family on foot. We had to call a ride. Finance manager Miguel is even worse tried to lie and give me a story when it was them who pulled my deal from the bank. This place is full of crooks and liars and does not know how to treat people or do business. I would not recommend this dealership to anyone. Stay Away!,1.0

4,"March 31, 2018","Went in trying to get a used car, and got turned down. But Rey and his team went to the bank and fought to get us approved on a new car. We never thought we would be approved with our bad credit situation. Well, we walked out with a 2018 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport, only 5 miles on it. Needless to say, we are very happy and I would tell anyone looking for a car to go here, even if you have repos, or bad credit like we did. I cannot recommend them enough. Rey was a younger guy and honestly didn't think he would be much help, but he took the time to explain everything to us, and like I said, we are the proud owners of a 2018 SUV .These guys are amazing!!!",4.8
