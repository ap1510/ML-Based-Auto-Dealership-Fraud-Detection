1,"January 06, 2018","I had been wanting/needing a truck to haul feed, hay, and other supplies/tack in, as I was driving around in a small car, and basically my vehicle didn't fit my lifestyle. I wasn't planning on purchasing anything this weekend, but we decided to just see what was available, and found a truck that was a perfect fit and within our budget. Mr. Gage was wonderful to work with and the whole process went incredibly smooth. I feel like we got a really great deal on a nice truck and I couldn't be happier. Thank ya'll for a wonderful buying experience!!",4.8
2,"January 03, 2018","This is the second vehicle that I have bought from Randall DCJ. My first Jeep was bought in 2012, and had thoroughly enjoyed it.  I was in need of an upgrade, so I opted to go back to Randall for the Grand Cherokee. I am quite sure I will enjoy driving my new Jeep as much as I did my first one. Knowing that I can rely on Randall to provide good service when I need it.",4.7
3,"December 19, 2017","Stopped in to look for wife's Christmas Present..Chris Pratt came out and noticed my son's baseball cap and we talked about baseball/softball for about 15 minutes.  Asked what I was interested in and what I was looking to spend.. introduced me to Rudy Salaiz (another great guy)..took my info and informed him I had some errands to run just call when he heard something.  20 min later Chris called and said it's done u can come pick her up.  Best experience to date.. no pressure, did not try to keep me there till paperwork was done..no hassle.  Great group to work with..will definitely be back..if u need a new ride I would definitely recommend this group!!  Just be ready..not a lot of car talk..which for me was the deal maker.. Thanks Chris and good luck with your son's baseball!  ",5.0
4,"December 18, 2017",Overall good experience. Pretty quick and simple. Truck was clean externally visible to eye but you can tell alot was missed on under carriage. For a 2015 pretty dirty underneath. Sales guy was helpful and courteous. I dont like that trade is taken off back end of deal where taxes are assessed on final price Not consumer friendly. Had I seen first I would have told finance guy to adjust. ,4.0
