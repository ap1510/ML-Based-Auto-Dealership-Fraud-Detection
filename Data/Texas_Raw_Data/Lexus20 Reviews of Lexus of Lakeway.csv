15,"November 04, 2019","Took my car for state inspection and some warranty work(burning smell from the engine area, transmission jerks and whining/buzzing noise from the dash/HUD area) and both Steve Witt/Chase immediately offered to help even though I didnt have an appointment with them. All of my issues were resolved except the whining/buzzing sound from the dash area which I still hear sometimes and will have to bring it back to take another look at it sometime in the future. Both Steve and Chase are extremely professional and courteous folks and I would highly recommend them for any service related issues. Keep up the great work...",5.0

18,"October 14, 2019","I drove from houston and bought the 2016 lexus lx 570 from this dealer last week. Totally disappointed. The problem was i deal to buy and trade in over the phone and email. I was honest on my car but they DIDNOT. When I arrived, they just asked me to sign off some car fax paperwork over the waiting area counter top and let me waited to come financial departments(DIDNOT SHOW THE CAR)‚Äù. After that, i have to work with training finance people. He had to run for help 2 times. When everything done over finance, they just rush to give me the key without showing anything features and leave me by myself. It about time for dealer to close so I trusted the salesperson so i still gave her the thanks card and cash for all the things she did. On the way back to houston, the rain come so i have to use the windshield wipers and 1 of the blade blew off. It not all, when i got home my wife so excited and checked around vehicle found the scratches on the running board with bad tough up paint. I email the salesperson with the picture right away. She DIDNOT responsed. Even next day morning i have to call her and she just said that when the vehicle leave the lot, dealer will not responsible for any of that. WHAT THE SERVCE???? So i have to contact general manager, she would send me a new wiper blades. About the scratches, she told me to bring the car back to dealer and wait for them so they buff it out ONLY when i ask if there is a complementary vehicle. What the decisions is that???? The 65k suv deserves that services???? I even check with the local body shop for estimates and offer she pay haft of the total price of $650. She did not. All i did is to make my wife feel happy because i even gave the salesperson $200 why did i have to bargain for $325???? They did not honest on the vehicle and very very bad customer service for the whole team. Please watchout when you shop at this dealer ",1.4
19,"June 21, 2017","To put it easily, this place rules. Every member here from the baristas to the service men and women are such a delight to talk to and work with. Complimentary coffee and other baked goods. Amazing waiting room. When dealing with the folks at the service department getting a car wash, it was a breeze and they remembered me from the second time coming back. Overall, incredible place. ",5.0
