Somebody keeps deleting my review. Hmm can’t imagine why!  

A mess!! I bought a car from AutoNation. My mistake was not getting a warranty on it but I had bought the last four cars from them so I was confident that I would get another good vehicle. It definitely looked the part. Had electrical issues when I bought it and Melvin was aware of it and I told Tim when I signed the paperwork he said that Melvin would be taken care of that for me. Was never done. Before I bought it they had it twice trying to figure out what was wrong with the electrical but I don’t think anyone even bothered looking at it. They never once had an answer but they did assure me it would be taken care of. Never was. Also about a month and a half later still didn’t have my plates. Had to keep calling and finally they told me it was never inspected and I had to drive all the way back up to do that and I honestly don’t think they even looked at this car before they sold it to me. Anyways. Long story short. I am the typical single mom that had to get my past vehicles at the “tote the note” lots and this mess is exactly the type of problems that you get from those kind of lots. I was so excited to finally not have to deal with those types of vehicles. A nice reliable dealership that would not sell those kinds of vehicles. Not sure if it was because of my status as a single mother or that I was just a woman that could be suckered because that’s what I was used to for so long with that type of vehicle. Anyways. The rocker on driver side is out cam shaft has to be replaced transmission has to be serviced or something and it keeps jumping into 1 gear and no one can figure out what’s going on with the electrical. They however were very nice about going and picking up my vehicle after I told them what was going on and towed it to their facility but also sent it to meader Chrysler to be Evaluated  but no one returns calls!!!! If meader hadn’t text me I would still not know where the heck my car is!!  When I finally got someone to take my call they told me I needed to chill out!  Went to see what they would give me to trade since couldn’t get anyone to take my calls and they wanted to give me significantly less. I’m not saying they owe me a new vehicle or get anything for free but if I can’t rely on a good car and that they look them over before I buy them. Why would I want to buy one from them. I bet there is no paperwork on this car where they looked it over mechanic wise anyways. But no responses or returned calls?!?!  I don’t know if I would feel comfortable buying another vehicle from this place at this point.

And they have had it going on two weeks and still nothing. I finally  just told meader Chrysler to fix it and I’ll just have to eat my 6k I put down and will never ever buy another car from these crooks.  I’m not even bothering with AutoNation anymore. I am however going to report to the consumer disputes.",1.0
1,"September 09, 2019","Took our vehicle to this location to have some recall work done on the vehicle. Apparently the door latches fail creating a potential for the door to come open at speeds, and the fuel tank has a tendency to loose ventilation causing it to implode on itself. Only place you can get this service completed at is the stealership. They took it upon themselves, without first securing my permission, to complete some sort of “inspection” on the vehicle in an attempt to upsell other services that they allege needed to be completed. Next thing I know, the car is 2 liters low on coolant and starts to overheat!! I contacted their customer relations person, and of course she made a few remarks insinuating that it wasn’t anything they did. Must have been the coolant fairy that came and drained a whole two liters off!!! They offered to have the car towed to their shop to “take another look at it”. Do you seriously believe I would relinquish control of my car to you a second time when you couldn’t get it right the first time and potentially caused irreparable damage? If my car were a woman, you’d be in pretty deep dog doo-doo for touching her in places without her consent. Just saying. Trust has been lost, I will never return to this place. ",1.0
2,"September 07, 2019","Run!  They lie, evade and deceive!  Robert Young was a horrible sales person who was lazy and full of lies and evasion!  Tom Bandola in finance will sneak in backend products without you knowing, if you make the mistake of trusting them.  Signatures from blank ipad show up on documents you never saw.  Finance director, Mike kept the lies going.  I don't know how these people sleep at night!  Gave them the chance to make it right, they didn't, so we will deal with corporate, trade commission and consumer protection.  Waiting on cancellation documents to get rid of vehicle protection package that I never approved.  I wonder how long that email will take.  I've never been so disgusted by anyone in my life until these people at Autonation.",1.0

After buying a different truck at another dealer (excellent experience) took my vehicle in for service - was quoted nearly a thousand dollars for work that I later had completed elsewhere for $170. ",1.0
5,"October 26, 2017",I started off buying a Ford Edge  from ford auto nation and the experience was great. Kaci made everything fast and speedy and we were out in no time. A few months later I got a flat tire and sent it to their service department where I worked with Randy and director Brandon. They did everything in the power to make me a happy coustomer and I was greatly appreciative to have bought a car from such an amazing company and group of employees!! ,5.0
6,"September 25, 2017","I am one of the unfortunate owners of a 2011 Ford Fiesta. After the first year of ownership as the clutch  system built into the shifting mechanism of the automatic transmission started giving me problems I took it in for service. Was treated like they had no idea what I was talking about and they would check the car out, adjust the clutch and say nothing really was wrong. Over a course of 1.5 years this went on almost every 90 days until they finally admitted there was a recall on the clutch system but it has to go totally out before they can replace it, and there are so many there is usually a 6 month wait but the car would still be drivable. Finally this was replaced. Now the car is six years old and air conditioning system is problematic. I take in for service and the young girl Ann had to be interrupted from the man (employee) sitting in her booth so I could get help. She was rude and could of cared less about helping me. The quote given to me 3 days later was for almost 4 times more than it should have been. I told them not to fix it and I would be in to get the car. When I arrived the woman taking payments had me fill out a 4 question rating. I asked her if this was for when I first took the car in or for now? She said oh for when you brought the car in to us. I answered all (4) as poor. And yes I was charged $100 just to be told my cooling fan was out. Back to the woman taking my payment. She hands me keys to a car and I told her they were not my keys. She said yes they are, I said well not unless you put them on a new key fob because this is not the key I brought in. She says well I think they are. I said ok well could you point me to the car they will start because if it is better than the piece of junk I am driving now I will be happy to take it. She then says just a minute. About 3 minutes late she comes back with my key and says here. I said ok could you point me in the direction of my car. She says it is outside behind that wall. I go outside walk up one side of the service lot and down the other and no car. I go back in and said you are going to have to come point my car out as it is not out there. She is obviously put out by having to come outside and as she steps outside and a man is walking by, she says his name and tells him to go find this lady's car and walks off. This man literally holds my key fob in the air and begins clicking the button. I do not have an alarm so he is obviously listening for lock click. He literally does this for over 5 minutes and the car winds up in the very back of the service lot behind a gated area, no where near where the woman had me looking. Seriously I will never come to this place for anything. If I am stupid enough to ever buy a ford again it will not be from the Burleson dealership. I will go somewhere that values their customers whether it is sales or service. You have lied to me from the beginning of my experience with you, knowing full well the car was a big problem child and now involved in a huge class action lawsuit. Honesty and kindness would of went a long ways with keeping me as a customer. Where you find your help out and your screening policy of hiring them leaves a lot to be desired.  This customer will not be giving any of their business to you again.",1.0

8,"August 09, 2017","Asked for a specific tire and was shown the exact tire on THEIR screen before purchasing. The tire ended up being the same brand but without the specs I had asked for. When asked why it did not come with the raised white lettering, they informed me that that tire did not come with raised white lettering. I should have made them take them all off but I was in a time crunch.",1.8
9,"July 20, 2017","There are plenty dealerships in the metroplex, but none like Autonation Ford Burleson.  I walked on the lot with ""a deal"" from another dealer , exploring options. I was met by Melvin and after explaining what I was looking for he immediately went to work. Though it took 24 hours with Misty's assistance and both of there diligent efforts,they made it happen. They went above and beyond shat I was looking for, from beginning to end!! Now I have a 2017 Fusion and the payments are less than what the other dealer qouted on the pre-owned vehicle they were proposing. Hurry and go see Melvin and Misty the will make it happen,  no gimmicks,  no lies, no run around!!!!! ",5.0
10,"May 19, 2017","Called earlier in the day to see about a last minute alignment on my f250 which was pulling hard to the left before I left town for the weekend was told there was a 6:00 pm opening , with dis belief , I questioned that late  of an appointment and was assured it was open for that late , showed up at 5:55 , and was told my assigned adviser had left early for the day and they had. No one to do the alignment at 6:00 on a Friday afternoon... I wouldn't have expected it , but they made the appointment , so I didn't look for anyone else..will never take another truck there for service......obviously one hand doesn't have a clue what the other one is doing",1.8
11,"May 03, 2017","When looking for a new truck, I found what I was looking for at AutoNation, Burleson on their website. I called to reserve the truck, and the salesman told me he had it held for me for 48 hrs. When I was preparing to go purchase it the next day, I called, and was told they had traded it to another dealership.
I kept looking and another one just like the first came available so I called the manager and he said he personally put it on hold for me.,
When I got their their finance guy, Guzman, said he had secured financing for me, which I had requested. Then He started the hard sales pitch about buying an extended warranty, which I repeatedly said I didn't want. Then he tells me that he could get me the policy with out increasing my payment..
Magically he reduces the interest rate by a quarter of a percent.
Some where in their advertising they pledge not to manipulat interest rates to sell aftermarket  programs or other items to you. ""THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE DID!'
Fast forward one year and 11,000 miles later.
I noticed bubbles under the window tint on two windows. I contacted service and was eventually told they couldn't warranty the claim because, of all things, they hadn't charged me for the tinting of the windows when I purchased the truck.
The service guy was sincerely nice, but said it was out of his hand, the decision came from a 
""Misty Ivey"". Obviously some xxxxx they put in a managerial position.
I cannot believe that with all the complaints that's on file against AutoNation Ford, Burleson, that FORD allows them to represent the Ford Motor Corporation",1.7
12,"March 26, 2017","First Chris ""accidentally"" sold us a a car with 300 miles on it instead of the one we looked at that had 13 his excuse was ""it's the same car just a different VIN"" well actually it's not because it has 300 miles that your people put on it driving it from Houston. Secondly we were sold the extended warranty which Jonathan repeatedly said ""all you have to worry about is the gas.""  my wife tried several times to call the sales person to claim one of our 2 tanks of gas they offored to make up for selling us the wrong vehicle he never answered his phone and ""never recieved"" her messages he then said ""you should have called my cell phone"" and my wife said I did I still have your card. At that he looked surprised and said ""I never recieved any messages."". Then while getting our plates we told them about the wiper blades that never worked properly and smeared and we were told that wearable items aren't covered under the warranty we purchased. We said that's not what we were told and asked to speak with someone. Jonathan came over in his sweet kind voice and said ""Im sorry about the misunderstanding"" and we told him what he said when he sold us the warranty and he admitted he says that but then he also said it doesn't cover wearable items. Well if it doesn't cover wearable items when we said ""all we have to worry about is putting gas in the car"" he should have told us yes and your wearable items like blah blah and blah not just simply yes. I feel we were mislead and taken advantage of considering this is our first time to purchase a new car.",1.4
13,"December 25, 2016","This place is disgusting. After I had negotiated the price. They hand me some sheets to fill out and after I filled it out I realized the second sheet was for financing. I told them that I do not want their financing I was already pre approved by my bank for financing. I gave them my banker info for them to email it to her. Afterwards, the finance guy comes out the back with paperwork saying he contacted my bank and here's the paperwork. I ask him did he contacted my banker and he said yes. So I  signed the paperwork and went to get my cashiers check for my deposit. That's when my banker informed me that she was not contacted and I would have been signing paperwork with them not the dealership. So I tried calling the finance guy Jason no answer. I called and spoke with Ben the manager and told him what happen which Ben was the one I told from the beginning I had my own financing(the manager). He said Jason will call me back and within 20 seconds he did. I 'm still at the bank at this time on speaker with my banker. I told Jason that he did not contacted my banker. He said you told me you wanted this bank financing and that's what I got you. I told him I handed you and card with my banker info on it and to email her the bill of sale. Jason then told me what's the big deal you wanted this bank financing and thats what you have. I replied that is not the point I gave you instructions as a customer for you to fulfill and you failed to do that and I then canceled the sale. Later Ben (the manager) called and said Jason told me what happened and he wanted to take over the sale and I can just deal with him to fix the issue. I told him no. He then said he would throw  in a bedliner for the truck. I told him I'm not selling my self out for a bedliner I can get cheaper than they was going to do it for. Then Ben called me back about 2 hours later and said he told the GM what happened and they were going to knock off another 750. I doubt he told the GM. If so, he should have called me himself but that tells you about their customer service. I told him I  will call him back tomorrow. Needless to say, I did not call back which they figured that out that the sale was over by then. Very unprofessional place and dishonest. I went to Five Star Ford in North Richland Hills and got a truck for 4K cheaper and a brand new 2106 verses a brand new 2015 they still had on their lot. This place was trying to sell me a brand new 2015 for more than a brand new 2016. F150 platinum by the way. Even though my credit was ran against my will. It was the best mistake they made for me. Thanks to Aaron Dias and Five Star Ford I am in a newer model truck for 4K cheaper. Stay away from this place and they will try to rip you off anyway possible. Their owner or GM haven't even claim their page on dealer reviews. That alone should tell about their pride,honesty, and customer service. But then again I would not claim this place if I was scamming customers of their hard earned money. 0 stars if i could. ",1.0
14,"August 26, 2016",I would like to thank Mr.Cross and Mr.Green. I previously posted our disappointment with this dealership. That has not changed. These 2 fellows have gone out of there way to help. When I picked up our vehicle today Mr.Green was dealing with customers.  They did not look happy. I feel like his hands are tied on many issues. I am overwhelmed by the lack of care put in by the General manager and the sales manager. By the way we still have not heard from Misty. I can't in good faith recommend this dealership. I do however really appreciate the 2 men I mentioned before. ,1.0
15,"July 11, 2016",Was not happy with the way i was spoken to by sales manager after i bought the truck concerning replacing my windshield. They replaced it but did not want to pay for windshield that was made for sensor. He was rude about it.,2.4
16,"April 26, 2016","We recently purchased a truck from Jonathan at Autonation Burleson, and we could not have asked for a better experience! We were shown exactly the vehicles we were looking for, never felt pressured into a vehicle we didn't want or need, and we never felt that dreaded dealer ""run around"". We had our trade in appraised very quickly and received a fair offer. Everyone that we encountered from the sales staff to the financing department was extremely friendly and accommodating. I would highly recommend visiting this dealership! ",5.0
17,"July 29, 2015",After my wife took our Explorer in for a repair. ..One month later..I called the service dept..Landon answered...I ask if the part for our car had come in...He checked and said yes it did...This was the first time they didn't call to let us know a part came in...So I asked Landon..why didn't someone call us? He said he didn't order the part. I expressed how disappointed I was with them again...And told him I thought there customer service was one of the worsed I have come across..Landon told me he knew they were not the best and assured me that there are dealerships worse than them...wow...Maybe that should be on the front window.... or at least a patch on there shirts..I would not buy another car from Autonation.,1.8

19,"May 23, 2015","They have a used 08 ford expodition that was listed at 21,500. After talking to them about financing they said 9.99% interest is an ball park number. Got our bank to give us a 2%. We had a trade in and $18,000 cash. Came to $21,000 total. They wouldn't make a deal over $895 difference after TT&L. Last time I checked it was a sales job and buying a used car negotiations are part of the deal. Not there to sale cars. Why be open!",1.8
20,"April 30, 2015",Everything I wanted I got. Excellent service. Thomas helped me in every step of the process and answered every question that I had. He found me the exact car that I have been looking for. He searched for the car that I wanted and exceeded my expectations. I have already recommended him to coworkers and friends who are looking for new vehicles. I have so many great things to say about my experience that I have people from out of town wanting to come up and work with Thomas on their next purchase. ,5.0
21,"January 09, 2014","So I went in after seeing a used car that I'd been looking months for. After speaking to one salesperson by phone I was told the car was in ""sale pending"" status. I asked for the salesperson to ask the manager if that car was in fact sold or not. I was told he would get right back to me. Two days later and still no call, I saw the car had a discounted price. So I thought I'd try another salesperson. This time I spoke to Randy, who was more than helpful and really the only decent thing about this place. Upon a credit check I was shown paperwork showing the 2008 Honda Civic Si was worth $17k so the price I was getting was a steal!! Not only was that untrue ( Car booked for $13.5k in perfect condition) but they told me that they gave over 11k in trade. Seriously, if you've done your homework this place doesn't want you as a customer, they want someone who's willing to believe everything they say. No I didn't buy the car, my offer was a little low but why shouldn't I try to get the best deal I could? Oh well I can wait, plenty of cars I out there.",2.6
22,"November 04, 2013","I made an appointment for 12:30 on a Saturday to get my first oil changed and tires rotation on my Mazdaspeed 3 with 7500 miles. After waiting for 1.5 hours, I asked one of the service managers if it normally took this long to change oil and rotate tires. He said that he would check into it. About 15 minutes later he explained that the service ticket printed out that I needed my wheels rotated AND balanced and the technician was having difficulties getting my wheels balanced. He told me that they would get a more experienced technician to take care of it and get them all balanced. 45 minutes later, my car was finished. I always check for my wheel lock key before I leave whenever my wheels have been removed. This is a good practice since my key had not been returned to my vehicle. I go back in to once again speak to the service manager about this issue. He goes out to the shop and returns with my key. Explanation: ""The technician must have forgotten to put it back in your car."" I'm so angry at this point that I don't notice all the oil/grease smudge marks on my door, hood, and front bumper of my car until I get home. I had just spent $30 on a car wash the day before! I will NEVER go back to the Burleson Autonation service facility again. I have very little reason to feel confident that any service I was to have received was done correctly, so I may as well cancel the remainder of my service contract, get my refund, and do it myself as I always have.

I called ahead about a certain suv they had and told them what I had for trade-in and about my rough credit. They told me to come on down and try out the suv and they could work with me. Well when I got there after an hour and half drive - First I was given to a different salesman than Sam the person I had talked to - Second - after truning in my credit they came back and told me they either needed cash down with my trade in OR they could put me in something else the the suv I was looking at was for a cash sale not to be financed - which I was not told before I drove all the way over. Anyway to make a long story short I drove straight to James Woods in Denton spoke with John and drove away in an suv I love with nothing down except my trade-in. Don't go here - Go to James Woods instead!!!!
