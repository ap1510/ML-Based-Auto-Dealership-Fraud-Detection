2,"September 03, 2019","I purchased my VW Passat in April. I previously posted because there were issues with the tires, oil, mildewed filters in the car, etc. Then two months later, after taking the car in several times, found out there were major issues with the engine that was being caused by the oil problem when I purchased the car... no problem right... I bought the warranty! Well my car sat at Patterson VW in Tyler for almost a month, Brinson provided a loaner car. Patterson jumped through every hoop asked by the Ford ESP warranty. Yet they still wouldn't pay for the engine to be replaced. One day alone, I made 12 calls to Brinson... and never received a call back. I have called so many times that they know me when I call. I was told they needed to pick up their loaner car... cool... what am I supposed to drive while the warranty is still being process supposedly, ""that is not our concern, nor problem, but you can rent a car at your own expense"". Why should I be renting a car when I just purchased a car. I got fed up and took the car back to trade it, which I felt was my only option... they wouldn't trade the car back and then Cheryl wouldn't even tell me how much the car was worth... I went to Brinson in Corsicana and had the car valued and 4 months later, there's a $4K difference in what they sold it to me for. I think I have been patient dealing with this for 4 months. Having the car towed here and there, sitting at the shop, VW firmly stating the engine, turbo, and exhaust need to be replaced, and Brinson doing exactly NOTHING about it... so it's time to take this to the next level, and not because I may win or lose, but because it is the principle of the matter... stand by what you sell or at least attempt to make it right!",1.0
3,"April 30, 2019","I bought a used Ford F-150 from Brinson and the overall experience was very pleasant.  After finding the truck online, I contacted Brinson, and Shane House promptly emailed me asking how he could help.   I asked a bunch of questions, and if he didn't know the answer right off the top of his head, he went and found out the answers. He was accommodating  and polite.  We went to pick up the truck and there were no surprises.  The transaction went smoothly and quickly.  If you are looking for a vehicle, I recommend Shane highly.",4.6
4,"February 27, 2019","The lack of caring at this location is phenomenal. I went there because I was on a budget and found a little Nissan I could afford. The ad said “Runs great!” And the short test drive I took it on, it ran fine. One day after purchase and I can’t drive more than 15 miles without the engine shaking violently and the lights flashing like crazy. This was only last weekend! I reached out for some help and they would *maybe* do a diagnostic as long as I trade in my credit they put on my account to fix the hatchback handle (which I don’t understand, what is the point of a hatchback that doesn’t open….that should have been included and any other dealership would have been embarrassed that the client found such an obvious problem but their technicians didn’t.) At the moment I am heartbroken and having to beg rides to work and back because my two day old new purchase is dead in the water and the people who sold it to me will do NOTHING about it. Unless you are planning on buying a new vehicle, don’t go here. They talk big game about wanting you to have a great experience at Brinson but when it comes down to actually making that happen, they run and hide.",1.8
5,"October 25, 2018","Went to the dealership 2 Saturday’s ago. Told them what I wanted and told me no problem. Said we found your truck and it will be here Monday. Signed paperwork got into a loaner and drove off. Monday comes around no truck. Tuesday comes around no truck, all the way to Friday. Demanded my truck back and after refusing to leave the dealership they finally said it’s coming around. I hope the owner of this dealership gets to read this and somehow makes it right. John Boyd is nothing but a liar.",1.0
6,"July 17, 2018","Deceitful and deceptive! Save yourself the time and effort and go ANYWHERE but to a Brinson dealership! They are not truthful on advertised pricing, lie about inventory, and are blatantly rude to customers. Extremely disappointed that a dealership like this even exists. Shameful! ",1.0
7,"April 22, 2018","I would give them 0 stars - I should have done this months ago but I got busy and am just now getting to it.  As I go to file a complaint about Brinson Ford - Athens, I see that their ratings are already pitiful.  Now it makes sense, they just don't care.  My complaint is that they are very unethical and be sure to check your mileage of your new & old car before signing off on it.  I don't see where they did anything illegal (or at least can't prove it because I was not there at the time of purchase).  My 80 year old grandma with the help of a daughter purchased a used car from them in May.  Several people pointed out that the car had a damaged frame (as if it had been wrecked and repaired).  The dashboard lights would randomly come on, low tires/gas cap open/engine warning light/inaccurate cruise control setting. After repeated visits to Brinson Ford, the only suggestions the service department gave here was to trade it in for a price much lower than her purchase price.  (Shortly after she purchased it, she went into the hospital for two weeks and then couldn't drive for another two weeks.)  She went back 6/10, alone.  She was talked into trading the used car that she owned less than two months for a new car.  The paperwork says she drove over 600 miles in that short time.  There is no way she even went 200 miles.  She went in to speak with her salesman, Scot, and he convinced her that the Focus was not enough for her, she needed a Fusion.  The owners manual was not in the car and after repeated requests, she said Jarvis Coper was very helpful and got that together with her plates and spare key.  I went over all of the paperwork and went in to talk to the finance manager.  The sale was done, we were not asking to give the car back and get our money.  I wanted to know their side of the story before I posted her side on the internet.  I asked if they told her how much she would be losing if she traded it in.  Mike or Mark (whoever the finance guy is) said that they go over the numbers in detail.  A typical ""little old lady"" isn't going to understand your ""details"" but she would understand if you said ""you are about to lose $8000"".   These guys lack then ability to put themselves in the place of anyone else.  All they are seeing is $$$$.  My question was ""how would you feel if your mother/grandmother/wife/sister/daughter felt like someone took advantage of them all because they didn't want to 'bother' you?""  The guy was either flustered or didn't understand the policies that he is selling.  He wanted to argue about her needing GAP insurance.  I read the contract, we can call and cancel so that does not concern him.  I had to correct him on how GAP insurance works.  Hopefully he knows and was just caught off guard.  As for the extended warranty, I wanted a refund for that.  He did show me where they pro-rated it and applied it to her down payment on the new car, which is fair but was very rude and hostile about the entire situation.  He then continued to argue the extended warranty sale on the new car and refused to refund that.  He said it was not possible for the way they created the loan.  When you choose 0% interest, you are losing out on other rebates.  The dealers will push it but it is not always worth it.  That was the case here.  She bought a brand new car, got a $1500 rebate... so paid 1500 less than sticker price.  When it comes down to it, they made a lot of money off this little old lady.  Talking to him was like talking to a programmed minion, almost like he was reading a phrase it out of a book, repeating it over and over.  He doesn't know anything but what he was told.",1.0
8,"March 08, 2018",Don Kilgore was very accommodating and informative! The process was speedy and the staff was very friendly. We will be coming back for our next vehicle! I would recommend to anyone looking for a vehicle to check out Brinson and request Don Kilgore!,5.0
9,"December 05, 2017",Bought a Ford Explorer and Ford F150 and havent had either of them more than a year. The Ford Explorer we are just getting out of the shop for exhaust fumes. Also has a bad noise coming from the dash in which I was told they could not fix because thats under the 12 month 12000 mile warranty. Explore just went over 12000 mile warranty. They said 36000 bumper to bumper warranty doesnt cover that. We tried getting the car in months ago before 12000 miles and they kept saying not to bring it in until it makes the noise. The noise would come and go so they said dont bring. Now they say they cant fix it. The Ford F150 is going in to shop tomorrow for safety recall and when starting a huge cloud of white smoke pours out of the tailpipe which is very embarrassing to drive. Im not satisfied with my vehicles at all. When you buy new cars you dont expect everything to go wrong with them in the first year of driving them.,1.0
10,"July 26, 2017","Brinson Ford in Athens, Texas is an excellent dealership. I purchased a 2005 Chrysler 300 Touring from Brinson Ford. The Sales Manager (John) and the Sales Consultant (Norman) were excellent. It was just a great buying process. They even transported the vehicle to me in Arkansas. I highly recommend to anyone who is looking to purchase a vehicle in the Eastern/Northeastern area of Texas to shop at Brinson Ford in Athens. I also recommend anyone in the Western Arkansas/Eastern Oklahoma area to shop at Brinson Ford. in Athens, Texas.",5.0

17,"March 28, 2017","Salesman was so busy he was not able to return our call about pricing. I heard one salesman quit...one is in jail...etc etc. Scott the saleman was very sweet but the Sales Manager was rude and arrogant and said ""go buy ya a Dodge they are cheaper if you are on a budget. Lol I guess he didnt realize I am not on a budget. I would not buy from this dealership as long as there is such a rude arrogant Sales Manager. ",1.0

31,"February 04, 2017","We went in for service on our F150. While waiting on repair estimate, we walked around the lot looking at F250s. We found a used F350 of interest, and asked the salesman for a price. In the meantime, service informs us that the extended warranty has expired on the F150. So Matt brings a red F150 for us to look at and John has located a red F350 at another dealership. We discussed prices and ended up signing papers on both trucks. We now have his and hers matching trucks. But the service didn't end there with our signatures. They are swapping, an external gas tank and grill guard.  The F350 has to have the Gooseneck hitch added also. But service continues. All this starts on a Thursday and continues through Friday. The trucks can't get completed before Tuesday of the following week. They provide us with a used F350 complete with Gooseneck hitch so we can pull our 40 foot trailer to the dealership for service work. By the way. We only drove 7 hours from our new property to our old property in Athens area. Ending up buying 2 new trucks from the dealership we traded with many times.",5.0
32,"January 12, 2017","Ben is a very nice and courteous young man. However he seems inexperienced and still learning customer service. It seemed that the Sales Manager was the  person I ended up dealing with on the transaction. 

Other issues:
I drove 2 hrs one way after having an agreement on price for a cash $39k purchase and being told the car was ready.
1. The vehicle was not clean, inside or out
2. Fuel needed
3. No oil change sticker
4. Had a deal by text of price with fees, that changed with fees added once there 
5. Had to wait over an hour to do the paperwork even after sending all my info before coming to the dealership
6. Had to wait even more after finishing paperwork for Ben to get it gassed up when he could have done that while chatting with us.
7. I have done business with Brinson Corsacana before that didn't waste my time.
8. Once we got with Mike to do the paperwork, it went quickly. He did great.

37,"December 14, 2016","I dealt with Ben Lee to get a 2017 Fusion S and within a days time I was driving it happily to work. (The days wait was all on my end and he was very patient with me) He is very knowledgeable on all of the features of a massive variety of cars. He made sure that everything I asked for was included and even gave me some tips and pointers on warranties so that I was able to chose the one that best fit my needs. He ran me through all of the features and explained it in an expert and professional fashion, making sure I understood everything about my new car.

44,"November 08, 2016","I have never been treated so well by a car dealer. These people went way out of their way to make us comfortable and we treated with the utmost respect. I was buying one of the cheapest vehicles on the lot and they treated us like we were buying the most expensive car. Negotiating was not a problem. They gave a great price without any hassle. It was like doing business in my own home. Each and every person was down-to-earth while knowing their business and being very straight forward and honest.

I have dealt with many people in all my years, but the experience we had there, was the best.",5.0
45,"November 04, 2016",Very nice and helpful. They brought the truck I wanted from Corsicana so I could see it and drive it in Athens. Thank you very much Sam .,5.0
46,"October 31, 2016","Couple of SNAFU's was not noted that there was no warranty until we signed papers. This should be said during sales for used cars. 
No hand book for used car. Unacceptable. Need to have this included upon purchase. 
We are writing to Ford and letting them know that need to change their policy.  I am sure this will be a deterrent for many people. 
I give Jaris good stars however don't want to penalize him for something he has no control over. 
Overall the buying experience caused no stress and an easy process from start to finish.",3.6

56,"August 13, 2016","Hello, my name is Aaron. let me start off by saying this is the worst experience i have ever had at any dealership. Amanda Weaver and jarvis Cofer. (Big Tex) knew this review was coming. After talking to mr. Jarvis this morning, he told me to grab a few documents  and to head to his dealership  so that he can sell me the Mustang, jarvis knowing i lived 90+ miles away.. I drove to the dealership  (over an hour and 30 minute drive)  whenever i arrived at the dealership everything was going fine. Jarvis let me test drive the car and then whenever we got back to the dealership, thats when the long waiting game began. Long story short. Im sure they did not do everything that they could to help me get into this car.  After offering $1000 cash down payment + my trade in. Still was a waste of time and energy. I WILL NOT recommend this dealership to anyone that i know. And i will also be posting reviews about my experience on other online car sites and social media. Not only did i return to the dealership for the 2nd time because they were not taking my calls or calling me back but also to see if we can make things right so i would be able to enjoy my new car. But that did not happen.  This dealership has lost two diff. Sales. Because i had 2 cars to trade in for 2 new cars. So it could have been good for jarvis. 
Jarvis is a cool guy, BUT ima need for him to do better than that! its not okay to grub down on lunch while you have a customer sitting right in front of you. unprofessional.. sorry, but you know it is. 
I hope this helps someone that lives far away and is told to come to the dealership make sure you dont waste your time like i did. I know this may seem a little bit dramatic, but I turned down a good deal on a new Mustang in my local town, and lost that vehicle because i came to buy this mustang from Jarvis and Amanda. So I will be contacting Mark Fields and his people  (which I'm sure you know is this CEO of Ford Motor Company)  so that I can let him know how my experience went at the Brinson Ford in Athens Texas.
Thats all.

57,"July 27, 2016",We were excited to find a vehicle that was the color and had so many extras we wanted at a good price.  My only negative comment is that I feel the window etching was slipped in on the deal.  But since we did pay the price we asked that isn't a big negative. ,4.5

From the website, we called to inquire about a vehicle and had great interactions with Norman. Upon arrival Norman greeted us and provided us with excellent service. 

The only reason the dealership didn't receive five stars is because our experience in the finance office was fair not great. In the end everything worked out and we purchased the vehicle. ",4.3

I test drove the vehicle, about 30 minutes before they closed Thursday evening, filled out the application and left.  Friday JT called me and said they got me approved and it was within my budget, but I had been waiting to see what my bank said.  I still had not heard back from the bank, so after work on Friday, I called JT and told him it was a deal, get the paperwork ready and I'm on my way.

I plan to purchase a lightly used 2013-14 GT-500, 2017 GT-350 or standard Mustang GT in the next 8-12 months.  Stephen appears to have a reasonable, if not good, knowledge of the Mustang models.

100,"September 14, 2015","Went to Brinson Dealership first to help a neighbor find a good used car.
 We had bought from them before and knew their god customer relationship.
The salesman was very kind and helpful even though the lady only wanted a cheap car.
While my husband help to find her a car another sales person, Stephanie Morgan,
talked with me and offered to show me a car and to give me information on any I liked.
She drove a car around for me to see.  I found one on the lot I liked and she got the key
for me to drive it.  She was never ""pushy"" nor did she try to talk me into any car.
All this time Stephanie knew we were there helping a lady on a pre-owned car.
Yes, I did like the car I drove and came home wanting that car!  We had little interest in
a new car for ourselves but may be buying one this week.
This extra effort from a sales person who had only been there 2 days, gave me a 
comfortable feeling that ""Just Looking"" didn't mean being ignored nor pressured to
purchase a car. 
PS There were 3 other salesmen standing at the door as we walked in with Kevin.
They didn't offer a ""Hello"".

108,"July 23, 2015","For years I have been buying Fords and have never been able to buy one in Athens tx.  I thought I would give them another shot.  So I again pulled in to the dealership parking lot and approached the front door.  This time was different, because normally I am swamped by salesmen. I walked in and approached the front desk where I found no one to greet me.  I looked around at the old ford truck for about 10 min and then decided to go look at a new truck by myself.  About the time I had decided on a vehicle a young man approached me asking if I had been assisted.  I explained that I would like to look at this truck and inquired if he could get the keys so I could look inside. About 20 min had passed and I walked in from the heat to see what was going on.  He explained to me that he. Had to get some information from me first.  I obliged him and then he wanted to get my credit information.  I explained to him that when I get ready to purchase I will give that info but not until.  Next I find out that he can't find the key to the vehicle I was interested in.  Now I have been here for 1 hour and still haven't seen the truck.  I decided that it was time for me to realize that this place hasn't changed in 20 years.  So I left and headed to Tyler where I found a great and helpful staff.  I bought a new truck that day.  I expect they must loose a lot of business to the Tyler store because of their own incompetence   For anyone who may read this post, stay away and don't waste your time.   ",1.5

148,"December 20, 2014","I recently traveled to Brinson Ford of Athens to buy a used car. I spoke with Erin Hankins on the phone as well as e-mailed and texted. I believe she intentionally misled me. Before I came to test drive the car I asked what fees there would be on top of the advertised price. She initially said none other than sales tax, then said there would be a small titling fee. I questioned her about paying sales tax since I was from out of state but she checked with someone and said they would match the sales tax rate of the county I live in and have me pay sales tax at their dealership. I said that would be fine and gave her the number to my county clerk's office so she could determine the appropriate sales tax rate. I asked her to send me an e-mail detailing the final cost of the car with all fees and tax included, which she did.

After test driving the car and deciding to buy it I went into a different office to write a check and sign a few final papers. The paperwork didn't say anything about sales tax and when I asked if it included the tax the guy (forgot his name) said no. The extra $480some dollars was FEES. I explained how I'd been told by Erin that there wouldn't be ANY FEES other than $35 for titling plus sales tax. He said that wasn't Erin's job, it was his job and these were standard. Eventually he reduced the fees some and I bought the car.

I e-mailed Erin explaining my Confusion regarding the fees. She apologized but offered no explanation and didn't make any attempt to resolve the issue.

We talked about taking the car with us or leaving it for 3 days then picking it up on our way back home. Erin wanted us to leave the car so they could fully detail it. When we came back three days later Erin wasn't there, and we waited around while others at the dealership tried to figure out what to do. The car had not been detailed; it still had the window sticker goo inside on the windows.

UPDATE 1.6.15

I wrote my original review Saturday, December 20. I received a response from Amanda (I'm assuming Amanda Weaver) Monday, December 22, saying she was researching what I had said in this review. I replied that I would be happy to provide any e-mails or texts between Erin and myself. I haven't heart anything since.

Also, I noticed that once the review finally posted to this site it didn't show up as a review for Erin Hankins. I contacted dealerrater.com and they replied that the dealership CHOOSES which reviews get attached to the person being reviewed. Since my review is negative Brinson Ford doesn't include it under their salesperson. Dealerrater is geared toward providing positive feedback for dealers. When I provided my original review I received a message explaining that since my review was negative it wouldn't post right away, and would only post to the site if I logged in and acknowledged the response the dealership made to my review. I imagine many negative reviews never post to the site because the reviewer either doesn't realize they have to keep logging in to the site to acknowledge dealer responses or the reviewer doesn't want the hassle of confrontation with the dealer.",1.8

150,"December 11, 2014","I researched vehicles on the internet and found what I thought may meet my wants.  I visited the dealership and met Wyle McClintock outside the front door.  I told him what I had come to look at and he briefly showed me and my wife the vehicle.  He had another customer that he was working with so I was handed off to another sales person.  We discused the price of his vehicle and then discussed my trade in.  He left and came back with the figures on a paper and said that is what the offer was.  I told him that either his vehicle was a little high or he wasn't offering enough for my trade in.  I pretty well found out that that was the price.  I thanked him for his time and we left the dealership.  I though that that was the end of that particular vehicle and would continue my search elsewhere.  The next day Wyle called me and said that he needed to sell the vehicle.  I told him what price and trade in I was offered.  I told Wyle what I wanted for my trade in  which was more than I ws offered.  He said that if I would bring in my trade in so they could see it, they may could offer me more.  I took my vehicle in and they looked it over and agreed that what I proposed was agreeable with them.  We made the deal and I drove home in the vehicle that I was looking for.

They provide a family atmosphere along with honest service. The reason for 4's on the review was due to a gooseneck hitch being installed and the wiring not checked before releasing to use. The right blinker on the trailer connections is still to be rectified at this time, although I am certain this will not be a problem.

170,"September 05, 2014","I would hightly recommend doing business with Amanda Weaver at Brinson Ford in Athens, Texas!  Amanda was an absolute pleasure to work with at this dealership.  Amanda was exceptional at communication, follow up, and did everthing within her power to provide First Class Customer Service in our experience with Brinson Ford.  She is very approachable and is fully up to speed on all forms of communication in today's business environment, i.e. e-mail, text, Facebook, etc.  Amanda provided the type of Customer Service/Sales Experience that is in my opinion, very rare at car dealerships!  Thank you for the excellence Amanda!

We were also greeted by the owners of Brinson Ford during our visit and were thanked for coming in to their business and thank for considering their dealership for our purchase.  Very nice touch!!

Steve Pate was also extremely friendly and very helpful with the financing process!

On the other hand, if you have a choice, find someone other than Scott Steward to deal with in your negotiations.  Scott was extremely arrogant, rude, and made us feel like he could care less whether or not we purchased a vehicle from Brinson.  In my business, if my employees treated our customers like Scott treated us,....i.e., customers that voluntarily walk into my business with the possibility of spending  their hard earned money......I would send them to ""Charm School"" immediately, or inform them that they need to begin looking for a career that does not involve direct contact with potential customers.",4.0

Steve went the extra steps to insure we understood our financing and extended coverage and his interaction with the sales staff proved that these folks are working as a team.

Amanda recognized there was a need.  Concerned herself with our comfort in multiple ways and never made us feel like a mere dollar sign.  She responded lightening quick.  She engaged me and my daughter personally while moving the transaction through the process.

I was offered a great deal and picked up my new Red Ford Fusion two days later, (because someone had to drive to Longview to get a red one).  Ross was a very polite salesman and was able to answer all the questions we had about our new Ford Fusion.

On May 18, 2013, Brinson Ford in Athens hosted a Drive 4UR School event as a fundraiser for the Malakoff Education Foundation.  I cannot thank you enough for the warm welcome you extended to Foundation members who were working at the event.  You and your staff were wonderful to work with and we all agreed that we had never had such fun at an auto dealership.  I watched as the dealership was transformed into a community get together.  The Cloggers dance team was the center of attraction.  The SPCA brought some puppies to show off.  Malakoff cheerleaders kept the place lively and I saw old friends reunite.  Brinson provided food, snow cones and some really nice cars.  We brought in a total of 300 test drives.  Each test driver was accompanied by a Ford monitor who rode in the back seat.  Everyone I talked to said it was a great way to try out a new car with no pressure and in a very comfortable environment.  The monitors were fun to be around and added to the experience.  What a wonderful day it was!
 
Ford Motor has sent us a check for $5900 which will fund 4 to 6 grants to teachers in Malakoff ISD who have innovative teaching ideas but need funding.  You and the fine staff at Brinson made this possible and we are very grateful.  
 
David Bullock
President – Malakoff Education Foundation

305,"March 20, 2013","Overall my experience was a good one. Robert Warman, the salesman was a jewel. He worked for the sale. The finance man, Jeff somebody did a great job getting a very good interest rate. However, he mislead us about the extended waranty which we purchased with the understanding it would cover the car for the next 5 years. However, we later learned, the extended warranty was retro to the date the car was first put into service, 10/11. Which means we are paying $2000 extra for the next 5+ years when the warranty runs out in 15, only a bit over two years from when we purchased the car and bought the extended warranty. That has stuck in my craw and for that reason I cannot give the dealership a 'great' rating. And I wonder if this is a Ford practice. If Jeff received a kick-back for selling the extended warranty, shame on him and whomever paid him. He left the dealership very shortly after we purchased the car. I understand he left a big mess in the fianance department office. He cost us an extra $2000. The man who took over for him, Chad, didn't help us resolve that extended warranty issue either.

340,"January 05, 2013","We could not recommend this dealership to anyone because we bought a used product that we were told was in good working order and that it had been checked out by the service department. We trusted the dealerships word but when we took it somewhere to have it checked out we found out it needed extensive costly repairs. 

We thought purchasing from a dealer would be better than an individual but your dealership proved this theory wrong. We were misled and we would have negotiated a much lower price for the vehicle if we had known you were selling an inferior product.

The only recommendation we will be giving about Brinson is DON""T GO TO THIS DEALERSHIP.

To me that is unheard of with all the dealership games that dealers usually play with you keeping you at the dealership for hours. For this reason alone I will always buy my cars from these people.
Rodney and Bryan were the most friendly people and felt like family when kidding around with them.

The only drawback I feel was make ready. Or who ever cleans the car. Ashes were found around the dash area and trash still under the front seat also letting me know that this car was from Michigan (not a good thing to do in selling a used car). 
Also we never received the original key fob which on this car cost quite a bit and makes me feel a little uncomfortable knowing that someone has a key to our car. We did get the second fob that works but the original fob has a hidden key inside the original. 

The make ready guy also should have notified us also of the toll tag that was left in our trade in instead of just throwing it away. I now have to drive to Dallas to get another one

I still had 200 miles until I would be home, so I found the closest Ford dealership, and pulled in.  IMMEDIATELY, Scott greeted me and started to assist me with my problem. He did not have my exact tires in stock, but he searched around town to see about getting me tires, even if not from his dealership.  No one else had them either.  He then started exploring any alternatives with other tires that would suit my car. 

While trying to make a decision, I contacted my husband and Scott offered to discuss my options with him.  He was very personable and extremely concerned about my safety and managed to keep me calm just by being concerning.  

Before I left the dealership, Scott asked me to be sure to call him once I arrived safely at home, even though he knew it would be around 10:00 at night. 

I cannot tell you how comforting it was to have such an awesome person to have helped me with a potentially scarey situation.  Being a female travelling so far from home, I couldn't have asked for a better situation in such a time of need.

I plan to also write a separate letter to the GM of the dealership to let him know about my experience, in case he/she does not see this review.

I had just bought the vehicle with full coverage for maintenance of same. I was informed that this problem was not covered in the maintenance agreement. $2,000 plus later I received my truck back. Since then I have had Antifreeze blow out all over the top of the engine. Now $32,000 Truck and Maintenance for a 2006 6.0 Ltr.

Rodney made my buying experience like none other that I have ever experienced. First of all, his attitude is that of a winner. By that I mean he truly understands that if you give great service, the money will ALWAYS come.He truly went above and beyond the call of duty. When I told Rodney that I liked the vehicle, and was willing to make an offer, but I needed an independent assessment of the condition of the vehicle, his comment was ""no problem."" I live in Dallas, so I did not know a certified mechanic in Athens, but Rodney made some phone calls for me, and went with me to get an independent assessment of the vehicle.
After we closed the deal that day, I picked the vehicle up a couple of days later. The left front tire was wearing, and I told Rodney that I was not feeling good about driving the vehicle back to Dallas. Again, he said ""no problem"", and made some phone calls for me, and found me a used tire, which ironically matched the other 3 tires.
Rodney is a true professional, and is very good at his craft. The vehicle that I purchased is fantastic, and I am very pleased. I am recommending Rodney to all of my family and friends who will be purchasing a vehicle in the future.
In closing, I want to share the great experience I had with Bryan Carter, finance manager.He made me feel so comfortable. Thanks Rodney and Bryan. You guys are the best!!!

 He did not waste our time with the dollar figure or the 'deal' made on the

 He gave us a tour of Brinson Ford to let us know where we go for our maintaince     and introduced us to the folks in the service department.
 Nic also called to make sure all was well and if we had any questions a few days later. 

 Bryan was very helpful in explaining the warranty, and the contract. 
 He is very persoanable too.

416,"May 15, 2012","I did not purchase a vehicle from Brinson however, I did inquire about several of their used trucks which unfortunately did not match what I was looking for.  I ended up buying a truck in Texarkana, TX simply because the price was right and the options were right. All of this happened fairly quickly therefore, Brinson didn't even really get the opportunity to search out a vehicle for me.  

I will however, in the future definitely keep Brinson in mind due to the way that Amanda Weaver continued to contact me asking if I had made a decision. She even continued to email even after I advised her I had already purchased a truck elsewhere.  I have no doubt that I will contact Brinson the next time I am in the market which, based on my history could be within the next year. I have traded for 4 vehicles in the past 4 years.  Obviously, I am impressed with Brinson or I wouldn't be taking the time to complete this survey.

Thanks again for keeping in touch and I hope we can get together on my next vehicle purchase.

418,"May 11, 2012","I strongly advise against using this dealer for any manner of out of state sale. 

Even though I was extremely prompt with scheduling a 3rd party mechanic check and expediting money to them, once they have your money you are an extremely low priority.
Their sales staff seem competent enough, but their finance division delayed week after week, sent paper work to the wrong address, sent the wrong and inadequate paperwork and repeatedly lied to me about when they were sending overnighting stuff  This resulted in several days of extreme stress for myself and my wife as we needed the car for a new job. They took more than 20 days and at the end of it they still didn't send me all the paperwork I needed. The NM Dept. of Motor  Vehicles supervisor actually took pity on me and issued me a NM title though she said my paperwork was inadequate.
If you think I am exagerrating, consider this: At the end of the entire deal, they sent me a title that was *NOT* signed and NO bill of sale from them!
There was a power of attorney on the back of the TX title that they didn't initially address, and I had to call them on the last possible day before I left for my job, for an emergency fax.
There is much more, but I don't want to bore you. If not for the NM MVD, I would have had to miss the first day of a new job. NOT RELIABLE people.

And at the end of it all, they had nothing but unsincere apologies and I had to ask after them, they rarely returned calls though they said they would. I asked for a tken of compensation and the manager, Brad Norell, had the nerve to say that I ""wanted to be bought off.""

The bottom line... you better get everything organized (paperwork, delivery of car, etc) at the same time as you hand over your money. I am strongly considering filing a BBB case against this place. I gave them every chance to fix this mess.",2.4

508,"December 16, 2011","I like keeping my business local when I can and I really like Andy. My only beef with Brinson Ford is the service department seems really slow in comparison to the other dealerships service departments that I have used currently and in the past.  For instance, I carry my Nissan Quest to Pielter Nissan in Tyler for oil changes.  I am never there more than 30 minutes as they have a line dedicated to oil and lube.  However when I have brought any of my vehicles to Brynson for an oil and lube I just drop them off because it exceeds 2 hours.  I watched an entire show one time in the waiting room.  For that reason I carry my vehicle to the ""Kwik Lube"" in Athens.  I would prefer to carry it to Brynson because you send me coupons but it isn't worth the wait.  
Just being honest not ugly! This isn't a slam against your service guys as they have always been curtious and helpful!

512,"December 16, 2011","  I would recommend Brinson Ford for those who like Ford products. For a long time
  I drove a Lincoln L.S and Ford Explorer and the service at Brinson was excellent.
  In order for a dealership to be successful, it needs to be honest, sincere,
  dependable, friendly and trustworthly. I found these traits at Brinson.
  In my early life, my uncle was a mechanic for 30 years, and I would often go  
  go around to different dealships and purchase parts for his business.
  I have seen several dealerships not successful and having to sell out because
  they did not take the time to consider the customer first, sit down and make
  a reasonable deal with them and just present a ""take it or leave it "" attitude
  to the customer.Working with the public sometimes is not easy, and it takes
  special talents and patients to be successful in a business. I sincerely 
  congradulate Brinson Ford for their success.

     I cannot tell you how pleased I have been with my experience with Brinson Ford in Athens, Texas.  I went in to really look for a preowned Lincoln, but, of course, fell in love with a new little MKZ.  Williams was so helpful.  He was never ""pushy"".  I've had some really bad experiences with car dealers, and I was very skeptical about buying a new car.  It had been eight years since I purchased my last one.  He talked me through everything.  He let me come back several times and look and discussed options with me.  Once I made up my mind, he was very helpful in getting financing for my new car.  The young man in the finance department was also great!  ( I don't know his name.)  He told me what my choices were as far as length of payoff, extended warranties, ""gap"" insurance, etc.  The amazing thing was, it only took about 1 hour!  I may never be able to buy another car (I'm a teacher and getting ready to retire), but if I were to buy another one, I would most assuredly come back to Brinson!!!!  Thanks so much for your help.  I love my little car.  It's beautiful, drives like a dream, and once I learn how to operate everything, it will be even more fun!

I have however had a problem with the purchase of the new vehicle. after getting home with my new Ranger I noticed the window sticker price was $299.00 less than the invoice that I made the mistake of paying before i had time to analize the details. As the financing continued the price kept going up and like any other excited new buyer i kept letting it happen. I am not passing blame i should have paid more attention to what was happening. If it had been a pickup and delivery charge it would have been one thing but the price was increased by $299.00 without any explanation for it.

After getting a general price for my trade, which I did not have with me at the time. I told them what truck I was looking for. I came back a couple days later after being sure that I wanted to make a deal. They did not have the specific truck I wanted in stock. Jason and the guys at Brinson worked extra hard, looking all around the surrounding areas for the exact truck that I wanted, which took a couple days of searching. They not only of course found the perfect truck for me, but they gave me $750 more for my trade than anyone else had offered; and I had looked at a lot of dealers. They went and picked the vehicle up from almost 400 miles away and had it there within 2 days! I am so please with Jason and Brinson and will definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a vehicle to purchase!",5.0
605,"July 25, 2011","I have always relied on the Athens dealership to fix my problem when I need a repair and they have always handled it very well. They have let me have a rent car free of charge in the past and this time I was offered someone to pick me up and take me to the dealership to pick up my car when it was fixed. Customer service is very accommodating.

I will say I am very disappointed in the vehicle itself.  I drove another Navigator for 10 years and had very little repairs over those 10 years and this one has had problems from the beginning. It looks great but has been a big disappointment in workmanship in relation to the price you pay for it. I purchased the second Navigator based on the great preformance of the first one but I should have purchased something else. I hope they have a better Navigator out now than they did in 2007.

Thank you for letting me vent.

I would figure the dealer would keep a healthy stock of Ford's premium muscle car for customers to look at.

619,"June 25, 2011","Brinson Ford in Athens, TX is a good dealership in my opinion. I gave ""good"" as my review because the staff was very friendly, informative, and were good at their job. I did not rate it excellent because of a few things. One, during the initial price workup, a "" new"" warranty was added in on a used car. I'm not sure if that was an intentional thing or not, but since I questioned it, the sales manager said ""Oh!, I accidentally added that in, let me take it out"". That drastically altered the price I was initially offered. Also, I received no documentation of maintenance. I don't know if scheduled maintenance has actually been done or not. Considering this is supposed to be a ""certified"" used vehicle, I really expected better documentation regarding scheduled maintenance. I did call back and speak with someone in the service department. I was told the oil had been changed. I would have requested maintenance documentation during the purchase process, but it slipped my mind to ask as I was busy trying to make sure all the financial aspects were correct.

I would use Brinson again. I think it is a good dealership. But, understand, I inherently distrust the car sales industry because of many past experiences and it takes me a few deals to actually start trusting a dealer. The ""accidental"" new warranty charge concerns me some, but it would not stop me from buying from Brinson again.",4.0
