0,"November 17, 2019","I bought a vehicle from another dealership, was frustrated with the experience and just glad to be done with the whole car buying venture.  Then someone ran a stop sign and totaled my new vehicle.  I was not looking forward to shopping again, but Bowtie was so great!  He made me feel confident and sure of my purchase, he worked with me on the financing, and just made sure I was comfortable and could enjoy my car shopping experience!  Great job, guys!",5.0
1,"April 25, 2019",We were in a car accident and Colby Brunson did an excellent job. He got the parts ordered and got us back on the road the next day. He went above and beyond his job to help us when we were stranded. Everyone one we met there was very friendly and helpful.,5.0
2,"April 19, 2019","We were returning customers having bought a new Challenger there two years ago. The fact that we were returning customers meant absolutely nothing to them. We were mislead, we were treated like second class citizens, calls were not returned, and promises not kept. They even tried to lowball us on a trade by a considerable margin from their own trade evaluator they have on their own website. This is NOT the dealership it used to be and I would strongly avoid shopping around.",1.4

10,"September 26, 2018","Both DJ Latimer and Ted Teague have spoiled me greatly--I am still making up my mind regarding a car purchase. Not only has there been NO high-pressure approach, they have gone out of their way to encourage me to drive several cars and to take my time reaching my final decision. To say that they have treated me right would be an understatement. The same holds true for James Schagel in the Parts Department--he always knows exactly what I need despite my meager descriptions, and he always remembers me. I must also mention Leslie Cooper-Gholson in Finance--we have bought two other cars here in the past and have thus worked with Leslie, as well. Even when we're just visiting, she always greets us, remembers us, and wants to make sure that our needs are met. All four of these folks are not only outstanding at their jobs, but also are outstanding human beings. I highly recommend this dealership in general, and these four people in particular!",5.0
11,"September 26, 2018",I have purchased many trucks and cars from different dealerships.The last two Ram trucks came from Allen Samuels  Waco. This team is AWESOME! D.J.

12,"September 25, 2018","Recently bought my 7th car from Allen Samuels and as usual we couldn't be happier. DJ Latimer or DJ the Marine as everyone knows him has been with me since day one. Although he is now a manager he's still one of the best in the industry. Purchased this truck from Trey McDade who was also an amazing person and salesman who was ready to help from the time I entered the lot. Great crew of people that keep you feeling like family. DJ is the reason I and many family members continue to return and buy from this dealership. Thanks DJ , Trey and Rolando!",4.8

He listened to my request and work he butt off to show all the vehicles I asked and did not pressure me to buy something I was not happy with or “I could live with”. He has taken care of me after the sale, which is unheard of from other dealers.",4.8

I was able to do everything online so when I went in for a test drive it took about 30 mins and then I left.  I had an answer on financing within the hour so when I went in to finalize everything it only took about an hour.  Gerald was very knowledgeable about the vehicle and was the best salesman I have ever worked with.  No hassle, no games just straight to the point and deal.

33,"December 12, 2017","I enjoyed working with Gary to get my wife a new vehicle. He hustled and did not waste time. He doesn't do the ""salesman"" tactics and does not try to screw you like alot of salesman do. I told Gary what I wanted, my price, and what I expected.

We stated no we were only looking. He said I will watch for you and if you need help just wave and I will be right there and I wont bother you.

38,"November 09, 2017","The staff at Allen Samuels were excellent! They exceeded my expectations! Spring, Guy and Clint went above and beyond what I was expecting from a car dealership. I was hoping Guy and Spring realized I wasn’t just another tire kicker and was a serious buyer. Most of my conversations with them was via texted due to my time constraint. Guy and Spring stepped up and found the perfect vehicle for me. It was in my budget and exactly the vehicle I wanted. I was in and out in under an hour! I’m loving my Truck! I will most definitely spread the word for Allen Samuels! Thx guys!

39,"November 08, 2017","We had a few problems, Crista took it upon herself to fix them. She worked out EXACTLY what we wanted and got everything made right. We had had problems with our previous truck. Everyone else we dealt with kinda pushed us to things we didn’t want, but she knew what we wanted and didn’t stop. Clint was also great working everything out. If you go here, go straight to Crista. She’s so great and considerate. Gets the job done and DEFINITELY saved the sale, and our returning business! ",5.0

42,"November 02, 2017",I bought a vehicle from here back in June and started having an issues with it and I brought it in for repairs not once but twice.

44,"October 30, 2017","We went to the dealership to buy a used Chevy Equinox we saw on-line.  The sales person we contacted by phone earlier, Randy Glass, did a great job of showing us the new car.  Also, when it came time to discuss the sale, it was hassle free.  Moreover, when the car's battery died a few days later (which we found out later was due to a light we left on), I called Randy.  He came out to the car with a mechanic and took care of us.  They jumped the car and then took the car back to make sure everything was in excellent condition. It was a great customer service experience.  .  ",5.0

56,"October 19, 2017","Anytime I take my car into Allen Samuels Dodge Chrysler Jeep Ram, I am always met with a professional courtesy that can feel like it gets lost in the fast-paced hustle and bustle of everyday life. My service advisor Colby always answers any and all questions I have in a respectful manner and ensures that by the time I leave, I am completely confident in the choice I made to entrust my car to the Allen Samuels DCJR service center.  Everyone I have encountered here is friendly and I have never felt pressured to get a bunch of things that I don't need.  Being a single woman who takes her car in to be serviced alone, the fact that no one tries to ""pull a fast one"" by trying to pad the bill with non-essentials is very important to me.

70,"September 26, 2017","I visited Allen Samuels looking for an SUV.  We were first approached by Phillip Gomez.  Phillip was there to answer all of our questions and provide us with additional information on some of the vehicles.  Phillip made the car buying experience comfortable without being pushy or adding any additional pressure.  During the process, Phillip was very responsive and was easy to communicate with whether by email, phone, or text when I had additional questions or thoughts.

86,"September 18, 2017","Upon arrival the management immediately put me with Jake Conner, a US Army Veteran, whom they felt would assist me in getting the 'Right' truck for me. Jake patiently listened to my needs and asked several qualifying questions to ensure he understood my predicament. He immediately felt they would be able to get me into my vehicle for the right down payment and price.  He was very personable but with the right amount of professionalism that lets you know you can count on his recommendations.

I am now the proud owner of a 2017 3/4 Ton 6.4 Hemi driven 4 wheel drive pick up.  

I received a call within 72 hours of my new purchase from Jake to ensure I was happy with my new truck and if he could assist me in anything. That is the true measurement of a professional.

Thanks Jake for all that you did. I am already recommending my friends to see you in the near future.

141,"February 06, 2017","I had previously purchased a 2016 Jeep Cherokee back in March 2016. Over the course of ownership, as unfortunate as it is, the vehicle had many issues which resulted in many trips to visit the service department. While picking up my vehicle from my last visit on February 1, 2017, I decided to stop by to visit with Ted Teague. This meeting ended up being one of the most important and best decisions that I had made as an Allen Samuels customer. This meeting changed everything for our family! 

Mr. Teague listened to my concerns and ultimately wanted to help make what, at this point, was a really bad situation a better outcome for me and my family. Once I left, he immediately looped in the Sales Manager, Clint Allen, who reached out to me quickly and was ready to help me. On Saturday, February 4, we stopped by to visit with Clint who fortunately had not given up on the Jeep brand, as I was already prepared to do. And, I am glad he didn't. I loved my previous vehicle. I loved what he had to offer. What I didn't love, were the problems. He assigned Wesley Abrahams to assist us, which was such a blessing! It was great that everyone was aware of what we needed and ultimately prepared to just help us. We spent a great amount of time really looking over some vehicles and making sure that the previous issues were not displayed in any of the vehicles we looked at. There wasn't a single minute that we were there that we ever felt like we were rushed or that we weren't important. This is true for our first visit, as well! 

After spending a great amount of time there, because of how thorough we were with looking at the differences among the options, we found a 2017 Jeep Cherokee Latitude that worked for us. We couldn't be happier with the experience. 

Not once, did Clint and Wesley ever give up on us! Not once did they ever make us feel like we weren't important or that we were just customers. We never felt like we were just viewed as another sale but that they really cared about us, our situation as well as the outcome. 

The finance process with Lesley was exceptional, as always! She is really a rare find in the auto finance business. She remembered us when we walked in her office. She is extremely personable. She cares about her customers and you really get a sense of how much she cares about you and your situation just after spending a couple of minutes in her office. We are so fortunate that we had the opportunity to work with Leslie again. 

Another important point to make is that we had our four year old son with us during the entire visit! I share this point and want to highlight this point to express how family oriented the sales team/finance team are. Each individual that we encountered incorporated him into the conversation and really made him feel comfortable during the entire process. 

This dealership is great! Mr. Teague, Mr. Allen, Mr. Abrahams and Mrs. Cooper-Gholson went above and beyond for our family. We are completely satisfied and highly recommend this dealership and these employees, specifically. ",5.0

Time for service rolled around so instead of driving all the way back to Bastrop took it to A.S. Needed alignment, Tire rotation and balance. When I went to drop off the Jeep wasn't sure who to talk to and no one seemed to want to help. No big deal! Finally got it dropped off. Was called the next day that it was ready for pickup. Picked it up with no problems. Stopped for gas on the way home was filling it up and started looking it over. I was in a blizzard in late Dec. in Amarillo and had to break the ice off my tires and wheels. While doing so I chipped a small piece off of my Right rear wheel.

191,"February 23, 2016","We went in one Saturday afternoon just to go ""look"" for cars for my grandmother. We just wanted to look around to see what her choices were. We did not want to feel pressured to buy a car since it was just our first stop & I didn't want an annoying sales person try to sell us a car just so they could get their part of the deal. One gentlemen asked if we need help right way which was a good thing that he noticed us and he wasn't pushy, we told his we were just looking. A few minutes went by and that is when Ashley came out to check on us. Ashley asked what brought us in, I was a little nervous because a lot of the car dealerships wont even try to help you out if you are not willing to spend the big bucks! I told her we were here looking for a reliable car for my grandmother ( she had a xxxxx car that would stop everywhere) , we were on a budget because my grandmother only receives her retirement . I told her what we wanted to her payments to be and instead of telling us ""sorry we cant make that happen"" , she told us she would do everything in her power to get what we wanted. She took us around to see cars that were in our price range. I was expecting cars that had 100,000 + miles on them but I was shocked to see what Allen Samuels had in stock that will fit in her price range. My grandmother saw a car she fell in love with, she was to nervous to drive so Ashley took us for a ride. She was very informative about the cars she was showing us which was a great thing and she was NOT pushy!  Now it was time to get to the hard part , financing time!  In our past experience at other dealer ships, this would be the time that took forever, but not here! They really did work with my grandmother to get exactly what she needed and wanted in a short amount of time! Ashley was a great sales person that truly fought for our needs (she even bought something with sugar for my mother that has diabetes ). This was so far the best car experience we have ever had! Thanks to Allen Samuels Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram & Ashley my grandmother now drives a 2015 Chrysler 200 with less then 25,000 miles. Will be coming back here to buy Again! I 100% recommend Ashley for your car needs.

193,"February 02, 2016","Allen Samuels Dodge/Chrysler/Jeep has, without question, the worst service department I have ever dealt with. We purchased two vehicles through Allen Samuels and have had nothing but trouble from service. If you are considering purchasing a vehicle from Allen Samuels, or even are unlucky enough to have Chrysler/Fiat-branded vehicle that you purchased elsewhere but live in the Waco area, please keep the following review in mind.

Our issues started the day after we purchased a 2016 RAM. We simply wanted to get our navigation activated. We were going to be paying close to $700 to have this 'feature' activated. We called our salesperson who said the service department is open until 8pm and to just come in and it would take them 5 minutes. We got there at 4:40pm and suddenly all of the service workers disappeared. I was literally the only person left in the front of the service department for about 15 minutes. I left service and went to find Marcus Ward, who is, by the way, delightful. Marcus and I walked around looking for Evan Harder (service advisor) for another 10 minutes or so before Evan pulls up in his personal vehicle. Marcus said Evan had probably just left to go get smokes. Nice. Classy. Definitely what Allen Samuels is paying him for.
 
After that, they took my vehicle in and left it sitting in the lot with the doors open for about a half an hour. This, for a five minute fix. All they had to do was call Dodge with the number on my navigation screen to activate it. The person who took my vehicle in and left it sitting in the lot could not be found. I eventually got fed up, got in my truck, and started to drive off before Evan ran out and asked if I had changed my mind about activating the nav. No. I just had already been there for over an hour for a five minute fix and nobody was doing any work. Eventually someone came out and took the five minutes to call Dodge with my number and get the navigation working.

Keep in mind that the hours of the service department say they are from 7-8pm M-F. This is, at best, dishonest. If you arrive after 5pm with any sort of real problem they will direct you to come back some other day as only oil change technicians work past 5pm. If you arrive between the hours of 4pm and 5pm, be prepared to get ignored by the service advisors and basically anyone else as they try to rush out the door to go home before helping you.

A couple of weeks went by and the weather got colder and I realized that the steering wheel heater did not work. We called to set up an appointment and were told they do not take appointments and would just need to come by the dealership to get it diagnosed...... Okay. Sure.

We drove the truck down there to have it diagnosed. We were told they could not diagnose it today and had to make an appointment to come back and have it diagnosed.... What? What was the point of not being able to make an appointment on the phone if we had to _drive_ there and be told to come back for an appointment for the diagnosis?

In any case, we did as we were asked. We brought the truck back in on December 16th, 2015 to service advisor Randi Martin. After some hours of leaving the truck there and having to drive back again to pick it up, still unfixed, Randi told us that they needed to order a part and they would call us in about a week. A couple of weeks go by with no news and then I have to leave town on business. When I get back, I go back to Allen Samuels on January 25th and speak to Evan who has no idea what I am talking about and says the part was never ordered. Great. Not only was the problem not fixed, but the service technician, Christopher Farmer, did not even note what was broken during his diagnosis. I will have to come back, _again_, for a diagnosis. Evan told me to come back tomorrow at 9:30am and he would have someone diagnose it as soon as possible.

On January 26th, I brought my brand new truck back in to the dealer for the sixth time. Evan, who made an appointment with me at 9:30am, did not show up until 11:00am. I asked Evan, ""I thought you said 9:30?"", to which he replied ""I... I did. Something came up."" Indeed.

Eventually someone did diagnose my truck and found out that the heater seat module was installed in the way of the seat track. When the seat moved back and forth, it cut through the wires and the wires grounded out on the seat frame. Nice. Sounds like a fire hazard. In any case, Evan says they will order the part and he will put ""special handling"" on it and it would be 2-3 days and he would give me a call by the latest Monday, February 1 to come back in and get the part installed. Here it is Tuesday, February 2nd with no phone call. I have called the dealer twice today and have not been able to speak to anyone, including the service manager who apparently “has someone in his office” so he can’t address my concerns.

If you value your time and your sanity, you will stay away from this mess of a service department.

209,"February 23, 2014","I recently purchased a RAM 1500 Laramie Longhorn from the Allen Samuels dealership. My experience with the Allen Samuels team was exceptional. I spoke to Marcus Ward initially. He was very responsive to my phone calls and immediately placed me in the hands of A.J. Johnson. A.J. was continuously patient and continued to make sure my every question was answered to my satisfaction. He created a very comfortable, professional relationship from the very beginning of the discussions to when I was driving away in my new truck. When I had very specific finance questions, A.J. introduced me to Leslie Cooper. She provided excellent financial support in answering questions for which I needed answers. As the consideration for my options broadened, David Rhoten became more involved. I had worked with David on my previous truck purchase in 2012. He, as he did in 2012, did not give up on looking for truck options that would work for me, with both the type of truck and financial options. He is top notch. For the final decision, I was left with two options. The two trucks were pulled up by the showroom floor where I could spend as much time as I needed to evaluate both options. I did take a while, but I was provided all the time I needed. Once I decided, Hossain Hessari handled the financial paperwork with ease, professionalism, and in an expedited manner. I will summarize this account as I started; the Allen Samuels team was just that, a team. From the beginning of the discussion to the end of the transaction this Allen Samuel's team was at my disposal. Nice job!

When I got back to the dealership to sign the paperwork, not only was my new payment less than my current car payment, but Leslie and Clint also worked to arrange for some additional benefits for me!  They must be miracle workers!!!  Leslie and Clint represented me very well to the finance institutions and now I am saving on gas and on car payments in my new Fiat!  I love my car, love my payments, love saving on gas, and LOVE Allen Samuels for helping to make it all possible.  I would HIGHLY recommend them to anyone looking for a vehicle.  Thank you so much Allen Samuels!  I am one very happy customer!!!

230,"August 13, 2012",I was very pleased with the way Ted handled our transaction.  He was very knowledgeable and not pushy when he sold us our Chrysler 200.  He let us take it home over the weekend so we could compare other cars in the area.  Great job!!,5.0

233,"June 19, 2012","After a few ""hiccups"" during my purchase experience (nothing major at all, but I'm a perfectionist) I almost chose to go to the people who usually service my car.  Then I decided that the hiccups weren't too bad so I'd give the service department a try.  Michael met me at my car smiling and ready to help me choose the correct services I needed for my mileage.  I had a visor clip that had cracked and I had already ordered a replacement and asked if I got the piece from the parts department if they would install it for me.  He was more than happy to do it...for no charge.  It was before 8, so I told him I'd get the part for him as soon as they opened.  He told me that they'd go over and get it, not to worry.  They had a very nice air conditioned waiting room with complimentary coffee and vending machines. Their courtesy driver noticed my Starbucks cup, and asked if I'd like him to take me for a refill since no one else needed anything.  When my car was finished, Michael explained the ticket to me (not that it was necessary, their tickets explain what all the services were for) I used a promotional ticket to get a car wash for $1.  When I went out to get in my car, I was amazed.  It looked more like a detailing job than just a wash.  I almost just drove out of the parking lot high on my good luck, but I wanted someone to know how fabulous the service department was.  I went in the main building and asked to speak to a manager or assistant manager who was over the entire operation.  The General Manager, Ted, ,met with me immediately, not even knowing what I wanted.  I let him know the service department had just saved him a customer with their superb, over-and-above service and told him about my hiccups during purchasing.  He had already become aware that that department was making too many errors and closed it.  I will reccommend this dealership to everyone.  If you are looking for a new or used car, or service Allen Samuels Dodge Chrysler, Jeep Ram is the place to go!",5.0
234,"June 07, 2012",We appreciated the customer service we received at Allen Samuels in Waco. It was not a high pressured sales environment like many dealerships. They answered the questions we had and then let us freely go and browse the inventory. We ended up trading our vehicle for another used vehicle and they graciously worked to get the payment that we had originally requested. The new dealership on HWY 6 & 84 is a comfortable and cool environment with many helpful employees. ,5.0
235,"May 17, 2012","I would strongly recommend Allen Samuels Dodge to everyone. I was so impressed at the professionalism, availability and response from my sales person BJ. Our initial communication was via phone where I shared with him what I was looking for and within less than 30 minutes he called me back with some options and pricing. After meeting with BJ in person and spending some time in the dealership I felt at home! Everyone is the dealership was extremely friendly to both me the buyer and my 6 year old daughter and mother.  Even though I am almost 40 years old my safety is still the number one concern for my mother. BJ was very thorough in educating us on the safety features for my vehicle and the longevity of the vehicle. Allen Samuels Dodge drove more than 200 miles to bring me the exact vehicle I wanted. The exact color and features.  It was just like I had created the vehicle from scratch and they FILLED the order perfectly! I was very impressed with the management team at the dealership. BJ's manager, David was very involved and available to me throughout the process.  
David helped me work with pricing to achieve an affordable vehicle.  I was given a good trade value for my vehicle. ",5.0

238,"May 14, 2012","I went to Allen Samuels looking for an affordable and dependable used car.  After my initial visit, it appeared that my financing would not go through, so I returned home with a promise from Orlando (my salesman), that he would continue to look into other options and vehicles to fit my needs.

A few weeks later, I received a phone call from Orlando letting me know that he worked something out with the finance department and had also found some very nice vehicles within my search criteria.  I went to the dealership that same day, and that evening drove home in my ""New Used"" Jeep!  I love it!  He really made me feel like I was priority and not just another customer.  I appreciate everything he and the dealership did for me!  They are by far the most customer friendly dealership around!",5.0

243,"April 09, 2012","My truck has 100,000 mile powertrain warranty. It was taken in at 30,000 miles for rearend noise and pinion seal was pouring oil. Pinion seal was replaced oil was topped off. At 45,000 miles rearend is howling and making noise. Service advisor said it wouldn't be warranty because they found water in rear end. They stated that the water probably didn't get in it when the seal was out so there will be no warranty. However the oil was NOT checked just topped off. Service manager recommended that I turn it in to insurance and they would fix it. ",1.6
244,"September 06, 2011",I took my truck in for some service work and a recall to be fix but could not get waited on. The service writer walked pass me three times waiting on people that come in after me finilly after the fourth trip he stoped and ask if I have been waited on and then told me to go inside and someone would help me in a little while. This is the same problem I had with the old WACO DODGE a very bad service department. I will keep driving a little farther to get better service at a better dealership.,1.7
245,"August 11, 2011","During the processing of the purchase the price changed,and the service department has a about 2-4hour wait time each time I went to add my upgrades...document everything when doing business with Allen samuals jeep ",3.0
246,"April 29, 2010","We had traveled an hour to look at Ram 1500 Quad Cabs. After using their internet department we were given a pretty good price, better than anywhere else by several hundred dollars on same vehicle. We worked out all of the deal, trade value, and options. We wanted to continue to look and were awaiting the title of our vehicle we own outright for several weeks. During that time we considered other options at their dealership on similar vehicle (color, upgrades, etc), but were thinking about buying more vehicle and trusted them since we had already been treated pretty well. After going back and forth with Wendy for 2-3 weeks, we finally received an email from her stating that she felt it pointless to look for different vehicles and that she was done vesting any time into our deal. Im sorry, but if I told customers that I couldnt work for them to earn their business they would take it somewhere else, what a crock. In the end we decided that we might have found our best deal on the original vehicle we had looked at on their lot. So, after submitting for financing we were more than a bit shocked at the final details. The finance department called to tell us that the selling price of the vehicle had gone up by a few hundred dollars, and that the trade value of our vehicle had gone down by $500. After speaking to Wendy about the APR (5.9%), which is ok, but we have excellent credit we wanted a lower rate, which we had discussed with her in person, she said let me see what I can do. She comes back on the phone in less than a minute and says done deal. Seems fishy, that they didnt offer us the lower rate initially. And if not mistaken in the State of Texas, dealerships can add as much as 3% to interest rates obtained from lenders and are quite certain that this was the case at Allen Samuels Waco. We had asked for one dealer installed option through them especially when the price seemed like a decent deal. Funny though, in the end that number went up by almost 20% when all was said and done, then funny again, I speak to the sales manager and he tells me that it was actually less than what they had quoted by 20%. Which is it, are you just selling parts at astronomical mark ups or what, they should communicate better amongst themselves. Overall they make me a bit leary, just keep one eye on their team, and the other eye on the first available exit......youre gonna need it.",2.5
