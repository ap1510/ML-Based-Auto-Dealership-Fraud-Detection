wear on them that was promised at the tire center where purchased.  They are aware, my vehicle
is my ""office on wheels"" and I felt very fortunate to have them watching out for my welfare. ",5.0

Love my Yukon, definitely a KEEPER!!!
Your service and parts department did a few tweaks for me.  A great, efficient, helpful, professional crew!  From purchase through the tweaks.  All of the people I dealt with did exactly what they said they would, and when they said they would!!!
They have earned two return customers!  My hubby will be bringing his vehicle to you if and when it requires service also!!!
Thank you making the complete experience as painless and convenient as possible.  You made us both feel that OUR time was valuable also.
We WILL be seeing you, thanks again folks!",5.0

Was highley stressed walking onto the lot, but, was put and put at ease almost immediately by our Sales Pro Ken Elmore (he was also, quite informative and helpful about my vehicle).  The entire team were professional, patient, polite and ""down to earth"".  All the pro's were very good when leading and assisting us through the steps for our purchase.  I came in with my ""little blue"" 2005 Ranger-Driven by me for 9yrs&8mo.  I took a ""Big Red Baby"", Yukon home, starting a NEW, I feel, will be a long relationship.  Thank you Gabriel/Jordan BUICK, GMC for a comfortable, low stress, no pressure, and pleasant experience!  I needed this!",5.0

20,"January 16, 2020",I was looking for a specific car (2017 LaCrosse Essence) to replace one that was totaled. I had exhausted the dealership inventories in the D-FW area where I lived. I ran across Gabriel/Jordan Buick on the Internet. When I called I was blessed to meet Chuck Pinson in sales. Sounded like they had what I was looking for. I was so impressed with his knowledge and helpfulness (he wanted to find what I  wanted instead of trying to just sell me what they had on the lot - the way I had been handled in many dealerships) that I changed my itinerary and made Gabriel/Jordan my first stop that day. Turned out to be my last stop as I was very pleased with what they had to offer and the fair price. I bought my car there.,5.0

24,"December 25, 2019","I have never had a problem before, but this time I was not satisfied at all. when I bought my vehicle, mike my salesman told me when I brought it back, it would be detailed because it was dirty inside and out when I bought it and took it home. I ask for an oil change, tire rotation and for the vehicle to be detailed. all was completed except the detail. it didn't even get a good wash job on the outside and the inside had hardly been touched. so, haley ask johnny to clean it up a little better and he did touch it up some, but still not clean at all.
I have been trading with Gabriel serveral years now and this is the first problem I have ever had.

85,"July 23, 2019","DO NOT TRUST GABRIEL/JORDAN SERVICE DEPARTMENT!!
I find a car online (2011 Jaguar XF with 92,000 miles on it) Go and test drive it at the dealership in kilgore) I noticed the car jerking when stopping so I brought it back to them and they assured me they would take a look at it. They did and as you can see in the images provided Niki (Internet Sales) told me that the ""Brakes are fine"" Matt in customer service told me that ""all Jaguars do that"" so I also mentioned that they were squealing. And was again told ""they were fine"" So here i am, 6 weeks later dealing with same squealing brakes, same jerking as i come to a stop and now I was fed up with it and took it to 2 local shops and told the Upper and Lower control arms are bad and the rotors are lipped and all need replaced. Approximately $2,000 dollars in repairs due to it being a Jaguar.. So I call and speak to Matt (Service Manager) he tells me i need to talk to Jason (general sales manager) Jason tells me, ""Well when you buy a used car your going to have to make some repairs"" ARE YOU SERIOUS? A issue that I was lied to about it being ""fine"" from the get go your not going to stand behind?  he also stated "" I know your frustrated because you purchased a vehicle 6 weeks ago and you have to fix it and put money into it but there's nothing i can do"" I'm sure not many people read these reviews but if i can change one persons mind from coming here I've accomplished my goal.

148,"December 11, 2018","Decided to buy a GMC Canyon in mid-2018.  Discovered some of the safety features I really wanted were unavailable on that year model.  Had shopped with several dealerships but Gabriel Jordan was the only one that offered to special order me a 2019 Canyon exactly to my specifications and at a competitive price to boot. 

The special order came off the line in record time (about 4 weeks) but GM had transportation problems (no fault of Gabriel Jordan) and my truck was ""stuck"" in St. Louis, MO.  Gabriel Jordan sales and management (Chuck Pinson and Tim Capps) decided it had been too long and at the expense of Gabriel Jordan sent a transport to pick up my truck.  It arrived exactly to my specifications and I am so happy with it.

Chuck Pinson my sales rep was very understanding when I called to check on delivery.  He kept me informed as we waited.  Tim Capps (Dealer Principal) was involved in the process every step of the way.  Both made me feel like a special customer throughout the entire sales and delivery process.  

I really appreciate the extra effort put forth by the entire Gabriel Jordan team:  Tim, Chuck, Chris, Paula, and Danny.  All have gone above and beyond to provide me with outstanding customer service for many years.

Chris the manager took the call.  When I told him the situation, his IMMEDIATE response was, ""we'll bring you a loaner"".  And they did.  He and Danny brought the loaner to me.  I couldn't believe it!  The best I was hoping for was to tell him I was going to have it towed to the service center and would be in the next day.  No, Chris went so above and beyond to personally bring me a car.  It is hard to put a price on this kind of service.  I am so thankful to be a Gabriel Jordan customer.

I explained that I was located 2 hours away with the competing dealership only 5 miles from me. He assured me that he would have the vehicle ready to test drive and as much of the paperwork as could be completed at the time would be. 

When my husband and I arrived, the vehicle was ready and waiting. After test driving, I knew for sure it was the vehicle for me. Zach made sure the paperwork was effortless. The financing agent, Andy, was able to get us the lowest interest rate we have ever had, beating a previous rate of 5.7%.
