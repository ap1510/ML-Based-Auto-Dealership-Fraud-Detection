2,"February 13, 2020","On December 31, 2019, I purchased a pre-owned diesel vehicle from Jaguar Land Rover North Houston dealership located at 18205 Interstate 45 N, Houston, Texas 77090.  A couple of days later, the check engine light came on.  I returned it to the dealership on January 7, 2020 to address the issue.  The issue persisted after several attempts to fix it, the problem got worse because the vehicle started severely overheating.  In the meantime, I discovered that on January 2, 2020, the Jaguar Land Rover North Houston dealership had used a different vehicle(s) to pass the state inspection (to obtain the tags) at its dealership twice for the vehicle I purchased while the vehicle was NOT at the dealership; it was still in my possession:

1.	The first vehicle state inspection was performed on 1/2/2020 between 12:40 pm and 12:45 pm for “emission” using a different vehicle that passed, with flying colors, for the vehicle I purchased as a gasoline vehicle while it is diesel (the vehicle I purchased was NOT at the dealership at the time of the inspection, it was in my possession). 
2.	The second vehicle state inspection was performed right after on 1/2/2020 between 12:46 pm and 12:48 pm for “safety” using a different vehicle that also passed for the vehicle I purchased as a diesel which the vehicle I purchases is (the vehicle I purchased was NOT at the dealership at the time of the inspection, it was in my possession).

It appears that the check engine light was deliberately reset prior to the sell.  Otherwise, why would Jaguar Land Rover North Houston dealership use another(s) vehicle(s) the pass the state inspection of my vehicle while it wasn’t at the dealership?  When I made the general manager aware of the fraud, he brushed it off.",1.0

6,"November 08, 2016","I visited this dealership to inquire about a used Lexus.  When I arrived , we drove the car.  Sat to talk about price, and the asking price increased $1,000.00.  I pulled up the email, showing the price, but when you clicked the link, the price had increased by $1,000.00.  Then on top of that, they added on these other fees for other services, that you have to pay.  Some dealer services fee, to fix stains and scratched rims.  You cannot decline the dealer services thing.  You have to purchase it, if you want to purchase a car.  Essentially they are forcing you to buy a product with their used cars, regardless if you want to decline.  ",1.3
7,"August 14, 2016","After struggling to get online feedback about offers and specific vehicles on their web site, I went in person; was met by the sales manager after walking around floor room for 10 minutes but he said he was too ""slammed"" to help me.  He walked up to 3 different salesmen in their offices, none of whom had any customers with them, and they all told him they were too busy to help me.    I hung out another 10 minutes before a salesman approached me.  He showed me a car I liked from their web site, that had a lease offer from Jaguar, and he said he would email me the lease offers that afternoon and we could meet the next day to sign the deal.  The lease offers were all at least 2X higher than the offer on their web site, and when confronted with this, they said this was a much nicer car and $9,000 more than the one in the ad.  However, the ad had the same stock number and VIN number as the one I drove, but they didn't want to honor that price or lease offer.    A second salesman called me after my visit and said he had been the one to email me a few days before my visit with the pricing on a different car, and he was upset I dealt with a new salesman at the dealership (even though he had no name in his 1 email and never called me), so they fought and got the manager to agree to a split commission.  I believe this is why they were quoting me a much higher rate.  They then said Chase had me at ""Tier 2"" credit around 694 so the price was higher.   My scores from the three bureaus ranged from 720 to 765 with all other creditors in the last month.   To make sure I was not crazy, I went to a second Jag dealer in Houston and their offer was normal and in line with the national lease offer, and would have been $0 down and $500/month less than this Jag North dealership for the same F Type. And there I was Tier I.   I ended up getting a Maserati after the experience with Jag Houston North.   I won't blame the salesman, who was nice, but maybe the sales culture.   Good luck if you go here, and be prepared for shenannigans on pricing.",1.3

10,"November 15, 2012",I went in looking at a used corvette. My fiance and I were planning on trading both our cars in for the vette. They lowballed us on our first trade in and said that they do not negotiate. the manager then told us to bring the other car in and he would work something out. when doing so they again lowballed us and said they would not budge on the number they came up with. Huge waste of time. Brought my business elsewhere and was treated much better. I will never do business with this dealership again. ,1.0
11,"November 15, 2012","Having been treated like a second class citizen at the local BMW dealer, I finally headed over to Land Rover. I purchased my Sport from Garry. He was the most attentive salesman I have ever worked with. I must say I am glad, because the range rover turned out to be even more spectacular than I had heard. My first service with Al turned out to be equally Impressive. He was truly amazing.",5.0
12,"October 27, 2012","We bought a used car in March and was delighted with the Sales team.  We purchased the extended warranty at that time.  The warranty had a $250 deductible.  We had the car in for service in June for minor repairs and paid the deductible.  In August the car was again taken in for service, the seatbelt sensor would not turn off, and the air was having to go about 3 cycles to get the AC to blow through the vent.  At this visit the seat belt was installed and the service department found no issues with the air. They said it was just that it was a Lincoln and they sometimes did this. We paid the deductible. We took the car back when the seatbelt would not latch and the air was still giving parttime service (intermittant problem).  In October the car overheated when the air was turned on.  We took the car in for service.  They replaced the radiator fan module but still the air was not working properly.  Although they were told the AC was messed up, this was not designated or looked into on the service report.  The service report does list that the AC is what prompted the issue. The deductible was paid again. The AC quit blowing through the dash on the 19th of October after having been serviced on the 13th.  Once again going to the dealership!! At this time the service representative stated that we shouldn't have to pay the deductible since it was the same problem, but that he had to check with his manager. He also said that it was probably the actuators and that they would have to send it to the lincoln dealer since the entire dash had to be removed.  8 days later, and 4 days of insurance for the rental, the car was ready and waiting for the deductible to be paid by US at the Lincoln dealer.  They would gladly give us a ride after we returned the loaner they supplied when we complained about having to pay for the insurance on the rental.  But the service manager did not feel it was Jaguar North's responsibility, since they could never duplicate the problem.  How from a Service standpoint is it our fault that their mechanics are not able to diagnose or fix the mechanical issues? Isn't this what a mechanic does? The Sales side of this dealership is great!!!  The service department is not!!!  The issue here is the integrity of the service department standing behind their word and being thorough with their work.  We did pick up the car from the Lincoln dealer, paid the deductible, and found out it was in fact the actuators that needed replaced.  It took a few hours--Not 8 days.",1.6
13,"October 02, 2012","They let me drive 2.5hrs only to give me an ultimatum price with no wiggle room and they COMPLETELY lowballed me on my trade in that happens to be a fairly hot commodity these days(2008 Toyota Sienna)

Why not tell me what they would give on trade before I drove so they did waste my time and money.

I was insulted and had to walk.

14,"May 15, 2012",Great experience. First repair to my Jag that was less painful than the dentist. Charlie is a former technician who really knows how to explain the issues. Everyone is very friendly and they fixed it correctly. I ll probably buy my next one here as well. ,5.0
15,"April 19, 2012",Well..... I have not even purchased a car yet and I am already getting the run around. Anthony will not return phone calls. They told me they had a car that was advertised on the internet and when I got to the dealership they did not have the car and would not have it for four more days. They acted like I was lucky they waited on me. I get the idea they could care less if they sell me a car or not. I it was for not for the fact that they have the car I want I would go some where else. And...I have not had to deal with the service department yet. By the way who owns this dealership...they don't seem to be doing anything about this bad rep....,1.5

17,"February 19, 2012","Earlier this month (February 2012) I purchased a new 2011 Jaguar XF-R.  My Sales Consultant was Nikki Mojica. I originally went to the dealership to test drive a 2010 XK-R and Nikki was more than happy to oblige.  During my test drive Nikki was extremely knowledgeable about the car and answered each and every question.  She was very pleasant and I truly appreciated the time she took to make sure all my questions were answered.  I found her to be very pleasant and not at all the stereotype ""pushy"" salesperson.  At the end of my test drive I decided that this vehicle was just not for me. Granted it was a beautiful vehicle but I was looking for the ultimate smooth ride with a ""get up and go"" engine.  Upon returning to the dealership I informed Nikki of my decision.  She was pleasant just as she had been during the test drive and informed me that she had a 2011 XF-R which had the same engine as the XK-R, same color inside and out and because of the vehicle type perhaps the ride would be more suitable.  Well, to make a long story short, she was right and I am now the owner of a 2011 XF-R.  If anybody has ever bought a vehicle before, you know that picking out the car is the easy part.  Well I was equally as impressed by New Car Sales Manager Frank Reed.  I found Frank to be extremely personable, the smart business type and a real professional and a credit to his industry.  I informed Frank that I didn't have to buy a car; however, I would not turn down a great deal.  Literally, two minutes later, I had a sheet of paper in my hand with what was even a better deal than I expected.  What I thought would be the finance nightmare was next.  Again, I was wrong.  The Finance Director Frank Pecka basically ""took care of me"".  I had contacted a bank and had obtained an exceptional rate on an auto loan.  I informed Frank of the percentage rate I had been quoted and asked if it were possible for him to obtain a better rate.  I think I was equally impressed when Pecka returned with a better rate.  My experience with him was just as delightful.  I cannot speak for any of the other sales consultants, managers, or finance personnel at Jaguar Houston North; but I highly recommend the three individuals who I worked with.  Sales Consultant Nikki Mojica, New Car Sales Manager Frank Reed, and Finance Director Frank Pecka made my new car purchase experience a pleasant one.  I am not naive enough to believe that they were just being nice to sell me a car, but I believe their degree of professionalism and demeanor were genuine.  If anyone is looking to buy at this dealership, please make sure to ask for this trio, and I guarantee you will not be disappointed.",5.0
18,"August 09, 2011","Service department completed oil and oil filter change.  Car driven less than 30 miles after serviced on 8/5/2011/ I drove car to church (within 3-5 miles).  Heard noise under car/ thought I had a flat tire. Discovered panel on ground. Hanging by one bolt, apparently, bolts were missing and released panel.  I told both, Service and Joe, I felt the service department was negligent in securing the panel.  And if panel was already cracked, it should have been brought to my attention when serviced.  Per Joe Benske/ Manager, was not necessary to remove panel at front of vehicle to change oil. Panel was already cracked on each side.  Joe Beneske, requested tow truck to pick up car from house. I agreed.  Next day contacted Service, 9:50Am, still waiting for that return call.  Finally Joe Benske called back to inform me that I had a beautiful car, very well taken care of,  however, they added the missing bolts to panel and yes, there are crack in panel, but it is drivable.  My 2006 Jag has less than 35,000 miles; I have serviced and taken care of my car, why would I want to drive my Jag in this condition?  Better still why would this dealership recommend that a customer drive this Jag in the broken condition?    I had to ask for the cost to replace this broken panel.  No one suggested or was pro active in restoring this vehicle to good condition.  This indicated to me that they wanted to get me out of the dealership in such a hurry to validate their claim of non negligence.  I disagree; the service department was negligent in performing the service function and did not properly secure the panel, therefore causing it to drop and further break and crack.  I want restoration of my now defective car.  Thank you, Verlis Adams ",2.2
19,"May 29, 2011","My husband and I were very happy with our car buying experience at this dealership. I have bought several new cars and I would rate this as being the most pleasurable new car buying experience I have had. Our sales person, Nikki, was extremely knowledgeable about all the features of the car, was very easy to negotiate with so that we did not feel like we were ""haggling with a car salesman."" I think she did a fantastic job and I would not hesitate to recommend her. ",5.0
20,"March 29, 2011","I owned (and sold) a Jaguar S-Type “R”. Like others have stated, you will be very lucky if you get a return call from the service department in a timely manner. I had one issue with the car where they took 11 weeks (total time) to attempt to solve the issue and NEVER got resolved. The technicians are not mechanics, but parts swappers, who keep changing out parts until the problem stops. If your car has an extended warranty the dealership will be looking for extra ways to generate income (e.g…changing out unnecessary items). I’ve had items taken from the car, and in addition, almost every time I get the car back there is a ¼ to ½ a tank of gas missing. I had them start to document the fuel level when I dropped the car off for service. Save yourself some grief and find another auto dealer.",2.4
21,"January 14, 2011","I have been a customer for many years and this was the worst experience ever!  My 2010 Jag was in for service on December 14, 2010 for several hours so I waited.  When I came home...my house key was missing.  I called Jaguar and spoke to Al.  He said he would look for it and call me back.  I had to call back to check the status.  He did not find the key and continued to tell me that no one here took it.  I asked to speak to the manager, Tim.  He suggested that I bring my house key to him and he would make me a copy.  He was totally missing the point.  I was concerned that someone had my key and access to my home.  Tim said that this has never happened before and it will never happen!  I asked for him to pay to have my house re-keyed and he said he would need to speak to the GM who was out of town until Monday.  I waited for Tim to call on Monday...no call.  I called Jason the GM on Tuesday and left a message...no return call.  Today is January 5th, 2011 and I have not heard from Jaguar.  I will not return to this dealership or refer anyone to them as well.",1.8
22,"December 08, 2010","my husband visited this dealership 3 months ago and was helped by salesperdson NIKKI MOJICA.  she gave him so much info concerning the XJ-he was thoroughly impressed.  We
returned today and purchased the top of the line Jaguar XJ supersport - absolutely beautiful car, primarily due to information provided by Nikki.  The entire staff there are just great.  Super friendly and helpful.  Thanks so much.   ",5.0
23,"August 17, 2010","This was a great experience with the staff and it went extremely well with our salesperson (Nikki Mojica).  We purchase a used 05 Benz CLK 320.  The 3.5 hour drive was worth it.  Although, the staff was busy with customers, the outprocessing was reasonable.  The was ready for delivery.  My wife and I would suggest this to anyone.",5.0
24,"July 29, 2010","The ""Great"" ratings above relate directly to the sales person, Nikki Mojica, only.  She worked closely with us regarding the very specific car that I wanted.  She found one at another dealership and had it shipped over on the same day. She was patient and friendly throughout the process.  She ""worked"" with us on the price of the car as well.

However, since the purchase of the car, I have had difficulty in getting the Service Department staff to attend to my needs.  They do not return calls right away, not even within a day or two.  I have to keep calling and leaving messages.  I am not used to this type of bad customer service since I had a Lexus before, and their Service Reps are on top of things. They would always return my calls within the hour, unlike the Jaguar Service Department people. They always had a smile on their face and you could hear it in their voice when I spoke with them over the phone.  The Jaguar Service Department people at this location need some Customer Service training.",5.0
25,"July 13, 2010","Absolutely the worst car dealership that I have ever dealt with. I was legitimately astonished at how poorly the staff there conducted themselves. It was almost as if they were trying every way they could to make me not want to buy the car they had for sale. Here are two of the many things that they did to me and will do to you if you try to purchase a vehicle from them.

1. Never call you back. Their sales department is awful about calling back when they say they will, and that is assuming you are lucky enough for them to actually follow through with their statements and call you back. You may ask to speak to a manager because the salesman is so awful, but don't expect to speak to the manager because the salesmen will ignore and block your calls from even the main dealership phone lines to save their own incompetent hides.

2. Throw in tons of hidden fees. I negotiated and finally came to an agreement with the salesman, Anthony, that we would pay $20,000 plus tax, title, and license. When the paperwork arrived, there was $240 extra for the ""Phantom"" theft deterrent as well as another $500 for ""dealer expenses."" After two disconnections and being put on terminal hold, I was finally able to reach them to tell them to take off the Phantom and explain the dealer expenses. They replied that they incur these costs on all vehicles and cannot/will not remove them. BTW the $500 dealer expenses were accounted to detailing the car and changing the oil (Bullspit). They were rude and decided to lose the sale and my business over $740 worth of charges that I never asked for and they never told me about until I noticed that they snuck it in with the final paperwork.

PLEASE, FOR THE SAKE OF YOURSELF AND THE SAKE OF THE MONEY YOU SPEND, DO NOT PURCHASE A VEHICLE FROM THIS DEALERSHIP. I promise you will regret it and end up in a position similar to mine and the other reviewers.",1.4
26,"July 05, 2010","Excellent service. I recommend that if you want a Jaguar or Land Rover go to them. I was and am very impressed with their professionalism and service. My husband and I were able to get the car that we wanted coupled with obtaining first class service from our sales person, Nikki, and the finance person, Roy. We truly loved our experience.",5.0
27,"June 21, 2010","On Saturday, June 12, 2010, I called Land Rover Jaguar Houston North to inquire about used Range Rovers in stock.  I spoke with Nikki Mojica who was extremely professional and patient with me and answered all of my questions.  At the end of the telephone call, Ms. Mojica stated she would call me back if she was able to locate a Range Rover that met my specifications.  Within one hour, Ms. Mojica called back to advise that there was a vehicle in stock at Land Rover Jaguar Houston North available for purchase.  On this same day, I visited the dealership and met with Ms. Mojica who accompanied me on the test drive.  During and after the test drive, Ms. Mojica took the time to show me all features of the vehicle which aided in my selection of this vehicle for purchase.  I did not anticipate purchasing the vehicle on this day, but due to the pricing and mileage, and most importantly, the patience, dedication, and professionalism of Ms. Mojica, I purchased the vehicle. 

I would recommend Land Rover Jaguar Houston North to potential buyers and would recommend that they request Nikki Mojica as a sales consultant!

28,"June 06, 2010",It was a pleasure dealing with Nikki. She was very knowledgable and responsive. She wasn't the stereotypical pushy salesperson. She listened to what we were looking for in a new vehicle and found us exactly what we wanted. Most importantly she was very honest and forthright in the negotiation process and didn't make it feel like a game.  It seemed more like a partnership in trying to reach the same goal and we truly appreciated the professionalism and integrity she demonstrated. ,5.0
29,"May 24, 2010","I recently bought a well used Jeep at Jaguar Houston North and I was very impressed with how I was treated. I was not buying an expensive car (probably the cheapest car on the lot) but they treated me like I was. I have bought cars at other dealerships and have even worked at various dealerships during college and so I have seen the way different dealerships are ran. The way customers are treated can always be traced back to management. A great management team sets the good example and then trains their staff on how to treat customers. I would highly recommend Anthony, Frank, and Roy to anyone and I hope to purchase a car from them in the future.  Hopefully next time a Jaguar!",5.0

She was also FUN and seemed genuinely excited for me! I feel like a real part of the family.  ,5.0
31,"February 28, 2010","A really good overall experience, I knew what I wanted and Steve helped me so much. I think I will always buy from him and tell my friends about him too. The fact that Steve knew his product and was not pushy was also a decideing factor, very low pressure. Thanks Steve!",5.0

33,"January 26, 2010",From day one the service I received was the greatest. Carson Bryant our salesperson was very informative and helpful in finding the car we were looking for. Through the whole processing until final signing he was there to answer questions we had. He followed up with several phone calls to make sure we were satisfied with the car and if we had any questions. When I brought the car in for some repairs I spoke with Frank Freeze who was very helpful getting the repairs done in a timely manner. My car was ready for pickup as promised. I am very satisfied with the salesperson and the service writer I have worked with and I will recommend this dealership to all my friends.,5.0

37,"December 01, 2009","Had a great experience with Patrick.   He showed me the car, never tried to push anything at me, and came accross as honest as any car salesman I have been involved with.  He figured out quickly that I was seriously interested and kept following up with solid information.   There was a point when he menioned that he is not sure if this deal would be offered if we wait until December(have heard that before) but it came accross as if he meant it and not just givig me a line.  The key was the dealership made a fair offer and as much as I hate to play the game it kept me from chasing any other deal.   I have had two Lexus sedans recently and my Lexus salesman did not follow up with me and the Audi dealership where I stopped in twice had every chance to just once follow up and they didnt.  Patrick did follow up in a non-intrusive way and he got the deal done.   He even offered to follow me to my house so I could take the car home the day I signed.  Good Job.",5.0

Carson was better than the other salesman, but the car's each had the same mileage and price...the only difference were those that I listed.

I rate this dealership high mostly because of its employee, CARSON BRYANT. He has been simply exceptional.
My husband & I first met Carson in January 2008 at his initial dealership, Land Rover Houston (Old Katy road). We purchased a 2008 Range Rover HSE. Carson was helpful in not only the purchasing process but in the after-sales services. He scheduled time to come over to our home to conduct a quick 101 on the basic use of the features and setting up the bluetooth functionality with our phones.
In September 2009 when we decided to upgrade to the 2010 model, we sought Carson. Even though he had moved to a dealership 45 mins away from our home, we felt very comfortable going there to clinch the deal. As was expected, we received the same exceptional service.",5.0

I am recommending to my partners that their next purchase be from this dealership.",5.0

45,"May 31, 2009",My whole experience from start to finish was impressive to say the least. The salesman was not high-pressure at all & was more than willing to work with me in getting the car sold. Follow up service is professional & courteous.By the way--I love my 2005 Jaguar XJR!,5.0
46,"May 29, 2009","I purchased a used Jaguar XJR approximately two weeks ago.  My experience was seamless and swift.  Each employee made me feel as if I was the only customer they were going to see that day.  My mother accompanied me to finalize the purchase and after completing the sale she told me that she had never had fun purchasing a vehicle, but that she really enjoyed being at the dealership.  I concur with her statement as well.",4.8
47,"May 19, 2009","My experience at Jaguar North Houston was fantastic because the atmosphere was fantastic there, the people were all very nice and helpful and they didn't try to give me a deal i didn't want on the car I bought. Juan wanted to get to know who I am as a person and didn't see me as just another sale.",5.0
48,"April 25, 2009",From start to Finish the process was far better than any car buying experience I have ever had. Marlon Young was my sales representative. He made sure all of our questions were answered and took the time to make sure we were comfortable in our purchase. Buying a new car can be a daunting experience but I cannot express enough how pleasant and low pressure this was. I will recommend Jaguar Houston North to everyone I know that is looking for a vehicle.,5.0
49,"March 30, 2009","When dealing with my saleswoman at Jaguar I was so impressed. I felt like my needs were being met and that I as a customer was being treated fairly. The customer service by Nikki was outstanding. I am always looking for the greatest deal I can get and that is what I got with Nikki. No matter how many times I would come back with a counter offer she would some how manage to get it to the price I wanted with all the details I wanted in my vehicle. I would recommend her to any of my friends that were interested in buying a vehicle. I am very impressed with the respect and genuine care of this dealership and my salesperson.

50,"March 30, 2009","After a pleasant offer to assist, Stuart Adams promptly escorted me to view the previously owned vehicles desired. Waiting briefly, Stewart returned to the showroom to retrieve the keys for the two vehicles selected. Following a test drive the choice made, we returned to the showroom to negotiate. Stuart asked where I wanted to be price wise. We then worked together to accomplish that goal. Well done Stuart.
Thanks,

55,"March 23, 2009","Angela was very polite and couldn't do enough for us when we came to pruchase our car, even met me off site to go over the car specifics as the day we took possession we had to leave before all this could be done. She has also followed up on a regular basis and has proven to be one of the best sales persons I have ever dealt with.

56,"March 23, 2009","This is my first car with Jaguar. I had a very good experience in dealing with Angela. I met her in responding to an ""XF"" over the internet then after a couple of weeks I went to the dealer to look at their inventory. Angela was very professional but not pushy. I would rate her as a 5 for new car sales. She even called me when she was in training from out of town. ",4.8
57,"March 14, 2009","AJ was very easy to deal with even though we lived a state away.  He not only met us on the price; he met us halfway across the states so we didn't have to make the entire drive to get our new vehicle!

62,"February 04, 2009","After leaving all my contact information with all 3 Jag dealers via their website one Sunday evening I was surprised only one dealer responded to my request for someone me to call me.  Jaguar Houston North called the very next morning to followup on my request about their cars. The phone call was pleasant, the information useful, agreed upon a time to meet and that evening I bought a new car. From the time I entered the show room until I left with the keys in my pocket, I'd have say how pleasantly surprised I was at how smooth the whole experience evolved.  This dealer is really on top of their game, they understand both the product they are trying to deliver and the customer, excellent product knowledge and superior customer service. Their level of commitment to provide customer satisfaction would be comparable to the folks in Vegas, both genuinely want to please the customer. The whole experience was top notch ie;  friendly, professional and no pressure to close the deal. I might add they even stayed passed normal closing hours to finalize everything in one visit.  Am I happy? Yes! Would I buy another car from Jaguar Houston North? Yes! Would I recommend this dealer to a friend? Yes! I guess you could say I'm petty well pleased with everything, even the one service department visit to fix a minor issue was beyond my expectations, they even washed my car.  I need to get back into the service department, that's best car wash I've ever had, I assume they wash your car after each service visit.  Additionally the followup on any questions I've had is always timely and accurate. Be sure to visit the customer waiting area, best coffee you'll ever have at a dealer.  Oh yea! My opinion on the lady that made it all possible deserves 5 stars, her name is ANGELA BASSETT.  I remember the GM, the loan officer and others, but the person I know and trust is ANGELA BASSETT.  When I think of Jaguar Houston North, I think ANGELA BASSETT.  ANGELA BASSETT IS Jaguar Houston North.  Glad to know Angela and her friends on the north side. Here's person that under promises and and over delivers.  What a fresh concept, thanks for what you did.",5.0
63,"February 01, 2009",I found Marlon very helpful and knowledgeable of what he was doing. He made the whole process pleasant and very sweet.

He did an excellent job on the whole process. ,5.0
