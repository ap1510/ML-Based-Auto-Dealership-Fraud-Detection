0,"May 31, 2020","I just purchased a  2020 BMW 530i from Alderson Automotive Group. My salesman was Gary Hays and words can't describe what a pleasure it is to work with Gary on purchasing a car. His knowledge on so many quality vehicles is simply unequaled. This is the 15th car I've purchased for myself or my family since 2001 when I bought my first BMW 5 series from Gary. I drive alot of miles, so I'm always looking for something new or different. Gary has never steered me wrong and I've not worked with anyone else for a new car since then. As long as he's there I can't imagine purchasing a new or used vehicle from anyone else other than Gary Hays at Alderson. ",5.0

5,"December 29, 2018","I live in Fort Worth, But was in Lubbock for Christmas. I had been looking online at Alderson used cars based upon my friend’s/ family’s experience there. I found a used X4 That looked beautiful and a great price. My husband and I stopped by the dealership to look at it. That is when we met Tyler Bell. What an exceptional person and salesman. He was knowledgeable, up front/ honest and kind. Not only did we purchase the X4, my husband purchased and X3. Alderson is beautiful, comfortable, and the sales/ administrative staff made purchasing two cars easy and pleasurable. Highly recommend. Go to Alderson and call Tyler Bell. ",5.0

Tyler Bell was so professional, knowledgeable and all around the best to work with. Crystal Marquez was so organized with the paperwork It didn't take long to go over everything and sign. Peter Daia knows EVERYTHING to know about BMW's. He's pretty patient to. I know I'll be contacting him in the near future!! Micheal was a great help also. He got me in the car I love and stuck to his word with my trade and purchase price. Thank you ALL for the BEST experience!! ",5.0

25,"January 06, 2017","I have bought about 4 or 5 different cars from this dealership and I live near Dallas!  I find that I always get better deals here.  This time I dealt with Lance Washam.  I called him and told him what I was looking for ahead of time.  Within a week he called me about a car, which I decided against, but then he called me again about a month later and it was a car exactly what I was looking for!!  We made the deal over the phone, he sent a driver to meet me, we exchanged cars and it was a very expedient, pleasant experience.  Lance called me several times to keep me up on the latest going on until I could get the car. ",5.0

34,"October 01, 2015","We were just looking and we were thinking about trading in our Nissan Murano. Isaac came out was very friendly, warm and full of knowledge. He ask questions, made statements and soon we were driving a couple of certified cars. Both were BMW's  and he let us drive both. The driving course he took us on tested the overall stability, comfort, proved the luxury of the vehicle and was overall a beautiful are to be in. He is interested in customer service, and went way beyond what we have been seen in the past and we usually trade cars ever year or so. The closing was directed by him and when we came back to pickup our new vehicle, he demonstrated what features were on the car. It had so many, that he was finishing up his presentation from our test drive. We are happy with our new car and happy with the time he took for this transaction. He really seems to enjoy his job!! Every one that was involved in this process was very helpful!!

His patience while showing the vehicles in stock and finally the one at the back of the lot was her choice He was very  helpful in the purchase of the vehicle.

37,"October 16, 2012","Stopped in with a taillight problem that started today and was given a brick-wall of service. I admit I stopped in an hour before they closed however a friendly I'll take your info would have been nice, and perhaps a better solution then we have to verify the problem for warranty service (LEDs in the light are acting up and not serviceable, they're half as bright as the other side and only half are working.) A quick google on my phone on the way to the dealer revealed a TSB about a bad batch BMW had in cars.

I'm 100 miles out from a dealer and would have liked to have had a better answer then the deer in the headlights I received. It's as simple as telling somebody you don't want to look at the 5 minute issue then to make a few excuses.

20k miles on my 09 335D

I'll be taking my business to Amarillo.",1.7
38,"April 07, 2011",Bogus staff and lier staff leader- Tim - he will keep your car for a week to change wiper blades and he will take genuine parts out of your car to install it in their dealership inventory to give warranty to buyers. STAY AWAY from Alderson BMW (period),1.0
39,"December 15, 2003","Very good service, nice people.  They return calls quickly and charge somewhat reasonable prices for a luxury car dealership.  Parts people are nice as well.  In addition, I had an excellent sales experience at this dealership.  Alderson has been around Lubbock for about 50 years, and it's because people keep coming back.  The dealer motto is ""Legacy of Excellence, Committed to the Future.""  It is no wonder!",5.0
