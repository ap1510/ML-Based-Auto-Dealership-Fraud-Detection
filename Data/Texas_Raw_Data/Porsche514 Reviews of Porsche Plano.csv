0,"June 06, 2019","I own a 1987 Porsche 930S, factory orange, 3000 miles. Because it is not driven much, the ethanol in gasoline ate through the rubber fuel-line. So, I trailered the car in to this so-called dealer. The so-called service mgr told me that it was a $15,000 repair. I asked why so much? ...he replied “it’s a classic” 
I had it put back on the trailer and sent it to Ft Worth Porsche. They did the repair for $2000, and I had to spend $700 on trailering fees. 
These pathetic people are criminals! ",1.0

All questions were answered, the CPO car was flawless, and we were in and out within a few hours.  I'd gladly use this dealership in the future!",5.0

After we picked up the car we noticed the front end was shaking while braking  We contacted Christopher Allen or salesman. We brought the car back and they fixed the problem by replacing the rotors,brake pads and sensors. Mike the GM of the dealership came out and personally thanked us and Becky who’s over the service manger and Fred are mechanic were all very friendly and went out of their way to make our visit as pleasant as possible.. they even gave us a loaner so we could go eat lunch. Would definitely recommend this dealership and we’ll be going back for the next vehicle we need!!",5.0

All of the employees I worked with through the transaction were kind, professional, and helpful. I have had my Macan serviced several times since then and have been impressed by the efficiency of the service department. I couldn't recommend this dealership more! ",5.0

Dealership issued falsified CarFax report, My purchase decision was based on the report that was provided prior to purchasing the car. The CarFax report given to me by the dealership had been altered.",1.0

8,"July 16, 2018","I purchased a 2017  Cayenne from this dealership last fall and had a good experience with the salesman - Josh.  I must say that I went into my first Porshe purchase expecting to have a superb customer service experience, but from there it went downhill fast.  First a rat got into the engine compartment and bit through a wire and it was giving me weird warning lights.  When I took it in they said it would cost $1,800 to replace the harness as it was not covered by warranty.  I asked them to send me a picture and quickly could see that it was just one wire, which I asked them to repair, not replace the whole harness.  They would not do it, so I told them to do nothing and took it home and fixed it myself in less than 10 minutes for nothing.  The wire that was chewed in two had been stuffed far back up into the bundle of 50 or so wires, so it was hidden from view, which I did not appreciate.  I complained to the service dept, the customer service dept, and ultimately wrote a letter to the Manager of the dealership explaining my frustrations and offering to come meet and discuss it.  Never heard a word from him.  Next, I had a glancing collision with the corner of a curb near George Bush which blew out 2 tires.  Thank God I bought the $1,800 tire protection package.  Oooopps!  Does not cover hitting a curb.  So I complained and requested to cancel the policy and get a refund.  They agreed, but now 8 weeks later, I don't have the refund and Suzanne, the woman who sold me the policy (from Auto Nation) has not responded to my last e-mail, sent a month ago.  I am due for my 20K service and checked to see what is included and what it costs.  Not much and $1,100.  I checked with Kwik Kar and they will do the same things including changing all the filters (air and a/c) and flush the brake system for $350.   Hmmmm - what to do?",1.8

10,"August 07, 2017","Recently bought 2004 911 Turbo x50 Cab to add to my collection.  Based on all assurances that all systems fully functional and operational - and service records from recent 30,000 mile service and 125 point Autonation warranty inspection - I bought the car sight unseen and had shipped to NC. AND paid their list price. The car arrived with inoperative rear spoiler - and dash warning light had been turned off. After many emails, phone calls etc to Arron in service, Chris Moore (salesman) and Mike Marsh, General Manager I was told to go away. The service technician said""I don't know what is included in the 125 Autonation inspection"". They would not tell me about their service history on the spoiler although I was told the same technician had serviced this car since new - for 13 years!  
I had diagnostic test done by dealer locally and was told that Porsche Plano could not have been unaware of the defective spoiler- and got $4000 estimate to repair. No question in my mind Plano shipped the car with defect knowingly and management WILL NOT SUPPORT SALE DEPT REPRESENTATIONS AFTER THE SALE. 
I have owned 16 Porsche cars bought from dealers all over the US and this is my first problem and first review. Porsche Club Of America members and serious enthusiasts - stay away from this dealer or be burned. ",1.0

15,"March 27, 2015","Buying a car is generally an exhausting and taxing on the nerves. Not so with my experience with Porsche of Plano.  I've purchased cars from other dealerships e.g. Honda, Toyota, Acura, Lexus and BMW; but the entire buying and ordering experience with this dealership exceeded all of them. I special ordered a Cayman GTS and Mark Laurenzi helped me through the maze. No muss or fuss.  Highly recommended and Kudos to Mark Laurenzi and Suzanne Andries!!

16,"December 15, 2014","This is the fourth Porsche I buy from those guys and the third time I have dealt with Mark. This man knows every detail about every model. I am definitely a car guy and consider myself rather knowledgeable, yet Mark still helped me pick the best option for me, adding this or deleting that. I am now the happy owner of a '15 GT3 and this is not the last car I buy from Porsche Plano. For those who live in Dallas, go the extra distance, drive to Plano and buy from them instead of the T-Rex Dallas-based dealer. You'll save money and enjoy a truly great experience, from the purchase to the amazing service. I know everyone there and consider them as friends as they all treat me better than one.

17,"November 16, 2014","We wanted a new Macan in the sapphire blue color (the color that was in all of porsche advertisements before it was available to customers). Mark Laurenzi kept a watch for when the color was available and notified us the day it became available. We ordered it then he updated us every step of the way as it came out of the factory, where it was located on the ship, when it got to port, and called us as soon as it arrived. Suzanne made even the paper work for the purchase nearly enjoyable. She is great! This is not my first purchase from Mark at Porsche Plano nor will it likely be my last. ",5.0
18,"October 30, 2014","Cars are a passion for me. Regrettably, I buy and sell them too often, usually losing a bunch of money in the process.  But, I do that voluntarily, so, for the most part, I have only myself to blame.  I got a bug for a Porsche earlier this year, and, long story short, bought a 2014 Cayenne from Porsche Plano.  For reasons that aren't important here, the Cayenne didn't last long, and I then bought a 2015 911. All along the way, dealing with Porsche Plano has been a joy.  The management is honorable, the sales team is superbly knowledgable, and the overall experience has been a true joy.  While I'm not real fond of the Porsche brand (a story for another time), I could not be happier with Porsche Plano, and could not recommend them any more highly.",5.0
19,"June 09, 2014","My wife and I were very pleased with the experience we had while looking for a new car at Porsche Plano. Our test driving with J.D. was very enjoyable and he knew a lot about the Panameras we were looking to buy. 
When it finally came time to negotiate, J.D. and the sales manager were very professional and courteous and made the least enjoyable part of buying a car a pleasurable experience. 
We would recommend J.D. and Porsche of Plano to anyone considering a Porsche. ",5.0
20,"May 17, 2014","Being an out of state buyer, purchasing a car sight un-seen is a scary proposition.

Working with Plano Porsche and David Loder, the process could not have gone smoother.  David gave an honest assessment of the car to insure no surprises upon my arrival.

David and the dealership were very competitive in their pricing and paid special attention to customer service.

I would highly recommend this extraordinary honest car dealer.",5.0
21,"April 20, 2014","My wife and I had been driving our vehicles for 6 and 7 years, respectively, and the annual service spend for each car was tantamount to an annual car payment. So we decided to shop for 2 new cars. After much brand consideration, we settled on Porsche. So, I asked a friend of mine, who has owned several Porsches over the years, if he had a sales professional he would recommend. Without hesitation he said, Mark Laurenzi at Porsche Plano. My friend told me Mark definitely would take care of me, and would remove all the angst one normally experiences when buying a new car. Boy, was my friend correct. 
Within 3 minutes of my friend providing my contact information to Mark, he called me. I told him what I was looking for, and he said he would send me relevant car descriptions that day for what he had in inventory. Upon receipt of these descriptions, I called Mark back to schedule a time for us to come for test drives. Mark was prepared, enthusiastic, professional, understanding and, above all else, friendly. Furthermore, he is incredibly knowledgable, and demonstrates that he truly want to find the right car for each person, which he did for us. In addition, Mark was honest about pricing and how he could work with us - very fairly I might add. 
Since purchasing two new cars, we have brought both cars back to the dealership for some after-market services. Both times Mark and our service professional, Tim Shaffer, have been incredibly professional and helpful. We have never had such an incredible car buying (and service!) experience. We most definitely would buy our next cars at Porsche Plano, and highly recommend Mark (and Tim) to anyone looking to purchase a Porsche. ",5.0

23,"January 29, 2014","I stopped by on a Saturday in January 2014 to test drive a pre-owned vehicle that they had on inventory.  Neil Conklin from sales helped me with the test drive, negotiations, and after sales work.  Neil is a fantastic sales professional who is knowledgeable about cars.  He was never pushy about selling the vehicle.  Neil was very patient with helping me test drive the vehicle and provided me all the necessary time and information to become comfortable with the purchase.  In fact, he addressed and fixed any issues that arose with the vehicle, no questions asked (post sale, there were some necessary non-mechanical repairs). 

This dealership prides themselves on delivering high levels of customer service and Neil was a great representative of the dealership's culture. 

When I am in the market for a Porsche, I would definitely return to this dealership and work with Neil on the purchase.  ",5.0
24,"January 09, 2014","I drove all the way to central Louisiana to Plano to take a look at an SLK 55 AMG listed on Porsche of Plano website. When I arrived I was promptly greated by salesman Neil Conklin.  After a walk around of the vehicle, he arranged a test drive and explained the features of the SLK.  I could tell he was very passionate about cars and knew his stuff. I didn't buy the car that day as I wanted to do more research and sure enough Porshe of Plano had the best deal i could find on an SLK 55 AMG.  Needless to say I Santa delivered a hot sports car to my garage this Christmas...Thanks Neil.  ",5.0

30,"August 04, 2013","Porsche of Plano is a very friendly and welcoming environment.  For a high-end, and exclusive brand like Porsche, one might expect a bit of arrogance or stuffiness, but there is none of that at Porsche of Plano.  I went there about 8-10 times prior to purchase and a probably just as much since taking delivery 2 months ago.  They always welcome you and are glad to see you return.

Mark Laurenti is a great sales advisor and very easy to work with.  He is a true car guy that will share his knowledge and passion, even after order placed and delivery of vehicle.  At other brands and dealers, I never saw the sales guy again after purchase and you are simply directed to the service department.  Mark and I have had probably 6 or more chats AFTER the sale.

Even the people in the 'administrative areas' are great to work with, like Suzanne Andries and Nicole Clarke.  These ladies assisted me with various paperwork issues with Texas DMV and Porsche NA HQ - far beyond the assistance you would get anywhere else.  They took care of several 'issues' for me (issues outside the dealership) and kept me informed.  They are truly committed to customer service.

I find the 'passion and excellence' that is evident in Porsche vehicles is also demonstrated by the employees at Porsche of Plano.",4.8
31,"July 30, 2013","I just recently bought my first Porsche (a 2014 Cayman S 6MT, fully loaded) from Dave Balthrop at Porsche Plano.  I have dealt with many dealerships in the past, and this by far was the best experience I have ever had.  From the moment you walk in, there is someone to greet you and ask if you want something to drink.  It's as if they invite you straight into their home.  All potential feelings of intimidation are instantly lifted, and you feel at ease especially since I'm a younger buyer in my 30s and not their usual demographic.  

Before I had even set foot into the dealership, I had casually written an email inquiring about a particular 2014 Cayman S that was not even available.  To be honest, I wasn't expecting a response.  Within 24 hours, Dave had contacted me to let me know that there would be one delivered the following week.  I was happy to hear that my exact configuration would soon be available, but even more impressed that I got a response.  It turns out I didn't have to wait a week.  Jon Griggs (Manager of Porsche Plano) called me within 48 hours to say that the car would be arriving off the truck and that Dave would call me in the morning when it was ready for a test drive.  

Sure enough, Dave called, and when I arrived, I was instantly greeted and offered something to drink.  I wanted to test drive both the PDK and the Manual, and Dave said 'No Problem'.  Dave brought the manual from the back and parked it under the shaded roof.  He allowed us to explore the ins and outs of the car with no pressure.  He willingly answered all the questions we had even comparing the vehicle with other strong competitors.  He was straightforward, knowledgeable, and funny at times with his stories.  His passion for the brand and 20+ years of experience is one of the qualities that exudes out when talking with him.

He started the test drive and really knows how to showcase the car's abilities.  I wish he could've taken me on the track, but we had to settle for the neighborhood streets of Plano.  I'm sure we woke a few people up with the optional (but really a must-have) sports exhaust.  Thankfully, Dave knew where all the police traps are.  :)

I wasn't so fearless when it came to my turn, and Dave continued to prod me to really drive the car.  I have never been told that, and coming from a salesman who typically want to protect/baby their cars, I was impressed.   

The Manual was a blast to drive.  The exterior of the new Cayman S is sleek and more exotic than the previous generation Cayman.  The interior has a luxurious feel, but still keeps the driver in mind.  The seats are comfortable, and it is surprisingly easy to view all blind spots.  With the sport exhaust option, it fills the engine cabin with a symphony of pure revving goodness.  The PDK Automatic was a solid system.  It's one of a kind in its ability to quickly shift gears, but in the end, the Manual called my name.  Both cars can really sell themselves.

 So, it was time to go inside and talk numbers.  The process was so smooth with no pressure, and I was again offered something to drink (multiple times).  During this time, I got to ask Dave many questions without bounds of all the different types of competitors that he has driven.  We were visited by Jon, and they both told me about the Porsche Driving School.  They both had opportunities to go out there and really learn how to drive a Porsche.  We also talked about the tracks in the DFW area and their community rallies.  This dealership has a family feel and really welcomes those interested in the brand.

Dave took me ""behind the scenes"" where I got to see the air-conditioned service area to see how the techs work on the cars, meet the service/parts guys, and review the history of Porsche (a timeline poster right outside the bathrooms).  You feel like you're joining a long racing heritage.  He even told me that I could get free hand washes at the dealership.

Since purchasing my Cayman,  I have also purchased a radar detector and have enjoyed every minute/mile of it.  After owning an Acura Integra, Chevy Camaro, Corvette Z06, and a BMW M3, this tops all of them in service, handling, performance, and luxury.  The overall experience was top-notch, and I look forward to this new Porsche journey.  When you go get yours, ask for Dave.

Mark Laurenzi showed me a few Porsches & has a lot of knowledge with the porsches, he drives one so he knows it well. He'll give you his honest opinion on each one of them. Very patient, no pressure experience. Bought a 911 GTS from him. Thanks Mark",4.8
33,"June 17, 2013","I loved the car the first time I seen it, in person so I knew I had to move fast If I wanted it, and the rest was history, this is one of the best purchases, that I have made,  David made the transaction as smooth as it needed to be.

34,"May 30, 2013","I went on my first Owners Rally with Porsche of Plano and was very impressed!!  When we got to the dealership they had breakfast set up, went over the rules and we were given directions for the ride.  The ride was beautiful and went at the perfect pace.  We ended at a beautiful restaurant that over looked a lake with a great lunch.  It was so nice to get together with other Porsche owners and walk away with new friends.  A few days later I received a email with several pictures of us on the ride.  What a treat!!

35,"May 28, 2013","10 years ago I purchased a Porsche from Park Place Porsche and was not happy with the experience or the service I received there. Last year I visited Porsche of Plano and met Mark Laurenzi. It was clear after a few moments with Mark I would be purchasing my next Porsche from Mark. Mark worked with me on my needs and convinced me the car I needed to pursue was the Porsche Caymon. Last week I took delivery of my new Porsche and I am ecstatic on my purchase. Mark is a true Porsche specialist and not just a ""sales person"". ",5.0
36,"May 21, 2013","I purchased my first Porsche, and most recently my fourth Porsche, from Mark Laurenzi. Since I do not live in the area, Mark made certain they had the vehicle with the options and color combination I was looking for before setting a meeting time to view and test drive the car because I contacted him after nine that morning and I only had a small window of time available to view the car and to get me a fair value for my trade. 
Every Porsche I have owned has been serviced at this dealership exclusively.  The service department is very professional and do their very best to get me in and out so I can be back on the road for my 5 1/2 hour trip home. Tim Shaffer and John Gladwill are second to none. ",5.0
37,"May 18, 2013","Mark did an outstanding job thru out the whole purchasing experience of our new 2014 Porsche Cayman, but what really set him apart was the attention to detail, he prepared the car as a Mother's day gift, He called the nearest Hobby Lobby to get a customized Big red bow so I could put it on top of the car to surprise her. Then he went all the way to my house to complete the job. We were very pleased with the experience, and will definitely do business again with you. Congratulations and keep your outstanding job at Porsche of Plano.

38,"May 14, 2013","This is my third transaction at Porsche Plano (formerly Boardwalk).  Second 911, and picked up 2013 911 4S this time.  As usual my local dealer in Austin can't touch Plano Porsche pricing.  But the real reason I drive to Dallas from Austin is simple--Owen Ford.  I have bought several cars from Owen, and he is a true gentleman.  Straight shooter, honest, best price, nice, personal--and you know exactly what you are going to get.  No questions.  Owen's personality and professionalism is exactly what others dealers should be looking at when it comes to training.  Everything is 'yep, I'll take care of it'--and he does.  Have a trade--he will give more than anyone.  Trust me, he did a deal on one of my trades for $4K more than the other dealer.

Flew up from Austin, he picked me up at the airport and off to the dealer.  Car was ready and looking amazing.  I asked if we could tint it--'sure no problem'.  Went to lunch with him and by the time we returned are was ready.  F&I lady was super nice and quick--no games or trying to sell extras.  

If you want a Porsche, best price and true customer service--go see Owen.  Man of his word and knows Porsche's inside and out.

Looking forward to maybe a Turbo next year.  Thanks again Owen and I'll keep referring people from Austin to you!",5.0

At the lunch following the drive, David was the perfect host, talking to everyone about their individual experience on the route and asking for each of our thoughts and suggestions for future events.

45,"March 12, 2013","The true character of any business can be found in how they handle a mistake or misunderstanding.  Boardwalk was very fair in their negotiating but truly showed their character when a misunderstanding had to be rectified.  They exhibited exemplary behavior in this regard.
I would recommend them without hesitation.",5.0
46,"March 05, 2013","I was referred to this dealership by a prior satisfied customer, and the recommendation certainly exceeded my expectations.  From the initial meeting to the follow-through and follow-up, I have been very impressed.  From the General Manager, Mike Marsh, who welcomed me ... to Sales Specialist, Owen Scales, who worked very hard to find a vehicle for immediate delivery ... to Nicole Clarke, who handled the closing paperwork, everything was handled with the utmost professionalism and caring.  

I was particularly pleased with the delivery process itself.  Owen spent a great deal of time with me going through all the features of the wonderful car and he made sure the car was prepped to his satisfaction (windows gleaming, etc).  I felt the trade-in value given to me for my old car was fair ... and providing the new car with a full tank of gas was a very nice touch!

I will continue to use this dealership for all my maintenance ... and I will certainly relate the positive experience I had to my friends.

47,"March 01, 2013","Owen provided a very positive experience for me and my family.  I am a first time Porsche owner, and the experience I have had at Boardwalk, due in large part to Owen, has made me an advocate for the dealership as well as the vehicle.  I purchased a new 911 after discussing and driving multiple cars with Owen. The pre-buy experience was low pressure, and filled with information. Owen was aware of the vehicle differences, as well as the options available in the 911 once I decided on that vehicle.  Owen has taken time with me not only before the purchase, but also after the purchase to educate me on opportunities available as an owner, which includes the PCA and the many events that are available to owners.  I will continue to recommend Owen and Boardwalk Porsche to my friends.",5.0
48,"February 25, 2013","This was by far the best ""buying experience"" I have ever had with any dealership. I must say to start that I did NOT buy a high value, high dollar car; but I was treated like I had! The entire staff was a pleasure. I would like to single out my sales rep, David Loder. He was exceptionally helpful and removed a great deal of the anxiousness of purchasing a vehicle from a distance. Not to mention he put up with a lot of emails, messages and phone calls without losing his ""cool"" when he probably should have! I am afraid to admit I was a ""high maintenance"" buyer!

Not only was the deal an excellent one, but they were patient and proactive about suggesting we drive multiple cars before making our decision.  With a good trade-in value offer on my older Cayman S, it was a deal we could not pass up.  Suzanne pulled everything together quickly and accurately. 

After the sale (as been my experience with Service), Tim Shaffer is an excellent service advisor, and takes great pride in ensuring things are done to my satisfaction.

Owen did a fantastic job of accurately representing the car and there were no surprises when I arrived to pick up the car in person.  Owen was very knowledgeable about the vehicle and gave me an excellent walk-through at the time of delivery.  Owen was also a professional when it came to leading me through the sales process.  He went out of his way to make the entire process very easy and hassle free.

I can think of several upscale car dealerships where someone looking like me would be ignored by the sales staff.  Not Boardwalk.  Colin Kurth wasted no time greeting me, then patiently answered all my questions, showed me the car, and provided me with plenty of information to take home.  In short, he was a consumate professional in a situation where not everyone in his position would be, and managed to do this with no certainty that I was a serious buyer and no reason to believe that I would ever return to the dealership.  Happily for all concerned, I was back the next morning - cleaned up - and with checkbook in-hand.

Before you you sign the paper they told you all the good service you will receive and how you will always get a porsche car for loan car.Finance lady said we'll never put u in other brand car, it will always be a Porsche. Well thats not true!! We took the car to service 3 times in less than 6 months after buying a new car and twice they gave us some other car rather than a Porsche. One time they gave us an older model of Nissan Maxima and it was dirty inside, another time they gave us a new Passat.

Even in the early days, when it was clear I was just ""looking"" and not ready to make a purchase, Jeff spent the time with me on test drives, explaining the vehicle and just having general conversation.  Never was there an aggressive sales push during the process.  And when I decided to make my recent purchase, the process was smooth, transparent and fair - and I believe the price I received was absolutely fair given the demand and market for the vehicle.

And I have found that experience to be as solid and consistent as I described in above in the sales process.  My service advisor is Jeromy Boulet.

He made sure we all had our tire pressures checked if needed, understood the schedule, knew that John and his staff were there to address any questions or concerns and even better, he made sure that all of the people out there were introduced to each other and did a great job making a small Boardwalk Community at the track.  I've done DE's before, but having the reassurance of Boardwalk and particularly David and John at the track made it not only more educational, but more fun as well! I've always enjoyed purchasing cars from Boardwalk but this is one more example of how Boardwalk utilizes their best employees to make Porsche ownership a lifestyle and not simply an automobile. Thanks for another GREAT event!",5.0
114,"September 27, 2012","The experience at Boardwalk Porsche was very professional and inviting.  I was hesitant to speak with a sales rep due to past experiences with other dealers, but after being greeted by Mr. Laurenzi, I was impressed with his approach from the very beginning.  He took the time to thoroughly answer all my questions, give me a tour of the dealership, and develop a relationship. This was refreshing as I walked in expecting the all too common ""transactional"" hard sell closer rookie types that we all love to hate. The tour gave me the opportunity to see that the shop and the service drive were as immaculately clean as the showroom floor.  To me, that speaks volumes as it reveals a high level of character and class. From the tour to test drive, I was completely satisfied with the experience.  Thank you for the time, and your relationship style approach to doing business.",5.0
115,"September 26, 2012","I have been a faithful Boardwalk customer since moving to Frisco, Texas 8 years ago.  As a 28 year Porsche Club of America member, I recognize the value that a great dealership brings to Porsche owners.  Boardwalk is exemplary in their support of our Maverick Region and members from sales, to service, to participation at our events.  I have 4 Porsches, and Boardwalk helps me keep them all in top shape.   David Loder is an awesome ambassador for Boardwalk at our events, both in the planning to make sure Boardwalk was front and center for our participants and the coordination of activities and personnel at the event -highlighting Boardwalk's support and availability to us beyond the sponsorship.  From the service area, John Gladwill is an endless patient source of information and advice for our members to optimize their Porsche performance, and demonstrates that he can walk the walk by his driving ability. For me, since two of my Porsches spend a lot of time at the PCA Driver Education events, I rely heavily on John's expertise. And being the series Chair, we appreciate Boardwalk's support. Cliff Blackshear offers a helping hand and wisdom from his years of experience in the care and feeding to keep Porsche's running young for our members.  In the service area, Jeromy Boulet and Tim Shaffer are like family friends, always recognizing every customer as they drive into the service bay with professionalism and kindness. Larry Irby and his team in parts are very knowledgeable and their area in the dealership is always spotless. The customer service from Boardwalk begins with leadership, and while they have always been good, since Mike Marsh came on board, I have experienced an elevation in the enthusiasm and pride at Boardwalk.

The best part is working with Larry and Thomas back in parts they have always continued to give me the best possible deals on parts. Honestly the best person is John Gladwell, his exceptional knowledge of Porsche mechanics has helped me upgrade my cars with the most cost effective way to achieve the upmost performance. The events that Boardwalk Porsche puts on at the track are just mind blowing. The DE events are head over heels fun and having the best mechanics John and Alex on site to handle any needs you may have as a Porsche owner is something unheard of. I really can’t believe that out of all my years of buying cars that I could have found a dealership that devotes its own time to Porsche lovers like me as much as Boardwalk Porsche. The Service is unbelievable even the others who indirectly help you like the lady Nicole and other sales people like Adrian, Mark and Owen.

Mark guided me through the entire sales process and made it so easy that has obtained a new fan for the brand, and for Porsche Boardwalk.

Unfortunately within weeks the check engine light came on again.   My first reaction was they didn't fix my car.   To their credit, they came to my home, picked up my car and returned  it with no charge.   The issue apparently was bad gas which I believe.  The bottom line  is they went out of their way (Tim Shaffer) and fixed my car even though the problem wasn't their fault.   I would recommend  Tim and his team any day.    ",4.8

135,"September 01, 2012","Boardwalk Porsche was recommended to me after having a not-so-good first experience elsewhere in Dallas. 

I called and spoke to Chris Williamson with whom I set up an appointment. My wife and I arrived at the agreed to time and not only was he not on the phone or dealing with anyone else, he was at the door to greet us. Might have been a coincidence, but still.... These guys work hard to create the right first impression.

Offer of water or coffee out of the way, Chris got the key to the car we had seen on Boardwalk's web site and we took it for a spin. Then we took out another car for comparison. We bought the car we had gone there to see. 

As part of the purchase, we traded in an early Boxster. The value we got was good, more than acceptable. Craig Sanborn made the financial transaction speedy with no difficulties.

An hour and a half after we had arrived, we were happily wending our way home in our unbelievably low milage - and low price - 2012 Boxster S. 

The staff we dealt with, Chris and Craig, were both professional and personable; and the price for the car we wanted was the lowest to be found anywhere in the USA.

Boardwalk had several on the lot that we were interested in so we drove 75 minutes from Fort Worth to look at the cars. This was the first luxury sports car that we would be purchasing. Owen was super friendly and very knowledgable about the vehicle. Owen directed the conversation to both of us which I appreciated, having been ignored at other dealerships in the past. Rather than give us ""the hard sell"" Owen was informative put never pushy. He test drove three different models with us, and presented them all favorably regardless of the different price points. Owen was very prompt at getting back to me with information. In fact, I emailed him around midnight and got a reply 10 mins later even though I was not  expecting a reply until the next morning. He introduced us to several members of the Boardwalk team from finance to service. Overall this has been the best car buying experience we have ever had.

177,"June 04, 2012","A couple of months ago I found out I needed to have some medical items taken care of; nothing too serious but out of pocket expenses meant selling my 2012 911 Black Edition that I bought from Boardwalk.  Even though I put down David Loder's name all he did was pass the information onto the used car guys (I assume) and I was presented with an offer on my car that was a joke, I don't remember the specific amount, somewhere between $73 - $75K.  Boardwalk would have come across looking better on this question if they just said they weren't interested instead of a low ball offer such as this one. 

When I originally purchased my 911 I wrote a glowing report of the sales process because it was awesome.  What Boardwalk showed me on a possible re-purchase deal is Boardwalk is no different than other run of the mill dealerships. Just FYI, Porsche of Austin offered me $10K more for my car without even blinking.

I called the dealer before 8am and was surprised to know it was open already. A young man, Logan Bains answered my call with enthusiasm and great courtesy. I had seen the pictures of the Cayenne I was interested in on the website and Logan answered all my questions with excellent knowledge. He also accepted my trade-in over the phone with only a few questions, and initiated financing for the new car right away.  Three hours later, he was on his way delivering the new car from Plano, TX, to Houston, TX, a 4+ hour drive. Everything was taken care of including registration etc. All I needed to do was sign papers at home when he arrived at 3pm and Logan drove my old car back to Plano. The car was in great condition as described. This was the first time I bought a car without visiting the dealer and seeing the car in person. By talking to Logan over the phone, I felt that I could trust him and made the deal. The price was good too. Logan was very friendly, respectful, courteous, efficient, and knowledgeable.

This is the second time we visited Owen to inquire about one of their used vehicles.  Owen is great to deal with.  He is very low key and accommodating.

We were in and out in a jiffy and returned within a week to purchase the vehicle.  The subsequent purchase experience was equally painless.  Owen and the finance manager Suzanne were knowledgable and efficient.  The car was prepped, all the items promised were performed on the vehicle, and it was cleaned up for delivery.  Owen explained all the features of the vehicle to us and impressed upon us that he would be available to help us with any issues or concerns in the future.  He took us over to the service department and introduced us to the service writers and explained the hours of operation, loaner car policy, and car wash policy.  Great buying experience and awesome vehicle.  We would highly recommend Owen and Boardwalk Porsche to anyone interested in a high end sports car.  -AG, Dallas, TX",5.0
253,"January 23, 2012","My wife and I decided to look at possible SUVs for our next car purchase, so we decided to stop by and try a pre-owned Cayenne. David greeted us with an ear-to-ear smile, spent a lot of time proudly showcasing the dealership, even before talking about possible vehicles.

David was ready to help, very informative, willing to research any extra information we asked about, never pushing too hard or being pretentious, and while  he was proud to drive a Porsche (and wear its crest on his jacket) he never insinuated that any other cars (that we owned or not) were lessen than the ones he was offering, a difficult feat on my car buying experience.  

Our first impression of Boardwalk could have been anything from horrible to awesome, and I can confidently say that David was the reason why we felt so welcomed, while not ceasing to impress with his utmost professionalism, proving that Porsche has its place in the high end automobile services.
 
In 5 words or less, David has simply wow'ed us! 
 
We can see a new and/or lightly used Porsche is in our not-so-long-future, and because of David, Boardwalk Porsche will be our first stop.

Mark Laurenzi was our saleperson on both purchases and he took a great deal of time to make sure we were well informed.

He took the time to understand our interests in a new vehicle and then made sure no items were missed. My wife was extremely impressed by Mark and his very personable approach to showing her all the features and getting her started with driving the new car.

255,"January 17, 2012","Bought new Cayenne from Mark in Jan 2012, the negotiation at the beginning thru another saleman was little pushy (and he quit his job before I pick up the SUV), so Mark took over the deal, he was easy to talk too, keeped up to date until deliveried. The SUV look very nice, Mark showed detail how the Cayenne work. Suzanne did a good job about financing too, she took time to explain details of those options need to add on for protection the SUV, and also explained the loan processed. 
Over all, it was a good experience and nice day to pick up a beautiful Cayenne.

256,"January 17, 2012","Searched online for a specific MINI and found a perfect match at this store so I emailed the dealership and Chris Williamson immediately replied and a few minutes later called to discuss. I was extremely satified with the response time and the information in question was quickly provided.

One hour later I found myself in the store and test driving the vehicle. The car exceeded my expectations and I applied for the vehicle.

Being young it took a few tries, but the finance department was on-top-of-it and I received a great deal later that day.

Two days later here I am in my new car! Great warranty and to-the-point service and knowledge about every detail of the process will keep me coming back!

So naturally I had to visit a Porsche dealer. I never knew what I was working for...until now. I am not there yet but he made me feel as ""part of the family"". He presented a level of service that I had never experienced, from ANY dealership. 

Mark let me drive the car of my dreams. Unfortunately, Boardwalk did not have a used Porsche in my budget (mainly b/c my budget is low and they keep newer cars) but that DID NOT effect the way I was treated! So, needless to say...I will come back to Boardwalk at some point and welcome the ability to work with Mark. Even if I have to purchase elsewhere, I will get my Porsche services here. I was impressed by the racing team of Porsche cars they service. Anyone who can work on race cars can make my daily driver come alive! Thanks for showing me the Service Department, I would have never known. I love race cars!

My sales person, Mark Laurenzi was a complete depiction of professionalism. He was straightforward and non hesitant in making our deal. Although I asked for extensive leg work and followup, Mark was unbelievably timely and concise.

His true character has shown up in post sales dealings with him. My car has enough buttons to rival the space shuttle. Mark has taken the time over a dozen times to help me understand the workings of the incredible machine he sold me. He meets me at the door every time I show up with a smile on his face.

It's about 200 miles away so I was apprehensive about working with a dealer that would not be servicing the car.  I gave them my VIN on my older Porsche trade in.  We negotiated over the phone and I drove up the next day to trade in my car.  To my surprise, it was the most-pleasant car buying experience I have ever had.  Tracy honored his price on my trade in, and the new car was exactly like he said.   I indicated that I wanted to put a front license plate on the car, and Tracy sent one to my house without hesitation.  That was very good.  I also had to get back to my wife (she was expecting), and he had all of the paper work ready to go.  It was a very smooth, very enjoyable experience.  Tracy called me after I had the car for a week to ensure that there were no issues and asked if I needed anything.  I have never had a dealer do that before.

Tracey has always been a trusted resource when it comes to buying a Porsche and this is why I stay a customer of his.  Tracey follows through and has always done what he can do to take care of his customers.  Tracey is also understands and thoroughly knows the product that he is selling.  He has been with Boardwalk for a number of years.  I wouldn't take the time to write this if I didn't highly recommend him for anyone's Porsche buying experience.

276,"December 27, 2011","I was searching for a pre-owned vehicle online and came across the vehicle that I was looking for at Boardwalk Porsche.  I contacted them and they were very professional and ready to show me the vehicle.  I met one of the salesman, Dave Balthrop at the dealership and he drove the vehicle to the front of the dealership for me to inspect and test drive.  Unfortunately, it was a bit late in the day so I decided to come in another day to work the deal.  Since I had missed Dave, I was helped out by Chris Williamson who was also a pleasure to work with.  They both were very professional and friendly and easy to work with.  Not much negotiating in the price but from looking at the same vehicle elsewhere, Boardwalk Porsche definitely had anyone beat even on the pre-owned vehicles but a lot.  When it came to the financing, I went through my own bank and had to make a third trip to the dealership when I got a chance to meet one of the managers, Matt Williams.  He was also very professional and got the deal done!!!  I am now enjoying my vehicle with no problems thanks to the guys at Boardwalk Porsche.  I would highly recommend anyone looking for a new Porsche or any pre-owned vehicles to stop by.  They will treat you right.  In addition, the receptionists were very nice and welcoming and each time I went in, there was not a time when I wasn't offered a soda or coffee.

Owen KNOWS HOW TO WORK HARD!  Surprisingly, in the end, every reasonable offer and request I made over the phone was agreed to and everything was delivered as promised!  I also feel Owen is an honest person.  Here's why.  After we agreed on the deal, I asked Owen to park my new Cayenne inside for two days until I can drive down to TX to pick it up.  Knowing that I live in OK, Owen could have said ""...no problem. I'll make sure the car is parked inside.""  But, he was honest and told me that he couldn't do that due to policy, but not to worry because the car is parked under a tent and ""out of the weather.""  Of course, this wasn't ideal for me, but I appreciated his honesty. This kind of behavior is extremely hard to find nowadays, especially in the car sales business!  In the end, I arrived in TX on Friday to pick up the Cayenne.  My wife's new Porsche was detailed and ready to go.  And, knowing that this was a surprised Christmas present for my wife, Owen went above and beyond and even sent home a personal gift so I can give to my wife!  It was one of the best car purchasing experience I've ever had.  Everything Owen promised to do on the phone was delivered upon my arrival!  Would I contact Owen again in the future?

I have had the pleasure of working with Tim Schaffer in the service department for several years now.  He has always made each visit so quick and easy.

What more could you want.....

I worked with Adrian Jackobs in the sales department to purchase our third Porsche from Boardwalk. He had a hard task because I knew exactly what I wanted (911 Turbo Cab, low miles, manual, and two color options) and I was willing to wait to get the perfect match.  Adrian would call to give me a ""heads up"" each time he found out a 911 Turbo was coming in or when one was traded in. He was VERY patient each time I would look at the cars and decide it wasnt exactly what I wanted. It was worth the wait . . . . I trusted Adrian and Tim so much that we purchased my dream car without even seeing it first!!   Adrian found more than the PERFECT match and I couldn't be happier!!

They exceeded my expectations and made the buying experience fun and relaxed.  The after-sale experience has also been great.  Tim Shaffer and Larry Irby have taken care of my car and me in a first rate manner.  The car is always delivered on time and in great shape.  Loaner cars are always at the ready.

316,"November 05, 2011","My experience with Mark Laurenzi and the team at Boardwalk Porsche has been excellent!  Very professional, patient, warm and helpful. 

July of 2011 was my first experience with Boardwalk Porsche.  My husband Ted has bought 2 car's from Mark Laurenzi and Ted wanted Mark to assist me in the ordering process of my new Cayenne Turbo.  The entire process of ordering the car was very exciting and I valued Mark's opinion in choosing the color, right down to the steering wheel.    

 Mark kept us informed in the process of the car being built and I could not wait to see it.   When the car did arrive at Boardwalk, he sent a text picture of the car.  It was very exciting to actually see a picture of it!  When I picked the car up,  I was overwhelmed at how beautiful it was!  And all the men at Boardwalk complimented on how beautiful the car was as well. 

This was my first experience to ever order a car.   We always choose one off the lot in the past.   And I have to say, this experience is one that I  will never forget!  The car is just beautiful!  And the service I received has been excellent! 

Mark has been so helpful and patient as I learn about the car and all the function's.  The car has exceeded all my expectations and I love driving it.  My husband loves it too, which mean's so much to me since he bought it for me.   It's over the top in every way and I know I will enjoy driving it for many year's to come!

A huge thank you to both Mark, and all the team at Boardwalk for your excellent service and for making me feel at home.  You all are the best!

David followed up with me several times while I looked at all of my options around town, never putting on the typical high pressure one normally gets when looking at cars. Boardwalk knows how to treat their customers. In the end, the Vette at Boardwalk was the nicest car in town, with the lowest miles, and at a very reasonable price.  When I stopped in to pick up my plates thtis week, David had my my car cleaned inside and out. Try getting that kind of service at you average dealership.

Mark is friendly, knowledgeable, patient and knows his Porsches.
This was my first Porsche purchase, but definitely won't be my last.
Being a female, I was worried I wouldn't be taken seriously regarding
car shopping. He treated me with the same respect he treated my husband.
Something I was grateful for. He helps with any questions I have, calls 
right back and emails information when you request it.
Even remembers me when I come in for my free car washes...stops and asks how
I'm liking my car. 

Without a doubt, when I'm ready to upgrade to a newer model, I'll 
go back to Boardwalk and buy from Mark. 

Also, I'll never own anything other than a Porsche from now on. Love this car.

Mark is a great listener not you every day sales person, highly trained and knowledgeable on what he sells, he really follows up after you buy the car and make sure the customer enjoys its purchase.
He is always there ready to help and to bring me up to speed in current inventory  that may be of interest for me. Furthermore, Mark is great in developing and forging solid friendship with his clients, I will definitely recommend him to friends that may want to buy a great Porsche auto new or use.
One of the reason why I keep coming back to Boardwalk Porsche to service my car is Mark's pro-active attitude and the friendly service advisors that get things done right the first time.

I had enjoy very much my experience at Boardwalk Porsche and Mark.

First, I want to point out that the reason I bought a car somewhere else is because I decided on an Audi R8 Spyder instead of the 911 Turbo S. Both vehicles are amazing so this was a purely subjective choice on my part. 
Mark Laurenzi from Boardwalk Porsche is one of the most helpful and product knowledgeable sales people I have met. He has a good knowledge of his product and all of the competition in his segment. He did everything he could to help me in the process and when he realized that the Audi R8 was my definite choice, he even tried to locate one for me within Boardwalk. Throughout the process, he was constantly working with me to understand my needs from the car and did an excellent job of demonstrating where a Porsche could satisfy that need. He kept me up to date as new cars arrived and made sure I had an opportunity to see and drive the various models that may fit my need. 
Because of the car selection, features and specific color requirements, I was not able to get my Audi from one of the Boardwalk dealers this time. Because of my experience with Mark, I was very impressed with the group and will visit there whenever the need for a car arises.

And then, finally, there is the entire cast of service and parts professionals who ensure that these machines operate in tip-top form. My service advisors are Jeremy and Tim, but everyone in the service and parts departments deserves a huge thumbs-up.  Boardwalk gets it done and they get it done by doing it right.

368,"August 17, 2011",My experience with Boardwalk Porsche has been exceptional.  I think they were fair with my trade in on a new Panamera. I have been impressed with David Loder's consistent follow up 'after the sale'. I have been greeted with courtesy and enthusiasm from the service dept. for something as simple as a free car wash!  The car has been awesome and I would not hesitate to do business with this dealership in the future.,4.8
369,"August 17, 2011","David Loder worked with my husband and me for about 7 months on a Cayenne. Initially we were looking for a pre-owned 2011 but when none were to be found, David and Owen Ford helped us build a 2012 that was within our budget. We appreciated David's low-key approach and never felt pressured. He understood our situation and even went on a few wild goose chases for us! David also answered all our questions and polished the car himself when we took delivery. Then he patiently went over the operation of the car and told us to call him for anything. Thanks David and maybe we will see you again soon!

After not finding what we were looking for in Fort Worth, we trekked over to Plano and, with Owen & Tracy's help, found a car we love.  They stayed late for us on a Friday night when I'm sure they had plans (thanks again, guys!) and treated us fabulously.  No pressure, just great customer service.  
I also dealt with Larry Irby, the parts manager, the following week who was great in getting me some really nice wheels/tires AND squeezing me in the same day to get them put on the car.  Overall, Boardwalk is a class act and we wouldn't hesitate to purchase another car there.",5.0

It was a Public Safety Fleet type of SUV. So, the entire sale and trade-in process was totally out of the norm for the Boardwalk sales people and the finance department. I think that many other dealerships would have sent me to a competitor just to give same a hard time! But instead the staff at Boardwalk literally bent over backwards to help me make a purchase with an odd trade-in. They were friendly and courteous during the several hours that I was in the store. In addition, I learned some interesting facts about the Porsche that I do own. They answered questions that I had long had about that car ( Boxter).

We have purchased 2 new Porsches from Boardwalk (a Boxster in 2005 and a Carrera Cabriolet last month). Both experiences were stellar, from the sales person (Tracy Rabey) to the manager (Owen Ford) to the finance department. The multi-day negotiations (pace dictated by us) went smoothly, and we did not feel as though we were in a fight to get a deal that we could live with. At the end, we got an exceptional deal and the post-sales followup by both the salesman and the manager has been exemplary. We tried to work with a dealership (slightly) closer to us, but the experience was night and day. I would highly recommend Boardwalk to anyone looking to purchase one of these great machines! ",5.0

I could not stay in business if the parts and service department at Boardwalk were not so supportive.  Parts Manager Larry Irby and wholesale shop liaison Roger Renyolds plus Thomas Freeman and Matt Gideon make sure I get the parts I need, when I need them.  And they are a big help when one of the old mysteries need solving.

And speaking of old mystery solvers, Cliff Blackshear, the service shop foreman is a treasure trove of information from the beginning of time, and I have heard rumors that the factory thinks he along with John Gladwell are one of many reasons Porsche cars rate so highly in JD Power's quality surveys.  

And then how can I close without thanking Robert McDaniel’s for doing street/track and track setups for me while I got setup to do them, and then for verifying them for me while I got my equipment set up.

What a great support group for my little shop.

Like I said, I could not stay in business if they were not there to give me the wonderful, high quality products and support they provide.

I rely on him to coordinate service basics and trust his recommendations on any Porsche service or  accessories. I've never  been given bad advice. He sends timely updates and calls when my car is ready and it is normally ready when  promised. Bottom line, Jeromy makes you feel like you have a friend working at the dealership.

What I expected based on the type and price of cars that are being sold that I would encounter the arrogance that I had already encountered at other Porsche dealerships. Everyone I met at the dealership made me feel at home, welcome and appreciative that I was there looking to purchase from their dealership.  David went out of his way to ensure that I was taken care of in all aspects of the purchase even to the point of switching out the drivers seat which had a minor flaw. Most other places would have had me come back for the repair at which time on your return I would have just been another number standing in line.  With Boardwalk they kept personnel around to switch out the seat if that had been my preference. Now come on folks, what damn car dealer have you been to lately where YOU had a say on anything! At Boardwalk you are actually treated as a real person and I really do not think it would have matter what type of car they were selling.  

The type of atmosphere encountered at Boardwalk can only be achieved if the person at the top of the food chain truly believes that customer service is the ONLY way any type of company can differentiate from their competitors.

428,"May 22, 2011","I want to thank Matt Williams and Mark Laurenzi for the exceptional service that I received last weekend.  On Saturday night, I apparently parked my Porsche loaner in a Tow Zone lot on Lower Greenville in downtown Dallas while dining in a restaurant.  Taking a Cab home was a hassle but worse was the headache of locating the vehicle in an East Dallas Tow Yard and being informed that I must have the dealer loaner contract, which was in the console, in order to start the process of retrieving the car.  On top of that, the initial tow charge of $195 would increase by $75 every 12 hours from the time of tow.  That meant $420 if I had to wait until Monday Morning to get a copy of the contract when the dealership opened!  Fortunately I had Mark's cell number in my phone.  He immediately put me in contact with Matt who was planning to go to the dealership the next morning.  Matt was kind enough to take the extra time on a Sunday to fax me a copy of the contract and saved me hundreds of dollars.   Thanks guys for making this experience a little more palatable!",5.0

I stopped to find out more about what the newer Porsche models had to offer. I knew what I had read but had never driven one. Three hours later I had driven every model I was interested in. After that time I knew what model was right for me. During this entire time I never felt like I was preasured to make a decision, to buy a car or felt like I was wasting their time. I honestly felt like they were there to help me understand the product not to sell me a car.

It was my plan to purchasing a new car in the next couple of months but I wasn't completely convinced on a Porsche. I had such a positive experience with both Mark and Matt, not to mention that I discovered what a premier car that Porsche builds. I went back the next day and bought a 911 Carerra S that I am absolutly in love it.

They are obviously there to sell cars...all dealers should thrive to have thier clients leave with the experience I had with Mark, Matt and the Boardwalk Porsche dealership. They are definitely how I define ""customer service""...

Knowledge about the product, passion with sales, persistance but not 'pushy'  Boardwalk Porsche Plano  employs high educated and trained sales people.

Isaac Madrid,
When it comes to service, customers are less enthusiastic...  Cost is usually high and the car is already being used.
We visit the workshop mainly to 'fix' problems, customer care service is of high importance there.
I have to admit that, I purchased another Carrera 911 because of confidence I have in Boardwalk Porsche Plano.
Excellence in service and reliability starting with appointment, reception and good loaner vehicles.
The invoices are detailed and well explained without request.

My name is Tamara Birch and I recently secured a build date for my new Porsche Cayenne.  I had to tell you about my experience.  Before making a decision on which car to purchase I checked out the dealerships I planned to purchase from.  Boardwalk was the first dealership I went to and that is also where I met Logan Bains.  I went to other dealerships and even got a quote for $10,000 less that what Logan quoted from a USAA affiliated dealership.  I called Logan and asked him if he could match that price and he was very upfront when he told me that he couldn’t and doesn’t understand how anyone could because of the high demand of the Cayenne (of course, I went to the other dealership).  Their salesperson told me that they would gladly honor that price.  By the time he came back with a proposal it was $10,000 more that the USAA price, due to trade in and other fees (I thought that was interesting).  I immediately thought about what Logan said and came back to do business with him.  The reason I came back was not only because of the bottom line (Cayenne is pretty much non-negotiable) but because of the service I received at Boardwalk. Your dealership was the only dealership out of four in the area and three in florida that someone actually called me rather than send out an email template.  I must say that the service I received from Logan as well as everyone else at Boardwalk Porsche was outstanding.  He is very personable and his honestly from the beginning set the tone for the relationship.  I respect that he was honest and upfront even if it meant he couldn’t tell me what I wanted to hear.  It is a great reflection of the service I have received from the dealership thus far and a great indicator of the service I will receive in the future.  I am so happy that I walked into Boardwalk Porsche that day and look forward to picking up my Cayenne!

As the service records were not available we were a bit wary to purchase, David Loder and his coworker called the previous owner and asked if he would mind talking to us.  We talked for 8 minutes or so and decided to purchase the car.  We asked to have the BMW dealer check out the car and visited the BMW dealership to make an appointment. The BMW service adviser told us not to waste our money because the staff/service techs at Boardwalk Porsche were excellent and would check out the vehicle as well as BMW could.

455,"March 09, 2011","I had been searching for a Porsche for weeks. During this time I contacted Boardwalk Porsche and Janine Whitney emailed me back promptly. At the time I was looking for a Boxster but living 200 miles away from Plano made the timing difficult for me to look at Boardwalk's inventory before they sold them. I then decided to buy a 911 and bought one promptly from an online dealer in Houston. During this time Janine and I had exchanged many very helpful -to me- emails. So, when I needed someone to look over the 911 I had purchased-there was no hesitation- I contacted Janine and she set it up with Isaac Madrid in the service department. Isaac was just as friendly and informative as Janine had been and made me feel confident that they would inspect the car thoroughly and let me know if they found any issues with it. Isaac communicated with me promptly several times a day to let me know what was going on.If there was any doubt as to exactly what  the problem was he let me talk to the man working on the car,Fred, who took as much time as I needed to fully understand the situation and what my options were. Isaac compiled a list of prioritized steps I should consider doing. Isaac also told me about a February special that reduced all the parts they used by 20 per cent-a great savings that I would have not known of! I took their suggestions and they serviced the car and replaced a few things in a very short time. I went to pick up the car and met all these very friendly and knowledgeable people. They treated me like an old friend and showed me around their most impressive facility and introduced me to anyone that had been involved with my car. While Isaac was showing me the car and explaining a few things to me he noticed something else that he wanted to have done before I took it. Janine started showing me the incredible inventory of gorgeous Porsches Boardwalk has. After learning a little more about my preferences she got the keya and we took a new 911 with PDK out for a spin....wow...I have never been so impressed with a car.There is no doubt what my next car will be and to whom I will go to to buy it. I drove my car home and it has performed flawlessly. Janine has kept in touch to make sure all is well.

The sales process was outstanding. Yes, we negotiated for a long time on price but eventually were able to come to a win win agreement that we all felt very good about. Delivery was fantastic, the car was as advertised, and I drove home with a huge smile on my face!

Next on the list was a few parts from Larry to create a dual purpose car.  Larry is very knowledgeable, timely, and will give you a fantastic price on the parts you need. Unlike most parts guys at the dealers, he is approachable and works directly with customers and not through the service writer. His customers are just as important as the Technicians.  

Then came the time to align the car, add safety equipment, and learn to drive.  Enter Jeromy and John.  Jeromy does a fantastic job of scheduling the service, managing the resources, and delivering the vehicle on time.  John is simply the best tech out there for a GT3.  He loves talking to customers, has a passion for the cars, and really knows how to get the most out of the car for the driver.  John will spend countless hours answering your questions, helping you make decisions, and then implementing what you ultimately decide.  He is a real asset to Boardwalk and the Porsche brand.

He was very friendly and answered all my questions about the various Porsche models.  I have not had any problems with my car, and I will be bringing it back to Boardwalk for service in April (major tune up and annual State Inspection).  A few months ago, I noticed a slow leak in my rear tire.  I was able to drive it to Boardwalk, where they immediately put my car on a rack and discovered a small puncture.  They invited me into the shop area for a look.  Fortunately, they had the identical replacement tire in stock, and I was out the door in no time.  I am a satisfied customer of Boardwalk Porsche.

483,"March 04, 2011",I was in the market for a clean used '09 or newer Carrera S.  I made a number of trips to Boardwalk to drive different cars they got in and at no time did I feel like my level of service was being compromised just because I kept coming to look and didn't end up buying.  I really appreciated this attitude and I was thrilled when Adrian contacted me about a car that he was pretty sure was exactly what I was looking for.  It turns out he was right and the trade-in of my GT-R for the 2009 Carrera S went smoothly.  ,5.0
484,"March 04, 2011","I started my relationship with Boardwalk Porsche in 2007 with my 2006 911 after relocating from the Chicago area. The service team welcomed me immediately as if I were a long time customer and provided over the top service, products and expertise. I start each morning with a quick chat at Starbucks with my service advisor.

Based on my service experience, I developed a realtionship with Mike Marsh and in January 2010 I purchased a cayman for my mom who is a proud Porsche owner and continues to be very complimentary of the Boardwalk team. The experience was fantastic. At this time I had just taken delivery of an E550 and Mike introduced me to the Panamara!

By October 2010, I was convinced that the Panamara was the car for me with a sedan and the 911 handling. I worked with Mike Marsh and Adrian Jacobs who made this deal happen as I traded both the E550 and 911 for the Panamara. Adrian understood my needs and located the perfect car for me! As a long time German car owner, this is the most amazing car I have owned and driven. Adrian went out of his way to make this happen! As I took delivery, the service team greated me as well and asks abouth the car each morning!

Each day I am stopped and asked about the car and I immediately recommend Boardwalk and Adrian Jacobs.

Thank you Boardwalk Porsche!    ",5.0

While paperwork was being drawn, I had a tour of the entire dealership and met many of the staff.  David handled my paper work and made my purchase complete very promptly.  Next it was back to Tracy who spent more time with me and my new car, even going so far as to linking my cell phone to the car's memory.  He knew a great deal about the car and made me feel right at home quickly.

They kept telling her to wait and bring back her husband. The car was for her! We never had this problem with Boardwalk... David is very knowledgable about Porsche... He owns one... that speaks well... he believes in what he is showing you!

The overall service level I have received from Boardwalk Porsche has been exceptional.  I work in the service industry and have very high expectations, I have yet to be disappointed.  My experience has added to my passion for sports cars.  I started tracking my first Porsche leveraging their service department for upgrades and track setup.  My third Porsche purchase was a dedicated Porsche race car for PCA Club Racing.  I won't let anyone else service my Porsches.  John Gladwill and Tim Shaffer are fantastic to work with and provide excellent communication during any service event.

At no time did I feel like I was pressured to buy. Mark asked what I thought about the vehicle and I then asked about financing. Everyone Mark introduced me to (David, Chris) was friendly and professional. To make a long story short, I bought the Porsche.

I trust the service department for timely, meticulous and thorough repairs.  I'm from Austin and drive 200 miles past other Porsche dealerships to take my car to Boardwalk, they are truly an exemplary dealership.

I never feel like I'm being oversold on services or products and their mechanics keep my financial limits in mind when proposing work in steps. You can find cheaper rates elsewhere but you won't be getting the up to date factory trained professionals of a Porsche dealership.  They know all the small issues others overlook or don't know about.  And if you track your Porsche anywhere in Texas they are the go to group for advice and service. ",4.8

496,"February 28, 2011","I recently purchased my second Porsche 911. I spent a lot of time surfing the web looking for a used 911 targa. I ended up purchasing from Boardwalk Porsche in Plano, Tx. Living in Houston I had to rely on internet pics. The Targa I was looking at was Porsche pre-certified, which gave me peace of mind. I negotiated with Logan on the purchase and before I knew it I had inked a purchase. Logan also worked with me on getting Bluetooth capability. Logan picked me up at airport and in 2 hours I was driving the Targa back to Houston! The Targa was as advertised and the one issue I had got resolved in minutes to my satisfaction. I also financed thru Porsche, as they offered a lower rate than my Credit Union. I will definitely keep Boardwalk Porsche in mind on my next purchase.

Thanks Logan & Boardwalk Porsche Management for a great experience.

Jeromy Boulet has done an excellent job of making sure needed service has been done quickly with quick pick up of a Porsche loaner for me and checking to be sure the service was done with excellent quality and care for my cars.

Larry Irby, the parts manager, is a super guy to work with for add on equipment for the cars and really goes all out to find what I need.

However since I'm looking for a very special 2011 Cayenne S with Panorama roof, air-suspection, and preimum plus configuration, which is not available at any Porsche dealer at that moment, I had to call Daivd to find out the ordering time and detail.  I was pleased to received a copy of Boardwalk Porsche pre-order list that there are cars that fit my criteria.

I finally met with David in Dec 2010, and was very please by his services. The price negotation was smooth and pleasant.  Deposit was made and David provide regular email to inform me about the delivery status.

Due to holiday season in Germany, the car was delay in production.  By the time the Cayenne arrived to the dealer, there was a month delay compared with the estimated arrival date.  Nevertheless, David kept me informed of the situation.  

On the day of my car collection, a Saturday, I was on my way back from a business trip in Canada.  The flight is scheduled to land in DWF at 19:40.  David went the extra miles to have the contract, keys and the car available for me to collect at 20:30 on a Saturday night.  My wife and I are very please of the services David provided.  We drove our new car from Dallas to Houston the very next day for business trip, and it couldn't be happened without David's help.

Overall, I'm very please and happy to refer this dealer to my friends and family.  For my next car purchase, I will definitely give David a call first.
