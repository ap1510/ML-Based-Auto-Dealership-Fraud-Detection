8,"September 21, 2019","September 16th, 2019...I'm a disabled Marine Corps veteran. I just drove in 2 hours to see a 1998 chevy at the loan ranger location. As agreed over the phone with Lyndi Mark's, I had the required income and down payment. I was excited about this purchase because it was for my son that's an active duty Marine stationed in California but they tried to shove down my throat other trucks i didnt come to see AND asking for a $7,000 down payment on a $10,000 truck. Shakedown! UNETHICAL! SCANDELOUS! Waste of my xxxx time!",1.0
9,"August 26, 2019","I went in for an oil change which was scheduled at 8:00am, my vehicle was not even looked at until 9:10am.  I asked what was the point of making an appointment and was told that that just, means you are next in like behind the walk-ins.  So I asked what's the point of making an appointment and he had no response.
   The next event was really frustrating, a technician came out and told me that the aluminum lug nut covers had swollen and they could not rotate the tires because of this issue.  The lug nut covers are factory issue, so I asked does Ford or Arrow cover that issue.  The technician told me that this happens all the time but there is nothing they can do except recommend that we replace them with steel luguts because they don't swell.   Well the wheel can not be taken off unless you hammer the covers off and break them off so all the luguts have to be replaced ar a cost of over $350!!  This really frustrated me because they and factory issue, and Arrow Ford is aware of this problem and yet they just pass it off as you are out of luck.  Why they don't fix the luguts when they receive the vehicles or at least notify the Ford owners/buyers of this problem is beyond me.  To top it off, they need to keep my vehicle probably all day since they have to get Lugnut parts and finish the work.  A one hour oil change has turned into an all day $400 fiasco.
 I have never had issues like this with other vehicles I have purchased, and I'm very disappointed with Ford and this dealership, apparently they just don't care about the vehicles they sell or their service.

Everyone I dealt with, from the service advisor to the mechanic to the shuttle driver, was great. ",5.0

Every time I go in to buy a new vehicle I can never leave with one, they low ball your vehicle and don't want to work with you, so when I leave I can always find another dealership to work with me.

18,"January 10, 2017","I recently purchased a 2013 Ford F-150 from Arrow Ford.  Cynthia Cantrell was my Sales Consultant.  Cynthia had sold my wife a 2013 Ford Edge in 2014.  We were impressed with her exceptional knowledge of the vehicles she sells.  That is the main reason I contacted Cynthia Cantrell when I decided to purchase a truck.  I had contacted Cynthia a few days before and she emailed me a list of trucks that met my criteria. When I arrived at Arrow Ford, I was amazed how professional she handled the sale.  She introduced me to various service personnel and others that I might contact with in the future to service my truck. I highly recommend Cynthia Cantrell, she is truly a professional.",5.0
19,"August 07, 2016",My entire dealing with Arrow Ford and Clay Anderson has been nothing short of excellent! Clay my salesman was very professional and helpful from the first time I spoke with him . He has answered all my questions and returned every phone call and text message. Did not feel pressured at any time. They did not try and slip some hidden fee in on me . What Clay told me was what I got! Very proud to deal with someone that will look me in the eye and shake my hand . Thank you Clay Anderson and Arrow Ford! ,5.0
20,"June 26, 2016",Bob Crozier was really professional in our entire dealings with him. He answered all our questions and treated us with respect. He told us he had only been there for about 3 months but he acted like a real gentleman and professional. We also really appreciated Loy and his treatment to us and tried to get us the best deal possible. We would recommend these two gentlemen to anyone needing a new car. We are really enjoying our new Ford Edge.,5.0
21,"May 24, 2016","Great experience, Scott Jacobs was my salesman and he made sure everything ran seamlessly.

23,"October 18, 2015","Everyone I came into contact with at Arrow treated me more like family and less like a customer or stranger, they were all very kind and professional and seemed happy with their job and the company they work for. My new to me truck is just what the doctor ordered and any question or concern I had was answered or dealt with quickly and painlessly, anything that wasn't know immediately was soon found out and answered or solved ASAP. This was the smoothest and best car buying experience I have ever had at a dealership. I walked in not sure if I was going to buy anything, just browsing really, and left with a vehicle I am very pleased with and a great deal. If you are even mulling over a new ride, stop in and let them show you how it should be done. Will Hopkins, in particular, made the experience as pain and stress free as car buying can be. You will walk in a customer and walk out with a new car and a new friend. Thanks again Arrow and Will!",5.0

25,"September 27, 2015","This has been our 3 vehicle from Arrow and the main reason why we continue to go to only Arrow is because of Adam!!!! This dealership truly has a hero! He is a person we never consider a ""salesman"", he is way more than that. He provides friendly, passionate, and  thorough service. He constantly stays in contact with his customers to be sure they are and continue to be satisfied with their purchase. I only hope that Adam's supervisor is truly aware of what a fine employee Arrow has. You all hit the jackpot with Adam! Keep him happy, and customers for your company will continue to multiply. Thank you again Adam! June/Michael Keith",5.0
26,"September 04, 2015",I bought my son a used truck to go to college and brant bunker was awesome! He helped with everything from start to finish. Arrow ford is the BEST!!!,5.0
27,"August 15, 2015","When we visited Arrow Ford for this purchase we came in contact with Adam.  I did not want a new vehicle I needed one so he had his work cut out for him.  He was fantastic from the very beginning.  It took me over a month to decide if I wanted another Explorer or change to a Fusion or Edge and he was very patient with me.  He even told me to take enough time to be sure as he wanted me to be happy with it.  He was great, he kept me updated on new inventory and I probably drove half a dozen vehicles.  I finally decided on a Fusion then took a few more days to decide exactly which one I wanted.  The day I of purchase we took care of things on the phone and when I got there that afternoon he had everything ready to go in finance.  It was quick and easy.  The finance guy was also great.  I have always bought from Arrow Ford and my previous salesman is no longer there but I'm very glad Adam is.  We will definitely call him next year when it's time to get my daughter a vehicle.",5.0
28,"August 12, 2015","Purchase a truck from a young salesman named Bryson Florez. He was very patient and an excellent salesman! I thought I had the truck I wanted the first week, but couldn't get the manager to put a new tire to match the new front right. So about 5 days later Bryson called and said there's a new used certified truck that just came in. I went and looked at it and the next day I purchased a certified truck that fit my needs better than the truck the week before that wasn't certified for about the same cost. I'm sure glad I held off and Bryson called me!! Thanks. Sincerely,

29,"July 29, 2015","From Ft. Worth, had an Escape break down on Saturday evening. Had Extended Warranty that covered the issue with the throttle housing, and towing. Sat I called an old friend who has his own repair shop, managed to get it there for him to look at. He hooked it up to the computer diagnostic, told me what it showed. Told me to take to Arrow as on warranty, wrote the code down . 
Monday morn was at Arrow at 725am. Service tech knew the friend taken to Sat. said they'd get.it towed,let me know as soon as they verified problem, and how long to fix. I told him I had to be back  in Ft. Worth Wed. for an important meeting with my employer so I needed to know asap. Right after lunchtime I get an automated call from Ford roadside assistance telling me wrecker on the way. I went by the friends shop to be there, little upset it took 5+ hours to get a wrecker. I waited and waited. No wrecker. Finally roadside assistance calls back to check, be sure picked up. Told them no. They called the tow company, then said he was finishing another job, would be there in 30 minutes.  At that point , around 2pm, I left the key with the friend, told him what they said. Was not real happy. An hour and a half later, after I called the service manager at Arrow the tow truck showed. 330pm. 8 hours it took to get it picked up. The service manager kept telling me they had it because a work order was written at 11am and wouldn't be until they did. I told her no , I was looking right at it. She said maybe they got the wrong one but would check. She never called back. The wrecker arrived though so I let it go, but a day was wasted. Tuesday I waited until 2pm, no word, so went by Arrow to check on it. Originally was told the throttle sensor or housing itself would need replacing. When I got to Arrow they said it was ready. Surprised no one had called I asked the clerk if sure, had they just needed a sensor. She said yes. I checked out. The friend with the shop asked what they did. I had to take back a 4runner he loaned me so showed him the paperwork.. He read it, told me no sensor replaced, Arrow simply reprogrammed the computer. I asked if that would take care of it, he shrugged, said be surprised if did from his 40+ years of experience but drive around town a lot before heading back to Ft. Worth. He was right. I got about two miles up on the highway and the engine light came on again and it started missing when changing gears. I made it back , called Arrow, left a rather strong message on their service managers voice mail, told what happened, please call asap. Never heard a word back. Took back to friends shop, asked if he would fix.  It may cost several hundred dollars but I'll know it's done right.  Had to reschedule meetings in Ft. Worth, which was not easy,  all because of Arrows lack of concern, unprofessional attitude, wasting a day trying to get towed, then not fixing right. Plus I will have to pay since they didn't fix under warranty right. Total fiasco. Never had these kind of problems with Bankston in Ft. Worth. Much more professional, take care of you. Arrow, always heard had a bad reputation, I found out the hard way why so.",1.0
30,"July 16, 2015","Took our car in yesterday for an oil change and to have the transmission checked under warrenty...called service writer at 4 to check on the car, left a message...called at 5 ;;;left another message..no call back...called  service writer this morning at 830..left message.. no call back..called the dealer ship at 930, talked with two different people to check status of our car...the second person said she would have the service writer call us...which she did a few minutes later...said our car was ready for pick up. service writer claimed the excuse was she hadn't received any messages  , while in her booth waiting to speak with the transmission tech, the service writer in the next booth which we could hear very well was returning calls..guess his phone must have worked.. you know..can;t say i was lied to, but i can say that if they were going to keep the car, that a simple phone call stating that was in order..they know nothing about customer service, when the warrenty is up on this car...we will never set foot in this business again...not happy.",2.2

37,"September 26, 2014",Our kids have outgrown the need for a mini van. So we decided to look for a car. When we left Sweetwater I had Arrow Ford in mind to start looking. Me and my wife pulled in and parked and kinda bypassed all the salesmen. We just wanted to look. We walked over three used lots at Arrow. We really liked the Taurus but we kept looking. We did not want ANYTHING with leather just our preference. After we agreed on what we wanted we went inside and talked to Mando Calderon. He tried to help us but he had been out a while and had A LOT of catching up to do. He put us in the hands of Scott Pugh. He took us for a test drive and made the car buying experiance an easy thing for us. We will be repeat customers.,4.4
38,"September 26, 2014","After looking at serveral dealerships both local and dallas. I found Adam Keidl by far the easiest to work with (even with a couple of strange request). I walked on to many different lots in a 3 day span ready to buy (check in pocket), every single other person or dealership was a serious pain to talk to or just plain unfriendly. Adam was very helpful, friendly and made buying a car very easy, even with a harder to find model. I will go back the next time I buy new/used.",5.0
39,"September 18, 2014","Adam Keidl was outstanding in his service and assistance to me.  I am one of those folks who is always reluctant to purchase a new vehicle. Don't like the payments or the hassle.  Adam and the rest of the team at Arrow Ford made it effortless and as pain-free as possible.  I've had my 2014 Toyota Camry SE for a week now and love it.  I would recommend Adam and the rest of the Arrow Ford team to anyone.

Thanks again!

40,"September 15, 2014","Adam Keidl went above & beyond the call of duty to find us a vehicle we were looking for.
He had been in touch with us for 6 months keeping us informed on the type of vehicle the dealership had gotten in that we were looking for. One day we drove onto the lot and looked at two Expeditions  and fell in love with one. After some wheeling & dealing we struck an agreement and the deal was made thanks to Kyle Kevil and his determination to help us keep our payments in a range we could handle. We love our vehicle and really appreciate how Adam & Kyle both went out of their way to help us get into the vehicle of choice. Thanks ! God Bless",4.6
41,"September 15, 2014",After getting my car totaled because of the hailstorm it was time to go car shopping not because I wanted to but because I had to and I will say that my experience shopping for my first car was a win. Great staff and such a great salesman that stuck with me until I got into the car I wanted. He was patient and never seemed frustrated and until this day I get phone calls just checking up on my purchase and making sure everything is still going well. overall my experience with arrow ford has been a great one!,5.0
42,"September 11, 2014","The best car buying experience I've ever had!  I drove all the way from Arlington Tx to Abilene Tx on the advice of a friend.  Great decision!  My salesman Zane Goggans was extremely friendly and helpful.  I was very picky and had a list of MUST HAVES for an SUV.  He found everything on my list in one car , gave me a fantastic deal on my trade in, and an excellent price on my new car.

43,"September 07, 2014","I decided to trade in my used Chevrolet. So I started browsing online at different Ford dealerships. I found the exact F150 that I had been looking for and for a good price at Arrow Ford. When I called to see if the truck was still on the lot and to get some extra info, I was transferred to Adam Keidl and he was so friendly! He even got everything done over the phone for me so that I didn't have to make an unplanned trip to Abilene (I live an hour away). And my beautiful truck was delivered the next day to my office! Needless to say, I am a very happy Ford girl again. Thanks Arrow Ford!",4.8
44,"September 07, 2014","Got back from a deployment, had to get my oil changed.  
I got a trade in letter while I was gone so I brought that with me.  I had no intention of even looking at a different car, but Adam just casually mentioned hey, wanna check this one out real quick? It was the same color and interior of my old car, that's the only reason I even looked.  He said hey, take it home for the day, and let us know tomorrow.  By the time I got home, I knew I was gonna take it.
Quite brilliant on his part.  There was no pressure, I just told him what I wanted, and he matched it up.  Just happened to be the first one I looked at.
 I consider Adam a friend now and truly believe he cares about what he does, which is really all you ask from anyone.",5.0
45,"September 06, 2014","I was referred by a co-worker who had recently bought a car from Arrow Ford. I was a first time car buyer, with less than perfect credit. Adam Keidl was great to help me find a car in the perfect price range that would fit my requirements. My husband and I showed up right around 5 pm, Adam worked diligently with us to get all the paperwork signed and submitted for the financing companies. Though everything was closed at that point we were able to get one response which allowed us to have the car and come back the very next day and sign all the papers. I was very pleased with not only Adam's service and friendliness but also everyone else who helped with our financing. I will definitely refer people to Arrow Ford. I could not have asked for a better buying experience for my first time. Thanks Adam!",4.8
46,"September 05, 2014","I gave Arrow Ford a call one day and basically stated that I was looking for a new family vehicle.  The receptionist was very nice and patched me through to Adam Keidl.  I told Adam exactly what I was looking for and what price range we needed.  My husband and I were able to come in two days earlier than our scheduled appointment and Adam was able to accommodate us.  All it took was one look at the vehicle we now have and we were hooked.  The space was exactly what we needed for our family.  We are enjoying our new family vehicle so much and can't say thank you enough to Adam, as well as Jerry (Mgr.) Josh (finance) and Greg (finance).

48,"September 02, 2014",I have to say Arrow Ford was a blessing.  My Explorer broke down. It was the first day of vacation. First time in nine years I had to use AAA. There was no repairing the Explorer. Time was close to closing time for the dealership and the Bank. The final hour my banker and Arrows financing was down to the wire. I needed a vehicle in the worst way. I was shown a two thousand twelve Ford Escape. In great shape. Several people stayed to help me. An hour and a half after closing I was very pleased to say everyone unlocked the back garage so I could retrieve my belongings. The Escape was filled with gasoline. Belongings in the Escape and on my way to Longmont Colorado. Everyone worked hard for me without complaining it was closing time and a Friday to boot. Smiles on every ones face at seven thirty I drove off the lot and in a super mood. I have told everyone that would / will listen that if your in need of a new or used vehicle to go to Arrow Ford in Abilene Tx for the best deal in the state of Texas. I cannot remember every ones name. There was another gentleman that helped with everything as well as Joe Nelson and Kyle Wassar. Everyone was the best. They called the next day to inquire  how the vehicle was handling. I let them know it drove like a dream. Great on gasoline. Great handling in the mountains. My son drove it too and really liked it.. I told him when he was ready for another vehicle to meet me in Abilene Texas at Arrow Ford and he would get the best deal ever with the nicest people. ,5.0

65,"July 04, 2014","Our previous vehicle purchased at Arrow Ford was destroyed in a hail storm.  We were without a second vehicle for several days.  While waiting for the Insurance to settle our claim we visited Arrow Ford in Abilene, Texas to look at SUV's.  Adam Keisl met us in the parking lot, introduced himself, and he asked a few questions to determine exactly what we were looking for in a vehicle.  We asked about a few vehicles we saw nearby and Adam answered each question with authority. We told him about our ""totaled"" vehicle and the things we didn't like in it and he suggested we look at a 2013 Ford Edge sitting nearby.  Since it was going to be my wife's vehicle she took it for a ride and really liked it. After my wife and I talked a little we told Adam that we'd like to purchase that vehicle.  Adam took us into his office, he offered us refreshment and made us comfortable.  In what seemed like just minutes, Adam was preparing paperwork and we drove home in the vehicle.  We returned the next day and closed the deal. 

We are VERY pleased with the vehicle, our Salesman Adam Keisl, and with Arrow Ford.  Great Car Dealer and FANTASTIC Salesman.  Every city in Texas should have an Arrow Ford dealership and sales people like Adam Keisl. Many Thanks.",4.8

75,"June 21, 2014","My experience with Arrow Ford Inc. has been the best yet when purchasing a vehicle  First of all, after experiencing a hail storm, with plenty of vehicles that were totaled (including mine), I had a few things on my mind...buying another car was just one of them.  Arrow Ford made the process a breeze.  My assistance began with great help from Tara, over the phone, who answered all of my questions and helped to prepare me with bringing in the proper documents (including those from my insurance company due to my vehicle being totaled from hail damage) and made me feel on-the-ball before even stepping onto the lot (also providing me with her cell phone number in case I had any other questions.  I then came into the dealership and was helped by Brant, who did a wonderful job at finding me my new car.  I went in hoping to get a used car I saw online, but after it sold the night before, he got me into a brand new car, same model, for roughly the same price.  He helped me throughout the entire initial sales process, helping to secure a great deal for me on my new vehicle.  My experience ended with Joshua, whom was on-point with his knowledge of finalizing the sale and explaining everything to me in detail.  As this was the first time I have purchased a vehicle solo, these three individuals helped to make it a wonderful experience and gave me the 1-on-1 treatment needed to not only get me the best deal, but to also explain anything I needed throughout the entire process.  I'm thankful for each and every one of them for all they did for me, especially after going through a hail storm the week before.  They made the process of buying a car a breeze, and now I'm walking away (or driving away) with a brand new car I love.  You can't ask for anything better than that!!!",5.0

Feeling defeated, I stopped in to a convenience store and just asked anybody that would listen if they knew where I could get a rental.  This gentleman said ""go to Arrow Ford, they have rentals"".  I was there in minutes only to find out that the rental department was closed.  However, the nice sales guy saw that I was desperate and told me to give him a second to see what he could do.  He found some nice ladies in the Parts and Service area and they set me up in a rental car just as they were closing for the day.  I had their names written down, but somehow misplaced it, (sorry).  Everyone there went above and beyond and they were so nice to help me out in such short notice.

86,"June 04, 2014","I live in Burleson, TX which is about 150 miles from Arrow Ford. I discovered that Arrow had a 2012 ""specialty"" Lexus model that I was seeking and had a high interest. With the long distance involved, I wanted to insure there were no ""surprises"" about the vehicle before travelling to Abilene. Through a friend I was introduced to Gilbert who called me personally and literally ""walked through the car"" while on his cell phone to describe the condition of the vehicle. Given that, I drove the 150 miles to personally check out the vehicle. I met Maria Carducci for the sales process and frankly had the most pleasant and efficient sales transaction that I've ever experienced. I'm a ""car nut"" and have been through this process several times, and this was my best experience, including purchasing from a Lexus dealership. I couldn't recommend Maria more highly. I then went to Doyle Barker in finance which I sometimes equate to going to the dentist. Doyle could not have made that a more pleasant experience either. He completed all the details as efficiently and smoothly as I've ever seen it done. He exceeded my expectations on a financing option and all with minimum fuss and effort.  Bottom line, Gilbert, Maria and Doyle made this the very best auto purchasing experience I've had. Thanks to all of you.

169,"January 14, 2014","I visited Arrow Ford several months ago as our family anticipated purchasing a new (used) vehicle in the coming year when our daughter would turn 16 and would begin driving our 2010 Ford Focus (which we also purchased from Arrow Ford in 2009, and have been extremely pleased with).  Adam Keidl met my daughter and me on the lot as we were looking at vehicles and was very friendly and personable, as well as knowledgeable about the vehicles that might fit the description of what we were looking for.  Over the next several months, he stayed in contact with me via text and e-mail, just enough that I knew he was thinking about us and keeping our needs in mind, but not so much that it seemed pushy or smothering.  After seeing a vehicle (2012 Escape) online at Arrow Ford that seemed exactly like what I was looking for, my daughter and I visited the lot again about three weeks ago and Adam immediately knew which vehicle we were describing, showed it to us, let me drive it, then offered to let us take it home and see if it was really what we wanted.  While we really did love this vehicle, my husband wasn't ready just yet to make a purchase as we still had several payments left on our Focus.  Adam continued to stay in touch with me about this vehicle, letting me know when the price was reduced, when the time approached for it to move off of the lot, the details of it's history, etc., and as I discussed the Escape with other family members, my mother-in-law and father-in-law visited with Adam more about the Escape, and he went to great length to work with them to purchase the vehicle for our family as a surprise gift!  We have driven Ford cars and done business with Arrow Ford for over two decades now, and Adam is one of a number of employees there who have gone above and beyond to satisfy a customer, even at their own personal expense, to make sure that we are 100% satisfied, and in return we continue to come back to Arrow Ford first for our vehicle needs.

193,"November 15, 2013","Derek was unbelievably AWESOME to work with!!!!! This was my first car buying experience on my own and I could not have found a better person to buy my car from. I had been searching for a very particular F150 model for about a month throughout Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas, emailing a dozen dealerships, and Derek was the only person who in two emails, got me exactly what I wanted for the price I wanted. I do not have a lot of free time to go search lot by lot for a new car, so I did most of my searching and dealership contact over the internet. I had started to get very tired and frustrated talking with representatives from the other dealerships, because they were always trying to get me to come into the dealership in person, or they would try and sell me a car that was not what I looking to buy, and they would not give me straight forward answers to the questions I was asking. Thankfully I found Derek, because what I accomplished talking to him in 2 e-mails was more than I had in about 20+ e-mails with other dealerships. Never did I feel like he was trying to swindle me and I honestly believe he did everything he could to get me the best deal on my new truck. I live in Dallas and my sister who cosigned on my lease lives in Pittsburgh, so we did a lot of talking over e-mails and on the phone with Derek. Within a week, we had everything figured out so that by the time I drove out to Abilene, I pretty much drove up to the lot and exchanged keys - it was such a hassle free buying experience. I drove 3 hours from Dallas to Abilene, passing Ford dealer after Ford dealer along the way, and I would have driven 3 more if it meant working with Derek! I LOVE my new truck and it is all thanks to Derek that I am driving it! I would buy every one of my cars from him if I could. I highly recommend working with Derek, I promise you will not regret it!

Arrow Ford and Adam were the farthest thing from that.  I would purchase a car from them again in a heart beat.

202,"October 15, 2013","Derek Mills was geat!!!  He was very friendly and made sure we were taken care of.  I knew what I wanted when i hit the door thanks to your website and the ease of use of it.  He never pressured us and went out of his way to make sure we had the right fit for us.  You truly have an assett in Derek.

We were a little dissappointed in the service dept. that cleaned out our car before we purchased it.  After we got home we found fruit loops and bulletts between the seats and in storage containers.  Took them quite a long time to clean up the car.  Which is odd to me since we were waiting forever with the finance dept.  When I asked if they were busy that day and had lots of sales three different people told me no not really kind of a slow day.

 We waited an excessive amount of time for the finance guy to fill out the paperwork and as we sat waiting he stood and talked with fellow workers at the front of the building.  We had already been waiting to sign papers for hours, this did not sit well with me.  When we got to the finance office the gentleman just did not feel very personal or professional.  Maybe it was just an off day for him.  

overall experience was good and will continue to do business in the future with Derek. As far as the finance department is concerned they need to take some customer service classes and some time management skills.  I've talked with several people that have bought cars from arrow ford and from other places and consistently have gotten the finance wait time at arrow ford is the worst.  Other places are much more efficent, fast, friendly and willing to go the extra mile.  Derek did what he could but you just can't rush someone who doesn't wanna play the game.",4.6

209,"September 23, 2013","I recommend for Service. I haven't bought a car in Abilene since I was stationed here in the USAF 20 years ago, but my friends have always raved about their salesmen at Arrow. My now 2 year old Escape was a problem from day one. I bought it new in Austin and moved home to Paint Creek 5 months later. It had already been in the shop once. It made a trip to Arrow 2 months later (Feb. '12) and Carrie really came through for me on getting my transmission software updated, yet again, and finding why my truck felt like it was driving through an earthquake every time it got up to 70 mph. It's always great to talk to a woman who knows cars; I was raised in the garage and on race tracks with my grandpa and dad building our cars, so I know what I'm talking about when it comes to wheels. She gave me the respect I have only ever gotten when talking to those who know me and my experience.

Last summer, when a national chain repair shop literally killed my best friend's car, Paul Martinez and ""Awesome Eric"" (in Sales) helped her get into a new car without ripping her off. They also helped her get the money that repair shop owed her for the demise of her former, once perfectly dependable vehicle. (She and I were referred to Paul by another friend who calls him ""MY service guy!"")

This September, I got fed up with multiple issues from my Escape. I took it to Paul Martinez and he was on top of my vehicle's diagnosis the whole time. I was very unhappy to hear that Paul researched my warranty and found that I did not get the warranty I told the Austin dealership I wanted when I bought my vehicle. I am now into extended warranty after only 2 years. NOT what I asked for from Leif Johnson. (Lesson learned; won't happen again.) Paul and his Service crew couldn't get to it for the first three days, and then tried for 2 days to get it to duplicate the problems I had. Nothing. Paul and I drove it together. Nothing. So, under extended waranty,  I had to pay for 5 days of rental car. Kyle and Arrow policy helped me out on two but I still had to pay for three. That was money I really did not have to spare. Three or four days later I checked my bank account and found that someone at Arrow, I don't know who, had refunded me one of those days.Awesome...I didn't even have to ask.

Sometimes, it's the smallest things you do that can make the biggest difference...thanks, Paul!!!",4.6

217,"September 03, 2013","!!!Update to this post. My computer was acting up and changing states that I did not put. I want to make it clear that my experience was an all 5 STAR experience, just read below and find out why.......

Why am I giving this reveiw? Lets start by saying that I work long hours and it was difficult trying to find someone that could work with that. I had contacted many other dealers and came across Arrow Fords web page and the assistant pop up came on and I just asked a question. The next day Aaron Cunningham got back with me. I told him what I was looking for and that I was just looking. He made an effort to find something that I would like. We made a deal to meet on a vehicle, but he call me and told me that it would be more than what I wanted to pay. He then went on to give me mulitiple options. I figured since he went out of his way I would give him the chance to show me some things. I was really expecting him to sell me on some new car that I didnt want or get me in something that I could not afford. I was surprised to find out that he only wanted to show me other options in the areas of what I wanted to begin with. I just want to thanks him for all that he did for me, by coming in on days off to accomidate my schedule and staying late to help with this process. How many people would do that, I know that I would have been like ""Its my day off, can you come in another time?"". I never felt like I was just a sale to him and that I was actually a freind, and that is what happened at the end of this. I didnt find a salesman I found a freind that sales cars.",5.0
218,"September 01, 2013","I am not easy to work with when it comes to buying a vehicle, but I had be best experience  Ever! with Mr. Mike Hilliard buying my car.

We discussed how to rebuild my credit and he gave me the tools to do so.  Mike did a wonder job at bring me to a state of self realization of what I SHOULD be looking for in buying a car.  :) 

My family watched as I went through the process and they recognized and appreciated all the hard work Mike put into getting me a dependable car that I can afford and that I Love!

May God Bless Mike Hilliard and continue to show him Favor.

225,"August 12, 2013","After seeing a vehicle in an online ad, my husband called the Arrow Ford and was directed to Cynthia.  She immediately went to work!  She was very knowledgeable.  In fact, she was able to persuade my husband (who was rather reluctant about buying another vehicle) to come visit that afternoon.  When we arrived, Cynthia greeted us warmly.  She already had the vehicle pulled up and ready for a test drive.  Her easy-going manner and knowledge convinced us that this was the vehicle for us, but we were somewhat concerned about the value of our trade-in.  Cynthia to the rescue! She went back and forth with offers and counteroffers and counter-counteroffers many times. She really worked to help get us the most for our trade-in and payments that we were comfortable with.  Even after the purchase of our Expedition, Cynthia continued to check on us to ensure that we were completely satisfied with our vehicle.

235,"July 18, 2013","In Apr 2013 I took my 2002 Sport Trac to Arrow Ford in Abilene, TX for a PCV hose repair, as I was going to sell/trade it in in the near future.  During my wait I decided to stroll down to their used car center to humor my curiosity with prices and trade-in options. Mind you, I was not on a mission to make any type of purchase transaction that day.  But as fate would have it, I was approached by a sales person who only asked how I was and thanked me for my service - I am Active Duty Air Force and happened to be in uniform. Adam Keidl was his name. I informed him of my FUTURE plans to acquire an F-150 (can't imagine why anyone would ever even consider another truck) - that I needed something bigger than the Sport Trac for the 3 car/booster seats I needed to tote around...but it must be an F-150.  We walked the lot telling lies and stumbled upon the perfect match for me and before I knew it we were in his office discussing trade-in values and payment plans.  Now, I understand Adam's job as a salesman and appreciate the ""skills"" which it requires, but I remind you I was merely window-shopping while having maintenance done on a vehicle I had owned outright for eight years.  Nevertheless, he did his job perfectly and reeled me in.  I knew my wife would have my head should I follow through with this, but I was in love with that F-150 and it was a family necessity, so onward we pressed.  I told Adam of the situation - of my ol' lady's reservations - so he handed me the keys, told me to take it home for the weekend, see if the car seats fit, and let my wife ""help"" make the decision.  She loved it but was scared to take on another car payment with all the other priorities we had.  Dejected, I reluctantly returned the truck and explained my predicament. Adam assured me he would keep the truck for me until mid-day the following Monday - ""that's the longest [he] could hide it for"", he joked.  And he did just that.  Early that Monday morning, not 30 seconds from my wife calling me at work to give the thumbs-up to go ahead with the transaction, Adam texted me to see if we were a go, as he had another interested party but wanted to stand good on his promise to me.  To make a very long story short (my apologies), by lunch that day I was the very proud owner of a 2008 F-150 XLT Supercrew with only 27K miles on it.  Adam Keidl was a fantastic salesman.  His professional attitude, knowledge about the vehicle, his skill-set with making me comfortable during the entire nightmarish car-buying process and his flexibility/willingness in getting me exactly what I wanted and needed (i.e. my asked for trade-in value for my Sport Trac and final sales price of the ""new"" truck) was by far the absolute best I have EVER experienced in my many vehicle purchases over the years.  I am a very happy and satisfied Arrow Ford customer and I WILL be a return buyer...hopefully Adam will be there for the next go-around for I will request, make that REQUIRE him to be my salesman.  Thank you, Adam and the entire Arrow Ford Team.

245,"June 28, 2013","I must say that this has been by far the best car experience purchase I have ever encountered. Let’s go back to January 2013. I purchased a 2007 Jeep Wrangler in January 2013. Four months later a piston blew out the engine. Come to find out Crysler sent an inspector out to inspect the Jeep and it was just a mechanical malfuction that caused it to blew out. At this point I was asking myself what I should do because the warranty had expired one month prior. So I decided to call Adam Kiedl the salesman who I dealt with when I bought the 2007 Jeep Wrangler and asked him can we look into trading it in. With no hesitation he said yes and he tried his very best from that day forward to get me in a car because I did not have one. I realized at that point  that he was very considerate about my situation and he wasn’t concerned with making money but was more concerned about his customer. After a few days of wheeling and dealing with financial intuitions we sealed the deal and I ended up getting a brand new 2013 Ford Taures!

259,"June 01, 2013","Our Sales person was Tate Ellison. We originally went to the dealership to look. That was one of the reasons we did not bring the car we may trade in because we had no real plans to buy that day. He showed us exactly what we were looking for. Normally no one finds what they are looking for exactly, but we did. Can you imagine, this was an 8 year old truck with miles of a newer vehicle, in fact LESS than a new vehicle and in just as nice of shape inside and out. Tate was helpful in all ways. Once we made the deal he stayed with us until Doyl handled our paperwork. We had a bit of that to do because we were not prepared as I had said. We feel the whole experience was very friendly, knowledgeable and we will come back when it is the wife's turn for her car, if I can get her to give up her ""Gator"" ( Navigator).

Not only was Tate a great guy, so was Doyl, along with Derek that tried to help us anytime Tate was a bit busy doing something else. Everyone had a smile on their face and everyone was friendly. We got coffee, water and popcorn and a new Truck...What else do you need for a Friday afternoon?",5.0
260,"May 31, 2013","First off let me start with the customer service; it was excellent. I was greeted promptly upon entering by Tate, and offered a drink before we went outside to look at different cars in my price range. I was extremely surprised on how low the prices were, and it broadened the range on vehicles I could afford. Tate read off a few cars, and I asked for something a little sportier. Right after, he said he had just what I wanted. We walked up to the silver dodge avenger, which I now own, and I fell in love. The car was perfect for me. The combination of sportiness, and fuel economy was perfect. We walked back inside, and ran some numbers. It was too much for me to afford, being 18 on a low budget. I left for the day to think about it, and came back the following day ready to buy that car. Tate talked to his manager for several minutes after discussing a price drop, and the third time he came back with a grin. He shook my hand and said, ""The car is yours, sir"". This is the first car that i've bought myself, and the newest i've owned as well. This was an overall exciting experience, and Tate made it awesome with his friendly jokes, and extremely positive attitude. He worked with me better than any of the other dealerships I had previously visited. As a final draw, he took care of the first half tank of gas for me, and also got a few nicks taken out. I still need to pick up my license plates, and get a final inspection from the arrow mechanics, but so far the work, and quality, and overall effort put forward by Tate was awesome. ",5.0

287,"February 21, 2013","We first started off by truck shopping in another town. We did this for two months actually. Two days before we went to Arrow Ford, this other dealership calls and wants us to trade in our old truck, plus cash, and put us in a vehicle we didn't want just because it was 'loaded'.  Aggravated? Slightly.  

We decided to try Arrow Ford the following morning since we hadn't been there.  We are immediately greeted by Derrick Mills.  He asks us what we're looking for and within 2 minutes top, he pointed out our options.  We test drove the one we really wanted and loved it.  We go in to talk numbers, fill out paperwork, and within 30 minutes, the deal had been done.  And one of the best parts?  We only put $300 cash down.  We were even upside down with our trade-in!  HELLO! Now that's what I'm talking about!

During our visit, Derrick was super friendly and clearly very knowledgeable.  <---Actually knew what he was talking about and you could tell that he wasn't just spouting out stuff he had no clue of.  He went over information relating to the truck, what buying a certified truck meant, gave us all the info in a nice folder, etc.  He made sure we were comfortable and never left us alone for longer than a couple of minutes.  He was 'normal like us'....you know what I mean?  He never made us feel stupid (like many do).  He talked about his family, asked us about ours and so on.  Personable while being professional; a quality so many businessman lack today.   While we were signing the financing papers, we kept in touch via text.  He was fast to reply and never led me to believe we were bothering him.  I always knew what he was doing, what was going on, and what was coming up.    One of the best parts before we drove off with our truck, was watching Derrick sync our phones to the truck (for the handsfree feature), and teaching us how to do it.  He has since followed up with us and even mailed us coupons for our future oil changes.  

So you wanna know what I think of Derrick Mills and Arrow Ford?  Freaking awesome. Thank you Jesus for allowing us to leave a dealership happy & satisfied, the first time ever in our 20 year marriage.  It was nice to have Derrick and Arrow Ford take that bad taste out of our mouths that had been put there by other dealerships, all those years.  Two thumbs up, 5 stars, and a 10 out of 10 rating from us.

My only complaint with the dealersip was the finace department, I sat arouund for 2 hours waiting to hear that the rate they could offer me was 3 times as much as what I was getting from my credit union.  And I had told them before hand what the other rate was and they acted as though they could beat it or at least match it.  I know they can't control what the rates are, but I would have hoped they had rough numbers and knew not to waste 2 hours of my day and running my credit in hope that I wouldn't care and get their credit instead.

313,"November 26, 2012","I am a single mother, and though I work, I don't make a lot of money between my child, bills, and all the gas I have to put in my car to get back and forth from work, school, and taking my son to school which is across town. For me, money is tough to come by. If you are a single parent or you are married and have kids, you know that times are rough right now.

Arrow Ford is extremely overpriced. They deny responsibility if they work on cars that are 'not their product.' Meaning if you have a GM car, you had better take it to Lawrence Hall, because if Arrow Ford makes a mistake on the repair and service of your car, they will use the excuse, ""Well, we don't have the blueprints because that vehicle is not our product. We do our best."" Unfortunately, they use this excuse very frequently.

I have a 2002 Saturn that has less than 80,000 miles on it. When I got the car, it was from a towing company that gave it to me for free because it had been abandoned. It needed a lot of work, and I took it to Arrow Ford for everything that needed to be done. I paid them around four thousand dollars for everything to be done and fixed - I reasoned that I owed nothing on the car, and so to pay four thousand to get it into good condition was a fair deal.

The last thing that has happened was that a pully snapped from the serpentine belt tensioner and shredded the belt. It pulled the sensor cable from the oil pan that runs to the dash, but didn't damage it - all they needed to do was plug it back in. The Arrow Ford Service Consultant that I spoke to, Mr. Martinez, was clear that this was the only repair that would be needed to get the car running.

To change out a serpentine belt and replace the pully, they charged $476.02 when the local NAPA garage down the street would have done it for about $250.00. For some reason, they didn't know they had to lift the engine out to attach a few cables and replace the belt (duh!), and it took them OVER a week (yes, over a WEEK) to even get that done.

After the belt was fixed, I got a call. The service consultant said that they had replaced the belt and that the car was not fixed. He said it would turn over and run roughly and stall out when idling. He said there was an issue with the engine. I asked why they hadn't noticed it to start with, and he answered me that they did not know because the car was not their product. I asked them to diagnose the issue which took another two days.

When he called me back, he said, ""Well, it's definitely the engine. What were you doing when the belt snapped?"" Oddly enough, the belt snapped when I was pulling into my driveway. The only thing I was doing with it was PARKING.

When I asked what was wrong with it specifically, Mr. Martinez could not give me a straight answer - to make things worse, when I went in, he tried to charge me $526.00 (the 476.02 + the 'labor costs' for them trying to diagnose the issue with the engine) and still did not have a straight answer as to why it would not run. I asked why they hadn't checked the engine before the belt was replaced, and he also did not have an answer for that.

He agreed to knock the price back down tot he 476.02, but it was the last money I had in my pocket at all - so I emptied out my bank account and still did not have a running car.

I thought to ask them if they would take it as a trade in to cover the bill and perhaps purchase a car from them, but the manager only wanted to give me $300.00 for the Saturn which sits on the Blue Books at $4995 when it's in working condition. The car salesman said he 'convinced' his manager to give them $500.00 for it to cover the bill, but it still put nearly nothing towards a new car. So literally, I was still out the 476.02 that they were trying to charge me for labor and parts on a car that was STILL not running.

I asked why the problems were not diagnosed to start with. I received no answers. Just that they needed the money for the labor and the parts. Now, while I can be very pointed with people, this was not one of those times. I was very polite and worked with them the best that I could, but this car company has made it very clear that they are more interested in milking customers and clients of every penny they have - unapologetic - without providing results. All to gain a profit for the company.

Because they would not further diagnose the car, I had to moved to Lawrence Hall Chevrolet where they diagnosed the problem as indeed the engine, and they explained EXACTLY what was wrong with it. Apparently, pieces of the serpentine belt got wrapped up in the timing belt pullies and it jumped time. I asked Arrow Ford WHY this happened, and their mechanics did NOT catch it. Their service manager, Tom, promised they'd get to the bottom of it, and not to worry, they'd have me back on the road and they would work with the bill at Lawrence Hall.

None of that happened.  Arrow Ford Service talks a good game, but when it comes to action, they do absolutely NOTHING!! ",1.0

The other employee I worked with was Kyle Wasson, Finance, who was methodical and not at all pushy.  The financial set up went very smooth.

320,"September 21, 2012","Very good Sales People.. Very POOR Service.. All i have to say is if you cant sell a car you are proud of knowing your customer is going to have peace of mind, you should'nt be selling cars.. We have bought 10 cars from Arrow ford and we loved them, but of course we had very good sales people, that took pride in what they sold, Like MIKE HILLIARD, MAX HARDIN, these guys wouldnt sell me a car or anyone if they new it had problems, i know that for a fact, they made sure i was treated fair when it came to service.. But  no its not like that anymore.. I love fords, but this may be my last.. Long story short, two weeks after buying a used F350 it started to stall and check engine light came on.. thought i would get the same service from my sales team, nope.. i brought it in they checked the light said nothing was wrong & recomended i buy an extended service plan.. least they could've done was be honest with me, before i was stranded 150miles away from here.. So i took the vehicle in to my Mechanic he as  a professional addressed the issues and well after $2,500 dollars in repair i have an awesome working truck.. all he had to do was check the light and tell me the egr cooler was clogged! in less than 5min.. So if you want good service after the sale Go elsewhere with your money, may i recommend Lawrence hall lincoln they have a great service team, all my vehicles get serviced there and my diesels at Abilene diesel performance, real diesel guys..",3.2

A month and a half later, Arrow Ford dealership was great when I needed them on a Friday p.m. at closing hours.  I was broke down about 100 miles from them.  They sent a wrecker right away to pick up my truck I had purchased, had minor electrical problems with sensors. Becky in service got my truck to the mechanics pretty fast. When my vehicle was ready they took care of everything with no cost to me. 

It is wonderfull knowing there is a dealership that stands by their customers and vehicles.  I will tell my friends to go to Arrow Ford to buy thier next vehicle. I will go back to them when ready to buy another truck.

Knowing that cell coverage in that area is spotty at best, my first thought after determining that it was a problem I could not fix myself, was about getting help.  I shouldn’t have been concerned for a moment.  Four vehicles stopped within the next 30 minutes (it is likely more would have if there hadn’t been someone stopped there already) to offer assistance- from the use of a cell phone to food and blankets.  We were soon towed  to Arrow Ford where our Expedition was taken over immediately by a couple of mechanics. They had us ready continue on our trip within a few minutes.  When we went to settle our bill, we were told there would be no charge.  When I asked why not, I was told “Merry Christmas”.  Wow!  As we got back onto Hwy 36 to continue our interrupted journey, rather than feeling put upon by the circumstances of having our tightly coordinated schedule disrupted, we spent a good part of the rest of our trip counting our blessings and marveling at all the good people we had just encountered.  What a demonstration of the love of Christ!  As for Arrow Ford: to treat us that way when you could have easily taken advantage of us is quite a witness of your true character.

The resolution was (is) more than I expected and the work is being done as I right this.  Jim called me yesterday with an update - a practice he has made since I first contacted him.  He asked if I would allow him to drive it some before I picked it up so he could feel good about everything done (not that he didn't trust the job the service department would do, but that he would do the same for one of his children.)  That made me feel very special.  The fact that the dealership decided to give a whole new engine, rather than just replace a part of it is making me feel very secure about what I am getting.
