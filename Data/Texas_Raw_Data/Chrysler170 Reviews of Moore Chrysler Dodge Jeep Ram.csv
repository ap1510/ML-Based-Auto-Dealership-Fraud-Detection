14,"January 25, 2019","Moore Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram provided us friendly & efficient assistance as my wife and I purchased our first vehicle as a married couple today. We would like to thank everyone involved in our purchase and would especially like to thank the main man who made this wonderful experience possible. We recommend anyone in search for great cars, great deals, and the best service possible to stop buy and let Jimmy add you and yours to the Moore family!",5.0
15,"January 19, 2019","Called ahead to make appt. The lady i spoke with told me they take drive ins, so i told her it was my first service for our Durango. She pulled our veh up with my name. She told me that it would be $41 for oil change and they recommend rotating tires at 10k mi and that was $21. Even though most dealerships do your first few services for free these days (Kinsel, Classic) and Modica will rotate your tires for free i went ahead and brought it to Moore anyway. Well i get there and tell the service advisor what im there for and he asks if i also want the tires balanced???? Doesnt that go along with getting your tires rotated???? No.... apparently not at Moore, oh and thats another $20.... so now were up to $82. Well, everything gets done and i go to check out and no one can find the cashier... and the other two ladies sitting around back there are like, ""we dont know where she is"". Neither were concerned enough to even get out of their seats to do anything. When the cashier gets back (she was on break) she gives me a bill of $118... i told her that this aas far more than i aas quoted! She told me that the Durango takes a special type of oil (i was being charged $66 not $41). I told her the lady who gave me that price k ew what type of veh i had... she had it pulled up! The cashier says, ""oh well, there is nothing i can do about it"". Doesnt give me someone to speak with or anything, just a severe lack of concern. I told her, ""thank you and i wont be back"". And i wont be back, very poor service.",1.0
16,"January 19, 2019","Very efficient and professional dealership with personable staff. The schedule for upgrading was timely and worked very well into my schedule. 

I was told to arrive at a specified and they were ready to take my vehicle back and promptly resolved the issue. 

Thanks",5.0
17,"January 16, 2019",We had a wonderful experience with the salespeople. We decided to get another quote from another dealership to compare offers.  We ended up with a upgraded vehicle at a better price from Moore. It was nice to end up making the best deal we could and so close to home.   We will be purchasing our next vehicle from them.,5.0
18,"January 16, 2019",Salesman was helpful in find the right Jeep for me. Had it inside when I arrived because of cold weather. Nice and thoughtful. Quoted me a price I felt was agreeable and good price on my trade in ,5.0
19,"January 16, 2019","First, the customer service by the two people that I dealt was awesome.  However, after having my car for three solid days for a part that needed to be replaced, I picked it up and it was covered in bugs on the front along with lots of gas gone.  They had to do an extended test drive to make sure that the part did not fail, but after driving it at least 100 miles they did not even bother to put gas in it or clean the bugs off that accumulated during the test drive.  So, essentially I paid to have my car (with 7,000 miles on it) in the shop when it was under warranty. I contacted my salesman (Jimmy) so he could let the service department know so they could correct in the future and he did offer to wash my car the next time I was in town. I have had no complaints previously about this dealership because they have been wonderful anytime I have dealt with them, but this trip was very disappointing.",3.4
20,"January 02, 2019",We had a great salesman who made buying our new Dodge a pleasure. Everyone was friendly and got the job done fast! They got the price where it needed to be for us.,4.8
21,"December 30, 2018","We had many varieties to choose from, the salesman was not pushy in any way, his goal was to find what I liked and financing was very easy as well.  Everyone was so friendly, and I love my new Jeep Cherokee...  (If you are looking to buy a car with as little stress as possible go to MOORE CDJR in Silsbee,  Texas)bud",4.8
22,"December 30, 2018","As a first time buyer I was nervous about how the whole process would go from start to end. I went to the dealership with a specific vehicle in mind and ended up with a little bit of an upgrade because the salesman got me a good deal on another similar vehicle with more features. The process went very smoothly. Everyone in the office was attentive and hospitable, but I will say that once it came time to seal the deal and sign the paperwork, things got a little bit pushy. I didn't feel like I was given enough time to read everything I was agreeing to (or at least glance over it) and that was nerve wracking for me, since I was a first time buyer as I said before. But overall, I think the people there are honest and knowledgable and kind. I would recommend the dealership to anyone in the market.",4.6
23,"December 28, 2018","Had a terrible experience here.. Wouldn’t recommend this dealership to anyone! All snakes in the grass and liars. 
30 plus days after signing financing documents and taking the truck home they told me that I needed to bring the truck back because they couldn’t finalize the financing. They even sent a wrecker to my house to “repossess” the truck when my bote wasn’t due until the 26th of January.. Wow just wow. ",1.0
24,"December 28, 2018","Dealership must have issues washing cars. New Jeep has permanent paint damage from bugs. When I complained, they ""washed them off"".... lies. Also the tail light was damaged. Salesman wrote up that a new one will be ordered. Days later the service department called and they will not order the light until they verify the issue. The fact that it was nogotiated before I bought the Jeep did not matter. I now need to drive 30 minutes for them to order the part. I don't like spending money to be frustrated. ",2.6
25,"December 28, 2018",Friendly and effective. Great experience overall. I've gone to other Dodge service departments in my area and they're not particularly effective or efficient. ,5.0

27,"December 19, 2018","Best car dealership! Great service! Got me the best deal, and treated me like family. Would buy again from them. I would also recommend to anyone to go see them. ",5.0
28,"December 19, 2018","We received a pre-approval letter in the mail, & I threw  it away because we have bad credit. However, Miguel called the next day & guaranteed we were approved. Linus called a few hours later, & he also, guaranteed approval. We ended up having to get a co-signer, but Miguel helped us through the process & made it pretty simple. 

Other than that, everything else went great! My husband & I looked around the lot making sure we got exactly what we wanted for a fair market price. No one pressured us into anything & we were given space to talk amongst ourselves. Miguel was knowledgeable, friendly, & helpful. We made an offer & Miguel brought Mike Moore into it at that point, & he brought the price down to within $200 of what we asked. We were very pleased!

Overall, we had an excellent car buying experience. No pressure, fair prices, friendly, knowledgeable staff. I would definitely recommend Moore Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram to anyone looking to purchase a car. ",4.8

139,"May 11, 2018",I went in last Saturday just to look.  I got interested in a Dodge Journey. I asked about the Bluetooth capability and was told it had everything.  We ran the numbers and ended up making a deal.  When I got home and tried to hook my stuff up to it I discovered it had nothing.  I came back to the dealership on Tuesday and spoke to the manager and he asked me to give him until Thursday since his parts person was off.  He said he would make it right.  We shook hands.   It is now Friday I have received no response and am now sitting outside the dealership cooling my heels since they are all “in a meeting.”  I feel like the salesman was deceptive and the manager is deliberately trying to not deal with me.  I want to return the vehicle and wash my hands of this dealership. ,2.2

144,"May 07, 2018","After searching a number of  dealerships for a quality well priced used ford mustang I was contacted by a very polite and knowledgeable salesman named Jacob Sparks at the Moore CDJR dealership in Silsbee with just what I was looking for and it was. From the moment I arrived I was impressed by the ease Jacob made of the whole process. From greeting me at the door too the appraisal of my trade too the really informative test drive too the overall quality of the vehicle. Which happened to be an anniversary edition with all I could have wanted and more. I appreciated that Jacob was able to handled all the paperwork without the lengthy back n fourth on price. My trade appraisal was more than fair and when I got to financing Clark made it easy to understand giving me options without trying to oversell me. I was right where I needed to be on payments as he wrapped up my experience with ease. I left the dealership with the Mustang I really wanted feeling really good about the purchase I had made and knowing if any problems arise I can call Jacob and it will be handled. A big thanks goes out to Jacob, Clark, and the whole Moore CDJR team for such good car buying experience.

Enjoyed working with Jacob Sparks as he worked out the details in finding us the perfect vehicle, a 2018  Dodge Journey SE. He was patient and kind, easy to work with and friendly. He didn't pressure us into anything but gave us the freedom of making our own decision  about the car and let us drive it to make sure it would serve our purpose and taste. 

We also want to thank Melina for sending us to Jacob and Clark to work with us to make sure we could get what we needed and to be able to handle the finance. This is the second new car we have purchased in many years and we are glad to have dealt with 1More Better Deal of Silsbee. We love our Dodge Journey and would recommend anyone needing a car to drive to Silsbee because it is worth the trip.

Let me just say, that truck is mine now, I'm 47 years old and this is the first brand new vehicle I have purchased, and when I look at buying again, this will be my first place to shop.
