0,"October 05, 2019","We purchased a 2018 Edge Sport from them on May of 2018 at a great price, but we started having serious vibration issues coming from the rear doors while the car was still under full warranty. It was a bizarre problem, but it was very clear; the rear doors would both vibrate so loud that you could not have your arms on them while sitting in the back seat. They had the car for almost 3 months and managed to fix nothing and ended up getting a very negative attitude, to the point where they wouldn't even honor their own warranty and even said we were making up the problem because they claimed they couldn't hear any issues, which makes me wonder what they were trying to fix for 3 months if they didn't see any issues. The service rep repeatedly lied to me about progress and what they had done to the car, and didn't even provide paperwork for anything done to the car. What they were doing made zero sense as far as fixing any issue goes. One of the owners, Dave, personally ended up telling me that  they could not fix it and to take it to a big city dealership, that they were ""too country to be able to fix the issue"" and they were ""too busy to spend time chasing noises and rattles"". He also complained that they had spent many hours working on the car and they were losing money so they could not afford to work on it anymore.  Their entire attempt to fix it was to replace a single part, and then ""feel around"" and hope the issue was fixed. They gave me back the car 3 times and every time I could hear the issue driving home from the dealership. I took the car to Brinson Ford Lincoln in Athens (note that this is a much ""countrier"" dealership) and they had the issue fixed in three days. The issue was a software update for one of the electronic components in the car, which is something you would think they'd check. Every time I asked for why they thought it was fixed, they gave no answer, most likely because nothing was done that could have fixed the issue.",1.2
1,"January 21, 2019","Brought my car in because the sync is not working meaning I can sync my phone, use my Navigation system, I can’t hardly change the temperature on my car due to it is touch screen and will not work. I find out the Software update is very large and for the service dept to update for you they Charge 130.00 for this update. An update that prevents the electronics of your vehicle not to work, my car is 2 years old and the main components don’t work. They basically told me to update myself and I did try but was unsuccessful. My car has a bumper to bumper warranty for 5 years or 75,000 miles which my car falls in this category and they still say not covered. Spoke with Steve the Manager who stated “what you want me to fix your car for FREE?” Uh yes under warranty yes I do he refused I explained I had purchased 11 vehicles from Tyler Ford and until this software update have never had a problem and if they want to take care of the customer this way then I would play the dirty way as well and write the review. So Tyler Ford after 20 years of business I will no longer purchase my vehicles through you. I will find a dealership that truly cares about the customer and goes the extra mile.",1.0
2,"January 08, 2019","Honestly, all I need to say is their are some mechanics even the head mechanic....that don't know what their doing!!!  The actual mechanic that worked on my truck wouldn't even talk to us he was too busy. Bad customer service .Took truck in to see why wouldn't crank last week, sure they did something to make it crank didn't last long...ran their computer on it and told us all that it needed was converters also said they did an oil change well good thing my husband knows what to look for and what he's doing,  because their was no oil change still had same filter and oil was black. Neway took it back to shop on tow truck told them look it's still having problems and oil wasn't changed we were charged for something that never happened. Long story short we get truck back and they tell us the timing is off...it needs a fuel injector...a spark plug...blah blah and gave us an outrageous price well guess what you were all wrong that knocking sound u heard where the pistons and motor is locked up so instead of guessing what the situation is and trying to just overcharge folks is not right by any means and I'm very very upset and will never be back. But I will say James Williams is an awesome service representative he knows what's up! So thank-you James for your time, and kindness none of this was your fault! ",1.0

22,"March 06, 2018","I was in a horrible wreck three days before having to go car shopping and yes I was still shaken but needed to get a car. Mine was totaled on the day of the wreck and even though it was not my fault I was looking at a car payment I haven't had in three years. My husband went with me for support to the only place I had ever dealt with. When we arrived the one young man who came to see how he could help me had such a caring and understanding way after hearing about my experience earlier that week. He was kind and patient, even when I had a bit of a melt down after getting in a car to test drive and becoming emotional about going into traffic. The kindness shown by him as well as the other people I dealt with at the Ford dealer in Tyler was something I will never forget. My name is Colleen Diaz and I would choose the Ford Dealership Hands Down and my sales guy Dayton was the BOMB! Thank You for everything, I got a car that I love and payments I can afford! Thank You again!",4.8

32,"January 03, 2018","I drove to a local Ford dealer. Salesman was nice but more interested in who was on his phone than a visitor on the lot.  Went to a dealer in the next town and it wasn't much better.  Drove the 40+ miles to Tyler Ford. They were welcoming, provided the info I requested, and asked questions about what I wanted in a vehicle. Even better, he took me directly to what I wanted.  Less than 90 minutes later, I drove away in my new Edge. Next car?  Tyler Ford.  ",5.0

34,"December 26, 2017","The truck I bought recently is very sophisticated compared to the one I bought 20 years ago. Kirby took three hours to patiently explan all the different features. Dan Parker remembered me me from last time I bought a truck seven  years ago. The parts guy even helped me install my floor mats. To sum up, buying a truck now requires every one at the dealership to have expertise beyond just selling you something. Tyler Ford does just that in a friendly, professional way. ",5.0

45,"October 26, 2017",Lane was the salesman working with me and they stayed WAY past their close time to assist me. He waited on me to get there after work and showed me what trucks were available based on the criteria I was looking for. They worked with me in every aspect I could imagine.

55,"July 20, 2017","Although hesitant to look at a vehicle at Tyler Ford, I am very thankful that I did!  My initial experience was easy in exploring the cost of what I wanted and the trade-in value of my car.  By the end of the day, I was called by Bryan Sammon, and he told me that Ronnie, the general manager, would match what I needed to make the sale.  Bryan's excitement about the car was fun.   I went in the following day, still thinking about whether or not I wanted to do this.  I then dealt with Cody Fox, as requested by Bryan since he was out of town, and the remainder of the experience was AWESOME!  Cody met me with enthusiasm and explained every detail about the car, letting us drive it several times.  He was very patient with my hesitation and concerns.  I cannot tell you how easy he made the entire process.  Bryan Harvel, in finance, was a great help in getting the financing set up so I could take the car home that day.  After I purchased the car, Cody asked me to bring it back to get detailed.  Not only did he have it detailed, he took care of having a damaged tire replaced, saving me from having to take the time to do it myself.  Cody went over and above taking care of me and the car, during and after the purchase!  I received the kind of customer service that you really do not find very often.  Thank you to everyone involved!  I am very happy that I made the call to Tyler Ford and will certainly go back in the future!  I will definitely recommend Tyler Ford to my friends if they need to buy a vehicle.   ",5.0
56,"July 16, 2015","Took my car to get 2 tires changed and fix minor body damage after a wreck .. It's been in there for over a month .. It took them a week to even look at it . This is the second time I've been there and the first time was just as terrible . The last time I talked to someone about the status of my car the person on the phone literally said "" I'm glad you called , I forgot we needed to order you a part thanks for reminding me""  i honestly don't understand how people say they've had good service here I've never heard anything good about this place ",1.0
57,"April 04, 2014","I drive a 2012 Ford Escape. Bought in Dallas so 1st x  used Tyler Ford Service Center and will be the last! Went in for oil change and inspection. They were not busy and had many employees standing around doing NOTHING. Took an hour and 1/2 if not longer just to change oil  and inspection sticker. They kept making excuses when they could see that I was getting restless . This was Friday 4.4.2014. They didn't,t clean up after themselves and I noted on road home that they put wrong year make on inspection sticker. I received very substandard  service and will not return

58,"October 25, 2012","I recently took in a vehicle to get my usual oil change and tire rotation done on my vehicle, Ive been going for 2 years now, but today I left the shop and about a mile down the road I experience engine issues, and smoke from engine and exhaust, so I stop driving and pull over nearest gas station.  I pop my hood and oil dipstick is out and oil spattering everywhere.  I check the oil level its low but ok.  I still notice my muffler smoking bad so I call the dealership and explain the situation.  Apparently they had forgot to take off original filter gasket, with this in mind, I knew they did a terrible job and worried they damaged my engine now.  They were great to quickly send a mechanic to to check the car and had it towed back in for inspection and service.  I talked to the manager about the situtaion and said they will be held responsible for any damages done to vehicle.  They got me a car rental for convenience until worked on tomm.  I hope they have not damaged my vehicle to an extent I need a new motor.  I hope they keep their word, if not they will be getting a lawsuit from me in court very soon.  I have seen similar issues with other customers here, so I will keep that in mind.  I will never come here again. Period.  Something as simple as an oil change should not damage my vehicle expecially from an official dealership.  We will see what happens.",2.8
59,"August 01, 2012","We are Sweetwater Barn Co. and I sent a crew to Tyler Texas with a Ford 450 truck pulling a flatbed trailer.  This is now day 3, I have a crew sitting in a motel waiting for this truck to be repaired - as of 8:30 this morning they have still not looked at it!!!  My truck arrived at service approximately 2pm on Monday July 30th.  They knew I was from out of town with a crew - I was told repeatedly by the service manager Brian Harwell that our truck was in being looked at.  Well they did get it in, but it was to do the oil change for over $400.00 in cost!   However, they still did not have time to look at my truck and repair it so I could get to work!!  I sat in a motel with a crew for another whole day.  I have NEVER seem such poor customer service!  I have owned Ford trucks for over 35 years and believe me I have broken down before out of town and the Ford dealers have ALWAYS gotten my truck repaired  immediately!!  This has cost me a fortune!  This is a very poorly run, inept dealership!  

I am appalled at the treatment I have received.  I was just informed FINALLY that it needs a new thermostat!!  WHY couldn't they have done this yesterday at least????  This makes me so made I'm not sure I will ever buy another Ford!!  This dealership should be banned from doing business and giving Ford such a bad name.  ",1.0

61,"April 12, 2011","Best Experience with a car dealer I have ever had!!
Joshua Minick answered all of my questions without hesitation and made the whole process seem completely transparent.  I never felt like anything was held back from me.  The price negation was pleasant and without pressure.  The finance guy offered different options to add to my deal.  The key word is ""offered"". Never once did he push me into something I wasn't interested in. After that I was given a tour of the dealership to make sure I knew where the Parts department, body shop, and service depart are. Randy Speake was especially helpful in relaying the information I needed to know about my regular maintenance. 
Overall, a very pleasant experience.",5.0
62,"February 24, 2010",Josh was very attentive in listening to our needs and went the extra effort to find a vehicle that met them.
