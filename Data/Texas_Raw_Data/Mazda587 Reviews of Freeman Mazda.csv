0,"June 20, 2020","If I could give a lower star, I would.  The manager and an associate, Bryan Basevi and Rodney King are the most misogynistic individuals I have ever spoken to.  I am 55 and hold several college degrees yet these men spoke to me with such condescension .  Be warned!  Especially women, this company is not where you should do business.  Every attempt at  communication about a purchase was met with interruptions and rudeness.  As soon as they ‘got the sale’, their true colors came out.  Avoid this dealership at all costs. ",1.0

7,"August 10, 2019","After stopping by a couple other dealerships and feeling pressured or taken advantage of, I decided to check out Freeman Mazda. The sales associate, Edida, took the time to listen to all of my qualifications for buying a vehicle and was able to offer several options within my price range. I test drove a couple, then was undecided so I left. Upon returning, the vehicle was still set to the side and I felt no pressure to buy, but was able to test drive and take the time my girlfriend and I needed to make clear decision. Through the entire buying process Edida was understanding, patient, and helpful. I cannot recommend Freeman Mazda and sales associate Edida Cruz enough!",5.0

11,"July 15, 2019","I live out of town and purchased a car sight unseen from Russ Cooper at Freeman Mazda in Irving Texas. Buying a car without driving it is always concerning but with the help of Russ and his honest, and attentive assistance the experience went very well. I wanted a car that was hard to find in the trim level and color I wanted so I needed to buy the car out of my area. Russ described the car for me in great detail and helped me set up a third-party inspection (Lemon Squad) to give me further assurances that the car was in good shape. Once I decided to purchase the vehicle Russ and the finance department at Freeman moved quickly to send the paperwork and set up a shipping delivery for me. They made it fast and easy and I felt very assured I was getting a great car at a great price with minimal hassle. Russ was always available to answer my constant questions, treated me with respect and returned communications quickly. The car is exactly what I wanted. Many thanks to Russ Cooper and the team at Freeman Mazda. Highly recommended.

12,"June 18, 2019","I worked with Tito who provided an amazing service and went above and beyond to meet our expectations. The moment we spoke to him about purchasing a new car, he put us at ease and made the whole process so easy from selecting a car to purchasing it.He was even willing to communicate around 11pm even though that is usually outside of business hours. Overall, we are extremely happy with Tito's work ethic and would surely recommend him and Freeman Mazda to anyone who is looking to purchase a new vehicle.",4.8

17,"April 30, 2019","I expected to have a good experience purchasing a vehicle from this dealer, given the many positive reviews.  Unfortunately, I cannot say that my experience has been positive at all.  I am a recent widow with a one year old and made the difficult decision to trade in my husband’s vehicle.  I not only wanted something larger with more safety features, this was also a fresh start for my daughter and me; it was not merely a choice made out of necessity but also a highly emotional decision. After much research I decided on the Mazda CX-9 and weeks of internet shopping led me to Freeman Mazda, a mere 400 miles away from my home in New Mexico.  The second day I had the vehicle the service soon light came on. The third day my cousin decided it would be a good idea to check the oil to make sure that was not why the light was coming on.  When he popped the hood he found that one of the battery cables had been chewed through by a rodent.  He told me I had enough connection that driving would be ok, but that I needed to take it in and get the cable replaced.  I in no way thought this would be a major problem, and when I took it to the closest Mazda dealer I was shocked to find out that it would be a $4,000 fix and that the interior of my car would need to be dismantled in order to replace the wiring.  And that it would not be covered under warranty since it was considered external damage not caused by faulty equipment.  I immediately called Freeman Mazda to see if there was anything that could be done and was told that they would need to call me back. I waited over the weekend and called back and was told that they needed to discuss what could be done since I lived so far away.  I waited a couple of days and called back and left a message with no reply.  I have had the worst year of my life dealing with my husband’s passing and chalked this all up to just one more thing to add to how horrible these past few months have been.  My aunt decided to act as an advocate on my behalf and contacted the dealership.  She gave my information and I did receive a phone call and a promise of a call back on Monday.  It is now close to midnight on Monday and I again have received no phone call. I now have a brand-new vehicle with $4,000 worth of damage and no one cares.  Had I been diligent and thought to look under the hood prior to purchasing I would have immediately seen the damage and saved myself a lot of stress and money.  However, I assumed that by purchasing a brand-new vehicle it would be in new condition.  I have learned a very expensive lesson.  ",1.0
18,"February 12, 2019","I came to this dealership because of the good things people had told me about it. And let me say, it was everything I had been told and more. The sales rep that I worked with was Edida Cruz. She is a lovely and wonderful woman, but she is also the perfect guide. I came in with some expectations in a vehicle and kind of had an idea as to what I wanted. I explained this to her and she immediately knew what i needed. She was so informative and helpful that I actually changed my mind while I was there. She never pressured me into making a choice and that is something I highly value when walking into any sales environment. At the end of the day, my family and I drove out of there with a beautiful truck and huge smiles on our faces.  I would recommend this dealership to anyone just because of this great woman and her outstanding service. Thanks for everything!",5.0

24,"January 06, 2019","I was shopping for either a Honda CR-V or a Mazda CX-5.  Got a quote for a CR-V from one Dallas area Honda dealer that was near Freeman Mazda, went there, ended up they wanted $2,000 more.  I was so upset and walked away.  I got a quote from Mr. Vanlooy (the salesman at Freeman) for a CX-5 which was very affordable.  I went to see him in 45 minutes.  No change or surprises in the price when I arrived.  I bought the car in the next hour.  Mr Vanlooy and the finance person, Nora, were very helpful.  I liked them a lot.  The finance people were even kind enough to give us a refund the next morning on an extended warranty that we had bought - we decided we did not want that (fortunately our check was not cashed yet and it was done easily by writing a new check).  I tried contacting other Dallas area Mazda dealers, but none wanted to give me a price on a CX-5 over email or on the phone.  They were not as direct as Freeman.",5.0

38,"November 28, 2018","I used Freeman Mazda even though it's out of the way for me because it's a Car Pro dealership.  I don't purchase cars often, so I'm hoping I got a fair deal with the Car Pro VIP process.  It was very nice not to have to negotiate on the price.  I only had to negotiate on the trade-in.  That's never fun, but was relatively painless.

Charles Peters was an excellent salesman.  He was patient, informative and never made me feel rushed or pressured.  When my new car arrived, it had a slight scratch on the removable black piece between the passenger side windows, and Charles saw to it that it was taken care of immediately.

I visited many dealerships when I was test driving vehicles before deciding on a CX 9, and Charles stands out among all the salespeople I dealt with.

40,"November 23, 2018","We purchased our CX-5 from Charles back in 2016, when he was a fresh-faced, wide-eyed salesperson. He made sure he did what he could to make our experience a good one. He wasn't pushy and recognized that customers, even though they may require a little nudge, are going to buy on their schedules. As someone who previously sold cars and always emphasized customer service, Charles was great in this regard. 

The CX-9 caught my eye at that time and I told Charles if I decided to purchase a CX-9, I'd get it from him. Well, two years later it was time for that new car and as a man of my word, I returned to Charles, a grizzled, old veteran by this time. 

I was looking at two vehicles, the Volvo XC60 and the CX-9 (yes, the CX-9 compares quite admirably to the Volvo). We ultimately decided to go with the CX-9. Now, let me say this, I probably could've paid a little bit less at another dealer, but Charles had done right by us and I told him I wasn't going anywhere else if I bought a Mazda. So...

Anyway, long story longer, Both Trent and Martin (desk managers) were easy to work with and Jesse worked well with us in the business office. My wife liked the Freeman presentation at delivery. I had no idea it was my CX-9 under that sheet when we walked into the showroom (kidding). The horns did startle my two-year-old but he was amused by it, too.

Again, a really good experience. 10/10 would buy from them again. Also, first year of maintenance free. 

P.S. My wife is advocating for a promotion for Charles.",5.0
41,"November 20, 2018","Excellent experience from start to finish. clear communication, nice building, pleasant and friendly staff.

53,"September 27, 2018","I saw an online ad for the type of car I wanted. I was contacted by Michael Ray, Freeman Mazda's internet salesman. He was very nice over the phone and he reserved the car for me for a day until I could go see it. It was about a 50 mile trip in a rental car because my car had been totaled. When I got to the dealership, I met Michael and he showed me the car. I was a cash customer and their offfer to me was a good deal, so I purchased the 2016 Mazda6, on the spot. They offered to clean up a few cosmetic flaws in the car, at no cost. Since I was there in a rental car, I could not take it right then. My salesman, Michael Ray offered to bring the car to me the following morning. Now that's what I call the best service imagineable!!!! The paperwork was well handled by Nora Ramza (very courteous) and they agreed to hold my personal check until I received my claim check for my loss, from my insurance company. I received the check for my loss, 6 days after my accident. Great job AAA car insurance. They too deserve a 5 star rating. I would recommend Freeman Mazda to anyone.",5.0

61,"September 11, 2018",Don't trust their inspection on used vehicles. They sold a used BMW with a passenger door lock not working. Agreed to fix and never ordered the part.

64,"September 06, 2018","Salesman Stephen VanLooy was very nice, no pressure on making a sale, looking at 2018 Mazda 3 touring, but I did not buy right then and there, returned  home to think about it first, after all this is not something that is done everyday or every year. Returned the same day and purchased the car, wanted snow flake white pearl, very nice color. They did not have the car in stock, found one in Austin and it was driven to Irving. I was not too happy about that, as I like to break my cars in very easy, this way it will last a long time. Sales manager Martin Ramon was very accommodating, no pressure from him. Had to wait a few days before I could pick up the car, but they gave me a rental to drive until then, and yes they put gas in it and I did not have to bring it back with the same amount of gas. Overall, very nice dealership, would purchase a car again if I need to . Salesman Stephen emailed me asking how I was doing with the car, they have very good follow up. He is very eager to help with anything I need to know about the car. Really like the car, has a 6 speed manual, it tells you what gear you are in, The 2.5 liter engine 184 horses is very nice,you can feel the car when you are chaining gears.

When I showed up for the appointment, he had done the research on the color I told him I was interested in, and had a car ready for a test drive.  After I drove the RF, we stopped at service, where he introduced me to the crew, where i was given an overview of the service process.  My wife and I then drove the convertible, which just happened to be the exact car for my second choice.

77,"July 31, 2018","I went into Freeman Mazda after being at many other dealers knowing it was going to be difficult to get out of my current vehicle situation. Charles and Trent worked with me and made sure I felt comfortable and got me exactly what I wanted without making me feel pressured or like they were just trying to make a sale. I am a young woman in my late 20's and never felt like I was being taken advantage of. Every employee made me feel like they knew me personally and was extremely friendly. Although I didn't feel the need to be the center of attention, I think it is really sweet how they take each persons new car inside and celebrate with them on the red carpet. Thank you for making this a great experience! ",4.8

79,"July 23, 2018","I really appreciate the sales team that helped me with my purchase. When the salesman first approached my girlfriend and I, he simply asked if we had any questions about the vehicles we were looking at. We explained we were just there to look for now. He wasn’t pushy about trying to set an appointment or get any personal information at that time, but instead just had a nice conversation with us about the quality of the vehicles and then let us continue looking on our own. We came back the next day to talk about the vehicle we liked. They stayed three hours past closing time to make sure I was satisfied with my purchase. They didn’t have the vehicle I wanted in stock since I was looking for something very specific, but they located one from another dealer and got it for me the very next day. They even gave me a loaner vehicle to use until they got the new one. The vehicle came with even more accessories than I asked for, and the unveiling ceremony was a great treat. An experience I will never forget. Needless to say, my expectations were met and exceeded. Thank you Freeman Mazda!",4.8

I have been trying to get the recall fixed at my hometown dealership for over a year with no help.  I have had nothing but trouble from my local dealership.  First, I was told they didn’t have parts.  Then, I made an appt and got there and was told that the service guy had a class and wasn’t there and I had no appt (even though I did and no one called to change my appt).  Finally, I was asked if I purchased the car there and when I said no they said they couldn’t help me and they would need a service manager to call me.  No one ever called me!  On top of that, I emailed our local dealership and Mazda and got no response from either.  You would think Mazda would care a little more that they have a dealership selling their cars but not servicing them!!  So, after all that, I called Freeman.  I was able to get an appt scheduled within a week.  Even though I had to drive the 2 hours for my appt, the service I received was amazing!  While there, I had a couple of other services done based on their recommendations!  I would highly recommend them to anyone who asks!  Thank you so much!!!!",5.0

They saw this and did not see the need to make a repair on this. The assumption was that everyone knows automatically when driving when the car is in park, neutral , reverse, or drive.

When I advised when they saw this why was it not repaired they stated we sell cars as is,
and everyone knows the clutch order. They were in such a rush to get me out of the door I guess
in hopes that I would not notice the issue, will not purchase from them ever again",2.4

Once I purchased my CX-5, Steven took the time to go over all the features with me and setting up my Navigation system and linking my iPhone to the car.

My son flew in for the weekend to help me buy a new car, and Steven made sure that as soon as we were on our way from the airport that the cars were ready for us to look over. When we finally decided on the one I wanted, he checked the stock and realized that the delivery of that color with the options I wanted wasn't scheduled for another few days. Instead of saying, ""You can come in and pick it up Monday"" he went the extra step of checking to make sure the car wasn't already shipped. Thank goodness he did, because the car came in that day, but was not yet prepped for the lot! It still had all the stickers and plastic covering it. We wanted to get the paperwork done that evening, and he quickly got the car prepped and he made sure the department handling all the paperwork did everything quickly, and they did!

I highly recommend Freeman Mazda and Steven Van Looy. From hassle-free price negotiation, to car prep and pickup, the whole experience was simply excellent!

Before arriving I had called the day before and spoke with Cliff to make some minor adjustments to my visit. He accommodated me with a professional and amicable approach. 
Upon arriving I was met by Rickie who has been with the company for 5 years while still maintaining a hugely positive attitude, looks like he just left college and is remarkably service oriented. He truly made my visit memorable. 
While having some time on my hands before I left for a lunch I sauntered over to the main building to look at their flashy new cars.  I love the new Mazda's and the value for money is ridiculously in our favor. I looked at a Mazda C5 mid size SUV for $27K and was surprised what you get for that. 
The showroom staff where attentive but not overbearing and I suddenly realized that this spirit of genuine care and assistance was company wide and not just service or sales specific. This dealership really wants to stand out as a company that looks after people versus being a company that wants your money.

My salesman, John, went out of his way to locate exactly what I was looking for at a dealership in New Mexico. Freeman Mazda had the car brought over so I could purchase it. When I went to pick it up however, there were two very serious issues that the other dealership failed to mention before sending the car over. Needless to say I was incredibly upset by the turn of events. The New Mexico dealership was to far away for me to vent any frustrations at them, and the Freeman Mazda group had no way of knowing this was going to happen.The sales manager, Martin Ramon and the General Sales Manager, Trent Boe stepped in to help me. Even though I wasn't in the greatest of moods, they both came up with solutions to the problems and presented them in a manner that made the deal work at Freeman Mazda for me.

He asked if there were any other issues with the car and I mentioned a tire needed air three times in six weeks.  Angela took my car in at the shop and was very quick and efficient.  She also arranged for me to be driven to and from work by a company employee.  The driver, Robert, did a great job but I praised him in the Hyundai review and say no more about him here.  While I was driven to work, a mechanic called and let me know that a nail had been found in the tire and it would be $30 to repair.  I gave him the go ahead to repair it so I could stop worrying about that issue.

One thing I could say that was when I pulled up there was a car in my way and I sat there for a couple of minutes and no one really directed me as to where to go or immediately greeted me. There was a nice woman, whom I would rather always deal with, who greeted me as I was about to just walk into the lounge area,(because thats what I thought I was supposed to do when I got there seeing as there was no one making eye contact nor greeting me immediately). But if it wasn't for such a friendly face who intercepted me as I was walking into the lounging area I would have just left my car sitting outside, assuming that was what I was supposed to do. She asked me if I had spoken to anyone, I said no, and she was happy to help with a positive attitude. I'm not sure what her name is, but I always seem to work with her, she has great energy, and seems to be comfortable in her position and  straight to business. I like that. So thank you, whoever you are. Please thank her for me if possible. Other than not being greeted as I pulled up to be directed where to go so I could get out of the heat, even though there were 4 or 5 people just standing right inside(granted, i'm not sure what they were doing) I would give this place a high mark. 

It would have only taken a thumbs up or a wave to help me feel comfortable with leaving my car where it was....fyi. but I almost felt ignored until the nice lady intercepted me and took care of me.

420,"March 05, 2016","On October 2015, I came into Freeman Mazda Hyundai after looking at several used car ads for an Infiniti G37 and BMW 335i. Mary Little was my car sales rep through nearly the entire buying process. I have to say that she was very professional, level-headed, and respectful through the entire experience even with my dad who can be very hard to work with. The rest of the team and staff was all very kind and welcoming to me and my family. After a couple test drives and just a day later, I ended up purchasing a BMW 335i 2010 sedan for a price that was more than reasonable (did research on KBB) and one that I was very happy with. I also purchased an extended warranty considering the high cost to maintain the vehicle. Unfortunately, a week later I discovered an oil leak with the valve cover gasket and took it back to Freeman and, after some discussion, they agreed to take the car and cover the repairs. About two and a half months later, I took my car to Autobahn BMW in fort worth to have all maintenance done of my car including spark plugs;  it was then that we discovered an oil leak all over the valve cover, several ignition coils, and more that was likely to be related to the previous problem/repair. I was upset, frustrated, and livid to say the least. Immediately, i brought the car back to Freeman Mazda and spoke to Mary Little and also the manager Matt Harris and almost made a complete 180 on my emotions. After speaking to  Matt about the situation, the FIRST thing he said to me is ""give us a chance to make this right."" I received a loaner vehicle, they took the car to a certified BMW dealership in Dallas, and covered the repairs for valve cover, vc gasket, and 4 ignition coils. The parts, labors, and fees cost almost $2000 to repair! No one in general would ever leap at the chance to pay for the cost of these repairs, but Matt and Mary displayed so much integrity and went beyond your standard business and dealership. Unfortunately, buying a used car imposes some risks as well as benefits and I was very blessed to have purchased a car from people that also believed in ""doing the right thing."" At the same time, I do feel that it is also the customer/consumer's duty to do a few things when purchasing a used car.. So here are some takeaways from my experience on my first car purchase

1. Take your car to receive a pre-purchase inspection. No one is able to tell when the valve cover / oil leak issues occurred (before trade in, during a customer's test drive, or even after purchase..?), but you can save some heartache having additional inspection done before purchase.
2. A lot of the cars on used car lots are with 30 day warranty or ""as is."" Get a copy of this buyer's guide if you do have a 30 day warranty!! Protect yourself!
3. Consider purchasing that extended warranty. I got mine for three years. You have the option of terminating this extended service plan and receiving a pro-rated amount back. This was actually my full intention that was suggested to me by the financial rep when signing all the papers for the car purchase. Most issues with used cars will happen within the first 3-6 months of driving. However, I may be keeping my extended warranty.
4. Be reasonable. Luckily, all of these repairs were requested within reason and under the right circumstances. You cannot expect any dealership to cover the costs of any repair if you bought a car as-is and with no warranty. Be smart about your purchase.

With all everything considered, i highly recommend shopping for your new/used vehicle at Freeman Mazda. The cars are very reasonably priced and the staff is great, especially Mary and Matt. Thank you very much!!! You guys have had a very positive impact on me and my family!!

He was very helpful and took care of all my needs and even verified some details of the vehicle I was interested in that weren't listed online. And the vehicle was listed at a great price for the great condition that it was in! I came pre-financed so I was in and out of Freeman Mazda quicker than any other dealership I have been in (when I purchased a vehicle). So again John was great. 

Only gripe might be the finance pitch. I came pre-approved with USAA so I didn't need and wasn't looking for financing, but judging by the paperwork and flyers I was handed, it looked it was a required element from Freeman mazda as part of the car buying process. But it's all good, I understand they haveto make some money too! 
Anyway, just a great and surprising car buying experience when compared with car buying a few years ago.

Upon arrival I feared the dreaded bait and switch and waited for the ball to drop.  I was especially skeptical when I arrived and my car was packaged with a bow and ready to go.  I thought psychological warfare ... get the customer to fall in love with the car... then up the price.  After a quick photo op Christina took me around the town showing me every feature of the car I had purchased even syncing my phone and helping me set the radio channels.  Then on to financing.  I just knew that was the end and I would walk away ... but everything we had agreed to was upheld and I felt great about my purchase.  Now just to enjoy my new Mazda CX5!!!!  ",4.6

Trent, Martin, Stephanie and Cliff were all wonderful. Stephanie hustled to locate a 2016 comparable to our 2014 that we were in love with. Christina had gotten us into our 2014 by letting us drive it to the Mini dealership which was the other car we were looking at. (no comparison). This second time around, the sales team got almost an identical vehicle in all the way from CO and helped us get back on the road quickly.

471,"December 16, 2015","Edida was wonderful!!!  So kind and helpful before, during, and after the sale!  She communicated well with me, and caught potential hiccups BEFORE they became issues the day I picked up my vehicle and signed my paperwork.  

However, I would be remiss if I didn't mention my unhappiness at the service at the finance department.  (Let me be clear that I feel that this was a separate situation from the incredible service Edida provided.)  I waited over an hour and 15 minutes to sign paperwork, which I feel was WAY too long, as I financed with my own bank and had signed my paperwork with them earlier in the week.  All I needed to do with Freeman was sign your paperwork.  When I was finally seen, the paperwork was incorrect and the numbers and terms did not match those that I had discussed and agreed upon with at my bank, to an error that would have affected me negatively.  (Needless to say, this was a complete shock and did not make me happy, especially after the long wait.) Thankfully I had my own copies of my paperwork with my bank and was able to resolve it with the finance department, who in turn resolved it with my bank the next business day.  

Again, Edida was awesome!  I'd highly recommend her in a heartbeat.  She deserves ten stars.  But the deduction of one star for the ""overall rating of this dealership"" is minor compared to the negative impression I was left with in regards to my experience with the finance department.  I do hope that others had better experiences in that building than I did.  ",4.0

479,"November 15, 2015","1)	Edida Cruz: Hands down, Edida Cruz is a godsend to anyone who wishes the car buying process to be stress free, transparent and conducted with the grace and consideration. Edida is a very good listener, thoughtful and responsive. She really knows the Mazda line in depth. I think I visited some 20 dealerships over the course of a few weeks, including three Mazda dealerships in the area. Many of them were fine to work with and not all sales people in the industry are shifty. However, Edida was a jewel. I have a millennial daughter, and when it comes time for her to purchase another vehicle, I would happily entrust her into Edida’s able hands.  I definitely appreciated feeling like everything that took place around my purchase of a 2013 Mazda 3 was completely ethical and above board, with no gamesmanship. This is perhaps the best car buying experience of my life. I felt that Edida acted as a true friend and customer advocate. She answered all questions thoroughly and demonstrated tremendous poise and patience. My advice for those interested in buying a used, late model vehicle: Go to Freeman Mazda and say, “I think I have an appointment with Edida.” And tell them Mark sent you. ;-)

2)	Freeman Mazda: Wow! Even though I had my own financing, I always dread dealing with finance guys at car dealerships. In this case, I didn’t have to get passed back and forth between the salesperson and the manager and/or finance guy. They named a figure. I countered. Edida brought the number to her manager. It was accepted. End of story. When I was walked over to the finance office (on the new car side of the operation), the gentleman simply printed out a series of standard forms, which I signed, and the deal was done in, honestly, under five minutes. Since it would take a few days for the money to be wired, I worried that I would not be able to get the fish all the way into the boat. Not a problem. They let me drive the car away even before they had any of my money. Awesome. Also, far from trying to upsell me on a dealer extended warranty, the finance guy simply asked, “Do you want to buy a warranty.” I answered no. That was it. It all felt so clean and friendly, with none of the usual smarmy undertone that can make car buying such an unpleasant experience. They detailed the car, threw in some window tinting and basically did everything to make the buying experience pleasant and enjoyable. I can’t praise them highly enough. Even the overall manager was a stand-up guy whose brief conversation with me, basically singing the praises of his own Mazda 3, felt authentic and affirming. 
 
3)	What I learned about buying a car: Don’t lose heart. You just have to hang in there until you find the right person and the right vehicle. Warning signs: The car sales agent doesn’t listen to you and proceeds to walk you around pointing out vehicles outside your price range or ones that you already specifically disavowed interest in. There are a few “no haggle” dealerships out there, which is a heartening trend. Freeman Mazda isn’t one of those, but when I asked to see the Carfax report and the current N.A.D.A. pricing on the vehicle, they were entirely forthcoming and gracious. I left the lot feeling uplifted and good. 

Bravo, Freeman Mazda. Bravo Edida Cruz!  (BTW, I have zero connection to this dealership and rarely can be bothered to fill out customer evaluations, but this experience was exceptional. Granted, it is anecdotal and represents just one transaction. That said, look at all the other positive reviews of Edida at Freeman Mazda. Clearly, they are on the right path and have figured out that, long term, transparency and ethical dealing are a winning strategy.

It only happened once and didn't happen again for almost a month but then after only having the car for 4 months it started shifting a lot harder a lot more frequently so I took it to the shop as I have regularly since I got the vehicle and told the mechanic what it had been doing and it was up to date on all its maintenance, I had maybe put 2000 miles on the car and the mechanic told me my transmission is going out and it'll cost more to fix it than what the car is even worth!!

501,"July 15, 2015","My girlfriend has purchased two cars from Freeman.  This is my first but most likely will not be my last.  One of the reasons I went to Freeman Mazda was Christina Figures actually quoted a price for what I wanted.  So many of the dealerships just say come on in and we will talk a deal when you contact them by email.  Let me know what the starting point is and I will determine if we can make a deal.  She did a great job working with me and discussing what I want and delivering on it.  The manager and Jessie, with the finance department, worked with me and framed a deal that met my budget requirements.  I feel the service has been excellent and is one of the primary reasons to shop here.  In the service/repair department I would like to praise Andrew and Tim for their support.

505,"July 10, 2015","We have a 2005 Mazda3 with 150,000 on it.  It's been so good to us, yet, it needed some special attention.  Being relatively new to the area, I did some online research and discovered Freeman Mazda, which came with high marks for the service department.  Having just picked-up our car after service at Freeman Mazda, I would echo the positive sentiment.  From the friendly, yet clear and upfront, conversations we exchanged with Rickie, Angela Engel and Josh Lymer, we knew good service would follow, and it did.  They delivered on all the promises they made (inclusive of pricing and timing).  

These days, you can have your car serviced in so many places -- from a dealership, to a quick care chain, to a seemingly reasonable guy off craigslist.  Based on our experience, what sets Freeman Mazda service apart from the other options is their empathy -- backed with their knowledge and insight, they talk to the customer as if they were the ones receiving the message.  I really didn't want to pour hundreds of dollars into a car we'll probably keep only another year or two, but Rickie, Angela and Josh presented options that were logical and sound.  I felt like they gave me information that empowered me to make the best decisions for our specific situation.  You can't ask for much more than that.  

As a bonus, they take coupons.  

Outside of all of this, I'd be remiss to not mention that while waiting in their lounge, I witnessed a conversation between Rickie and another customer that I believe is noteworthy.  In my humble opinion, that customer could have used a few Emily Post courses.  Whilst smacking her gum, talking to her insurance agent on speaker phone, and offering commentary on the verdicts of Judge Judy, she managed to tangle herself into at least three lies about what was wrong with her car, and why it needed an oil change.  While this was obvious to all of us in the lounge except for the woman, Rickie allowed her to ramble while he listened patiently, and then simply and compassionately let her know that she needn't worry about him judging how the situation came to be what it was, but rather he just wanted to help her understand how to get things back to good.  The whole situation exemplified good customer service.

And one more thing, Ben, who works in a different department but just happened to be helping out in the service department, was kind to all of us in the lounge, and he took a few minutes to come over and have a chat -- solidifying the idea that this place was more like hanging out with your family than a place that just wants to do work and take money.  

Thanks, everyone.  We'll see you again when it's time to buy our next Mazda. ",5.0

My wife worked with Edida as well when we almost bought a Mazda a few months earlier.  We ended up getting a different vehicle then but the experience was so great with Edida that when life presented me with some need for a new vehicle and we saw the great deals Mazda was running, we immediately sought out Edida to work with her again.  The price / lease payment we received for the Mazda 6 is incredible.  I looked online for cars I could lease for $200/month and there was nothing even remotely close to the Mazda 6 interns of appearance, relative luxury, size, incredible gas mileage, highly reliable, etc.  When it came to working out the details on the price, available vehicles, and things like that, Edida and her sales manager Trent were extremely fast in their exchanges and never kept me waiting long.  There were no shady sales tactics going on.  Again, I felt comfortable and that the whole process was very transparent as we looked at leasing vs buying and other things.  We ended up having to get a car from another dealership to give me what I wanted and Trent and Edida gave me a brand new 2016 loaner car to drive for the few short days until my Mazda 6 arrives.

When we arrived, we met Edida. She was friendly, and seemed eager to make us at ease, and give us exactly what we were looking for. She asked several questions about what we were looking for, and then said she was going to bring a few cars up for us to look at, so we could compare the features and the colors. She also explained that if we wanted something she did not have, she could get it here.

We went out to look at two models, the sport, in a wonderful red, and the touring model, in a delightful blue. She spent time in each vehicle, going over the features, and then we took the touring model for a test drive. It happened to have everything we were looking for.

Edida then worked with Martin to get us the vehicle at a price we were happy with, and we drove the vehicle home that night. Tresha Petty was the finance pro we worked with. It was a long day/night, but we were in and out of there in less than 4 hours.

Toward the end, Trent closed the deal regarding the 'numbers'.  I would definitely recommend both of them.  ",5.0
567,"April 28, 2015",I've purchased two cars from Freeman Mazda - both were sold to me by Stephanie.  She was as transparent as it gets when it comes to car buying and has guided me through both purchases with grace and kindness.  I'm very thankful that she cares about customers like myself and makes sure to stay in touch when we come in for services.  I was able to upgrade to a new 2016 MAZDA6 this year with the help of her and the entire Freeman Mazda team.  I highly recommend Stephanie Foreman to work with if you're looking for a vehicle.  The new line of Mazdas are beautiful and awesome cars to drive! ,5.0

569,"April 28, 2015","I had been researching Mazda , on a Saturday afternoon I had decided to go car shopping , I pulled into the dealership , I saw as I pulled in that it looked like they had a female salesperson and I hoped to myself that maybe I would have her help me look for a new car. it just happened that when I parked she was the one that came out to great me as I approached the building. she went in to asking me what my needs in a car were, she explained all the differences in the inventory there , Edida was very patient with my being undecided with all the great cars there I liked so many I couldn't make my mind up . I know she was happy when we finally narrowed it down to a blue Mazda3. Edida went the extra mile to get me in that car that night. she is the best !! there should be more female car sales persons out there . I will for sure in the future want to come back to deal with her.",5.0
570,"April 28, 2015","One of the drawbacks in purchasing/leasing is the amount of time it takes to get the deal done.  Stephanie, Trent and Brian make the process so seamless it is mind blowing.  Once we determined what we wanted..Stephanie and Trent went to work pulling the numbers and putting the proposal together...they came back to us with a deal that was easy to understand and well thought out....the next step was Brian and the financing....the approval was done quickly due to the preparation that this team makes....I recommend this dealership and this team for any all purchase or lease options.

P.S...I have purchase 2 vechiles individually and 3 jointly....I will continue to direct our business to Freeman Madza in Irving........",5.0
571,"April 28, 2015","I live in Austin area and had first gone to the dealer in Mazda south austin. The service there was pathetic. I then approached Freeman Mazda at Irving. The service here was just the opposite of what I saw at Austin. The people were great, kind and extremely responsive. I dealt with a Sales representative just on the phone. Her Name was Edida Cruz. She was the best person to deal with. She was extremely professional and responsive, everytime i spoke to her, she got things done immediately. I never had to wait for  an answer or email. Her max. time to get back to me was 15 minutes which made me feel really important as a customer. I would recommend going to this place and dealing with Edida. The price factor was also really great, I dint have to haggle and they straight away gave me a good price. Even the finance department was good and always called me up if I missed anything. All in all, it was a great experience and I would happy to recommend this dealer and buy my cars from them in future. ",5.0

She is trustworthy, friendly, extremely helpful, very knowledgeable about the vehicles, she listens to her customers, she goes above & beyond to ensure her customers are happy and it does not stop when you drive the vehicle off the lot. I have bought 2 cars from her and referred my son to her when he was looking for a vehicle and wanted to look at a Mazda.  I have given her name to anyone I know looking for a Mazda. I have bought numerous new cars over the years and I have never met 1 salesperson I would give all 10's or refer to anyone until I met Stephanie.  She is a leader in customer service.  In addition, Angela in Service, Trent, the GM, Martin, the Mazda Sales Manager and Brad and Brian in Finance have always been very helpful.

578,"September 06, 2012","This was absolutely the worst experience i have ever had at a car dealership.  Rick Westbrook provided me w/decent customer service up until the last few minutes of my visit.  His Sales Manager Larry Chase displayed the most appalling customer service i have ever received.  Larry approached me with the sole intent of antagonizing and humiliating me.  In anwer to your question ""have i had a bad experience at a car dealership before?"" - not until i met you!  You should not be entrusted with a customer service position.  How dare you treat a customer with the utter disdain you showed me??!!  Customer Service Tip #1:   if you feel that a customer is not having an enjoyable experience try a handshake, a smile and 'what can we do to make this a better experience for you?'  But DO NOT approach that customer with a swagger, without reaching out for a handshake, and proceed to mock that customer, tell that customer that you do not need their business, and continue to yell at that customer even after she has left the building.  As for Rick Westbrook, I had no problem with his customer service until the last few minutes of my visit.  Customer Service Tip #2: when the customer you have been working with for the last hour + tells you how horribly she has just been treated by your sales manager, do not turn around and walk away when that Manager sticks his head out the door and calls you.  i took the time to thank you for your time even though your manager had upset me tremendously.  You could have at least shown me some common courtesy and respect.",1.6

580,"May 10, 2012","Pretty disappointed in this place. I've never bought a car from here but I bought a Mazda CX-7 from Honda right down the street. I have an airbag issue. My vehicle is an 07 and just hit 51,000. My service advisor had to take it there because it was a safety issue. Mazda apparently has a 60,000 mile or 5 yr warranty on these type of things. My warranty was expired by 4 months. They flat out refused to fix it. By four freakin months...
The greed in some of these companies amazes me. They were rude about the whole thing. I love Mazdas and when I trade mine in it definitely won't be at this one. I like places where the customer is first and appreciated. Oh, and they still made my service advisor pay $139 for the diagnostics. Greedy and does not care about their Mazda family. Go somewhere else where you'll be appreciated.",1.0

If they couldn't afford it, why did they call me there? Do not trust anything they say on the phone. They just want people to come to the dealership thinking they'll then buy the car at their price. DO NOT BUY A CAR FROM THEM. I rather recommend Town North. They were very friendly and stuck to their words.",1.0

586,"August 24, 2009","I have previously purchased 2 cars from this dealer and this salesperson (Brian Basevi).  After my recent experience, I will never set foot in the dealership again for any reason and would advise anyone else to stay away.

On a Monday, I test drove a 2010 CX-7 and decided to see if we could make a deal.  I was offered $11000 for my trade in and a total out-the-door price of $26800.  The trade-in was less than the value assigned by Edmunds and KBB so I told him I wanted to think about it.

On Wednesday, I decided I would buy the car.  I arranged financing with my credit union and left Brian a voice mail that I would take the deal.  Later that day when I went in to finalize the deal Brian and the sales manager changed it - offering $10600 for my trade and a total out-the-door price of $27200.  They told me that was the most they could get for my car from a wholesaler.  I told them that I considered it a ""bait and switch"" tactic and that it was completely unacceptable for them to change the deal after I had accepted it and that I wanted my keys as I was leaving.  They actually had the nerve to pretend that they couldn't find my keys while they tried to get me to take the deal.  I finally had to start yelling for Brian to suddenly locate my keys and give them to me so I could leave.  Later that day I e-mailed the owner and informed him of the situation but have never received a response.  I also contacted Mazda USA to inform them of the disreputable behavior of this dealer.
