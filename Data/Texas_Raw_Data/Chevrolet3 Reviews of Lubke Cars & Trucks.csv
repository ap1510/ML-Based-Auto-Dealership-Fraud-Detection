1,"January 23, 2012","As a first time car purchaser, I was a little intimidated by the idea of purchasing my first new car. Cory went above and beyond to explain all the details of the purchasing and financing experience. He walked me through the paperwork, and articulated very well what I was getting myself into. He also took the opportunity to make sure I was received all the rebates possible. I will definitely be shopping there again, and recommending Lubke's to all my peers interesting in buying a vehicle.

2,"January 23, 2012",My experience was great. They worked with me while I was at work and had all the paperwork ready for me and my Tahoe ready when I got there after work. Everyone was very helpful. It is a great small town dealership and great people to do business with. Thank you very much.,5.0
