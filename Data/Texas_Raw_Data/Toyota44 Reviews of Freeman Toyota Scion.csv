He was not pushy, answered my questions and delivered by new beautiful truck to my house! I wouldn't do it any other way ever again. I look forward to working with him again in the future! Thanks again guys! #FreemanRocks

4,"July 12, 2019","When my wife and I went in to purchase a new RAV 4, we were told that we were getting the best deal out there and not to worry about Mothers Day or Forth of July specials as we were getting the same deal as the holiday specials. So we purchased the vehicle. The next weekend, Mothers day, I called down there to see what pricing was available. Thank god my phone call was recorded. They were offering an additional $1750 off from what we had paid. Now we felt ripped off as we specifically asked the simple and direct question if we were going to get the best price. We added that we were willing to wait for any holiday special pricing. So of course, feeling stupid and taken advantage of, I called the Sales Manager, BJ. Left message and he then returned my call. The first words out of his mouth was that he saw my invoice and proceeded to tell me that they lost money on my deal. What??? Sales manager and losing money selling cars, I dont think I'm that stupid so I framed him as a dishonest liar. I was happy to take $500 back or even get some accessories for the new car. This man stood his ground that he was right and not willing to make a new customer happy. He did offer for us to bring the car back, but not sure how that would have finished. Really don't think he was sincere. Does anyone believe they lost money on the deal selling us a new vehicle? I must say that I did call other Toyota Dealerships, and better deals were being offered there, Richardson Toyota and Toyota of Fort Worth. Funny also, mentioned to other dealerships about my situation, and understand that BJ seems to have a poor reputation amongst the competition. We definitely  will not support our local dealership. By the way, the finance guy was a nice guy and helped with the finance part, also mentioned to him my situation, said he would talk to BJ, but to no avail. Not happy with dishonest people trying to prey on others. Wonder why the GM has not called me either, left him 2 messages. Writing this 2 months after we purchased with the hopes that someone would want to rectify any situation. No!! ",1.4
5,"May 04, 2019","I cannot stress enough how happy I am as a repeat Freeman customer.  Have been driving Toyotas for 20 years, and my last two purchases have been with Freeman.  We started with the online search to get an idea for what we were considering, and found the site easy to navigate, with enough information to get started.  We were not aggressively stalked when we first walked onto the lot.  Our salesman, Mark, answered every question we had and did not try to steer us in any way toward anything but what we were looking for.  Every step in the process from inquiry to finalizing the purchase was relaxed, and geared to satisfying us as customers.   On top of that, the price we paid came in less than what we compared it to on Edmunds.  ",5.0
6,"March 09, 2019","I have just today purchased my sixth and LAST vehicle from Freeman Toyota. Even though most of these purchases have been good experiences, the salesmen are becoming increasingly more deceptive and using more and more double-speak. I was frustated by this two wweks ago in purchasing a new 2019 4Runner Limited, and incensed by the deceptive tactics encountered today when buying a new 2019 Highlander Limited for my wife. The slander the sales personnel use against other area dealers is, above all, a description of their own practice and tactics. There are far too many Toyota dealers in the area to continue to spend tens of thousands of dollars only to have a slick willy mislead, deceive, and double-speak his way into more money out of my pocket. Freeman never again.",1.8

8,"January 04, 2019","The last time I brought my car in for servicing, the service department representative (Garrett, I believe) was unable to find the warranty information we purchased from another dealership so I ended up paying for the service. This surprised me as the time before the representative was able to find it.

When I took my car in for an oil change today, I worked with James. I feel he went above and beyond to address all of my questions and concerns (why does my account show that I did not attend my last visit, how can I have a copy of my warranty associated with my account so that, moving forward, I won't be charged for covered services, and can I be reimbursed for the last service appointment?) I cannot express how impressed I was by his customer service skills as he was professional and courteous; skills that seem to be sorely lacking in many people today. I was admittedly frustrated by my last visit to Freeman Toyota's service department, but after working with James I know I will be happily returning in the future. Thanks, James!",4.2
9,"November 05, 2018","Our 2008 Sequoia at times would not respond when turning the ignition key... When we took it in, we had all kinds of warning lights showing as we drove there.  We had the good fortune of getting CJ as our service rep.   He took fabulous care of us.   That day, they tried to replicate the issue and couldn't - the vehicle started perfectly every time.   Since he couldn't replicate the issue, he arranged for us to have a loaner.    He tried to replicate the issue all week long, and the vehicle started correctly every time.   While in the shop, CJ found a nail in the front tire and repaired that.  After 200+ tries to replicate the issue, we finally picked up our vehicle, very appreciative of the effort that was made.  CJ could've just said we needed a new starter, but he didn't want to replace a part unless he was sure that was the problem - we really appreciated that!   It has been two weeks, and the Sequoia is still starting perfectly every time!    We certainly will return and give our business to this dealership!     By the way, our 2008 Sequoia has been a pleasure to own!",5.0
10,"November 05, 2018","My phone would not communicate with the entune 3.0 system in the van and was treated with disdain from the sales staff when I first let them know it wasn't connecting.  I called the Toyota tech support number to work with them and they were unable to assist me and directed me back to the dealership.  I returned 2 days after the purchase and spent nearly 2 hours with sales staff illustrating that the problem was with the vehicle.  Once the sales staff realized there was a problem they called Toyota's corporate support and found a service bulletin for the issue I am experiencing.  They took the vehicle that evening and still have no idea when it will be repaired now  

I let my salesperson know that it is extremely disappointing to spend money on a new car that doesn't work as advertised.  I requested to swap the van out for another one that functions properly and was told that is not an option.

In the meantime, I was put in a 4Runner with a third row.  While I certainly appreciate a loaner that fits my family, it is extremely difficult to use it as a primary family car when you have 4 kids that are getting dropped off/picked up at school a 4Runner does not meet our expectations. 

One final note, in addition to issues with the entune system, I was told that my vehicle was eligible for the Verizon WiFi, upon activation I received a message that it wasn't eligible.   Additionally, the pre-collision detection system is not operating.  When I asked the sales person to demonstrate it and test it with me, he was completely unwilling.  At this point, I have no reasonable assurance that the vehicle will operate as advertised.  In fact, I am confident that when I come to pick it up after the entune system is fixed I will turn right back around and have in your shop getting something else fixed.  Unfortunately, I don't feel like I am a priority for Freeman Toyota at this point.

11,"October 15, 2018","First call I made inquiring about the vehicle no one called me back.  Next time I called I spoke with Ricky Simpson and he told me the car I was inquiring about was still available.  When I told him I was interested in the car he told me the price was not negotiable.  I didn't want to negotiate the price I just wanted the car.  He said the car was on a long test drive, then he said it went to the auction and didn't sell and they wanted to get rid of it because it had been on the lot a long time (87 days). I wanted to make arrangement to get the car because I already had approved financing and he started acting like he didn't want me to buy the car.  It seem s as he was holding it for someone else.  I told him I would call back to let him know when I could come and see/purchase the vehicle because I'm 250 miles away.  When I called back he said it had sold at the auction.  This dealership is not very trustworthy.  They had a for sure sale but Rick Simpson messed it up.  I'm sure he was holding it for someone else though.  ",1.6
12,"September 14, 2018","Trust based selling do not exist here.  I would not give them one star!

A few days ago I decided to call to ask where the deposit to my 2008 Tundra went in June went for the figures not making sense.  Been 20+ yrs since I been involved in any financing, green. Though the paperwork they gave me was not clear but they were lying to me throughout the transaction over days.  

THE Freeman Toyota LIE: ""They only going to finance you $17k, you gotta pay the rest on the $22k."" .I responded precisely with, ""well if it's less I would have to payoff."" 

As predicted when dealing with a stereotypical used car salesman (William Bates), that I did not know at the time.  When  I called to ask, he didn't know where the money goes he says, call the lender.  The lender, stated it like you didn't know, the dealership got the deposit.  

Truck was financed 100%. Got huslted on $5k. With a terrible rate rate.  

I will never do business with them or send anyone to them. 

I like the truck but this will not end well for the inception if this transaction tainted this transaction.",1.0
13,"June 27, 2018","Troy Thompson made what could have been a complicated process so easy.  Once he received my inquiry, he was prompt with emailing me a complete feature list for the car I was looking for along with a quote.  HE DID NOT BLOW UP MY PHONE, which I completely appreciated, yet he was extremely responsive and timely in returning my emails.  He answered every question completely and honestly, and we were able to work everything out in advance so that the actual buying process took less than an hour.  He provided me a loaner while we waited on my car to arrive, and he delivered my car to my house.  Who could ask for anything more?  Best car-buying experience I've EVER had.",5.0
14,"April 27, 2018","I was immmediately surprised when I drove to Freeman Toyota used car dealership, I was expecting to be overwhelmed with immediate “sales pressure”, as most are when going to purchase a car. Another reason is that I was a female on my own still looking for what I wanted, once I knew what I wanted I would have my husband come with to help with negotiations, and to be honest, to help deal with the sales pressure. I instead was met by Tina Marton, and immediately felt relief with her expert knowledge and non-pressure approach. She was extremely patient, as I came back twice to Test drive to narrow my decision. They didn’t have the exact color and other features in the Used Model I had decided on. Tina texted me often with updates, and no pressure felt with her communications. I came in a 3rd time with my husband to see SUV Tina had texted me about. Still not that dreaded, full on pressure which made us want to make sure we made our purchase with Tina and Freeman Toyota. I have never had better customer service purchasing a car. I will be back to see Tina and Freeman with my next purchase! I would recommend Tina and Freeman to anyone. Thanks for the awesome service and a great car... did I mention I love my SUV!",4.8

16,"December 30, 2017","The finance person  ( working  on Saturday Dec 30th ) begins the glass was unprofessional. They said they could do x payment only to come back higher. They said no co-signer needed and then said o’ we need a co-signer. The way they acted was the epitome of sleezy car sales men. I would never recommend anyone to this dealership. I have purchased over 8+ cars since living in Texas, and never have I had such terrible service. Don’t waste your time stopping at Freeman Toyota.

17,"October 04, 2017","I recently had to use my so called Extended Warranty. Russell the F & I person explained to me when I asked him,  what does that mean? Russell said, Bumper to Bumper means everything is covered except Tires and Battery. Okay add it to my balance of car. The problem I had with my 2013 Nissan Sentra SR was a loud road sound coming from the rear of the car.  It was determined by Service Person the loud grinding sound I was hearing was the rear Wheel Bearing. It could be fixed.  Okay let do it. When I got the Invoice with  the price of the Part, which was high and the labor Cost which added up to be over $600.00. Wow, that must be a gold platted wheel bearing. But the wheel was fixed. However, the other problem I had was having was with  the Radio with Blue Tooth Sound, hands free. The left button on the radio didn't work property, you cannot turn the volume up. But you could turn it up on the steering wheel. And, when you had the A/C on when driving the person in the other end such as your wife couldn't understand what you where saying, You have to turn off the A/C completely. The Service person I used said they call Nissan and the Radio was ""Out of Warranty"".  I was told I could go to Nissan and buy a after market radio or get one from a car toys place.  I told him his guy told me both wheel bearings were replaced. Wrong! I asked the young service person what about my Warranty and he said radios are not covered. What. I asked for the Service Manager, he told me how to use the radio worked.  That he looked at it and the sound  was okay and it was fixed, nothing wrong with it. Yeah right.  They screwed me around on the Radio and the Bumper to Bumper Warranty. Buyer be Ware of used car warranty. They are not transparent with their deal.  I still have to turn off my A/C Fan Motor so I can talk on my Phone. That's not right.",2.2
18,"September 23, 2017","I came to freeman toyota to shop for a new truck. I had an interest in both the Tundra and the Tacoma. When I came through the doors I was immediately welcomed by a salesman, so I assumed this would be a good visit...I was wrong. 
I explained that I wanted to look at the two trucks previously mentioned and I was told ""those are two very different trucks, do you know what your looking at"". Well of course, I'm here because I'm Shopping! 
The salesman proceeds to let me ""look"" at the floor models until I mention that I would be making my decision/purchase around december. I was immediately turned away and told ""to come back when I'm ready to buy"" and ""come back when you know what you want"". 
I then requested to test drive a Tacoma, and got a hard ""no"" because why would I test drive a car when by December they may not have any of those models. Is Toyota really gonna run out of Tacoma and Tundra trucks?!
I was then given a brochure of each model truck and shown the options page for each and was told ""look at this and when you know the options you want come back""
Seriously!? Worst car experience I've ever had. When I went to 5-star ford earlier this afternoon, I told them I would not buy until December and they went out of their way to let me test drive 3 vehicles that matched what I was looking for. If I decide to buy a Toyota it will not be from this location. ",1.0

20,"April 28, 2017","The first time I leased (ever leased a car) I leased a RAV4 XLE 2015 from Moses who way overcharged me.  I had to put down nearly $10,000 to get a payment down to something I could afford under $200.  That was my life savings.  He kept coming up with one excuse after the other to justify why I had to put down so much money. I was in such a need for a car but could not buy one at the time or I would have left after hearing the price.  None of it was true and I even had the recent salesman tell me I put way too much down also.  Two years later and I decided not to do business with Freeman Toyota again, but Jeff Harper contacted me and he seemed nice and reasonable so I decided to go through him to lease another vehicle as I cannot afford to buy yet again.  

Mind you, I am a single female and a senior citizen.

You would think I wouldn't have anything go wrong the second time around and while staying with the Toyota brand rather than go with others I've seen and liked, but no, that was not the case.

I told Jeff what I wanted, which was another XLE only white with another color interior instead of black again.  I wanted everything on it just like the one I was turning in.  Not a problem.  I had to leave town to see my father who was/is very sick so he said he would put a hold on it and put it under my name.  After agreeing everything was the same, I said to go ahead.  When I returned to trade the cars out and test drive the new one, I saw and was told, there was no CD player in it as Toyota was phasing out CD's on all of its models starting with 2017.  Really, when other brands are ""loaded?"" This car also did not have the remote liftgate feature, meaning you have to open & close the liftgate manually which can be difficult with groceries, etc.  My other car did have this feature too.  Why would they not put that feature on a car, especially in these times?  I was not happy about this at all but felt I was now obligated in taking it. I let Jeff know I wasn't happy mostly about the lack of a CD player because I have a lot of them and which I use often.  He tried to tell me how great and easy it was to download music to my phone only I don't have the means to do that nor do I even want to do that. I asked several people at work about doing this and didn't really understand, for me, it's just too much trouble. It may sound small to some people but it’s a big deal to me.  I like music, I like to play my CD’s on trips, and listen to my audio books.  I did ask about getting another car that included these features, like I was assured this one had, and was told that if he had to go someplace else and bring it back, it would cost me more money.  I couldn't afford any more, so I felt I had to stay with this car, or so I thought. He failed to mention that there were several other cars in the back with the same colors and they all had CD players in them except one!  I do know there was at least one in the back that had all the options that my old car had plus the 2017 additions, I just wasn't told about any of them.  (I have that cars stock# & VIN#).  I found out about it after going online trying to figure out what was standard on a 2017 XLE and came across the inventory for Freeman Toyota.  That's when I saw all the other cars just like what I wanted, same price after the $2,000 rebate like I paid.  The one car I wanted had a $39.00 difference, which I offered to pay!  What's even worse was I borrowed that money for a down payment from my sick father.  Now I'm angry at what happened to me and I want it corrected.  You did this to a second time customer knowing I wasn't treated right the first time!  That's bad business, period.  

I was told not to worry about the last payment on the old car since I was making the first payment on the new one, that it would all work out when Toyota got the paperwork.  I called the CSR department to verify this and was told I'm responsible for that last payment plus I'm responsible for all of the remaining balance of that car!  I did not realize that but instead thought Toyota would be taking that over or so I was lead to believe.  The rep then said I was approved for a $750 Loyalty credit which was never mentioned nor offered to me!  This is the first time I've ever had to lease a second time and was not sure what to expect.  I'm pretty sure now that I could have gotten that payment under $200 with the down payment and the Loyalty credit added in.  When I asked about the prices quoted on their own website with down payments, Jeff said not to believe everything you read because it's misleading to the public.  He was right about that.

I want them to take this demo car or whatever it was really meant for and trade it back for the car I found in their inventory and make this right.  So Mr. Dane Minor (GM) are you willing to help me with this and make my second lease to be what it should have been?  I hope so because if not, that would leave me no choice but to go to the regional level, national hotline, and let all of the social websites including the cars.com, edmunds.com, etc. know my review and why.  If that doesn't work, I have Michael Groff and James (Jim) Lentz's emails plus president Akio Toyoda's.  

This was to be my ""forever"" car as I was planning on buying it after this lease was up, not anymore.  
As a senior citizen, I have rights too.  Why Jeff, did you feel the need to dump your bottom-of-the-line car on me?  Shame on your dealership for pulling this stunt!",1.0

Thanx to Michael Daniels for his compassion and friendly smile. He made our day. ,5.0
24,"June 26, 2016","After being displeased with the demeanor of the salesman that was attending to my request and having to wait almost a half hour for the car to be brought to me for a test drive, I contacted the sales manager on duty, Jeff Morris, to complain about the whole process. Here's a description of that conversation and subsequent events from a letter I wrote to the General Manager (unanswered), which, I'm hoping, will discourage many prospective buyers to set foot in this place. 

I asked Morris for five minutes of his time in private. He took me to a side office, where I expressed my dissatisfaction with Bill, the salesman. Even though such complaints occur very rarely in my case, the managers in the past used to be in full control of their customer service skills and use them to pacify rather than antagonize me regardless of whether they believed me or regardless of what they intended to do about the salesman I complained about. Not so Jeff Morris. From the very start, he gave the impression of taking Bill's side. When I mentioned that Bill didn't advise me in a timely manner about the problems he was having in getting the car, Jeff kept repeating the mantra that he did eventually inform me. I then admonished Jeff for not showing requisite customer service skills. Instead of saying something like: ""I apologize, sir, for the experience you had. Our dealership's policy is to make you fully satisfied. Would you like me to get you another salesman?"", he was continuously on the defensive. He even accused me of raising my voice at him - as if he were some kind of untouchable high priest instead of an individual that's about 30 years my junior. Finally, he said, ""So, what would you like me to do?"" I said: ""Well, I don't think you can do anything for me at this dealership."" He immediately changed his demeanor, stated that he wanted me to leave and practically threw me out of. I said, ""Jesus Christ, are you throwing me out!?"" Of course, that expression, just like ""my God"", has no religious defamatory connotations and is used in this and other English-speaking countries by hundreds of millions of Christians and non-Christians on a daily basis. His hypocritical answer was: ""We're a Christian dealership and we don't like you to use those words."" In the same breadth he said, ""Now CARRY YOUR BEHIND (he used the stronger three-letter word) OUT!"" When I asked for his name, Morris refused to give it to me. I figured out later that his escorting me was designed to minimize any chance of my going upstairs and complaining to his higher-ups. 

Not willing to play a wilting violet, I called the dealership after I got back home to obtain the owner's or General Manager's e-mail address/phone number. They kept transferring me, and I finally got Morris even though he was the last person I wanted to talk to. He called me a ""donkey"" (again, he used the stronger three-letter word) and said that our conversation was on a speaker so that the whole dealership can hear it. He kept pulling his Christian creds on me even though he behaved more like a servant of the devil rather than of Jesus. When I hung up on him, he called me back, pretending that he was exercising customer service civility because, in his words, ""we were cut off"". 

Apparently, at Freeman Toyota, Jeff Morris has a carte blanche to behave like a bully, insult customers without a justified cause, use a perverted notion of Christianity as a fig leaf for his aggressive mentality, and throw out a customer who himself had voiced an intention to leave the premises. I've never encountered this kind of customer service fiasco before in my 60+ years of life.

25,"October 12, 2015","Scheduled for Monday morning at 7am.  Employee there said to drop it off Sunday night for early bird.  Got there, gates locked.  Then called Monday to tell them we can't come in at 7am as scheduled but ""Brady"" said to come on in.  Got there a little after 9am and said he will call me by noon to let me know what they found out on the alternator belt.  Noon passes-NO CALL.  I called at 1pm and Brady said they have been busy and said my car is next in line to be looked at.  Brady said he will call me within the hour to update.  2pm came and NO CALL.  3pm came and NO CALL.  So, I called and asked for Service Manager-not in.  Called for the next manager in line-not available.  So ""Brittany"" took down my info and said they were very busy and it was why no one has called me back-after I was told by Brady he would call me back at NOON and at 2pm after I called him at 1pm.  Brady calls shortly after I talked to Brittany and said they still haven't gotten to my car yet.  He said the tech was still ""stuck"" on the car in front of me.  

He said his team was short handed so I asked him why don't he get help from other teams knowing he was short handed.  He said it doesn't work like that.

26,"September 18, 2015","Made an appointment with BIG Mike and I arrived about 20 minutes after stated time and he was with someone else, which I understand...I was late..thats my issue.  However he could have greeted me and handed me to another salesman. After about 45 minutes he finally talked to us but he wouldn't look at my trade in (lease return), run my credit, or even look us in the eye. He put me in the corner and told me to wait.  I was interested in a Kia listed online for 13999. he said it was 14999 and told me it was a deal since it should be 15999. when asked where the difference was coming from he couldnt respond. that is false advertising to start with...he flat out refused to work with me after I said I was uninterested in a car with 118,000 miles on it! He didn't want to make a sale because he knew it would be a loss monetarily for him. He was disgruntled from the moment I walked in and extremely rude. He is exactly why people think used car sales men are sleezy, liars.  He is very dishonest and is giving a bad repuation to Freeman Toyota.
The only saving grace was the NEW CAR side of the dealership. Moses in new car sales is AWESOME!",1.0
27,"September 17, 2015","I was searching various Toyota dealerships for a new 2015 Toyota Camry hybrid XLE. 
I was quoted a very detailed quote on the vehicle they had in stock including the msrp, all options, dealer discounts and rebates.

The salesperson sent all of this information to me in writing. He said in his first set of emails that this vehicle had no dealer adds! And bragged that some dealers do that to inflate the selling price. In the very next email he sent me, he reversed himself and stated that it did in fact have about $700 in dealer adds! 

That should have told me to run but I didn't. I asked the salesman to send me the stock # of the vehicle he was quoting me since I could not find it on the Freeman Toyota website. He sent it to me and I checked it against the msrp that he had quoted me and there was a $5,000 difference!

I asked this salesman which msrp was correct? The one he quoted me in writing or the msrp on their website. He responded, sorry for the typo, the website msrp is correct.

Now, he isn't just off a little, he is off $5,000. So instead of the selling price he quoted me of $24k, it suddenly becomes $29k.

I immediately emailed the salesman and said this feels like ""bait and switch.""
He writes me back and says, LOL, this isn't bait and switch!

Unbelievable! I'm so glad that this Freeman Toyota employee thinks it's a laughing matter to be off by 5 thousand dollars. How can they let someone so incompetent be sending out written quotes and then be off by 5k dollars??

I emailed the GM of the dealership and at first he didn't respond so I emailed him a 2nd time. He responded by saying it was not bait and switch because I never entered the dealership. Again, unbelievable! He stood by his employee and said it was a mistake but the GM never once apologized even though I had been referred by syndicated radio host, Jerry Reynolds.

The thing is, they sell so many cars that they don't care about this one screw up. It's not an isolated event, I believe this is how they operate. Please be careful if you ever deal with Freeman Toyota. Remember that your quote may be off by $5,000 also!",1.0

Had a free Sprite, signed the papers, talked to Accounting and drove home in less time than I usually spend at church. Thanks Everyone!",5.0

30,"November 21, 2014","This was by far the smoothest vehicle purchase I have EVER experienced (and I have prurchased MANY). Alvin (sales) and Wes (finance) did a wonderful/outstanding job keeping it simple, fast and more than fair. I have dealt with all kinds on salesmen as well as F and I guys you 2 guys were Stellar! Keep up the excellent work and I will send anyone looking to purchase your way. I can honestly say after this purchase that I am a Freeman buyer for life....",5.0
31,"October 22, 2014",After having a horrible service else where. My husband and I came here to purchase a new Tc. ...well we ended up getting a camry. *love it* our sales guy was very professional and nice. He went up and beyond what a regular sales person should do. Thank you fisel & toyota!  I will definitely recommend this dealership.  10+,5.0
32,"May 18, 2013",I should have trusted my gut and walked away from from this dealership.  I have learned my lesson and will never shop or buy a car from this dealership again.  They were very aggressive and unfriendly.  All the promises that they made were never kept.  The price we agreed on and the monthly due date we agreed on was not what I ended up with.  I tried to talk to someone about it afterwards and they were not helpful at all.  Take it from me and stay away.,1.0
33,"May 02, 2013","We had a wonderful experience working with the Internet Sales Manager, Wes Gerhardt. He was prompt, informative and pricing was very competitive. So much so that we drove our new Scion xB home last night. I highly recommend him and Freeman Toyota/Scion if you are in the market for a vehicle. Again, thank you Wes for making this such a wonderful experience! ",5.0

35,"January 11, 2013",I've leased/purchased 4 vehicles from Freeman Toyota over the past decade for myself and my family and every single visit has been great.  I really appreciate that the General Manager is usually on hand to make customers feel welcome.  My last visit was to get a new 2013 Prius and I love the vehicle.  I think the entire experience took under 45 minutes (including financing) and everyone was very attentive to my needs.  This is a family-owned dealership and you can tell they want to make sure that every customer is happy.  I would proudly recommend Freeman Toyota to friends and family... and I have for years.,5.0
36,"January 07, 2013","My experience with Freeman Toyota was great!  Owning a service business, I have purchased many vehicles over the years.  All previous vehicles had been Ford and Chevrolet, but with re-occurring problems with most of them, (and doing some research) I decided to give the Toyota Tundra a shot.  In my business we focus heavily on customer service so I am the first one to pick a company or person apart that lacks in customer service.  In this transaction with the people at Freeman Toyota the customer service was top notch!  I knew what truck I wanted, the options, color, and price I thought was fair (I know Freeman is NOT a non-profit organization and they have to make money as well).  I called and told Bj exactly what I wanted, he found me a truck in San Antonio but had me come into dealership and showed me three different Tundras (interior of one, wheels and step bar on another, and dash option on a third).  This process took about 30 minutes.  We went back to Bj's office sat down and agreed on price for new Tundra and price I was wanting for my trade, that took about 10 minutes - including paperwork!  I then went down to financing department and Seth had me in and out of there in less than 15 minutes!  Awesome experience so far...  When my truck arrived from San Antonio 3 days later I went back to pick it up.  I met with Andy who went over some key points in the Owner's Manual, went through the new Tundra with me showing all options and accessories and how they worked, he even helped set up the bluetooth on my phone and program some numbers into the trucks system.  Andy then took me on a tour of the Service Department, explained different maintenance schedules for different items and also scheduled my first oil change with an e-mail reminder!  This process took about 1 hour simply because so much attention to detail.  AWESOME customer service from start to finish!  I will let everyone know about Freeman Toyota!",5.0
37,"November 26, 2011","Troy Ross was easy to work with.  We felt like he was genuine, not fake like some of the other car salesman we encountered.  There were no gimmicks or high pressure sales tactics from anybody we dealt with.

I called to see if he could beat a written quote from another dealer.  He confirmed that he could via email, so we went to have our trade-in evaluated.  After some negotiation, we were able to come to a fair price between our trade in and the price of our new RAV4.  Troy was professional and respectful during the entire process -- from my initial phone call to handing us the keys to our new car.  

I have recommended this dealership to others and will continue to do so.  ",4.8
38,"October 12, 2011",Price was high. Customer service was poor. They were at least not crafty or dishonest. They were trying to get me a car that I wanted. But did not know the specifics of the dealer addons that they put. ,2.8
39,"August 16, 2011","My wife and I purchased a brand new Toyota 4runner from freeman(Hurst,TX.) in 2007.  We had the vehicle in for service 4 times during the warranty period for a popping noise coming from the brake system.  The first tree times they told my wife they could not reproduce the problem or find anything wrong.  Just prior to 36k I went with her to the dealer because it was obvious there was something wrong with the braking system and we wanted it fixed before it went out of warranty.  They told me the sound was normal and they would take care of it regardless of warranty.   the vehicle now has 43k and the ABS brake booster assy had to be replaced.  The original quote was $3200.00 but when I found they were charging over MSRP for the parts and two GALLONS of brake fluid they adjusted the price to just under $2300.  I asked them not to discard the old part so I could have an engineer find the actual cause of the problem.  They did not return the part even though it was my part and I had paid for the NEW part.  I called the Toyota Customer Experience number to see what could be done.  I spoke to Tony who stated that the Freeman service manager assured him that the popping noise when braking had no relation to the current brake failure.  My question then was how can they know that there is no relation when they could never identify the source or the noise in the first place.  I asked Tony with Toyota if there was anything that could be done to leverage the dealership but he told me that they are a private entity/business. Never mind the Toyota name is all over the place.  The part that was replaced was a #4705035030 and you are welcome to look up the amount of the part online.  I feel like this dealership treated my wife as she did not know what she was talking about with the problem. They told me the noise was normal and they did not make good to fix the problem once it was out of warranty.  They tried to overcharge for the part and tried to bill us for ten times the amount of brake fluid in the entire system.  They were dishonest when they told Toyota the two things were unrelated when they could never identify the original issue. Toyota did not even question that logic.  No car should be having such costly repairs at such low mileage.  The part was either poorly engineered or was defective but I will never know since they did not let me keep it even though I asked both verbally and in email.  You have been warned!!!!! ",1.4
40,"March 17, 2011","Freeman Toyota of Hurst employees lack integrity. They lack some other things also. This is a profit driven dealership. They will run over their customers to make a big profit. They will go even as far as changing the sales price on the contract to steal from you after you sign it. They will stall you until a big profit is made off of you. Bring a lawyer if you do decide to go here. I advise you not to.  Positive reviews here are more than likely FAKES made by their own employees. Common sense dictates when a person has a bad experience they will spread the word to warn others. 
Just turn around find some other dealer. You will be sorry if you ever set foot in this place. ",1.0
41,"June 25, 2010","I just got home with my new Toyota Highlander Hybrid and I am just so very happy with this great SUV (and it's gas mileage!!) and the way we were treated there as well!  We went there through the internet department and we are very pleased how that happened as well.  We saved about $1200 over what the other dealer offered us on the exact same vehicle!  So saving money, saving time, no drama...we like that for sure!",5.0
42,"April 13, 2010","They were honest and there was no pressure.  When they didn't have the specific vehicle I wanted, they found it and brought it to their store for me without charge.  I would recommend Freeman and BJ to anyone looking for a Toyota and I'll definitely be back when it's time for my next purchase.  ",5.0
