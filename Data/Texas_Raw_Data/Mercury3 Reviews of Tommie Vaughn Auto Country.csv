0,"May 30, 2012","Purchased a 2012 Shelby GT500.  Paid full sticker price.  Upon delivery, vehicle had a nick in the console and discoloration in the bezel around the navigation screen.  Ford denied warranty service to correct these problems.   Dealer failed to convince Ford that the problems were due to manufacturing defects.  

In contrast, my other new car experiences were significantly better:   2001 Acura MDX (purchased from Sterling McCall), 1999 Mercedes Benz E320 (purchased from Star Motors), and 2011 BMW 328 (purchased from Momentive).  Both Sterling McCall and Star Motors corrected manufacturing defects withough argument and without cost to me.  

For the time being, I do not plan to return to Tommie Vaughn, and am not likely to make another Ford purchase.   ",1.4
1,"August 29, 2011","Found a ""great"" deal at the dealership through the internet.  After talking with ""Andy"", I took off 1/2 day work to make the 1.5 hour drive to the dealership.  On the way I called to confirm some details of the vehicle.  Upon arrival, I was told this ""great"" deal was sold, but the dealership had plenty of other vehicles to choose from.  This seems a classic case of ""bait and switch"" - I confirmed the vehicle and was never contacted until arriving.  I can not confirm the ethical behavior of the rest of the buying experience, but would suggest caution.  Would suggest the good people of Columbus Tx visit the Houston area when looking for a car.",1.7
2,"February 03, 2011","I called the dealership and told service advisor I wanted the egr coolant hose replaced  on my 2004 Ford F-350 Super Duty and asked how much it would cost.  He told me $160.00, and I asked if the part ($48.35) was included in thes price, he said yes. I took the truck for the repair. He called me about 2 hours later and said the truck was ready, but the service tech had to replace a corroded tube, which was $60.00 more. I said that is  fine I will come and pick up my truck. He also said, after replacing the egr coolant hose,  the service tech pressure tested the system to check for leaks and  that there was a leak from my egr cooler and he would show me this when I arrived. When I arrived the service advisor and the service tech took me to my truck and hooked the pressure tester to the truck and showed me where the leak was coming from. They advised me not to drive the truck away from the dealership because there could be some engine damage.  They asked me if the truckhad ever ran rough, smoked, or had overheated. I told them the truck runs and performs very well. I told them that the only problem I had was the seepage from the egr coolant hose,  that they just replaced.  I asked the service tech to show me the the corroded tube he had replaced, and he looked at the service tech and said quote,I did not replace the tube, because we do not have one in stock, end quote. The service tech and I went to his desk and he closed the repair ticket. The total was  $226.70. I asked him if he took off the charge of $60.00 off the bill, because they did not replace the tube. He told me that the extra $60.00 was for pressure testing the service performed. I did not argue with him and paid the $226.70 bill.  After leaving the dealership my truck started blowing white smoke, it did not overheat or run rough.  The truck had never smoked prior to the visit to this dealership. I have driven it about 60 miles since then and am taking it to another dealer. Did they sabatoge my cooling system? I certainly hope not. This is becoming an integrity issue.  I contacted the GM of the dealership and told him about my experience and he said he would get right back to me.  He did call and said he had talked to the service tech and the tech said he had showed me the old hose that he had replaced. I said that is true, but I am talking about the $60.00 extra charge. He said the service advisor was out to lunch and hbe would call me back.  I waited until 430 pm and called him.  His first comment to me was quote,I'm very upset because you tried to hire my mechanic, end quote.  My reply was quote,I asked him (the service tech) if he did work on vehicles outside of the dealership and he said that he did, end quote.  That is all that was said between me and the service tech. The GM asked me what is it that I wanted him to do.  I told him all I wanted him to do was refund my  $60.00 overcharge for the part that was not installed.  He asked me if I had paid by check or credit card.  I told him that i had paid by check and he said I would be receiving a refund in the mail. So, is there an integrity issue here?  Was my cooling system sabatoged?  I did not mention to the GM that I had bought a new Dodge 3500 in 2007 from them. I've had it serviced at the Dodge service dept in their dealership with no problems. ",2.2
