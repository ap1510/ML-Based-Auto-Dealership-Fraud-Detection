1,"May 06, 2020","Horrible experience. They prey on uninformed people. My father and I bought 2 mega cabs. The next day they said financing fell through for my father but had another contract ""for just a little bit more interest"" this is called spot delivery and is done because the dealer gets all of this added interest, and ITS ILLEGAL he didn't have to sign the new contract but he did. Weeks later driving in my new truck and they call me saying my financing fell through, but I didn't fall for that. We signed a contract if I can't back out when it's signed neither can the dealer. But they have been harrassing me and my father for a month now, Carlos the finance manager has been threatening me and my father and so has Zachary owens. Even after the sheriff has told them they can't do anything they still keep lying and harassing me. If you're looking to get harassed and taken advantage of go ahead and come here. They prey on un informed and people that can't afford an attorney for stuff like this, but they're getting a rude awakening with me ill see you in court cjdr of midland.",1.0

11,"July 22, 2019","My salesmen and his manager apologized for the mix up in vehicles but stated a resolution was out of their hands and rests with the management. Neither the dealership nor their owners, Lithia Motors, are members of or answer to the BBB. After my bait and swap I can tell you why. ALL American is rated F on the BBB for good reasons.  The Administration of the dealership and their parent company Lithia Motors have refused to correct the situation.",1.4

16,"April 02, 2019","Randy Castaneda was my sales person and let me tell you, he went above and beyond to make sure I got exactly what I wanted. 
I was pretty specific on the car I wanted as well as what features I wanted it to have. I know a sales person's nightmare, right? (JK) However, Randy treated me with respect and he was extremely patient with me. He kept in contact with me frequently and listened to understand what I was looking for and gave me a great selection of options to look at without overwhelming me. He promised that he would do everything he could to find exactly what I was looking for and he did just that! I am a proud owner of a 2019 Dodge Challenger, Pitch Black, with 20"" granite rims, leather seats, sunroof, 8.4"" display screen, and 6 Alpine speakers. 
His level of expertise and genuine care for his customers can not be measured. 
I highly recommend any one who may be in the market for a new vehicle to contact Randy Castaneda at All American Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram of Midland. ",5.0
17,"January 04, 2019","WARNING: Take a lot of Hydrocodone and Alprazolam before bringing your car to their service department! Also prepare to experience their 5 star incompetency!

I would personally give this clown of a dealership a -0/5 stars. The service department is managed by a bunch of clowns who do not know what they are doing. Customer service does not exist in their work ethics. Worst of all, they do not have word of honor. Let me start with my story: I had my Charger stuck on sports mode. I brought it to Dodge Midland (12/1/18) to tell them the issue, I also requested an oil change and an alignment to be done to the car as well. One of the service advisers booked me on the 28th of December. 2 hours after, oil change and alignment were done. Before leaving the dealership, one of the service technicians told me that the bolt on the driver‚Äôs side control arm was loose and he had to tighten it. On my way home, I have noticed that the steering wheel on my car was not aligned properly. Bottomline is 2 of the issues happened after the alignment. Fast forward to 12/28, I brought the car to the dealer for the suspension issue and the loose upper control arm bolt that they messed up after the alignment. Service adviser told me that the car will be seen the week after the 28th of December (Between Dec. 31-Jan 4) due to the fact that they claimed that they were ‚Äúshort-handed‚Äù and the cars ‚Äúbacked up.‚Äù I felt disappointed due to the fact that the car has to sit there for a week, but the heck..I gave it a shot. The service adviser told me that he will give me a call between the week to update me with the status of the car. I did not receive a call from them. I gave them a call in the middle of the week, service guy told me that the technician has not seen the car yet and to give him a couple of days. After a couple of days, I called to follow up and the service adviser has too many excuses just to give me false assurance. He told me that the car has not been seen by the technician and the earliest day that they could see it is Monday (1/7/19). I asked him if there is a guarantee that it is going to be seen on that Monday, the clown said ‚Äúthere is no guarantee.‚Äù So in short, if I leave the car there, it will sit in their lot for Lord knows how long.‚Äù That there made me mad at their unprofessionalism. Bottomline is I have to take the car back and probably bring it somewhere due to the ‚Äú5 star‚Äù incompetency of the service  department of Dodge Midland. This is probably my last Dodge car. The service ruined my experience. The service department needs major overhaul or major re-training of their staff!!!

The price was fair, the trade in rapidly negotiated and financing was efficiently handled by the finance manager. All of the employees I met were cheerful and accommodating.

42,"August 29, 2017","I originally purchased an older, used vehicle off their lot. My budget was low and very specific and they got me in the best vehicle possible for my needs. Unfortunately, after a mishap with the motor shortly after purchasing, Lisa went above and beyond to make sure I left their lot again with exactly what I needed - ultimately a running, reliable vehicle as my baby was due in two days. Not only did she get me out of the used vehicle, avoiding major service repairs, but I drove off their lot in a brand new '17 vehicle in budget, but also with zero financial repercussions from the used vehicle. Lisa took all of my personal needs into full account with extreme concern about what was best for me and my family. Through this purchase, I have grown to know Lisa on a little more personal level and her actions were literally a life saver for my family's emotional and financial needs. Thank you!",5.0

45,"July 15, 2017","Purchasing a vehicle is something I usually dread, because it is aggravating and time consuming. This experience was much more pleasant because of Car Salesman Zachary Owen. Zak is efficient, professional, and knows what he is doing. He answered emails pmomptly, communicated clearly, and was knowledgeable about the vehicles. He followed up on our lost set of keys, until a new set was made for us. I highly recomend him- if you hate the usual haggling & messing around, and just want a good car at a fair price! ",4.0
46,"July 13, 2017","Buying a new car is stressful and I have always approached it with a sense of dread, but Alex and Mike at All American CJD of Midland made if a fun and enjoyable experience.  My questions and concerns were addressed knowledgably and every effort was made to insure that I was comfortable with my purchase and trade-in. Kevin in finance was very thorough in completing the paperwork - lots of paperwork - and explaining all the details.   The experience was entirely easy and I would definitely buy here again.  

Thanks for the laughter too!!

47,"July 10, 2017",Well to start off it took 3 days to get my vehicle after I purchased it. Secondly the communication around is very poor. So when I finally got my car the carpet was soaking wet son had to leave my window down for then to dry. Now I'm having to take my car back to get serviced and nobody can tell me anything. The service worker said he was trying to get ahold of Zac and he didn't have his cell phone number. Seriously?   And Zac said he was trying to get ahold of him. But in the mean time I'm talking to the both of them. So I'm with out a vehicle that I'm paying for and have had it for only had it for 5 day. ,1.0

Went in and stood in the lobby for 15 mins waiting and finally a guy came and helped me. Told me I would have to leave my truck for 2 to 3 days so they can fix it. Never offered me a rental or anything. I walked out and will not return to buy or fix anything else. You have lost my business and we buy a new cummins truck about twice a year.

60,"January 25, 2017","The purchase of the vehicle went smoothly and the sales associate and finance guy were both friendly. However, when I drove the vehicle home is when the problems began. After a couple of hours on the road the CEL came on and I noticed a severe lack in power. I had the OBD codes pulled, in total 8 codes came up and I noticed multiple loose hoses under the hood. I then parked the Jeep for the night to prevent any damage and found an alternate way home. The next morning I had the vehicle towed to my local Lithia dealer in Santa Fe, NM where it has sat for the last 3+ days. I called All American and told the sales associate about my issues. I was told I would get a call back from the appropriate people... there have been no attempts to contact me other than this satisfaction survey. I was also told that this vehicle passed their 160 point quality inspection and that there were no issues with the Jeep. I question what they are looking at during this inspection if they saw no issues‚Ä¶ my untrained eye was able to find loose hoses while looking at it for 30 seconds. Hopefully the Santa Fe Lithia can restore this lemon back into working condition! When you buy a used car from a dealer, which I have done a handful of times prior to this, you expect some cosmetic flaws; but to sell a vehicle that breaks down on the drive home is inexcusable. I gave my experience one star because it was not an option to give zero stars.

2/14/2017 Update - My Jeep has now been in the shop for 24 days, and nothing has been done to correct this issue. The only communication I receive is when I call one or both dealers; I never receive a call to give me an update or status. The Jeep came with a 60 day/ 3000 mile warranty, but I am afraid that my whole warranty period will be spent in the shop. I inquired about extending this warranty to be effective when I actually receive the fixed Jeep, but was told that wasn't possible. At this point I am not convinced that All American Midland is concerned about customer satisfaction at all. I am very disappointed with this whole experience.",1.0
61,"January 21, 2017","I called and made an appointment with this dealership to have my truck repaired.  I later called back to see if I could reschedule, but they informed me that they did not show me as having an appointment.  Then they told me that I could go ahead and bring the vehicle in anyway.
I brought the vehicle in, gave one of the representatives my keys, and also gave him my contact information and details of the work to be done on the vehicle ect.  After they had my vehicle for three days, and I had missed meetings and appointments, due to not having a vehicle, I called only to discover that they did not even realize they had my vehicle.  I was put on hold numerous times while they spoke with this person and that, trying to figure out who was handling my repair.  Finally someone informed me that they had located my information and that they would be starting on it right then.
After another day of doing without personal transportation I called to find out the status.  At this time I was informed that they would need to order a part and that it would be about a week or so.  In other words, not only had they still not done anything, ordered the part, or even called me to find out what to do, but I was to be without my vehicle for another week.  I asked if they had lender that I could use, because I had already been without a car for four days, and they said, ""No, we don't have anything like that."" At this point I informed them that I would rather take it to someone who would communicate with their customers and keep track of their automobiles and that I would be there shortly to pick it up.",1.4

Don't believe a word they tell you! The most frustrating thing is NOBODY in this entire dealership will return calls!!!!!! Even Scott, the General Manager, won't return calls!! I had to contact the Jeep Corporation just to get a phone call from then.  They promise many things when they're out for the sale, but after that you're on your own! PLEASE don't buy from this dealership!!!!!!",1.2
79,"April 03, 2016","Potential buyers be aware of what can happen at this place!! I'm truly disappointed in this dealership and lack of integrity and the dishonesty is incredible, I would rename the the dealership "" UnAmerican CJDR of Midland"". Two days ago I did an inquiry on a truck I wanted to buy, I loved the truck and wanted to make a deal and was willing to drive 428 miles from my home to go get it. Yes 428mi.!! The next day had a salesman, Daniel B. contact me and I give him the situation and we start the process of getting the all the information and submit a credit app. Couple of Emails and a bunch of texts and about 8 calls we were on our way to getting this thing done and I was amazed how good it was going..Now Daniel was a breeze to deal with and very nice person Over the phone doing the deal he also was working in tandem with one of the managers Scott J.  Once approved for the loan we hash out the deal and made one last call to Daniel saying I want the truck, to consider it sold and I'm on my way to come get it. That was 1:43pm. Daniel told me at that time that him and Scott, since I was coming in from out of town that they would have all the paperwork and everything done so I could walk in and sign and drive. I gather my things and take off from my house, fill up my current truck and start my journey. At this point I'm happy and excited how easy this was going! I drive 298miles out if the 428 miles and at 5:10pm Daniel calls me and asks where I am, I tell him and then he tells me that I should turn around and that they sold the truck to someone else. What?!?! Yes!!!! They sold the truck right out from underneath me. You can tell at this point that the sales managers and general manager as well are completely disengaged in the people that try to deal with this dealership because they sent a salesman(low man on the totem pole) to call me and tell me this. So now, this dealership has completely wasted my time, money, inquiry's on my credit report and I have nothing to show for it but an attitude from them of ""oh well sorry about your bad luck."" The way that these people do business is just amazing. I'm sure this dealerships internet people will try and give some excuses to what happen or even try to disprove my story, but I have kept all the Emails, texts and took pictures of my call history and getting my credit reports as I type this to back up and prove what I say is true. If your a potential buyer that tries to be honest and has integrity and a good moral compass do yourself a favor and find another place to buy your next vehicle. If you don't take my advice, well ""good luck"". ",1.2

101,"September 30, 2015","I was interested in a used car that All American had posted on their site, Cars.com, and AutoTrader. I went by on a Sunday, in hopes of seeing the car (but without dealing with salespeople). 

The gates were open (even to the service area, should be worrisome to anybody leaving their car with them).

I was immediately taken back by how much of a mess the lot was. I‚Äôve never seen a dealership so disorganized (cars were haphazardly parked every which way).

The car was nowhere to be found (a risk I took when driven over).

During the week, I called to confirm the car‚Äôs status. I was surprised by the reply of ‚Äúwe sold that weeks ago‚Äù.  It was pointed out that the car was still listed online, and the response was ‚Äúthat only gets updated about once a month‚Äù. The car was long gone, but as of my writing this (four days after my visit), the car is still listed on those sites. They clearly don‚Äôt have anybody overseeing their digital presence. 

It shouldn‚Äôt be a surprise; during my visit, I noticed that most of the used cars they were advertising online were nowhere in sight.

Given that nearly 100% of consumers start their car search online, I don‚Äôt want to deal with a business that doesn‚Äôt value my time.

With three Ram dealers in town and a couple more between El Paso and Midland, some folks may wonder why I'd purchase a truck from All American CDJ in Midland. I had two reasons; 1) I had a specific list of options I wanted on my new Ram 1500 truck and 2) I wanted to get it for a reasonable price. I actually had to contact Robert Davis in Midland to find a salesperson who wanted to find the truck I wanted. Robert made no effort to persuade me to buy anything other than exactly what I wanted, to include color. He and his associate Big Mike searched around and found the exact truck I wanted. Of course I assumed I had lost my bargaining position by being so picky but this wasn't the case. Robert gave me a great price and I ended up with the truck I wanted at a better price than I could get in El Paso ... and the truck was delivered to my driveway.

152,"February 21, 2015","I must say, after being involved in a horrific auto accident (not my fault) which left my car in no other condition but total loss, I knew I would be getting a new vehicle, but just could not get excited about going out shopping to find what I wanted to buy.  And the reason for that is because it is a complete nightmare to just go look at vehicles on a car lot without being swarmed by Salesmen 3 seconds after getting out of the car you see something you may be interested in.  It is such a frustrating task, this game. I understand the Salesmen are there to make a living as well as sell vehicles for their dealership, but I think that is an area of the business that really needs to find some other means of pursuing. However, I was very lucky with my visit to AACJD,M! I had a 2008 Honda Accord, but after my accident, I no longer wanted a Sedan, but rather an SUV/CUV. I had a very cool, laid-back Salesman (Jamie Nguyen) approach me in a way that most amped up salesmen do expressing only one emotion. And that emotion is: ""Oh gosh, I've got to sale this guy. I'll just hound the dog out of him so he cant refuse!"" That is so sad but true with many car salesmen, but not Jamie! It was Jamie's patience, not obnoxious persistence that earned him a sale from me. I had no idea what kind of vehicle I wanted. My Honda Accord was paid for, so buying a new car was the last thing on my mind, and Jamie's courtesy to not pressure me on any one particular vehicle made for a very nice experience. I had a final divorce court hearing on February 17th, I was still pretty banged up from my accident, and I did not have much time to get into a vehicle, because the auto insurance did not determine my car a total loss until 1 month after the accident and I only had a few more days of having a rental car.  Pretty darn stressful times!  I totally believe Jamie had the true ability to sense all of the stress I was under and he really helped me decide on a vehicle that was right for me, and I absolutely love it.  Another fantastic piece to this purchase is that the Midland Dealership did not have the vehicle the way I would want it, so Jamie ask me to come inside and meet one of his Managers, so we could let him know exactly what I was looking for on my Jeep. Well, when I walked in to meet the Manager, I almost fell over with joy. There stood one of my dear friends that I went both to high school and college with, but have not seen him in probably 15-20 years. That Great Man would be the one and only Mr. Scot Mowles! You want to talk about Divine Guidance, that is what this story is all about! The good Lord protected me from what I thought was going to be certain death from the car accident, and then only visiting AACJD, Midland and getting a undeniably Professional of a Salesman to work with, and being reunited with a very Dear Friend, who by the way found the exact Jeep I wanted before the end of that day. And for your Finance Manager, Dee Montgomery, what a easy going guy to do business with! His honesty is something you guys should be proud of in having him as part of your team! When we crunched the numbers, and thought everything was taken care of and all papers signed, he called me the next day to tell me my payments were dropping yet even more. He called and felt so bad because he simply forgot to add my rebates in when dong the last of the paper work. I told him not to feel bad, feel good about yourself for realizing a harmless mistake, and be proud that you were honest! Basically, I am more than pleased with my entire experience, you guys are Awesome!",5.0

I did not take my vehicle home the same day it was purchased due to some details that needed to be fixed on the vehicle. She lied about when my car would be ready for pickup. They gave me the run around and wouldn't call back. I had to call every day for 2 weeks until I received my vehicle. From the girl up front answering the phones to the so called sales managers, they are not adequate or near qualified to be there. They have no customer service skills and all they are worried about is making the sale. They're priority is not the customer like it states on here or on their website. Sadly I had already purchased the vehicle but wish I hadn't. My car is nice and its what I wanted, but regret having used them as the dealership...

The parts department apparently does not communicate with the service department, so as a result, the service department does not communicate with customers when there is a delay or issue getting a part.  So unless a customer calls and chooses to sit on hold for 30 minutes waiting for someone in service to answer the phone, you never know whether or not your vehicle is actually going to be ready when promised.  I've actually called, spoken with a very nice person named Pat, which assured me that someone would return my call within a few minutes.  2 1/2 hours later, my call still hadn't been returned.  So, I have to go through the whole 30 minute waiting game again.  It's ridiculous.  Service blames it on parts, and parts blames it on computers on warehouses in Dallas.

Their mechanics would come to us and say, ""You drive it and see if you can tell us what is wrong with it"" because they couldn't figure it out.  
Every time we went into the dealership to check on how things were progressing, we were a huge ""problem"" and in their way.  Once they told us that they would not fix the truck we purchased, they told us we would have to pick out a different truck, but they didn't have any in stock or would not find us anything else.  We had to do all the leg work to keep checking back to see if anything was available.  We even drove to their other dealer locations to see if we could find something that would meet our needs.  
After they finally received something in that met our needs, they would not make it right and work with us on the price.  We told them that we had a budget and they didn't care.  
They are the laziest bunch of people I have ever worked with.  The day we went in to pick up the truck that we finally had agreed upon, they told us that it would be ready by 1 and at 2:30 I was still pressing them to get our truck finished and ready to go.
I could go on and on about the bad experience we have had at this dealership......don't buy here!

200,"August 13, 2012","Purchased Town & Country Van.  New Saleswoman worked w/ me, assisted by her manager.  They were very good.  Answered all questions I asked, and I never felt pressured as I have at some previous dealerships I worked with.",4.8
201,"April 21, 2012","Chrysler town & country van having electrical problems
Took the dealership 2 weeks to get things done ‚Äì cost me over $1,000
On the way home the van started having the same problems it had before I took it to them
Drove straight back towards the service department but did not make it there ‚Äì Van died on the street
Had a friend help me tow the van that last 100 yards ‚Äì only to be told that this was a ‚Äònew‚Äô problem & would be another $1,000+ to repair
Contacted the General Manager ‚Äì Bob Billips ‚Äì only to be told tough luck
Took the van to 2 other service facilities in town to find out what was really wrong
Both said about $200 in parts ‚Äì I then called the General manager again asking for a compromise of me buying the parts & them doing the labor at no charge ‚Äì no deal
They have lost me as a customer forever & I tell anyone I can about my bad experience
I have bought 2 new cars since (1 for me & 1 for my wife) but I will NOT set foot on that lot ever again ‚Äì not even to look at a Chrysler
Not only have they lost me as a future customer ‚Äì but Chrysler has lost me at ANY dealership

202,"September 19, 2011","It has been over a week since I have dropped off my vehicle and I have yet to hear any feedback on it. I have called the company at least twenty times and have left several messages. I am concerned and considering moving my vehicle to a different mechanic shop, because the employees keep telling me that they will call me back and never do. One of the employees said he would have my car looked at by Wednesday originally and than he said Friday and now he is saying sometime next week. There customer service is awful and I regret bringing my vehicle here. ",1.0
203,"January 04, 2010","Absolutely the worst service department.I had extended service repairs done before the extended warranty was up. Transmission replaced,fuel system replaced,cooling system replaced. All freeze plugs replaced except the difficult ones. Heater still blows hot only on one side. The mechanics and service people will not work any harder than they have to for warranty work.All of this work was done at once and half of the repairs are failing. DO NOT GO TO ALL AMERICAN DODGE IN MIDLAND TX.  ",1.0
204,"June 05, 2004","The most dishonest car dealer I have ever dealt with! They will low ball you on your trade and absolutely try and nail you to the wall. I walked away from this dealership feeling I needed a shower. Run to Big Spring or try Odessa, these people are awful!",1.0
