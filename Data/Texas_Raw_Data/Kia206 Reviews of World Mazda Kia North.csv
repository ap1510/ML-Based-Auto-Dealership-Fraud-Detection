1,"July 03, 2017","I was bullied by Mike Smith to purchase an extended warranty at 2900. For my 3 or the deal wouldn't go through..
..I was also bamboozled into 18 percent interest. In Feb 16 Gillman Honda got me 8 percent and no high pressure bull. ",3.0
2,"January 18, 2017","From my first interaction, the customer service representatives have been so personable and helpful. Complications with my bank forced me to arrange all my loan and purchase paperwork over the phone and the managers led me through every step. I was able to test drive, review all warranty and benefits I was covered for, sign for the car, and drive away within 2 hours. I had requested the maintenance/service history of the car and it was promptly delivered to me the next day without any questions. Unfortunately through the next few weeks, I had my engine light come on and every person made sure that I was well taken care of. They gave me a loaner car to, ensured I was well informed about what they were working on, and happily reminded me that everything was under warranty and paid for. They take care of their customers to the best of their ability and it will always be appreciated.  ",5.0
3,"October 29, 2016","My experience with Legend Kia was the BEST. Maria Garza was great, so patient ! I have been in sales for 25 years so I know when someone is a good salesperson and Legend Kia is lucky to have her. Victor in finance was also wonderful and very helpful.
    It is great being apart of the Legend Kia family..

4,"September 21, 2016","i would like to thank Jeffrey and Legend Mazda for the best car buying experience I've ever had! From the moment we got there, Jeffrey was friendly and extremely helpful in answering all our questions about the Mazdas (we had never owned one before). I now own a new Mazda 6 and couldn't be any happier! Thank you Jeffrey, for all your help and Mike for giving us the best deal! I will be sending anyone I know in search of a new car your way!!!!

6,"August 26, 2016",This is my second time using this dealership. Everyone is very friendly and the waiting area was fantastic. My sales person was very helpful and great about following up with me while I was attempting to get a loan through my bank. I ended up using Kia Motors Finance. The interest rate was great and the bonus services along with my purchase made me extremely satisfied. ,5.0
7,"August 25, 2016","These guys are awesome.  I had a slight rip in my backseat, probably caused by an exacto knife when they took the plastic off, which we didn't notice until the week after we bought our new Sportage.  I reached out to Terry Roberts, our outstanding salesman, who promptly made arrangements to help us out.  

Along the way, I reached out to the GM, Mike Trevigno, to bring to his attention the care, respect, and patience his sales and financing staff showed us as we negotiated until close to 11:00 the night before.  I mentioned to him that we'd had the hiccup with the seat and he insisted that we have a loaner brought to our home which we stayed driving during the ordering and installation of the replacement seat cover.  Mike made sure we were very satisfied customers and Terry drove the vehicles both ways each time.  

My wife and I would like to sincerely thank the Legend KIA team for their outstanding service and for going well above the call of duty to ensure customer service expectations were exceeded.  It's nice to know that service still matters to some companies!

9,"August 04, 2016","I walked in the dealership not getting my hopes up, as I was a fist time new car buyer. That totally changed when Jeffrey Barajas, my Sales Consultant went above and beyond to get me the right price and right vehicle that I needed. He was the most helpful and understanding sales person I've met. I would recommend this dealership and sales consultant to all my friends and family. Thanks Jeffery and Legend Mazda, you guys are the best! Sincerely a really happy and satisfied customer. ",5.0
10,"August 03, 2016",I met with noel morales the sales person like 2 weeks ago. She was a very kind young lady. She was very knowledgeable as far as explaining to me about all the benefits kia legend offers you when you are about to purchase a new vehicle. She was a great person. My blessings to her.,5.0
11,"August 02, 2016",My experience with Gracie and Legend Kia was the best experience I have ever had in buying a car. They were very honest and everyone seemed to be very warm and caring. The entire team was very forthcoming in answering my questions. Everyone bent over backwards for us and made this whole experience painless. When time to purchase again I will come back to Legend. I am telling all my family and friends that they need to go to Legend.,5.0
12,"August 01, 2016","Our initial visit to the store was to see a used car that I had seen on the internet. As the car was already sold, she showed me a new vehicle and I test drove it. My immediate response was that I was so happy with it and I asked where I needed to sign? She worked with me until the end. I personally, feel like I gained a new friend. Her friendly demeanor and knowledge of the cars on the lot, showed me that I would welcome doing business with her anytime. I will recommend her to any of my friends or co-workers.",4.6
13,"July 24, 2016","My son just graduated from high school, starting a new job and going to college.  We were seeking a ""starter"" car.  We never anticipated the wonderful outcome.  Gracie helped us on a Saturday and she was so kind and helpful that we returned the next Saturday to find the perfect car.  Gracie was busy when we returned so Terry helped us out in the meantime.  He was great.  When Gracie returned she helped us with a sporty Kia Rio, one owner, super low mileage and still with 2 years warranty.  To top it off, the price is exactly what we were looking for.  Gracie has been no stranger after the transaction as my experience with other car dealers.  They just do not care about you after they get their money...unless you want to buy another car!  Gracie has been in contact me to ensure everything is fine and most of all, to make sure we are happy.  We couldn't be more satisfied.  Love this place and Love Gracie!!  Roberta Cruz",5.0
14,"July 23, 2016","I am giving a second review because I went back to get a window tint and wanted to do it through Kia.
I walked into the dealership and the employees greeted me like family, who does that? From the front desk to my salesperson Graciela, even though she was with a customer, she took the time to come and say hello. I have been through several dealerships and have never encountered one that treats customers (I had already purchased, no need to show interest) as if they are coming in for the first time.  My Sportage came out looking so nice and not only did the young man Giovanni, who I had made arrangements for the tint walk me out to check out the vehicle, but one of the managers, Marcos, came out as well.  My son wound up talking to Giovanni about a part that is aftermarket that goes in the back to cover luggage and other things you may want to keep covered.  He ordered it.  Overall, I really like my Kia, the employees at Kia and the service department. Had been thinking of a Honda and now wouldn't trade for a Honda.  Great driving car, sporty, economical and just great.  Thanks Kia and superior employees.  They go the extra mile when you don't expect it.  Esther Herrera",5.0
15,"July 22, 2016","I went to the dealership intending to purchase a new car. Gracie was very eager to help me, my only stipulation being ""not a Soul"". After test driving 2 or 3 and really listening to my feedback Gracie convinced me to try a Soul...I loved it. I am so glad I met Gracie. She knew her product she understood my needs and she facilitated a perfect match. I couldn""t be happier with my choice and the experience at Legend Kia.   Sincerely,  Tammi Coomes ",5.0
16,"July 18, 2016","Came in just to look and after browsing  a few used cars, Gracie moved my attention to new vehicles and I wound up buying a new one.  No pressure sales, easy to talk to managers.  Happy people and very professional. 
Loved them all, specifically remember Marco, Gracie and Giovanni.  
Was actually shopping for a Honda and went to Kia just to look around. Just looked at list below and I was under the impression that Marco was the name of a manager not sales. If he isn't a manager,  he should be  because he has all the makings of a very good manager. 
Thanks for your employees. ",5.0
17,"July 18, 2016","I feel like everyone I worked with, especially Noel, made every effort for me to leave with a car. They are the best dealership I have ever worked with. Noel wanted me to be happy and stayed with me until the very end making sure every question I had was answered. I could not ask for more in a dealership and a sales person. I felt like I was a VIP customer and yet it was my very first time I walked in there.This is the first car I have ever qualified for.",5.0
18,"July 13, 2016","We had some unfortunate misunderstandings, for lack of a better term, and our buying experience was less than enjoyable.  After about a month of discussions between us and the manager, Michael Trivigno, things have been taken care of, we're happy with the dealership and know they went out of their way to make things better.  We loved our sales representative, Graciela Cantu, and recommend her very highly.  ",4.2

21,"July 02, 2016",Although we decided not to puechase a new car we were extremely pleased with the service we received.  Graciela Cantu was friendly amd knowledgeable.  By the end of the night i felt like we had known each other for more than just a few hours.  When we do decide to.make a new purchase we will definitely return to see Graciela.  Thank  you Gracie for ALL your help and time! ,4.8
22,"July 01, 2016","Graciela Cantu was great to work with!  Very professional, knew her product well, and was very patient.  She showed us several Optima's and discussed each one; what a great person to work with!  While we decided not to purchase at this time, we will definitely return to Legend Kia and ask for Graciela by name when we are ready later this year -- hoping they have some awesome year end sales at that time.

23,"July 01, 2016","From the moment I walked into the dealership until I drove off with a new car everything went smoothly and professionally. The people were all friendly, especially my sales rep Graciela Cantu and my finance manager Nancy Hinojosa, and they were knowledgeable as well. Graciela stayed with me to make sure everything went well, even after the completion of the paperwork and the delivery of the car. She showed me where to check in for service and introduced me to the service department personnel. Nancy presented me with warranty options (almost all of which I took) and generally made me feel welcome. It was the best car buying experience I've ever had.",5.0

27,"June 16, 2016",I was texting a sales man at legend Kia and recived a price in writing . When I got to dealership to buy car the manager said he could not sell car for that price. So I drove an hour and a half for nothing. I was paying cash for car and the difference was $1800. But if you give a price in writing to a customer that should be your word.. Not the case at legend Kia. I've bought a lot of cars and this by far is my worst experience . Just know the price they give you in writing is not what they say.,1.0
28,"June 13, 2016","This is the second time the I have purchased a vehicle from Legend Mazda. Both times they gave me outstanding trade-in value, and worked to get me into the car that I wanted.

35,"May 21, 2016",We were in search of a new vehicle and our credit wasn't perfect. I was super apprehensive about calling. I called and spoke with amber and right off the bat she was awesome. She was knowledgeable and friendly. We weren't able to make our appointment we set up. But she text me a few days later. We started the process through texts and emails. Made it super simple and less hassle than sitting at a dealership for 5 hrs. By the end of that day we drove out with a 2016 forte with 10 miles on it! We are very happy! We left with an awesome car and a great experience. Amber made that possible! ,5.0

42,"May 03, 2016","First impressions are very important and a day before we visited the dealership my boyfriend spoke to someone and said that they were really great and provided him with good information regarding the vehicle. He was convinced that this would be the place we would purchase my car from. As soon as we arrived we were greeted by the receptionist and were approached by Amber. She was really great to work with. She was super sweet and didn't make me feel pressured to actually buy the car I was looking at. THAT is what sealed the deal. She and Michael Trivigno answered each one of our questions thoroughly. I've been to many other dealerships around town and always feel like I am being attacked by vultures as soon as I step out of my car. The car buying process is usually a very stressful one and not once did l feel uncomfortable or anxious to leave the dealership the entire time we were there. Overall, this was an easy and great experience. ",5.0
43,"May 01, 2016","We just purchased a Mazda 3 from this dealer and were very pleased with the entire process, from beginning to end.  Our sales consultant, Keith Wells, gave us exceptional service.  We were not the easiest of customers either.  We went to the dealership a week before and asked him all kinds of questions.  Though he knew we were not ready to buy the vehicle then, he patiently educated us on the various options.  His great service that day compelled us to buy from Mazda Legend.  After we saw him, we visited 4 other Mazda dealers in the area.  Through that week, we kept in contact with Keith asking additional questions.  When we were ready to buy, we could not think of buying our car from anyone else but Keith.  He researched and did not stop looking until he found the vehicle that had all our requirements.  Once we had the vehicle, and the process transferred to the manager, Keith stayed with us every step of the way until we drove the vehicle out of the lot.  Management was polite, flexible and helpful.  Keith took us to Victor, from Finance, who was quick and efficient.  I would recommend this dealer without reservations. ",5.0

She instead went online to find the one she wanted. She found 3 or 4 and the one with the best price was this particular place.  She called and made an appointment for us to go see it, a couple of hours later she was driving home in her dream car at over $2k less than the other dealerships.",5.0

50,"April 22, 2016","Thomas Gregory greeted us as soon as we arrived at the dealership. He then proceeded to act in such a professional and courteous manner that impressed us from the get go. He wasn't pushy, yet was efficient while being cordial to an extreme. We had suffered quite a bit of damage due to hail storms and were only looking at vehicles. That did not deter Thomas who actually tried to ease our concerns, insofar that we ended up purchasing a vehicle. Throughout the qualification, contract, insurance and purchase he maintained a positive attitude and his outlook was always reassuring. All in all, thanks to this young man, what was going to be (to us) a bad experience as well as a bad day, turned out to be a positive one. I don't have enough words to praise this salesperson and would encourage his supervisors to hire this caliber of individual. One foot note, his manager, Danny Armstrong also came and reassured us about the process.  He also kept us at ease throughout the entire process, as he noticed the level of excitement (not so good)  that we had brought in with us.

The staff there are very kind and do not push you into buying anything that you don't really want. I never felt rushed or pressured to do anything while shopping there. The prices on both of the cars that I purchased were very fare and they even lowered them to match my budget. The last car that I bought from them was a used 2013 Kia Optima and a sales associate named Jessica was the one who helped me the entire time. She always stuck with me and continued to make me feel welcome at every stage of the purchase. She was the first one to shake my hand when I arrived and the last one to see me off after purchasing the car. I wish every car dealership ran their business the that this one does. I know that as long as I live in San Antonio I will continue to use this dealership for all of my car buying needs. They have more than earned my trust and business. ,5.0

67,"April 06, 2016",I went to Mazda expecting to be turned down because I had not paid the loan off for my totaled vehicle but figured I would give it a shot. I walked out with a brand new car and model that same day. I truly appreciate that the sales person Jeffrey Barajas helped me and accommodated my needs to the fullest. It's not easy having to wait on insurance brokers to finish unsettled business while life goes on and I need a car. Jeffrey got me in and out as soon as he could and was very courteous and professional. My mother was with me as well and they talked about anything and everything while we waited. It is great not feeling like we are being pressured to buy and put money down immediately. So thanks legend Mazda! And thank you Jeffrey! ,5.0
68,"April 06, 2016","The horror stories of car salesmen lying and trying to pull one over on you is true here. They will lie about features and what's included. When you call to ask, they will be rude and say it's already done. I would never want someone screwed over like me. Please avoid this place or come extremely prepared!!! 
Advice: they offer higher percentage rates than the finance really offers so always ask for lower because they're trying to pull one on you. Get everything in writing, even small things. Do not sign a thing until you get what you asked for fixed. Get a proper document describing your warranty, because they will tell you there is one, ""it's automatic, it's attached to the car"" blah blah but you will get screwed and no one there cares! 
So believe that this place will lie to you and take advantage of people. 
I'm screwed for the next 60mos all because I didn't think a dealership would screw me so bad. 
Please think twice. 
Avoid Nancy at all costs, she was a major part in the lies and trying to cover it up.

71,"March 31, 2016","A warning began flashing on my in-dash screen and my battery light suddenly was on as I was driving down the highway in rainy weather. I happened to be close to the dealership from which I bought my car, but stopping there was a huge mistake and waste of time. I had to walk around until I found a human, then I was told I could leave my car there if I wanted, but it could be a week before anyone could look at it. They made every effort not to help me. I called Legend Kia from the other dealer's parking lot, and Crystal Salazar answered the phone. She responded with empathy, urgency, and care. When I arrived, I was greeted warmly at the curb by a young woman who checked me in and recorded stats from the car and the issue. She escorted me inside and connected me with Crystal, who explained everything thoroughly, and got my car back to the technicians within minutes. She also arranged for a driver to take me to pick up my husband's truck from his office so he wouldn't have to leave work. Justin was the driver, and I couldn't ask for another kinder or friendlier individual. It took a few minutes until Justin returned from his last ride, and while I waited inside several other employees from both front and back of house said hello and shared short exchanges making the wait pleasant and warm. One would think it was a slow morning, but there were many customers. I learned later they were even short handed in the service area that day. Even so, they replaced my alternator and AC hose within 6 hours. I probably would have still been waiting for a taxi to pick me up had I stayed at the first dealership. I will not take my car anywhere else! ",5.0

After being turned down 2 places prior Keith helped me find the car I like and he even went around the car showing me details and controls that I didn't even notice. He was very hands on and I can't thank him enough!!

I ended with a great deal due to Ismael Ramirez and gave me that new car experience i never had had before. He helped me get a second reliable vehicle that i could count on. He was very understanding in my current situation and i believe went beyond that of a business transaction....which was needed at the time. He is very knowledgable for his age and basically reminded me of myself when i was younger. He is a valuable asset the company and should raise the standard for anyone in his position. At his age he has nowhere to go but up. I just hope Legend Mazda Kia aknowledges the talent and possible future job opportunities i believe he is beyond qualified for that would benefit the company as a whole.

I was actually about to leave when Pablo came up to me and drove me to the correct building. He was really nice and made me feel comfortable and encouraged me to go inside. After this point I was sort of shuffled around a little bit with everyone trying to figure out what kind of car to have me test drive. I was frustrated by this because I called on a specific car that I wanted to see. After this little bit of confusion the rest of the day went amazingly well. I ended up buying a car that day!

She worked very diligently with all my requests during the purchasing process.  She made me feel very comfortable and was able to hold a conversation to help pass the time while waiting. She also introduced me to other employees who would be working with me in the future when my vehicle would need servicing.  I thought that was particularly helpful as it's nice to know a face to look for when returning.

Since that time, Amber has checked in on my and my vehicle and possible needs roughly every 30 days.  It has really given me a since of comfort.  At my last servicing, she saw me sitting in the waiting area for my oil change and came up to me and we had a nice chat.  I feel like I'm not just someone she sold a car to, but rather more like an important person.  

She made quite an impression on me. I can see why you hired her and if all your employees are half as conscientious as she is, you have quite a team and I will continue to do business with Legend Kia and more importantly, Amber, for a long time despite the proximity of other dealerships.  I have and will continue to highly recommend Legend Kia to family and friends.",5.0

161,"January 20, 2016","I purchased my Optima in August from Kia and worked with Kelsey, she was great helping me find the perfect car for me. At first, I felt like the back and forth was time consuming and frustrating. It was only frustrating because I didn't understand their process which now I really appreciate. The sales staff (and other staff) try to spend quality time with their customers to build a foundation and establish a relationship with you. They are truly there to add you to their family and make every attempt to create this relationship. I worked with Victor during financing and as I stated above he went above and beyond. Dealing with the staff is a great experience, so if you find yourself a little frustrated keep in mind they are not just trying to sell a car but more establish a foundation. 

I have had my car in for service and had a little snag. I know usually you only hear either all good or all bad. Well as humans mistakes will always be made but the difference is that the customer service is OUTSTANDING. They will make any bad situation better, so talk to them and allow them the opportunity, you will be happy with the outcome. 

So now my most recent visit. The beginning started off a little rocky with a personality conflict, but this was not an issue...I found George at the Mazda building. George helped my son and I find the perfect car. We purchased a used (none Kia/Mazda) and received the same level of care as if we purchased the most expensive car on the lot. George was amazing, he was open, upfront, honest and tentative. Again, he talked to us. Not because he wanted to sell a car but it was all about establishing that relationship. Mike, the new General Manager, promptly greeted us and we began the process of buying the car. As we were waiting our turn, I spotted Victor, who remember me and we chatted a bit catching up on things as if we had been friends for years, which reinforces that relationship building.  For this car we worked with Nancy in Finance, who was just as friendly and welcoming as Victor was in August. To be honest, we encountered some issues. Not big issues, but none the less frustrating. But as before not an issue, any problem that we encountered was addressed immediately and resolved. Everyone there went over and above what I have found at other dealerships. Customer service and relationships are what they stand for there. I could go on and on but I'll leave you one last thought.  

Next time I buy a car it will be here, and if George is still working he will be my first pick.   When my car needs servicing, I will take it here, not even a question.

He's the salesman who cares about YOU and not just what your purchase can do for him. That's a hard-to-find kinda guy in that type of business..

I've purchased 4 cars from him already, and I guarantee this much- if he's still in the car business when I'm ready for my next purchase, it doesn't matter what he's selling...Chevy, Kia, Ford, Mazda...I'll be doing business with him again. Mark Apao is by far the best guy to work with!",5.0

181,"June 09, 2014","I recently “purchased” a car at Legend Mazda. When I drove the car off the parking lot…they did not fill up my gas tank, which is the norm when purchasing a new car at a dealership. I went back to the dealership to get my free gas tank, my third attempt at it, and was ambushed by the manager, Collin, at the dealership. For one, he refused to re-fill my gas tank, telling me that I should’ve been there earlier…and to come back tomorrow. Again, this was my third attempt. Secondly, it turns out that the dealership did not properly finish the paper work on the sale. I was told that I needed to sign more paper work, but, with a different monthly payment that was agreed upon. I was told that they could not honor the monthly payment that they told me I would have. During this discussion Collin, the manager, was very rude with me and unprofessional. I felt like he was trying to take advantage of me and the situation. Maybe he thought that I would just give in because I am woman and was there by myself, at least, that is how he made me feel. I was so upset and felt so disrespected…that I told them to keep their car, and walked out.

I emailed the Director of Sales, and the managers, the next day and informed them of my experience the night before: I have yet to hear from anyone on what happened. No apologies, not even an attempt at an explanation of what happened. Needless to say…I am very disappointed with my experience. I was so happy about my new car, I only regret that I dealt with such an unprofessional dealership. I would not recommend anybody to do business with these people. They do not deserve it!

I was wrong. The online MSRP for each of the vehicles is incorrect. The posted price has already been marked down $8000, but there is no indication of this. The online posted price of each of their 2012 Mazda6 vehicles clearly shows MSRP.

This is deceptive advertising and I indicated this to Craig. In the last 18 months, I have purchased 2 cars, paid in full, from Legend in San Antonio. I will never purchase from them again.

my wife indicated she was interested in a car and inquired on line with cars.com.  Jason Castillo (sales manager/director) from Legend Kia emailed her right away and called soon after and was very responsive to our questions.  We went in to the dealership on/by Judsen and 410 in the evening.  As we were headed to the dealership, we get a phone call from a female sales rep from the same dealership (Legend Kia) and we informed her that we already spoke to someone and before my wife could finish that sentence the female sales rep had already hung up on her.  We should of walked away after that.  Second thing is that the used car sales floor is not as clean or kept as any other dealership.  After everything was said and done we purchased the vehicle because of the ""low price"" and instantly regret our decision. The next morning when we were able to see how they never bothered to vacuum or shampoo the interior. We wanted to take it back witin 12 hours of purchasing it (always double check return policy). I understand it was a lower price for a reason but I am telling you now that you can spend your money on another used vehicle at another dealership for the same price and you would have all of those things done and more...just sayin.  There were dents on the outside we asked to get repaired and Jason put it on a ""we owe"" type of paper reflecting they would fix it.  So now when I call to follow up on when this ""dent/body guy"" is coming in.  Allegedly the ""dent guy"" comes in every other week and its been 3 weeks and the ""we owe"" expires after 30 days.  Part of me sort of wants it to expire so I can have more to complain about with this dealership and the sales manager. Jason nor anyone else answers the phone over there when we call.  Even the business card Jason gave us, we call that number and he still doesn't answer nor does he return any phone calls, we leave messages, still nothing.  Do not take your business to these people at all.  The sales people will never make it past unprofessional and the title of the stereotypical car salesman sleez because they are a reflection of their managers.  The managers let them get away with hanging up on customers because the managers themselves lack the character and integrity to even face people knowing they gave them a horrible product.  Fine, I will take the hit for being naive and allowing myself to be fooled with this garbage customer service.  If you don't believe me, walk into a few dealerships before you walk in to this one.  The facility is run down in comparison.  Also, ask about the return policy on used vehicles. Texas law says there are lemon laws for used vehicles under the original warranty only (double check online) but other dealerships throw a 24-48 hr or even a few days return policy but not this one.  As for the vehicle, I will use it for a few months and trade it in and NEVER go back to this place. ",1.0

I made multiple calls, left messages that went unreturned and even left a message for the General Manager that was not returned.  I wrongly assumed the GM would want to know where his dealership was lacking, he apparently does not care.  I still haven't heard back from him.  All I wanted was basic info like what trim level was the vehicle, what options did it have etc.  I called the dealer one day and asked for David.

Don't go there if you expect respect and for them to actually do what they get paid to do. ",1.0
201,"May 11, 2012","Never visit this dealer without first going to your own personal credit union for a pre-approved check!

Then only go to the finance people at the dealer with your lawyer to check all the paper work and fine print.

Never allow them to get your financing with SACU  (almost 2% over other credit unions)
Never allow them to provide gap insurance ($450.00 over the credit union gap ins)

Never expect them to tell you the truth if there is a problem, they will look you right straight in the eye and just say sorry, nothing I can do or outright lie.

Between them and SACU it must be a real profitable and sleezy arrangement.


It is a shame the sales staff has to put up with the aftermath of the financing process",1.8
202,"February 29, 2012",I went in after I had been to other dealerships and had been turned down. I was originally turned down at Legend Mazda / Kia as well. The manager came out and told me he would not go home until he got me into a car. He did! It was very close to the payment I needed and I am very happy with his extra effort!,5.0
203,"July 04, 2011","Wow, what a AWFUL place. Be prepared to suffer. My wife and I went looking for a used vehicle the other day. We test drove a Torrento. The salesman was new there. We never talked about what features the vehicle had. There was an orange stain in the rear back seat floor. When we got back to the sales floor, we crunched numbers. After a few questions, we were on our way to obtaining this vehicle. We were told that we would talk to the finance guy. We did and he explained that we could take the vehicle today and we would here from the dealership in a few days to sign final papers. We were then told they could'nt furnish gas money, because they ran out of gas cards. They advice us to buy our own gas and to save the receipt, which my wife did. A whole week goes by without being contacted from the place. After a few days later, my wife gets contacted, and she goes back after work. They were going to detail the car and give her her gas card, which they didn't. She gets home frustrated with the experience. Later on, I'm around the neighborhood and deside to drop by to see what I can do. Either get her license plates and the gas card. I get neither. I deside to get to the bottom of this runaround. One of the managers asks me what can he do to help. I explain to him the runaround we have been getting. He apologizes, and procedes to help me. I'm told to bring the vehicle to get it detailed and for the gas card the next day. We arrive the next day. After talking to one of the managers, he gets Mr Coco to do these things to appease us. Mr Coco takes our vehicle to get it detailed, then I see him tear off in our vehicle like a at out of hell. He disappears, I guess to put gas in the car. He comes back, then we start talking about our gas card we are owed. That gets his fumes running. We felt like after the purchase of the vehicle, we were kicked to the curb. THATS THE WAY WE WERE TREATED. After it was all discussed, we didn't get our gas card. When we got inside our vehicle, we discovered our interior was not touched. The stain was still present. I hope that our vehicle lasts us a while, because we hope to never see there faces again. We will not EVER RECOMMEND this dealership to anyone!  ",1.4
204,"June 29, 2011","i took my perfecly running car for the timing belt service and when i pick up my car it broke down a mile away, i almost got in an accident and the people in there didnt even try to make me feel better. i asked what was going to happen and they say they would tow my car and see what's wrong with it till monday..... so i asked how was i supposed to get home and to work n they told me there was nothing they could do till monday so  i told them if i was supposed to sleep in dealership for 2 day and the manager told me ""if thats what you wish"" HOW STUPID IS THIS? 

When i bought the car they tell you any time the car breaks down they will come get the car and put you in a rental, there was no small print that if they break yur car on sat you are screw!!!! so i couldnt resolved anything until a man got on the phone and he finally got through another manager to get me a car!!! why is it that a man had to get on the phone to get aything done?? 

oh by the way i still dont have my car back since sat and is tue and wont get it for at least two days!!!!!

more than anything this is not the first time it happend!!!! the last time i took my car for the regular service it broke down two days latter then they try to get my to buy a new battery and when i asked about warranty on the new battery they told me all of them have two years so i told them my car is not even two years that the battery should be under warrenty, when they figured i wasnt going to let them rip me off they told me ""oh yea, we will replace it and you can pick up the car in 30 mints""

i will not be taking my car back to this dealership again because this is the second time my car breaks down and both times after they touch my car! another reason is that their costumer service really sucks!!!!!! 

i was planning to trade my car within a year but i will be taking my bussines somewhere else. ",1.0
205,"March 06, 2011","I purchased a 2010 Forte with 9000 miles from Legend Kia in December.  
Once the sale was made, I was then informed that there was only 1 key fob.   I feel this fact should have been disclosed before the closing.  The parts department says a new one would be about $130.  If I would have known this, I would have paid less for the car or walked away.    Other dealerships I have dealt with would have provided the addition key fob for free or at least had the courtesy to sell me the additional key fob for cost.
At the time, I was told the vehicle was inspected and service was performed.  I made the mistake of thinking your dealership did their best with the vehicle.  Your service manager admitted that they only did the minimum that was required.  They said they changed the oil and inspected the vehicle.  I was not impressed when after we started sensing a smell in the car, I pulled the interior filter and it had not been replaced.  Your service manager said that since it was not “required” and that the retainer clips break easy, they do not check them.  The owner’s manual says it should be checked/replaced based on use.  The engine air filter appeared to be new.  If it needed replacing, one may think that the interior may need replacing.  I purchased a new filter and replaced it without issue.  
I also noticed water marks from the cleaning on the seats; I had to return the car on another day to get the seats recleaned just to have new water marks show up later after the cleaning.  I have given up on your cleaning crew.  
Another thing that shows how inept the car prep team is, when I explored the car’s Bluetooth, I found all the previous owners information still in it. This should have all been reset.
What good was it that I purchased the car from Legend dealership?  I expected professional car prep and top customer service.  This I did not get. Their web site says ""Making a Difference One Customer At A Time"" is our promise. With our VIP Sales and Service philosophy we intend not only to earn your trust, but to ensure that we exceed your expectations. This I did not experience.  I could have received the same care from any other dealer or a private sale.  I expected that when you buy a car from the vehicle dealership that I would get the best possible support possible, not the minimum, but to go beyond the minimum expectation. 
Also, when we were finally notified of the registration being ready for pickup, they failed to advise us that the registration was to be picked up at the Mazda dealership, thus wasting time.
