0,"May 26, 2020","I recently purchased a used F-150 from Blake Fulenwider Ford.  Justin Landreth was very friendly and coordinated the purchase at my pace and in a professional manner.  The entire purchase was coordinated over text and e-mail.  Ultimately, the vehicle was delivered to my house over an hour from the dealership.  I’ve bought many new and used vehicles, but this has been my best vehicle purchase experience to date.    ",5.0
1,"December 16, 2019","I absolutely despise buying new vehicles because of all the bs involved.  This was by far the most pleasant and stress free experience ever.  Everyone involved were honest, hard working professionals who put their customers needs first.  We will definitely be back to buy a truck for our son.  ",5.0
2,"November 21, 2019","I bought a used expedition and had the best buying experience that i've ever had at Blake Fulenwider - Beeville.  I live north of Austin but Aldo Lopez and team were able to get me taken care of dispite some challenges along the way.  No matter your location, give Aldo a call...he will take care of you.  I will be giving Aldo and Blake Fulenwider a call the next time i need a vehicle.   ",5.0

7,"April 26, 2019","Nicole was a really good sales person.  I was impressed at how much she knows about the trucks and vehicles in general.  It took a while to get out of there, but my trade in truck had mechanical issues, and had to iron that out.  I hate buying vehicles, so I have to say that this experience was not as painful as some of the other purchases I have made prior to this one.  I don't think I would have stuck it out and followed through with getting my new truck if it had not been this dealership and Nicole as the sales person.  The people there are really nice and knowledgeable and Nicole just kept trying different scenarios to complete this sale.  I am happy.",5.0

11,"February 24, 2019","The Dealership was fair. The general manager was very appeasing and Proffesional. The sales person I dealt with was told I had 1 week to get into a mew truck but he was not motivated to follow thru with my new truck request. When i called 2vdays later to see if he found a truck he said he had neen busy but would start on it. He found it tgat day but could not get it till the next day.thus it thru my schedule off and I had to request rctra days off to be able to drive the new trucl back with me 500 miles away. I was told they would tranfer the tires, cover and the trim bed handles I had on my trade in truck but All tgey did was change out tge tires and the cover. I called my sales guy several times to get the rest of my stuff from the trade in and he promised to send it to me but never did. Thruout tge process I had to speak to the General manager to get things corrected and he would but I felt like i should not have to be constantly going over his head to get results. Overall it is a good dealership but once you buy the new truck the follow up response on the floor is non existent. And I have not gotten my bed handles or plates yet. Going on my 3rd month this week.",3.8
12,"February 22, 2019",Went into this dealer because my wipers would not stop. Called the dealer told them the problem and also told them I purchased the extended warranty. I asked  if it would be coveres and the sales person stated she did not know because it could be the wiper switch or the motor. I told them both were covered under the extended warranty and the sales person acted stupid. Went in showed them the extended warranty paperwork and she again said she did not know if it was covered. They looked at it and said it was the switch and asked me to leave the vehicle. I said ok and if they would loan me a car because it was part of the warranty agreement. They said they did not have a vehicle to loan and then asked me to pay my deductible so they could order the part.  And I never got the sales persons name. ,2.0

22,"July 31, 2018","Purchased a 250 super duty truck from Blake Fulenwider Ford 700 miles from my house in Texas. Started the deal on a different truck with Sandra, found out it didn’t have all I wanted on it switched to this one I purchased she put me at ease on the truck by sitting in it and taking pictures and described everything in detail. Went to her boss with my reduced offer after the first deal sheet was sent to me via text and email and they accepted the offer. I feel as though I just got the best deal on a vehicle in my life. To top it all they delivered the vehicle to me the very next day with the paperwork at no charge. Trusted me to sing and mail the legal stuff and my down payment back in a pre-addressed ups envelope. Truly a great experience!",5.0

27,"February 09, 2018","Having lived in this area for 20+ years after a few bad experiences we felt that to service or buy our cars we had to leave town to have quality service.  The dealership changed to Blake Fulenwider and a situation arose that we had to use local.  The best change that could be made!!  The service department was fantastic, skilled and very accommodating due to the circumstances.  In the showroom, they have the most respectful and friendly people working.  We will recommend and will be back for all of our service needs.  We have driven Ford products for many many years and this was one of the best experiences by far.  Thank you",5.0

44,"July 20, 2017","My husband and i had already shopped at 5 other dealerships the day before we arrived at Blake Ford. While i liked two vehicles at the other dealerships, i could not bring myself to purchase a vehicle from a bad salesman or dealership. And when i say bad, i mean, just downright sleazy. Sandra was a breath of fresh air after our bad experiences prior. She was attentive, listened to our needs, and went so far as to find me a vehicle that i ""built"". In the end we went with an explorer limited that was perfect for our family. And Sandra made it all any easy process from start to finish. Bravo Blake Ford for keeping a winner on your team!! ",4.8

48,"June 26, 2017",We went to Blake Fulenwider Ford because we were looking for a good used Suburban and Sandra Carson sent us some texts and answered questions we had. She sent us pics and helped us tremendously throughout the process. Sandra went above and beyond what we were getting at other dealerships as far as courteous service and professionalism. I'd recommend talking to Sandra Carson if you ever are looking for a great salesperson and tired of the runaround. And she's also easy on the eyes. LOL.,5.0
49,"June 17, 2017","Great folks at Blake Fulenwilder, have dealt with them for 3 or 4 years at other dealerships, the Beeville location and its staff are no exception.

50,"June 12, 2017","When we first got there we were treated better than family, Sandra helped me find my first truck which happened to be at one of their sister dealerships in Snyder, Tx. I liked it the instance I saw it but I'm not gonna like it ended up being a little ruffer than I expected. I only saw pictures of it but since it was a black truck it was difficult to see the dent on the passenger side of the bed and that the rear tires were balding but they threw in two new tires. Overall I'm happy with the truck and the service I received. ",4.6

53,"May 27, 2017","My salesperson was Sandra Carson, she said she was new to the business but she was great to work with.  I was skeptical and nervous at first because we traded information completely through phone and email. She always kept me updated without being pushy like most salespeople are. After a few days of communicating we set up a time to go by the dealership since we are an hour away.  Once we got there she came out right away and was very friendly and talkative within 2 hours we had completed our trade in process and signed papers for the new vehicle and were on our way home! Everyone in this office was so friendly and welcoming it wasn't like most dealerships where your just another customer here it was like you were family.  I would definitely return to purchase another vehicle in the future.",4.6

58,"May 02, 2017","Our son has been extremely ill for a little over 6 months now. We've been in the hospital weekly, sometimes it feels like we live there. Our car has been acting up since august of last year. It's been hell and we desperately needed a new vehicle to get us and our son from home to the hospital or Dr. appointments. Aldo at Blake Fulenwider Ford in Beeville was and is an extremely caring individual. He worked for a little over a month to find a vehicle that was in our price range with every feature we were interested in. From outside to inside it was exactly what we wanted!

67,"April 01, 2016","Great customer service by Robert and his team. Needed oil & filter change done on my F-53 Ford motorhome. Called all Ford dealers in Corpus Christi and Kingsville area (I was on Padre Island). Most said they cannot do it, have no big lift. Two said big lift is broken or bay is under reconstruction. Called Dave Moore Ford in Beeville. Robert in Service said they do not have a big lift but right away offered to do it on the ground. Got there next day, oil & filter change was done immediately. Thank you Robert for your can-do attitude. No other dealer I called offered to do it on the ground.  ",5.0
