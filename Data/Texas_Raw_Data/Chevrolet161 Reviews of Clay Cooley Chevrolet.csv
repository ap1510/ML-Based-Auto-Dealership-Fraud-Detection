It is my first time buying a car and have no clue how the proccess is, thankfully I got enough information and now I know what to do when I buy my first car. I recommend L.A.

2,"May 30, 2020",LA Warren was very best salesman ever.  I was introduced to GM Kevin Herlehy who along with Mr.  Warren provided me with an exceptional customer service experience and a great deal.  I am very happy with my experience here and encouraging others to utilize this dealership in their auto buying experience. ,5.0
3,"May 13, 2020","I spoke to David in the internet sales department.  I inquired about a car they had that I found on Car Gurus.  I emailed them and then called them.  Everything seemed to be going well in our conversation until we came to dealer fees.  They charge $2,495 as a mandatory add on for a GPS tracker.  Yes, that is two thousand, four hundred,and ninety five dollars.  I told David I had no interest in that package and he said it is mandatory and if I didn't want the GPS tracker installed that they would just raise the sale price of the car by that amount.  Keep in mind this has nothing to do with the bank wanting a tracking device as I was planning to pay cash.  It is sad that the dealership feels the need to false advertise the price to get customer interest.  If you want a certain price for the vehicle then ask for it.  Don't mislead people with the hope that you can convince someone that adding $2,495 for fluff is normal.",1.0
4,"May 06, 2020","Terrible dealership.  Gamesmanship and upselling.  Drove 45 miles after speaking to Don Johnson and was first time told when i got there that dealership would not honor the price advertised on cars.com. Talked down to me and claimed i should have clicked more somewhere else on some page and then it would mention a $2,000 add-on. Never saw it.  Stay Away.  Bait and switch. Never treated so poorly by a dealership.",1.0
5,"January 03, 2020","I got suckered by these people for about a week. It was completely agonizing. So first I communicate with the online chat people. They were very nice and it was easy. The I get a call from the first sell person John C. I tell him I'm very busy and my last car I bought was though Carvana which kind spoiled me (by the way very seamless and straight forward), I said I do wan to come down there and sit in a dealership all day for ya'll to tell me what you can or can't do. If you tell me you go a deal I will come down. He tells me to fill out an app online. After I filled out my app I text him and let him know and he never got back to me, so that alerted me right then so I text back and say don't run my credit. About 20 minutes after that I start getting alert saying that Clay Cooley ran my credit smh. Then a few calls and some text from someone named Will B saying that he was calling from Capital One Bank and that he works out of Clay Cooley he said that he needed a copy of my Drivers license and check stubs to he can process my loan. So I was like ok maybe they go me financed. I asked him for his email so that I can email it to him from work and he gave me a yahoo email. So from that point I didn't send any identifying information. Then Comes John F. lol (another joke) I tell him that I'm tired I don't want to keep doing this it's frustrating, he was like ""no we can get you a deal"" I was up front about my situation from the beginning, I'm upside down on my current car I want to trade it in. I know that I'm going to have to pay more for my note my credit score is a 643 and I have more than one car loan however they have never been late. He said oh no I can get you a deal. We go back  and forth for a while then he said I got you a deal come on in (xxxxxxxxx again) I come down after work. Get there and he bring to his office and says he'll be right back he goes to finance talks to him then goes and deal with his other customers. Then ask me do have I have someone that can co-sign. I just laughed and said if I needed a co-signer then why didn't tell me that before. He said because he just found out. I said you said you had a deal. Then he said he'll be right back again and this big tall guy walks in there mind you I dealt with him before at Nissan he was disrespectful then and I guess they use him for intimidation. He tell me that I need a down payment I said how much then he leave out and I wait another 15 minutes and I called John F and told him that I was leaving. I tell John that he full of it and I'm going to write a review about the way I was treated then he said let me help you. He comes back and says that he found a deal for 2800 and my notes would be 589 I say that I don't have 2800 he said he'll check with the bank again and the bank is Westlake financial. I said that I can't pay that much down it's right after Christmas I have a $1000 then he said $1500, I said I have $1000. He said ok Ill call the bank tomorrow he never called back I had to call him then when I did he said with someone with Credit like yours they wanted $4000 I talked them down to $2800.00 So I said show me the deal in writing and I never heard back from them. So I wouldn't recommend this place to an enemy. They are shysters and liars.",1.0

9,"October 25, 2019","This is hands down THE WORST car buying experience I have ever had. They are shady to upmost! I went in with a pre-approval from Capital one as well as a trade in finance thru Cap 1. I pointed out issues I had with the vehicle BEFORE the purchase and was told that they would be taken care of...Long story short, THEY WERE NOT. I ended up having to call capital one and have them pull the financing in order for this dealer to do WHAT  THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO DO ANYWAY! With the financing pulled, they started talking a different tale. This grimy manager came out stating that he had agreed to doing these things already and he doesn't know how that was miscommunicated. A LIE! I asked the sales person SPECIFICALLY and he told me the dealership was refusing, but he might be able to do it out of his own pocket. On top of all of this, I checked my credit and they ran my credit ELEVEN times. Why would you even need to run my credit once when I come in with a PRE-APPROVAL! I will never buy from this dealership again and if you're smart, you won't either!",1.0

13,"September 21, 2019","Between my wife and I, we've purchased AND PAID OFF 5 cars from this dealership but still there's NO customer appreciation. The salesmen that ""I've dealt with"" are fantastic but management and the finance department SUCKS! Alone I make 60k with a decent credit score plus 3 cars paid in full from this exact dealership. There's no reason why I would/should need a cosigner yet they ask for one. On paper I stand alone and have never needed a cosigner. I feel this comes from a personal and judgmental place. I'm not with the game's being played. They want to do business with males only if accompanied by a female for a cosign. 2 people making 30k will get the same car a male can't get alone while making 60k (the income is the same amount). I will not be going back and will reach out to the BBB because of their OVERT DISCRIMINATION!!!",1.0

I went to the 700 E. Airport Freeway Irving location to purchase a Mercedes Benz G63 priced at 94k. I contacted the location to confirm the vehicle was available as the vehicle was an internet sale. The drive took abt an hour. Upon arrival I met a sales rep who advised me that the car was sold. At that point I asked for a manager as I had bn told otherwise. The African American manager whom I suppose works in finance was very unprofessional. No customer service skills at all. He advised me that the vehicle was with Clay Cooley’s daughter and would be available for sale in the a month or so. No apologies or nothing..

I would do the same thing for my daughter the issue is why bait me to drive that far and you very well know the vehicle is not for sale.

17,"August 03, 2019","My husband found a Trex on autotrader.com for a low price. Before driving the 45 minutes to the dealership my husband called to make sure the car was still available, it was. When we arrived an hour later, the car had ""miraculously"" sold. We were going to walk away but two separate sale associates assured us they would honor the price on another model. After a test drive we started the loan process and the number they brought out was almost $10,000 more than on the website. My husband reminded them that they agreed to honor the autotrader price but they just said we were being unreasonable. It took my husband demanding he keys three time before they returned our property so we could leave. We discovered the next day that we hadn't gotten my husband licence before leaving. They did not call to inform us of the situation and when we called to inquire they offered no help.  ",1.0
18,"August 01, 2019","Traded in my 2013 Chevy Malibu in 9/28/18 for a 2017 Chrystler Pacfica dealt with CJ in Irving, Tx.

They used my trade-in on 11/16/18 racked up $65.21 which I refuse to pay since the vehicle was no longer in my possession. Everyone has been avoiding me which I will have no choice but to file charges of using the vehicle without consent while it was still under my name and going through tolls. The title was not changed until 11/17/18 I have left messages for ALI with documentation of the charges, I have saved texted message that I had communication with Joel Lewis and even went in person several times to have someone address this issue. You guys took the battery that came with the vehicle and put an old battery that was dated from 2013 and had to spend $275 to replace it as well at your service center.

20,"June 22, 2019","It's been over 2 mos since I shook hands with these 2 guys and after washing my hands countless times since, I still can't get the slime out!

Rahim Hussain (Finance Manager) & Ali Thanawala (General Manager)- two peas in a pod and neither can be trusted as far as you can throw them.

The $ 100.00 gift card- yeah I'm sure it got lost in the mail.
The promise to come back and pick up the rear cargo cover- yeah I'm sure there's a priceless excuse for that too!

The 72-month finance that they tried writing up as a 75-month finance- nice try guys!

The ""we know you denied wanting to buy any additional warranty...  but we put it in the contract anyways and if we take it out, your interest rate will go up"" BS... I can't even begin to explain everything that's wrong with that statement.

So in a nutshell- there's countless other Chevrolet dealers in the Metroplex folks... save yourself a lot of headache and aggravation and go purchase your vehicle where good, honest, honorable people work hard every day, to earn and keep your business.  A place that hires people with morals and values that align with Texas and what makes this the greatest State in the Union.

21,"June 11, 2019","I absolutely will give every nitty gritty reason why I'm giving 1 star, if I could have given less, I would have.
On May 1st my husband decided to check into trading in his VW Touareg for a new pickup truck. He have loved his Touareg, but super expensive to maintain, plus he have always been a truck and a Chevy guy, he have had many trucks, but never a new vehicle.
I was in the hospital, 4 surgeries since Christmas, my 5th hospitalization, this time with bone infection and 2 abscesses next to my spine
I'm mentioning this because it has been much harder on him than me. He wanted to surprise me.
The day he picked me up and brought me home from the hospital he was so happy and so exited to show me.
He chose a Chevy Colorado instead of a larger truck. We could afford it and would lower our bills.
He bought some accessories, bug guard, rails, ordered a bed extender, was looking at bed liners etc.
During this time he got his tags and plates.
On May 31st he received a frantic call from Bryan Bellamade, he asked my husband to read him the vin off vehicle, not the paperwork. My husband did. Bryan had panic in his voice and told him that he had the wrong vehicle. They had given him another vehicle than what he purchased on 5.1.19. For one month my husband had driven around in a vehicle that was not registered, not titled, wrong tags. Where was his vehicle?  Bryan said he would get back with him. Nothing Friday or Saturday, Monday was memorial day. My husband had called him and texted him. Nothing. He called Tuesday morning, nothing. He had to go to work, i offered to call Bryan. I called and he answered on first ring. He said he would call as soon as he got to the office, said he was the sales manager. By 1pm i called him back, no answer. I then borrowed my sons phone, Bryan answered right away. 
I introduced my self. He used the same tactic, he would call me in a few hours. I told him my husband needed some answers, what Clay Cooley would do to make it right. Bryan became very defensive  raised his voice  accused me of harrassment. I asked for the name of his manager, he screamed louder, it was no other manager who could deal with this. I told him i was just asking for the name of his manager. He continued to scream at me, that i was threatening him. I was calm, erratic people don't make me change my behavior, I told him I would find out on my own and I would be disconnecting the call. He was extremely abusive, disrespectful and rude.
Called back and got big Joe. He seemed very nice, apologized, laughed the whole thing off and said it happens all the time that customers get incorrect vehicles.
He told me to have my husband call him.
My husband called and it sounded it was easy peasy to fix it, just some paperwork. He was told he could keep the truck he had been driving since 5.1.19.
A couple of days later he got another call from Joe, apparently it wasn't easy peasy, he needed to bring the truck back and get him into the truck he actually bought.
The truck he had been driving was black, the other truck was dark gray. The accessories he bought was for a black truck, not that big of a deal, but added to frustration. They offered to transfer the accessories for him before they delivered the car. More waiting. The truck was brought out, keys handed over.
And you would think that was the end of it. No, that's when the nightmare started.
After my husband got the keys, he stood outside and had a cigarette before heading home, decided to walk around the truck to check it out. When he got around to the driver side he noticed a big dent and a scrap on the rear fender by the back door. Someone in the dealership had crashed his car during the short period they had it to switch over the accessories... and decided not to tell him about it. Monty went in and got Joe and showed him.
Joe promised they would take care of it and would throw in a bed liner.
My husband realized later that he made a huge mistake then when he accepted delivery of the car. He was so overwhelmed at this point and just wanted to get home. When he started driving is when he realized his new truck was filthy and had over 3000 miles on it, it had been used as a loaner.
He came home and showed it to me. Exhausted. 
He brought the vehicle back for repairs next day and since then he has been in a loaner. The vehicle was supposed to have been done last Friday, then Monday or Tuesday (today), today he was told Thursday. I was finally able to speak with a senior advisor at GMC today. The case. Was supposed to have been assigned last Thursday and been completed today, instead she is telling me 2-3 days, no sense of urgency by anyone, mainly hostility or a blaming attitude. 
They seem to care less now when they have their money. 
My husband had such excitement 6 weeks ago about his new truck. That is all gone. The truck he is getting is used (as a loaner) with 3000+ miles and have already been in an accident. 
I would really like to hear Clay Cooley explain this to us, face to face, looking us in the eye. Is this how he has become rich? By being crooked. Ripping his customers off.

28,"March 21, 2019","Called the morning of 3-21-2019 on a 2018 Chevy Silverado I saw on The KBB site the night before. This vehicle had been a loaner and was priced at $29,805. When I called the operator transferred me to Tony. I gave him the stock number and he verified the MSRP but when I told him the cost of the vehicle he stated that a third party vendor does these sites for them and entered the rebates twice and the price was wrong. Funny how a few more dealerships had the same type of vehicles which was loaners going for the same rate. Informed Tony that I was shopping for Silverados and needed his best price. He told me to give him a price and I said no, what is your best price?  He became very aggravated and aggressive towards me and hung up. Yes, he hung up on me. At no time was I rude or unprofessional. 

Later that day I called back again and it was still a cluster. Talked to a guy named Dennis who came across extremely desperate and acted like he had never sold a car. I asked for another pre owned person and this offended him. Finally got ahold of a guy named Jay and he hung up on me twice by accident but called me back both times. In the middle of all this Tony got wind of this and called me. I record the conversation between Tony and I and he stated that he hung up on me that morning and nothing else needed to be said. Seriously?

Finally got ahold of the GM named Ali and explained what happen. Even sent him the recorded conversation between Tony and Myself. That was around 4 today. It’s now 9:30 at night and nothing. I did get ahold of Clay Cooley’s personal secretary and she assured me the Clay, Chase and Ali are working on this. I also filed a complaint with GM corporate and the chamber in Irving Texas. Will follow up with the Atteiney Generals office in the morning. 

Being a loyal GM owner for 25 years and dealing with dealerships for about the same time I have never dealt with such a group of unprofessional people in my life. These guys already have a bad image in the industry but always liked Clays commercials and a personal friend picked up a SUV from them last year and said what a great group of people. 

I truly feel being in a unique situation with excellent credit and putting down a large amount of money hurt me more than it helped in this situation. That the target market for them are people with ok credit so they may finance them with lenders who will give them kick backs in the loan process and make more money at the end of the day. 

I truly hope you turn this situation around fast and coach and train this group at the Chevrolet dealership in Irving so no other’s customers have to experience this again.",1.0

30,"March 12, 2019","Buyer Beware!!

If you buy a used car from this business, which I highly recommend you do not, make sure to have a third party mechanic look it over. Do not listen to their sales staff about how the vehicle has gone through rigorous testing by certified staff. 

I am currently in the middle of purchasing a truck from them which is contingent upon Clay Cooley fixing issues my third party mechanic discovered, which their ""Top Notch"" mechanics had missed; as well as, repainting the truck. In fact, the truck wouldn't even pass inspection.

During this time of waiting for the repairs to take place, no one could give me any answers as to the status of the truck. Getting anyone to call you back is the most difficult process for this company. After leaving multiple messages with the sales staff, finance, and managers, I received a response one week after dropping the truck off. Now to mention again, the loan was not to go through to the bank until after the truck was fixed and I inspected it. 

They finance department had decided it was ok to send the loan through anyway. So this process is still an ongoing mess right now. The person in finance I am working with, Rahim, had me come in and resign some paperwork to extend the start date of the loan because the repairs were taking longer. 

In my haste, ignorance and misguided trust in the company, it was not until later when I received the loan note from the bank, that I noticed the price of the vehicle was increased by over 3k. Rahim assured me that the paperwork I had signed was just an extension for the date and not once did he tell me about the increase in price from the original loan. What they did was lower my interest rate and raise the loan amount so the monthly payments looked the same.

 Not a tactic I would expect in a company like Clay Cooley. I've tried to reach out to talk to Rahim and figure out why he tricked me into signing this deal, and while yes I should have read the many pages in detail, Rahim assured me it was the same deal, just a date push out. Also to reiterate, the loan was not supposed to be processed until I inspected the truck. 

I will update more details on how my loan was changed to an amount which was not after upon soon.",1.0
31,"February 28, 2019","Unorganized mess of a service department.  Careless and sloppy service. What they are doing is wrong, and unsafe to customers.  Clay Cooley Chevrolet will return vehicle to owner with more problems than originally taken the car in for.  There is clearly no communication within the department, no one knows what is going on. Employees fight with each other and talk bad about customers in front of other customers.  With all the time I spent there, I heard several people call to complain, only to have the service department deny everything and talk bad about the customer after they hung up the call. You will call and they will tell you to come in, then arrive and they wont have anything prepared, as if you never even called.  Extremely unprofessional. Unqualified or lazy technicians.  Absolute nightmare. Here is the VERY CONDENSED version of my experience:

-1st time I took my 2017 traverse with under 60,000 it it got returned to me saying that they fixed all transmission issues, and charged me $600. The vehicle had no additional miles put on it, and very obviously still had the problems originally complained about. Indicating that they did not even drive my car. I took the car back in.  
-The second trip back (after they claimed to have fixed my transmission and charged me $600) they found that the car had a whole mess of issues with the Transmission.  It had to have a fluid and debris removed from the transmission.  Making it very obvious that they did not even touch the car the first time.  They had my car for an entire month to fix this issue.  They then returned the car to me once more.  I drove the car off the lot and immediately heard noises coming from the car and experienced an extremely shaking ride.  
-I took the car back a 3rd time, to address the NEW issues on my car, only to have them tell me nothing was wrong.  When I picked up the car they did not have paperwork written up, and did not appear to have even looked at my car.  I took the car back just to run from these people who clearly had no idea what they were doing.  
-I then filed a complaint with Chevrolet Corporate, where I received minimal assistance.  My car is driving worse than ever, and is very scary to drive.  Eventually, it breaks down.
-Fast forward 2 months, and my car is not drivable, with $2,000 worth of damage.  Keep in mind this is a new bought car, with under 60,000 miles, that they told me was completely fine, even after I explained all of the new issues that had arose after taking it in originally. 


Clay Cooley Chevrolet is running a very sketchy business.  I regret ever taking my car to them, as it has been a horrific experience that has cost me so much money, time, and annoyance.  I am now left with a undrivable car, more damages than I could ever imagine on a new car with under 60,000 miles, paying for a rental car until I can figure things out, and too much money invested in this car.

32,"February 18, 2019","I saw listings in CarGuru, Autotrader, etc for Clay Cooley Chrevrolet in Irving,  for 2019 Camaro base models (there were about five at the same price) for $18.529.  This was late on a a Saturday, too late for me to actually drive over.  So I did the dealership chat, and confirmed the price was valid.  Took a picture of the listing on CarGuru for one of the cars for good measure.  This is obviously an outrageously good price for a new Camaro.  So, I called the dealership first thing Monday.  Spoke to Eli.  He said they had the specific car in stock that I had the picture of, but said $24K was the best they could do.  So, I advised of my screenshot and the chat I'd had with a rep confirming the original price.   After some discussion, they agreed to honor the price, and said they would call back with the final pricing (TT&L, doc fee, etc.) in ten minutes.  Waited, waited....after nearly an hour I texted and called.  When I got in touch with Eli, he said that in order to honor the original list price, I had to currently own or lease a Ford Mustang.   Hmmmm....not mentioned in the original listing, or in the previous conversation.    I understand that the original listing price was really too good to be true, but they did list it.  Also, feel like if they say over the phone they will honor the price they should do that, or tell you at the time there are strings attached.

-Investigate Alignment , Balance and Wheels for Warping or damage to cause it to vibrate when going down the road at highway speeds. I informed the guy who took my car that I recently purchased new tires and the shop installing them mentioned that my Wheels are bent causing a balance issue.

Long story short, I dropped it off Saturday the 5th of Jan 2019 at 3:30ish thinking I could get a quick inspection (wishful thinking I know) on the alignment/balance. They told me the only way they can check for that is for them to put it on the machine they use for alignments. Ok, so I purchased that service as it had been a few Ks since it had an alignment. Fast forward to Tuesday and no response/communication from my advisor despite asking for status via their text app. I finally get ahold of someone who tells me it's ready ""Everything is fine come pick it up"". I swing by and my Advisor is overly nervous and can't seem to answer any of my questions about what they found and states that he cannot tell me anything other than what the tech found, which he can't even quote what the work order stated. I had to read it and then he gets argumentative and dosennt want to find the tech to answer questions. 

15 min later of finger pointing, explaining that what I wanted got lost in translation because the job traded hands 3 times in their service department and still no one had an explanation about why the balance weights were double stacked or why my Vette was cleared after one of the Caster's shows it is out of spec. Despite having the adjuster ""Bottomed out"" and the  Service shop mentioning that they found ""impact"" to one of the wheels, I finally had enough and got the Service manager involved who did confirm that the alignment shows the car is out of spec and can't explain why my concern was not addressed.

Needless to say their Service Dept is a Joke and had it not been for the Manager offering all the services free of charge I would have disputed the transactions and filed a BBB case. Clay Cooley can't be trusted and they keep very inexperienced and poorly trained staff on board that simply do not work as a team.

 I suspect intentionally as they are stewards of the Business and not customers. They're there to hide defects/issues and prevent lawsuits while taking in as much $$$ and doing as little as possible. @ Clay Cooley ...don't you dare respond with one of these ""Sincerely BS responses with please get in touch with XYZ"" This place is a Circus and one of the poorest excuses for Dealership/Service dept I have seen since Autonation's Chevy shop near where I live in Hurst, TX. I can tell you how much they cared because I had to threaten to sue GM before getting a ""We're Sorry"". Last time I ever do anything with a Dealership outside of DTP or Lemon law. Waste of time.

Simply put, I turned the heater on for the passenger side only to find out it doesn't work. Due to the extreme heat when I first purchased it, I didn't check it but was informed by the service department that they had performed a 120-point inspection, which could not have been [successfully] completed since checking the heater overall is part of it. Because I didn't purchase their warranty, they refuse to fix the problem, even with the Service Director being notified. Now I am left with having to write a bad review and most likely having to get BBB & CA involved due to their falsified inspection when I first purchased the vehicle.

35,"October 27, 2018","Worst car dealership in the country.

A completely dysfunctional dealership and truly disappointing experience that for some awful reason, keeps on giving (must be a sales event). 

I just bought my truck, and the employees at the dealership were leaning on it. A new truck, and you have 2 people laying all over the hood of the truck. They said they would tell their manager about those employees - that didn’t happen. Next, they put a full tank of gas in it, but forgot to tell whoever getting the gas to not SMOKE in my car. At this point, let’s pause. Are these two events considered good service for a large purchase like this? Absolutely not. 

And the story gets much greater, they didn’t just take my deposit amount - they took twice my deposit amount. 

At this point, I’m pretty angry. I call them up, I get a sales person, who says there is no manager on site. I hang up. I call my bank and file a dispute. They recommend I call them back. I call this dealership again. A new person answers. I say why I am calling and how I need to talk to a manager immediately. She says of course, WE ALWAYS HAVE A MANAGER ON SITE. I then say - well why did someone else say otherwise? She didn’t know. Great. Two people who aren’t being helpful - don’t worry, she forwarded me onto an extension line that didn’t pick up. I called again. Talked to another person. I told him why I was calling and why I was calling a third time. He talked to a manager and said I would get my 25 bucks back - UM hello, my deposit that you all took twice is much larger than 25 dollars. I told him I wanted to talk to a manager and he said the manager would call me back in 15 minutes. NO CALL FOR THE REST OF THE NIGHT. 

I should have never purchased a car from this dealership. I had an appointment and they were so unorganized. This should have indicuated rk me that this was not worth continuing. 

Overall, I will never step foot into another Clay Cooley car dealership again. Trust me, you will have a similar experience as me if you shop at any of his dealerships. The service quality is low, none of these employees are trained appropriately, and the culture does not surround the consumer. 

I am going to inform my whole network of this awful experience and can’t wait to see them purchase cars at other dealerships besides Clay Cooley.

If I could give Clay Cooley a number below one, I would. 
I went to the dealership on 635 LBJ near the Galleria Mall / Tollway. 
The service and unprofessionalism there was awful.  
Mr. Cooley should do the undercover boss show.  I wonder does Mr. Cooley already know what is going on at the dealerships.
The sales and finance manager are not to be trusted.  Especially, Brian and Dustin.

I strongly recommend you check with another dealership before you sign anything with Clay Cooley. 
In fact, shop around before making a commitment.  
Sadly, the sales manager added a price for an app that is provided free of charge by Chevrolet..  
The Clay Cooley team did not share discount information with me.  Clay Cooley missed a good business opportunity with my company and family.

I will never do business with any of the Clay Cooley's locations.
I wish the sales employees the best of luck, they need better examples of a trustworthy and honest management team.",1.0

41,"February 24, 2018","Barely a 1-star.... I had to really give this some thought on what I wanted to say about this place and the way they treated my wife and our autistic son.  

From the get go it was a horrible experience for her and I went back the next day trying to make it better for her and didn’t really get anywhere besides BS from the finance guy and the sales manager who tried to make it right with a “maintenance contract” but was still a bunch of BS.  The best part for her was a young lady and I don’t remember her name, but she was very nice to my wife and our son and helped as much as she could. 

My wife went in there to simply look around and wasn’t ready to buy without me there with her and they screwed her into signing for a bottom dollar piece of junk little car for our daughter and really raked her over the coals on the price and then in the end charged her almost an extra $3000 in charges or fees that didn’t need to be there.  

I wouldnt recommend anyone going to this dealership but if you have to, in the end you had better really pay attention to the fine print and the details… if I had a way to make them take this car back and get my wife back her money back,  I would do it in a heartbeat....

Another really bad side of this equation is that I work with one of Clay Cooley’s (the owner) nephews and he highly recommended this place and the salesman and it was a horrible experience from the beginning to the end and we will never go back nor will I ever recommend this place and from this point forward, Clay Cooley Dodge has lost all of my company‘s business as well!!  I went back in my records to look and in 2017, we bought 16 Ram trucks, 2016 was 12, 2015 was 18 and I didn’t go back any further....enough said but they have lost ALL our business from now on. 

I’ll make it my point in life in every which way I can to post negative feedback on every site that I possibly can find to share our ordeal… I realize not every dealership is perfect & there’s truly not a perfect dealership out there but this place is FAR from it and I will make it a point to prove that to anyone that I can!

43,"August 21, 2017","From the used car salesman, to the title team, to the sales manager, and the entire customer support team... be prepared to deal with ineptitude, lack of communication, misplaced information, busted deadlines and an overall lack of either honesty or a complete lack of job knowledge (I'm guessing ineptitude since I would hope the days of the lying used car salesman are behind us). Take your business elsewhere. expect the finance department to not file your payment information in a timely manner (yes, my bank called me to tell me I had not yet paid for the truck since the finance department failed to contact my bank per the loan information). Be prepared to submit proof of insurance multiple times (yes, Augustine failed to send it to his team, who could not deliver the vehicle when agreed upon). Be prepared to have your temp plates expire while waiting for Guila to process your title paperwork (yes, I called 10 days prior to the expiration, she assured me it would be extended... she did not do her job). Be prepared to negotiate one final price with Augustine and later find out that due to shifty language, there was no intent to be accountable to the agreement and N/A in the Title fee only meant that it was N/A for the Clay Cooley team to be accountable for their verbal agreements. Be prepared to call and text Augustine for weeks while trying to resolve your own issues, so that You can have current temp plates to keep you legal on the road. Be prepared to talk with the pre-owned director William Harris who will not help with your concerns (instead, he will take an attitude with you, claim the dealership manager is not in (he was) and hang up the phone on you mid sentence. Be prepared to elevate your concerns with Mr. Ken Sink whose very political tone yielded no more than a reference back the the original source of my problems, the sales representative Augustine Gomez. Be prepared to express your concerns with the online corporate assistance team when you feel all is lost.

44,"July 12, 2017","I apologize for length of this review, but I want people to understand the depth of the deception and unethical practices.  I originally contacted Clay Cooley Chevrolet in early June in regards to a vehicle that I saw on their website.  I spoke with a salesman named Terry (who is at 0 fault in this) and completed a credit application online.  Terry called and said that they had an approval and had a perfect vehicle for my situation.  I went in on June 17 around 4 pm and began the process.  At first, they said that they were not sure that it would be approved and I stated that they had already told me that everything was good to go, so  I wanted to know what happened.  After spending nearly 4 hours at the dealership, we had finally agreed on numbers and a vehicle and I agreed to come back on Monday to sign papers and complete the deal. I agreed to a down payment of $750, which the sales manager agreed to hold a check for 2 weeks on. I agreed to trade my 2006 Toyota Camry, for which they agreed to give me $3000.  During this process, they asked me a couple of times about our other open car loan and if I had a cosigner, to which I said no and would not be able to get one. They assured me that this would not be a problem.

When I arrived on Monday (during my work hours), I spend 2.5 hours there waiting on finance to be ready for me.  I signed my paperwork, but was told by Joe Gobea that they would not give me paperwork then, that they would mail it to me in a couple of days.  I agreed and set an appointment for Wednesday to pick up the vehicle since it had to go through service.

When I arrived Wednesday evening, I again was there nearly 2 hours waiting on the car and the  temporary license plates to be ready. I left assuming that everything was okay and that I had just purchased a good car from an okay dealer.

Thursday, Joe calls me and asks why I have not brought them cash or a cashiers check for the down payment.  I explained to him that the sales manager had agreed to hold the check and deposit it on the 5th of July.  He seemed very frustrated with this and told me he would check on it and let me know if there were any issues.  Since I did not receive a call back, I assumed that everything was okay.

July 5th came and went and I expected them to deposit the check at any time. I received a call on July 10th from Terry that they would need me to come in and resign some paperwork since it had gone from June to July.  I agreed and made an appointment to come in the next day.  Three (3) minutes later, Joe from finance calls and basically says the exact same thing.   I asked him if he even talked to the salesman since we had just spoken and he said ""no"".  I informed him that I would be in on the 11th and his words were ""come see me tomorrow and we will work everything out.

When I arrived on the 11th, I find out that Joe was on a scheduled day off (see above comment from him) and dealt with Keith, their finance director.   He informed me that they needed me to trade the other vehicle that we have a loan on (my fiancee's 2009 Buick Enclave) or they needed a cosigner.  He also stated that they had discussed trading the Buick and I informed him that this had never been discussed as a trade and that they only asked me if it was in both of our names.  I told him that I would not trade that vehicle (I am upside down in it) and that I did not have a cosigner.  He then stated that “no finance company will give you 2 open auto loans, I don't know why we even signed you up on this contract.”  I was completely taken aback and extremely mad at this conversation and repeatedly asked why they had done this if it would not get approved.  All he could say is “I don't know”. I left completely frustrated and pissed off.  Keith told me he would work on it but it did not look good.  I called my salesman personally and spoke with him and he was completely flabergasted that this deal had gone bad.  I then spoke to Clint, one of the sales managers and apprised him of the situation.  He said he would check and get back to me personally.  I received a call from Keith (not Clint) 2 hours later that we needed to unwind the deal.
This morning, my fiance called the Texas Attorney Generals office and spoke to a woman who explained that SHE had this exact same situation happen to her:  WITH CLAY COOLEY!!!!!  She informed my fiance that we should call the lender to even see if they tried to get an approval or not and see what the lender actually said about the deal.  I called SAFCO and was told that they had denied the original contract but had APPROVED another version.   With this information, I called Ken (General Sales Manager) and explained my dilema to him.  He sounded sincere and wanted to look into it.  During this conversation, he stated that not only had SAFCO approved the loan but that there was an approval from another lender that they would work with.  He said that he would talk with the finance guys and we would “work something out”.  I then received a call about 30 minutes later, from Joe in finance, that the only way they could get it done was with me trading our other car.  I informed him that I had spoken with Ken and he said that it didn't matter, the deal would not happen.

I have now wasted nearly a month of time and energy on this deal.  I feel that I was lied to and misled and have never had a straight answer.  I am pursuing ALL avenues of recourse, including legal, and intend to make this review available about them to anyone who wants it.  I am filing complaints with the Office of Consumer Credit Commission in Texas, the Texas DMV, General Motors, and the local BBB. 

Don't be deceived like I was.  Don't spend your time fooling with this incompetent bunch and take your business to someone who will at least try to earn it.  I feel like Clay Cooley should reimburse me for the countless hours I have spent and the sheer frustration and anxiety that this has caused.",1.0

These were not options and they were not included in the advertised price. I was told the fees were not negotiable. The GM of sales admitted there is a standard addendum from $1295-$1995 added to their vehicles. This is not included in the advertised prices.

After driving my truck a few miles the vibration kept coming back, they would check out the truck and again stated that the tires were out of round and replaced them.  This kept repeating over and over for about 6 months. Then I started getting a hard thumbing noise and vibration in the fount end. I road with service manager; again they said it the tires were out of round. This process repeated 4 more times, the last time I picked up my truck it was not fixed even though the promise me it was.
 I took my 2014 - 2500 Silverado HD Crew Cab Diesel, to Clay Cooley, and my now husband explained the issues that I was having to are service rep Johnny Gamez.  Johnny took a test drive with us and right off the bat knew something was wrong and didn’t think it was the tires. 24 Hrs later Johnny called and said they had found the issue which was Steering Shaft was Lockup, and would not move.  Johnny told us that the Steering Shaft could have snapped and I would of lost control of the truck.  I am so grateful for Johnny’s knowledge and the quick response we received from Clay Cooley service department.",5.0

But it had 2000 miles he told them “I want the same car with 0 miles”.   Clay Cooley did a dealer swap for a Camaro RS, black with no sunroof.  My bother-in-law goofed and signed papers with out inspecting the car first.  The Chevrolet dealer sent the papers to the bank while they waited on the car to arrive.  Kevin was so excited about getting his new car he for got about the sunroof, left the lot 2 hours later realized his car had no sunroof took it back.  The Dealer said sorry the papers are already at the bank, there is nothing we can do.

    Seven pm I get the call, Brother help.  So I go down there and get the same story “sorry the papers are at the bank there’s nothing we can do.”  “WE WANT TO MAKE THIS RIGHT”  They could have called the bank and said hold on we have a mix up.

But in the end the Chevrolet Dealer chose to do nothing and when I talked to them on the phone a day later I got attitude from the sales manager of tough we SCREWED YOU, BYE. CLICK.

Now I have a dead engine and another expensive repair and the inconvenience of not having a car. I have never received a call in 5!!! days for an update, when I called in, it took them at least 15 minutes to provide me with an update. Not even a detail has been done in all those days.

75,"April 09, 2015","Where do I start...Let's just say a good lesson learned for young, young adults. 

I went in to trade my 2003 Chevy Silverado and to get a 2014 Chevy, the sales man was extremely nice on the phone and informed me that everything was going to work out and he would not screw us.

We told the sales man EXACTLY what we wanted in a TRUCK (5.3L 4x4 crew cab) which we told him multiple times. He then said I have the perfect truck, pulled it up to us and we test drove it. 

It was dark and we failed to check the motor, but whenever we were in about to go over financing he told us multiple times it was 5.3 L and not to worry. 

Whenever we were speaking about our warranty they suddenly tried to take the bumper to bumper away and say they never told us, whenever I stood up to leave they SUDDENLY remembered they said that and gave it to us. 

The Sales man also promised us that he would have the windows tinted for us and a trailer hitch receiver put on the following SATURDAY at 10AM 

The following day we were messing with the buttons trying to learn everything and it scrolled across the screen it was a V6. So we drove back up to the dealership and went to our sales guy and whenever we did he said ""i am so sorry, I did not realize it was a 4.3L, let me get someone to help yall right away!"" (AND THE CONTRACT SAYS NOTHING ABOUT THE MOTOR EITHER) 

HE then went to the manager and then the manager came out (OR WHO WE THOUGHT WAS A MANAGER) he basically told us there was not anything they could do for us, and we were going to lose the money on the truck because we could not get our down payment back from the truck we traded in and get a new one. I said ""well the sales man said he did not even know it was a 4.3L and he said,"" ""he told me he did tell yall it was a 4.3L, so you guys knew before you signed the contract"" (SO THE SALES MAN LIED TO SAVE HIS BUTT) I asked to speak to the GM and they told me he was gone for the day and I could not speak to him. 

After that being the young woman I am I called my father (BECAUSE I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO), he then called up to the dealership and requested to talk to the GM of the place. Well come to find out the sales manager and the GM have almost the same exact name and they are brothers. So the Sales Manager (THE BROTHER) decided it would be funny to get on the phone and pretend to be the GM. (THERE IS A GLASS WINDOW WHERE I WAS WATCHING ALL OF THIS HAPPEN) and they were all laughing about it saying they would call back and try to help. (AS I AM SITTING IN THE BUILDING) they would continue to stand there and then whenever my dad would call back they would tell him they tried and there was not anything they would do. 

We waited for 4 hours (BY THE WAY AFTER THE FIRST hour NO ONE SPOKE TO ME TO TRY TO HELP)n and then left. 

the following day we decided there was not anything we could do, so we called to see if we could still get the receiver hitch and the tinted windows and the salesman said he would have to call us back because he did not think he could have it done anymore, after we started to get mad he said ""well I will call you back at first thing Saturday morning"" (FRIDAY NIGHT 4PM) The following morning (SAT MORNING AT 10am.) we called and he said he would call back because he still did not know, called again at 1pm he said he would call back he did not know, called again at 6pm said he would call back before the day was over..... NEVER GOT A PHONE CALL, 

Called Monday 10am and he said he would call back between 12:30-1:30 NEVER GOT A PHONE CALL, so we called again at 3pm and the salesman said he could tint the windows but we would have to pay $400 for the trailer hitch receiver and that he never said he was going to have it done for free.  (SO HE LIED AGAIN)

PLEASE DO NOT GO HERE, IT WAS THE BIGGEST WASTE OF MONEY, ONCE YOU SIGN THE CONTRACT THEY NO LONGER CARE ABOUT YOU, I REGRET EVER GOING THERE. PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY, THERE ARE CHEVY DEALERSHIPS ON EVERY CORNER. FIND A DIFFERENT ONE TO GO TO",1.0

93,"October 24, 2014","I was given a loaner vehicle while my car was in the shop for 2 months. I received a call from Cathy who informed my car was ready and the vehicle i was in was sold, so turn the vehicle in as soon as I can. On Friday, I called and informed them I did not have the money to put in the gas tank, I had no money. They informed they would charge my card when I got the money which would be Monday at 5.00 a gallon to fill the tank totaling 150.00 again I had no money. I went to the location to turn the vehicle as I entered I was informed the service department had closed. The next day, I tried again to turn it in. Again, I was informed the department was closed. Monday morning, as I'm filling the tank, I go to turn the car on and they turn the vehicle off. Mind you, I had just spoken with a woman in the service department and informed her I was on my way, and she said it was fine. I called the rental department, they accused me of trying to steal the vehicle! I informed Dana of the situation she said it was ok. I returned the vehicle by 9am. She tried to charge me $120.00 for a cleanup fee. I informed I do not have any money, she then negotiated I informed I had $40.00. However, as she tried to run the payment it wouldn’t go through because it was a prepaid card. I also was made to open a claim due to a dent in which I informed I did not know what happened. As far as I knew the car was fine. I opened the claim and pretty much had to make something up because she would not let me leave. Before I left Dana informed I would need to pay the $500 deductible for the insurance claim or they would have to turn it into legal claims. I understood and informed I don’t know when I will get it, but I will pay it as soon as I can. The same week, my car turns off while I'm driving yet again. They had a wrecker come pick the vehicle up and “fixed"" the problem. I was able to pick my vehicle up that Saturday. A week later the same problem happens again, the car turns off while I'm driving it, only this time I almost lost my life due to a semi-truck almost hitting me from behind, in the middle of the highway.  The wrecker picks me up orders of Cathy. I call back the next day, this time NOBODODY where my vehicle is, I called for three days and the ONLY person willing to help me was Paul. He was very friendly and very understanding, eventually he found my vehicle and began working on it. A week went by I'm having to pray and hope I have a ride to work. I go to pick up my vehicle and Dana and Summer as well as the new department manager tell me that I cannot pick up my vehicle until I pay the $500 deductible from the original claim A VERBAL AGREEMENT. Mind you, my account is already  -$300 I could not pay them if I wanted to. I felt so intimidated and defeated, I just left the car there. During the month of September and October I received one voicemail from Summer stating the balance was due, and if I did not pay the account goes into legal claims ONE VOICEMAIL On September 2, 2014. I called back several times and nothing was ever stated about the claim only my balance on my car. Julian called my grandmother’s house once to collect payment FOR MY CAR. ON October 17,2014 they ran my account in 4 total transactions totaling $500. Never was I called and informed they would be running my card. I called and referred back to the conversation we had September 11,2014 Dana talked over me and would not let me get a word in. She never answered my questions in reference to the verbal agreement we had previously. She also tried to lie and manipulate me again stating she left voicemails. I asked when she left voicemails she could not answer. I informed I received calls about buying cars, but none from her. I informed we can settle this, or I can get a lawyer. She said because I mentioned lawyer we could not talk  and she hung up in my face. Awesome customer service for a manager great representation of the company as a whole!
If they were going to run my account the least they could have done was called and left a voicemail! The last voicemail the same day I received from Clay Cooley was from Terrell asking me was I in the market for a vehicle. They could’ve even ran it all in one transaction for $500 so the most I would’ve gotten was 1 overdraft free! it was very irresponsible and inconsiderate for a Business woman such as Dana to do something so unprofessional as running a card without doing a basic customer service procedure of leaving a voicemail. I NEVER RECIEVED A CALL OR VOICEMAIL FROM DANA OR SUMMER! They are full of it if they speak otherwise. And we can always pull phone records I have an IPHONE I CAN SEE MY VOICEMAILS! Dana also informed they keep running the card until the balance is fulfilled. I NEVER AGREED TO THIS! If this was the case, why didn’t you run my card previously and overdraft it instead of denying me the right to take my vehicle home. The manipulation in this whole situation was horrible. I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND THIS CAR LOT TO ANYONE THEY ARE SCAMS!

97,"September 25, 2014","Wow, where to start.  I was looking for a specific vehicle and it just so happened that Clay Cooley had the vehicle in stock.  I am not a local buyer so I did everything on line.  The vehicle was priced on there website with a sale price of $38,999.  There was no fine print just the msrp and then the discounted sale price of $38,999.  Right underneath that was a button that said request a quote.  I clicked the link and submitted my contact information and the vehicle I was interested in.  Later on I recieved an email that said the special Internet price they could offer me on this vehicle was $38,999.  The next morning I called in to the dealership to request some actual pictures of the vehicle because only stock photos were listed.  After 3 days of calling 3-4 times a day I finally did receive the pictures.  After seeing the pictures I told the salesperson I would like to go ahead and put a deposit on the vehicle and start the purchase process.  He then told me he had to talk to his boss first, which I was a little confused on because I wasn't negotiating.  They sent me a written offer and I accepted it.  However at the time I didn't argue.  A couple hours later I recieved a phone call from the salesman apologizing but said he had to sell the truck for $46,000 not $38,999.  Obviously I was pretty upset and surprised by this.  I told him I had a written quote for the $38,999 as well as it is on line listed for $38,999.  He could not explain why the price was higher.  Absolutely terrible experience all the way around!  It's almost impossible to get anyone to return your calls and it's even harder to actually buy a vehicle.. It is hard for me to understand how a business like this can stay open.  I am a business owner myself so I try to be understanding of the business side but this is just strait up lying.  If you're in the market for a new or used vehicle this is definitely not the place to look.  ",1.0

I can say this, Clay Cooley as I heard from a few people who had bad experiences with the used cars divisions had it wrong, They are alright in my book, I appreciate what they have done for me and as such they created a new car relationship for life, I will tell all I know that Clay Cooley and the salesman Andrew Hawkins worked a miracle and for that they gained a client for life as long as they stay the same.

102,"September 18, 2014","I purchased my 2014 Malibu from this dealership on Saturday Sept. 13 not expecting to drive away with a deal that would be so awesome, so big and very untypical of what you would expect from a dealer that I ask myself everyday is this really true?

My story is simple, I had purchased a used vehicle from the deal a few years ago and as it approached the high mileage death stage, I began to look at ways that I could still have a dependable car that would allow me and my family to get around in. After hearing a few, ""Sir we cant help you get out and off our property"", a salesman by the name of Andrew called me out of the blue as if I heard the angels and sounds of heaven raining down. 

Long story short, Andrew Hawkins said come in and lets us look at the car and I bet we can get you into a new car. After thinking about it, I decided to go and after running credit and looking at my trade in, THEY SAID YES WE CAN AND WILL HELP YOU!

After signing the financial paperwork I was handed the keys to my brand new Chevy Malibu yea me! But then it got even better, my partner was in need of a car and they offered we obliged and low and behold we drove out that day with not ONE but TWO brand new vehicles at a time when other dealers were saying no and we need large sums of down payments.  

I can say this, If you are looking for a new vehicle then take your tail on down to CLAY COOLEY CHEVROLET where you will get a YES before you get a NO! I hope this doesn't sound too sales pitched but I just want to express my gratitude for a team of people who worked hard to provide the best for me and my family. Thanks ANDREW HAWKINS!

128,"September 01, 2014","MY OVERALL REVIEW IS THAT THE CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS GOOD, I FEEL THAT THE TIME IT TAKE'S   TO ACTUALLY PURCHASE A CAR NEED'S TO BE ALITTLE SHORTER. I WAS THERE FOR ABOUT 4 HOURS. WITH TODAY'S TECHNOLOGY THERE SHOULD BE A FASTER WAY TO PURCHASE A CAR. AND I FEEL THAT BEFORE THE SALES  PERSON TRY TO SALE A CAR TO A PERSON THAT ARE USING THEY OWN CAR AS A TRADE IN. IS TO LET THE PERSON KNOW UP FRONT HOW MUCH THE TRADE IN IS GOING TO BE., AND THE COST OF THE NEW CAR. I WAS'NT GIVEN THE INFORMATION UNTIL I WAS SENT TO THE FINANCE PERSON. I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BEFORE I GOT TO THAT POINT. BUT I KNOW NEXT TIME WHAT TO DO. BUT THE STAFF WAS GREAT!  AND I LIKE MY NEW MALIBU, THANK YOU

I went in and she took my information and showed me a vehicle, in the process of working on another vehicle I got handed off to another representative William White. I told them the amount I had as far as my down payment and a possible upside down I had from a totalled car I had to replace. They said that was fine and they would work with me. Sent me home w a new car on Thursday night pending bank approval. On Tuesday I get a Call to bring in the vehicle and asked for a bigger down payment than what I told them I had. So they send me to the used dept and he said they would work with $500 down. I had to again repeat the information I had already submitted on Thursday having to  fill out another application. He came back w a higher down payment and a larger monthly payment on a used car. I understand I have bad Credit and a low down payment, but I had told them upfront as to not waste their time or mine. The next day I went to Frank Kent Hyundai and got an Answer the same day and a brand new Hyundai Elantra Unlimited w the same down payment without any hassles!!
