0,"March 11, 2020","Accepted a price emailed from sales manager and set an appointment to come in and purchase the vehicle. Met the sales manager and he appointed a sales person to go over the car with us. After getting home and going over the contract, realized the car was priced $650 more than agreed amount. I should have payed closer attention to the numbers and didn’t want to argue over it and was going to forget about it. Over the next couple of days and several reminders from the dealership to fill out survey and give them all 10’s I explained after overpaying I didn’t feel they earned it. The sales manager did not think I understood the figures on the contract and had the gentleman from finance call me to explain. After receiving a voice mail from him I called back and explained it to him on his voicemail. Never heard from anyone at the dealership again. On the two week anniversary on the purchase of the vehicle the screen on the dash indicated there was an updated for the system. It would not download and stated to see dealership. I called the service department at Gilman and was informed I would have to schedule and appointment and drop the car off. Went by the dealership talked to the salesman, he talked to the service department and confirmed even though I was right there with the vehicle I would have to make an appointment and drop the car off. This seemed inconvenient so I called Honda Car of Katy which is a few miles from my house. After explaining the issue with no questions the gentleman said to bring it by the next morning and they would look at it. This made me realize I may have chose the wrong dealership. Today received letter from Wells Fargo with details of purchase. After turning down wheel and tire protection at least three time to the gentleman in finance he stated he would throw it in for free. No where on the contract at the dealership did it list tire and wheel protection. The letter from Wells Fargo has it listed as an add on item for $1,049.00 charge to the loan. I have now started a claim with Wells Fargo and plan on contacting the Better Business Bureau.",1.0
1,"February 20, 2020","If I could give this dealership 100,000 reviews of 0 stars, I would, every single day, for the rest of my life. 

DO NOT COME HERE. FOR ANYTHING.

I brought my 2002 Honda CRV in because it was having issues starting. They charged me the diagnostic fee, I said ok, they said they'd figure out what was wrong with it.

It took them four days to figure out what was wrong with it. Up to this point, I'm still fine. Maybe it was something really complicated, who knows. So the service rep calls me back and quotes me at 900$ to replace the starter, and then says oh, you also need all of this other extra stuff (as dealerships often do). I said oh, that's a whole lot, please let me call you back soon. 

I called my family mechanic, who quoted me for 250$ less, and decided I would take my car to him. I called the dealership back within 15 minutes, no answer. Called again, no answer, so I left a voicemail saying hey, please don't do anything to my car, I'll be by to pick it up tomorrow after I get off of work.

The next day, I got a call from the service rep saying they went ahead and replaced the starter, and my total would be 980$. Of course, I was pissed, because I had never said yes, please fix my starter. When I came in to pick up my car, this customer rep tried to say TO MY FACE that I authorized the work. I demanded he bring up the audio recording of our phone convo (because you know they have to record everything) where I approved the work, and he shrank back and knocked 200$ off my price. I should have just refused to pay and taken my car back at this point, because THIS IS WHERE IT GETS WORSE.

I got back in my car, turned it on, and my SRS light was on. It had never been on before, not until I took it to the dealership, so I immediately turned around, walked back in and said, ""........Why is my SRS light on? If y'all messed up something else in my car, you need to fix it."", to which I was responded with ""Well, we can run a diagnostic on it, but it will cost"" at which point I just walked out.

Fast forward to today, when I took my CRV to the Clear Lake dealership to have the SRS light looked at. They quoted me TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS to fix the damage this dealership did to my car. I can't even begin to explain in English words how upset I am right now at this dealership. Probably the worst experience I've ever had paying for anything, ever, and then they ruined my car (for those of you that don't know, they basically killed my car's safety system, so the airbags will not deploy if somebody hits me). I can't afford to get a new car right now (because I just paid y'all at Gillman 900$), I can't afford to fix my car's airbags, and my car inspection is due at the end of this month. 

Tl,Dr;
I took my car to Gilllman to be looked at, they kept it for a week, and charged me an exorbitant amount to break my airbags while doing work I hadn't authorized, so now I drive a deathtrap that I can't make street legal, and if I get pulled over, I'll get arrested.

Thanks Gillman Honda. I really hope someone at your company reads this and actually does something about it,
because literally,

2,"January 21, 2020","My mother-in-law dropped our 2016 Honda Odyssey off because the check engine light had come one.  They responded back to her and told her that a purge valve solenoid needed to be replaced at $537 and they recommended a $222 engine carbon cleaning.

When I researched what they recommended, I couldn't believe the prices they were charging.  I watched someone on youtube replace the same solenoid in less than 20 minutes and the part costs around $70.  It's one thing that they charge $145 per hour shop rate.  But to think that they wonted $537 was over the top.  Carbon Cleaning, who has heard of this.  I bought a Honda because of the reliability.  Carbon Cleaning, I consider this a total scam and hope everyone looks out for this, I have had cars that have gone over 200,000 miles and no one every recommended Carbon Cleaning!

Picked up the car and they charged me a $145 diagnostic fee.  Really, if they wanted to keep me as a loyal customer, they would tell me what is wrong with my vehicle and help me fix it a reasonable price.  I can go to any parts store and they'll run a diagnostic test for FREE.  

Worst yet, I drove off their lot and there is not check engine light on.  Yes, they most likely reset the light, but is has been a long  weekend running the vehicle and no check light.  Was it a fluke, did they even check the solenoid to see if it was faulty?

In my opinion, BAD, BAD customer service philosophy.  Treat people fare and honestly and they will stay will you forever.  Treat them poorly, leaving someone with the feeling of being taken advantage of, not only will you loose their business, they will tell as many other people of your failures.

Gillman Honda will NEVER earn my business.  I will drive or trailer my HONDA ODYSSEY to another Honda dealer and explain to them exactly why before they work on my vehicle.  Hopefully all Honda Dealers aren't the same.

5,"October 30, 2019","A used car was posted online for $5,700. I chat online and confirmed the price for $5,700. Besides, I requested an online appraisal for my car and immediately they gave me a range of what they could pay for mine, So I went (from far away) and after spending more than 3 hours, they gave with this paper with a totally different price for their car ($11,995) and an appraisal for mine almost $1,500 below the minimum price provided in the online appraisal.
I decided to talk with the manager and no surprise, I found a rude and disrespectful woman that could not even apologize for their mistakes or wasting people's time. It was clear she cares only for numbers, not for treating customers right. 
I don't recommend this dealership. Definitely, the worst experience.",1.0

9,"August 09, 2019",I booked a reservation to have my honda clarity re-calibrated for the lane departure systems due to a windshield replacement. During the appointment scheduling they took down all details about the claim with the insurance etc to file against. When I go to the appointment they are like I don't even have this appointment. Then they figured that they made the appoint against my old car which I don't even own. Then the service guy out right denied they ever file a claim with the insurance and that I have to pay out of pocket and file with the insurance myself. He won't even let me even talk to the manager. The way he talked made me realize that this is not a place you should even walk into. It doesn't feel safe to leave you car in such a place. I just took my car out of there as soon as possible. ,1.0

12,"July 29, 2019","I made an appointment for A/C repair and my car is still under warranty. I got there 10 minutes early, the service advisor refused to serve and told me to wait until the exact time for appointment, then let me wait like 30 minutes more because he was busy on the phone with somebody else. After checking my car, he contacted me and said they need to replace new A/C compressor but unfortunately that part is out of stock. He said he didn't know how long I have to wait for that part is shipped. 
Two days later, he called me and said it will take one week to ship. After a week sweating without A/C, he hadn't contacted me so I called him and asked about it, he didn't even apologize but also said that I gotta wait much longer and do not know how long. While I bought my car brand new 2017 from them, there is no ways a large dealer like this take forever to ship A/C compressor. Then, I decided to go to other dealers to get my car fixed. 
Went to Spring Branch dealer, dropped off my car early from morning and got it done completely in one day.

13,"July 19, 2019","I made an appointment for my wife's car to do some warranty work.  When I got there, the tech couldn't figure out what the recall was or why I was there (even though the tech that made the appointment noted both).  Then they charged me $150 to tighten the oil cap because it wasn't covered under the warranty.  To top it all off, they said the issue I brought it in for wasn't broken so they wouldn't fix it.  If you want to throw your money away, you can go there.  My wife always took her car there for regular maintenance, but never again.  Ironically, I'm in the market for a new lease and my old lease was with Gillman.  They just lost a customer over $150.",1.0
14,"July 19, 2019",This is a third time i have had bad experience at Gillman Honda. This time i got Service Director involved due to bad behavior and attitude demonstrated by one of their employees. She would not apologize or offer any compensation despite absolutely terrible customer services and rip-off prices even though i had pre-paid maintenance contract. Honda should take away the dealership license as they don't know the meaning of customer services.,1.0
15,"June 23, 2019","I am a disgruntled potential customer that would like to share my experience today at your dealership. I hope this gets escalated so that it can be corrected. Today, my mom and I were in the market for an accord. After visiting Big Star and Clearlake, Clearlake gave me a great deal, everything was lined up, except one thing- they did not have the car in stock. They would have to do a trade, and it would be ready for pick up on Tuesday. So I decided to call your dealership for a quote and availability. Nick answered, said the car is in stock, gave me a solid deal: beat Clearlake by $100 and will match the special interest rate, pending credit. At the time, my mom was weary of visiting two dealerships so she did not want to visit a 3rd. So she did the online credit app, sent me in to iron out all the numbers, and went to work. If the numbers were good, she would come in to sign. 

When arrived, I was greeted by Nam Nguyen, friendly guy, who helped me. The deal was made. Then we went to finance. I was initially helped by Matt. After he did some crunching, he told me the interest rate would be over 5%. I questioned it, I was told that it would be 2.9% special rate, and my mom’s credit was over 800, it should qualify for it. He explained that with special pricing, I cannot receive special interest. I stated that’s not what I was quoted before I came in. He then stepped out of the office, and when he returned, he told me Javier will help me. Confused on why I’m being passed around. Javier asked me my age, and told me in order to buy the car, I have to be on the loan as well. I told him I do not want to be on the loan, my mom’s credit and income should be enough. He then advised me that since the car is for me, I have to be on the loan or else it’ll be considered a straw purchase, and that’s illegal. I questioned it, so how is it possible that parents buy cars for their kids to go to college, or when people buy cars as a gift. Father’s Day, Mother’s day, anniversary, Christmas, whatever the reason shall be. His reply, “only if they are under 18”. It still didn’t make sense but I responded, “I never heard of straw purchasing, I just learned something new. But regardless, I’m not under 18, and if I have to be on the loan, then it’s a deal breaker, I guess we won’t buy today” His reply, “if you don’t buy the car from us today, I will call all the banks and tell them you’re doing a straw purchase, blocking you from buying it somewhere else”. At that moment, I took it as a threat, strong arming me, forcing me to apply by his rules or else. Is that how Gillman treats their customers? Angry, I walked out his office. Of course he tried to stop me, and said he’s willing to make a deal. I was too angry to hear what “deal” he had to offer, so I left. We have purchased many cars throughout the years, but never once have we been treated this way. It’s very frustrating. If your dealership considers it a straw purchase and cannot sell, then so be it. But is threatening a customer apart of the process, is it necessary? I just want to share my experience, but I also hope someone can explain what just happened. Thank you for your time, I look forward to hearing back. ",1.0
16,"June 14, 2019","There is a reason why this dealership has the lowest rating in Houston. I paid $135 to get a diagnostic test, which they then recommended some costly repairs. The $135 diagnostic test goes toward the repair so you can always expect a costly, unreasonable repair. I had asked for an explanation on what needed to be changed out and the salesman pretty much told me everything I wanted to hear, to get me to agree to the repair. To avoid any miscommunication, I had him look up pictures of the pipe set on the internet and also show me fuel injectors in person, so I knew exactly what was going to be replaced. Once the ""repairs"" were done, I opened up the hood to verify the repairs and EVERYTHING WAS EXACTLY THE SAME AS IT WAS BEFORE THE REPAIR. The Service Manager gave me an explanation of the invoice. It turns out the salesman explanation on the repairs were inaccurate. It was truly a deceptive sales practice because everything prior to the invoice was just a verbal agreement. The invoice did not reflect what the salesman told me was going to be replaced.

Lessons to be learned at dealerships:
1. Avoid dealerships with low ratings. This dealership has the lowest rating in Houston.

2. Get what is going to be repaired in writing, before agreeing to the repair. Make them be as specific as possible or else they can change and charge whatever they want on the invoice.

3. Ask to get the old parts that were replaced. This is to verify that they did the replacement and not just did some quick repair.

4. Open up your hood and verify that they changed the parts as indicated in the bid.

17,"June 02, 2019","I went to Gillman honda for my A/C repair, the service consultant (James) said they have to diagnosis and it can cost up to $150 and they will do it next working day. I said ok and dropped my car there. next monday he called me and said it will take more time to diagnosis and cost $450 total. I said ok do it. I called several times for progress but no response so i went directly to there location, they said it will take some more time and they will update me by next day. I said ok and came back. next day james called me and said after diagnosis, they said A/C control unit has to be replaced and it will cost up to $1200, I just said no i will come and pick up. I went there and paid $450 and asked james to write down part number he written it on the invoice. later I bought that part in online store for $50 and replaced it but still A/C not working. I called james and asked is it a genuine reason he said his mechanic conformed it is the only problem, so I returned the part I bought in online. later I verified some of A/C circuit diagram and bypassed relay, my car compressor clutch engaged and when i checked R134a it was low, I filled it and put the relay back to its place and checked, that's it my car A/C worked normally. I didn't replaced any parts. The climate  control system works fine, If i agreed with them I might loose $1200 for false repair. But any how I lost $450 for their wrong diagnosis and lot of time.
Before going to this dealer think twice and spend some little time on self research.",1.0
18,"May 25, 2019","Gillman Honda did not provide cargo net when I bought a new Honda Accord. The dealer transferred cargo net with other stuff from my trade-in Toyota. Because Toyota net was much shorter, it pulled off trunk on one side. When I went back and asked for a replacement, Gillman Honda dealer denied wrong-doing and refused to provide me the net and asked me to pay for it.

19,"May 17, 2019","In May we got an oil change on my wife’s 2014 pilot. The next day I saw a puddle on my garage floor. Hoping it wasn’t anything serious, I crawled underneath to discover the drain plug had not even been tightened snug. An observation of the dip stick revealed it was really overfilled. — Gillian has a reasonably advertised price for their synthetic oil change which attracted us to them but If I have to go back and get dirty, drain the oil to the correct level, tighten the drain plug and double check their work, I’m better off doing it myself. — the thing they didn’t fail to do was give us a list of costly repairs they recommend we have them do. - expected better",2.2
20,"May 17, 2019","I have a 2018 Honda Civic EX.  Everytime I go for an oil change, they always tell me its time for tire rotations and alignment.  This time was a guy name Martinez.  I just got those done couple of months prior and I told that to the Honda employee.  He said alignment needs to be done every 15,000 miles and tire rotations every 5,000 miles.  I told him that I have got those done already when I came to get my very first oil change.  My car only has around 12,000 in mileage and he knows that.  He still stared at me in the face and said ""so, do you want to do them or not?""  I told him ""NO, I have already got them done when I was here for the free oil change!""  What's surprising is that I went to Gillman Honda three times just for oil change and a different person everytime told me I need alignments and rotations.  I thought everthing that's done to my car at the dealership are all on records.  Couldn't they just look it up and see that I don't need them!!!",2.6
21,"April 01, 2019","We just bought a new honda accord sport 2019 at the end of february, we was so happy with the new car, great experience with the sales Man Al. After the first car wash we noticed an overspray on top of the hood, weather stripping on one of the quarter windows was touch up by the dealer,  dirt under the clear coat in one of the passenger doors, a cricket noise coming from the engine. We when yesterday 03/30/2019 to pick up the license plates and we spoke with the service manager Shanh shahriari about some issues, we don’t explain about the cricket noise coming from the engine, the service manager Shang  was  with no interest like if all this issues are normal, is not respect or minimum interest for what we was telling him, so rude. Im so dissatisfied and disappointed with the car, we should not have that many issues with a new car and scheduling service repairs in brand new car. This is the dealer responsibility to inspect every single car before they sale to costumers. I will not recommend people to buy from them.  the less we expect  with a brand new car is not having any issues like this. I hope we can have a response as soon   as possible from the owner and they take responsibility for this. Also i have to work and live far away from the dealer, that’s why we bought a new car because i need a good and safe transportation. It’s very difficult for me to go to the dealer only because they don’t inspect the cars before they sell them. Frustrating and terrible experience.",1.8

23,"March 26, 2019","I would never ever do any business with this dealership (Gillman @ Rosenberg).

Throughout the process, we were promised evertything until we sat in front of the sales person.

- When we are there to trade in our Odyssey, all of a sudden, we don't have the car that we were told is available. I am there for 3-4 hours total in the dealership and it may not be best use of your time to read it if I include everything.

In summary, do yourself a favor and never ever try to do any business with them, they lied almost 100% and they seems very shameless. It is fun for them to lie and when we find out and question them on it, they are literally smiling. OH my god, never go there.

We purchased the warranty and find out immediately after coming home that lot of excluded items were promised and we are still trying to cancel our warranty and get the refund but it seems like we really need to go to small claims court on this since they are only acknowledging our cancellation request verbally and from what we experienced so far, we do have a strong feeling that they lie on this issue later since we do not have written confirmation.",1.0

25,"February 16, 2019","I enquired online to Gillman Honda Southwest about a new 2018 CR-V Touring, and received a response very quickly telling me they had  new 2018s available, they had them on their website, and in the color I wanted, giving me a quote which was acceptable to me. I was ready to buy it.
I received multiple emails from Gillman's edealer.hub February 8, 12, 13, and 15, 2019, still confirming they had the new 2018 CR-V Touring.
Somewhere in the middle of this I received an email from General Manager Daryl Waterwall asking me to call him, which I did. Mr Waterwall said he wanted to help me personally since we have bought previous Hondas from Gillman. He also said they didn't have 2018 but he would give me the same deal on a 2019 since I had been given wrong information.He also said he wanted to personally make sure we got in and out quickly.I told Mr Waterwall that my husband might also trade in his Honda Pilot.
I continued to receive emails from Gillman Southwest ehub about the new 2018 CR-Vs.including yesterday.
Today we went to Gillman Southwest for a 2:00 PM appointment I had verified with Mr. Waterwall. 
We were handed down from person to person to person, and told that they had seen the offers that had been emailed to me on the new 2018 CR-V Touring,, but they didn't have any. Yesterday I had received yet another email on the 2018 CR-V Touring and asking if I was coming in today for my appointment. I responded yes.
The person we ended up with was Mike, a very nice young man who had been given the job of selling me a 2019 CR-V and diffusing the bait and switch over the 2018. Mike said they were aware of the emails I was receiving from their dealership from the internet person but it was all a mistake. We asked where the internet hub people worked from and he told us right in the same building.
If Gillman Honda and Daryl Waterwall knew that I was continuing to be contacted by the internet person with erroneous information, why does it still go on? This is ridiculous, and our promise from Mr. Waterwall that we would be in and out quickly was also false. I had decided I would go ahead and get the 2019 CR-V that I drove, but the price haggle was ridiculous, and certainly not in line with ""giving me the same deal"". By now we had been at the dealership 3 hours and were taken to ""financing"" which was full of people. At this point we decided to go, and did inform Mike who in turn informed ""his boss"". Never again, the last car I am buying from Gillman is the one I drove in there today. This is a really bad way to do business. I feel badly for Mike, he was tasked with selling me a 2019 CR-V Touring, which is not what I wanted, and he was certainly not supported by Gillman's management team in this effort. I feel that Gillman's management team threw Mike and me both to the run around.
Even today, 2/17/2019 Gillman Honda Southwest website is still showing 2018 CR-V Touring available. If they can't take care of their business they certainly will not get mine.",1.0
26,"January 15, 2019","Went there for an oil change. Took me 3 hours... When driving on freeway going back home heard something rubbing against the road. Came to find out there is a tray under the engine it was hanging all the way to the ground and rubbing against the road. Called the dealership and they said do come back and they will fix it. Went back had to wait 3 hrs again and they put a new engine tray. Went to different place after few months  for oil change of coarse and before even they touched my car they showed me what Gillman honda did. Gillman honda had put all kinda different junk screws and clips to hold that tray up for the engine, not the honda OEM parts.... Can u imagine that spending all the money and time Just for peace of mind that they will do the job right and put OEM parts but instead they just mixed and matched and put whatever screws and clips they could find from junk to put the tray up. 
I got the oil change done from that place and than came back and brought the whole issue with service director Kelly. At first Called her so many times and left voice mails and Called her assistant also but no response. Finally Kelly (service director) calls and I was shocked by the way her attitude and customer sercive skills are. She really thought it wasnt a big deal. I dont care about anything but my time and safety for my family is very  very important. I m paying extra bucks so I can get that peace of mind and good customer service, and if my wife is on the road with my baby I m ok that the car is gonna be fine. 
She said to bring the car back and if that was the case where they messed up and if I was telling the truth (lol) she will take care of me (9 hrs waste of time) as They messed up my car. They messed up my car, mess up after mess up. And than I took my car back to honda Gillman. I requested manager to show me what is going on with my car. He showed me their mess up what They did and admitted their fault. He took all the after market screws and clips from the car and brought all OEM parts and put them on. I had to catch them for them to correct their mistake. NOW IF SOMETHING WAS INSIDE THE ENGINE I WOULD HAVE NEVER FOUND THAT.

I had a very bad experience at this honda dealership.  I live 45 minutes away from dealership and because of their fault I wasted 9 hrs of my time altogether and paid them What they asked for and in return Kelly had nothing to say... No apology or anything . She shouldnt be even a cashier at any place for the customer service skills she has to offer and She is a director of a place like this. Than imagine people working under her dont even care to do their jobs right. 

Will never go there again as they put CHEAP and after market parts in the cars to save their money and not putting their customers lives under serious safety issues. People have babies and kids and families so please take this advice and dont go their again. Honda Katy I have never heard anything bad about them. At least they put good and OEM parts and haven't heard anything in regards to this issue what I had to face with honda Gillman. 
Honda of Katy very nice and respectful people. Very satisfied with and very caring. If u want to save ur time and have peace of mind when ur family or kids drive the car and that the parts in ur car are actually original parts not the junk parts.

27,"December 05, 2018","I had a pretty nasty experience when I took my truck for a 100k service.  I have taken my truck here for oil change and the estimate given by the service advisor was around $1100.  Day before the appointment I called the same advisor and was told
That it would be another $300 in addition to the package that was recommended for the 100k service.  I agreed despite these cheap tactics.  I got the 100 k service done and the next day the truck would not start. 

I had it towed to the dealer.  I was told that the battery connection was corroded and a new battery was needed.  I do not know what they did but my battery which was ok till they did my 100k service was now dead and the cable was corroded.   The estimate was another $650.  Again I had no choice as the truck would have to be towed elsewhere and I am sure they knew I was captive audience.  So now the total was around $2100.   I got the truck home and the radio codes had not been reset when they installed the battery - how sloppy can a dealer be.  So I called the service guys to get them reset.  

My take - be careful as they use cheap tactics to get you in and then nickel and dime you.  This is the last time I am going to these guys.  I am assuming the service guys are put under pressure to jack up repairs and estimates.  Unfortunately this is an unregulated industry and we should use these review to weed out the unethical ones.

34,"February 19, 2018","I have so many bad things to say about this dealership. I will start by saying that soon after I left my info online so that I could receive a quote for a new vehicle, Gillman was the first dealership to contact me. Their prompt reply made me want to go and deal with them, based on my belief (then), that they were good at providing customer service.

It was not until I went there, that I found out they have terrible business practices. They quoted me a car significantly higher than the published sticker price. They tried to justify the high purchase price based on some accessories and upgrades that they had already included on the car, which of course were not requested by me. Simple items such as window tint and wheel locks, were in their minds enough reason to cheat me out of a few thousand dollars more.

That made me feel bad and thought on going out to a second Honda dealership, but they still asked me to leave a deposit down for them to separate my car before leaving. Something which made me feel even worst about such experience.

I ended up going to a second dealership the next morning, and after receiving a very good treatment and a completely transparent offer at such place, I ended up buying the most equipped car in that segment for a better price than the one quoted by Gillman a day before. If you are interested in a Honda and live around Houston, I recommend going to Honda Cars of Katy. They give you more than what is promised and for a much better deal. I suggest avoiding Gillman even if you live next door to their place.

Finally, even though I informed the salesperson and his manager, which by the way called me not less than 10 times within 24 hours, that I had bought the car that I was looking for at another dealership, they still call me every day and leave a message on my cell phone offering me a great deal and asking me what is required for them to get my business. They guy who calls has left several (exceeding 20 messages) in my voicemail and I can barely understand his messages.

I have bought several cars during the past 8 years, and this visit to Gillman Honda in Houston has been by far, the only terrible experience that I have seen. I wish they would stop bothering me right away! 

I wonder if other clients have suffered with the same terrible customer service at their store and the extreme phone harassing techniques after that first visit.",1.2

42,"February 02, 2017","The vehicle sticker, sales and finance department said the Nitro package was on my car.  The Nitrogen package included nitrogen filled tires and a road hazard warranty that covered the tires and wheels in case of damage.  I was told that it is already on the car.  I did not think it was smart to pay for nitrogen when 78% of the air we breath is nitrogen.  That sounded like a scam.  However, it included the tire and wheel road hazard. 

On December 3rd at about 5:30, a bolt punctured my car tire while driving.  I called the Honda dealership about an hour before they closed requesting assistance.   They told me that they would have to find my paperwork and call me back.  They didn't call back so I called them.  They told me that I would have to deal with it on Monday because they were closed on Sunday.  I called on Monday and the person that checked my contract folder said there was nothing in it about a warranty, not even the extended warranty that is separate from the Nitro package.  I asked to speak with Crystal (sales manager) and she claimed that I got such a good deal on the car that there was not Nitro package warranty.  I told her it was on the sticker and sales contract.  She told me that there was nothing she could do for me.  I then called the main office and spoke with Stacey Gillman's assistant, Debi Adams, and she told me she was going to call Aldo Cortes, the manager at Gillman Ft. Bend.  Gillman Ft. Bend responded with an offer to try and repair the tire this one time as a courtesy.  My response is that I have a warranty and they need to honor that warranty today and in the event of any future problem as specified in the warranty.

44,"January 13, 2017","I wish I would have read the reviews  first before I wasted my time driving all the way across town to deal with these people. Their business practice is so crooked and so severely lacking that I hope this review saves people the headache and the time of dealing with them.

We test drove a car yesterday. Before we left , Marissa, the Manager, stated that they made a mistake on the price and that the price would increase in 48 hours. I called back in less than 24 hours and they said the price already went up $2,000 and that they would not honor the price they quoted when I test drove the car. When I spoke to the salesman about it, he said the Manager told me 24 hours (which she did not, as my daughter heard her also and I even wrote it down) and that the car was just on sale at the time I looked at it. Either way, it's not my problem if they made a mistake on the price, plus I called back even before 24 hours was up, so their argument is full of it.

I have dealt with numerous dealerships from Houston to San Antonio and Dallas in the past year, as I recently bought a new car and have been looking for a used car for my child for several months. I know car salesmen don't have the best reputation, but this one goes far beyond their usual deceptive practices.

58,"October 03, 2015","We were looking to purchase a CR-V Touring SUV, and arrived at the showroom sometime around mid-day.  There were several customers milling around, but no salespeople.  We were advised that they were ""in a meeting"" but that someone would be with us shortly.  About five minutes later, a young lady arrived and brought up an appropriate vehicle. We asked if it was equipped with navigation, to which she replied, ""No, but we can add it.""  As it turned out, the feature is standard on the CR-V Touring, as is Homelink (garage door opener), which she also said was not on the vehicle.  During the test drive, she had difficulty getting a couple of features to work, but we wrote all of it off to inexperience ... we've been there.

When it came time to discuss money, she left us alone for quite some time, ostensibly to arrange for our trade-in to be appraised.  She returned, stating that she had no idea how the shift lever worked (it's a 2014 Prius, and operates electronically), and it took her forever to get it over to the appraiser.  

When the initial offer finally arrived, our first inclination was to leave immediately ... full list price for the Honda (not to mention a bunch of add-ons, including $300 [Three Hundred Dollars!] to inflate the tires with nitrogen)  Adding insult to injury our Prius came in at a whopping $5,000 under trade-in value.  We've bought and sold dozens of automobiles over the years, and fully understand the ""car game.""  But we immediately surmised that we'd be getting nowhere here, and requested the keys to the Prius, so that we could be on our way.  

A nearby colleague heard us, and tried to intervene on  the young lady's behalf ... but despite his explanation for the lowball trade offer (emphasizing that Gillman is not a Toyota dealer, hybrids have decreased in value due to $2 gas, and that Honda was offering no incentives on the CR-V), our immediate objective remained to leave.  

In order to get one step closer to retrieving the keys to our own vehicle, we had to endure the sales manager's condescending canned spiel about how KBB, Edmunds and the other online sites don't take various factors into account.   Still, there was no possibility of a deal here, so we once again asked to terminate the conversation and be gone.  

We had to walk the virtual length of the showroom, but they finally surrendered the fob.  When asked where the car was parked, someone pointed to an area halfway across the parking lot ... and given that my wife was wearing a boot to correct an orthopedic condition, the least anyone could have done was to bring the vehicle closer.  One salesperson actually came out to apologize.  

We had planned to take a look at the Subaru Forester at the Gillman dealership next door ... but given that it almost took an act of Congress to get our keys back, coupled with the rationalization as to why we'd be screwed out of $5,000 in addition to being charged top dollar for the CR-V, we decided to look elsewhere.  

It should have been simple ... we couldn't come to terms (hardly unusual for an automobile transaction), so we say thanks and exit.  Not so at Gillman ... we literally had to raise our voices to let those folks know that we had no intention of doing business with them, and we'd like to have our transportation back.  

We're sympathetic to people trying to earn a living in such a cutthroat industry ... but before they come on the floor, they need to be trained.  This might as well have been our salesperson's first day on the job.  

Incidentally, we did get full value for our trade (and not from a Toyota dealer), as well as a nice discount on our new SUV ... and there were no incentives either.  Unless you have the patience of a saint, know little or nothing about buying a car, and are willing to overpay for your new ride, while being shafted on your trade-in's value, avoid this dealership at all costs.",1.3

I have seen the used car and did the test drive, i told sales person that there are some good signs of scratches and paint issue on the car. Sales person told that 'no problem, i will take care of them' and after I sign the paper and I asked him can you fix those issues you committed and I am surprised that sales person saying that 'we will not able to fix them and do anything with them'... This is the first time I am seeing such a core profession marketing sales person which behaves completely different before and after signing the papers

Also i approached them with Internet price and in Internet nothing was mentioned extra on top of Internet price. After I decided to buy then sales person given the car price as Internet Price + added Service Fee (Service Fee means all lubricant oil changes on the car + they said Gillman will give life time engine warranty for that they will charge extra $998 on top of Internet price(this was not mentioned on the internet)...So i negotiated the final price as same as Internet price (i am hoping that my price will include life time engine warranty) and after signing he said i will NOT get any warranty as I declined that....But i have not declined and I have negotiated the final price which includes warranty...... Finally I realized that they simply add extra $998 and every customer negotiate and  even after customer negotiate the price still they will get as the internet price what they offered ...customer simply loosing money and they are getting what they initially quoted ($0 on negotiation), so they completely cheated me on the price.

One more catch on life time engine warranty on all used cars means you have to come to their service center and do all regular services and if you miss one service then this life time engine warranty will not work...

My bad was i really not noticed some major issues on the car like windshield crack with temporary fix on it(I  noticed when driving the car back to home) and some of the dashboard switches are very bad...Even I have not called and asked them on these issues because I don't think they will respond....

When I mentioned stopping by John Eagle Honda for price comparison as being straight forward and honest person. He totally refused to give me any price for 2015 Honda Accord Sport. 

How can you expect someone to buy anything without them knowing the price. I asked him to whether he ever purchased a pair of paints from a shopping mall without  knowing a price for them. He said no. Then I asked him how can you expect me to buy a twenty seven thousand dollars of car without knowing the price. 

He got tipped off when I mentioned to him John Eagle Honda. He said John Eagle Honda were very small and low class dealer than Gillman Honda. 

He was rude, argumentative, unprofessional and mean. I DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE GO TO GILLMAN HONDA EVER!!!!! OR AT LEAST NOT TO DEAL WITH THE MANAGER LAWRENCE.

There are good honest sales people out there and I won't give my business to a dealership that pull these dishonest stunts. Very disappointed in my experience with Gillman.

I left, came home and printed out the web page that was still opened on my computer showing $5,998, then refreshed the page and printed it again with price of $7,998.

I purchased a preowned Mini Cooper from Gilman on May 4, 2013.  On the drive home I opend the sunroof 
and it would not close.  Gilman inspected the sunroof and determined that the cost would be in excess
of $1,600 and the most practical solution would be to disable it and seal it off.  The manager did apologize
and refunded $800.  

In less than three months of purchasing the vehicle, the low oil pressure and check engine lights came
on.  An authorized Mini Cooper service center found two significant oil leaks that resulted in $1,500
of repairs.

Before posting this review, I spoke with the manager about Gilman's obvious lack of inspection and repairs
prior to selling the vehicle.  There was no apology this time and I was informed that I should have 
purchased the $1,800 extended warranty.

I've purchased used vehicles from Fred Haas Toyota of Spring and Sewell Infiniti of The Woodlands without
the pressure or need to purchase an extended warranty.  Both delivered quality used vehicles that required 
nothing more than routine maintenance.

Ed was by far the most gracious and accommodating car salesman I encountered during my quest to find the perfect car at the best price.  He was knowledgeable about the CRV and took the time to share his knowledge with me.  When I asked Ed for his best price on the CRV LX, he consulted with Sal and presented me with a ""walk out"" price that seemed very fair to me (based on my online research).   Unlike some other dealers, there was no pressure to buy immediately or the price would not be honored.  After three visits and test driving two different cars, the price was still good.  Originally, there was not a blue CRV in stock so I placed a deposit on a red one and planned to take delivery on Monday.  Ed knew that red was not my first choice so, when a blue CRV arrived over the weekend, he called to let me know, switched my deposit to the blue one and expedited the check in process so I could pick it up on Monday.

First of all the salesman never tried to sale the car to us as far as why we should buy Honda and especially the great features that the Accord has to offer us.  We were already sold on the Accord but our salesman didn't know this.  With the exception of opening the trunk and letting us test drive the car he didn't offer any information  to us unless we asked.  Then the number game started.  I a had already been to another dealership, so I had an idea of the value of my trade and the price of the new car.  WOW was I shocked.... Gillman came with their offer they offered me $3500 less on my car and the price of the new car was about $3000 more.  And they couldn't understand why we wouldn't accept the offer.  We tried to leave the dealership and everyone knows how that goes.... Here comes his manager...ARROGANT and RUDE is all I can say.  We finally were able to get the keys back to my car and headed to it.  We were trying to get out as fast as we can...manager chased us to the parking lot.  Glad that experience is over, we ended up buying from a local dealership that gave us faith back in salesman.  By th way. Most dealership offer at least a year of free service maintenance Gillman looked at us like we were stupid.

111,"March 27, 2013","The sales representative, Mr. Najam Siddiqui, was friendly, courteous, and helpful during the selection of the car I was interested in, a Honda CR-V EX-L 2WD.  The reason I rated the overall experience as ""OK"" had to do with the process of negotiating a fair price for the car and the financing.  In my case Gillman had already added ""extras"" to the car I selected in the form of items like splash guards, a cargo tray, and wheel locks.  I did not ask for the accessories as you can buy and install them on your own.  But Gillman nonetheless added them and subsequently marked up the retail cost of the accessories to increase the overall cost of the vehicle.  Moreover, they would not offer me the same vehicle without them.  So, I was forced to negotiate with the Sales Manager (not Mr. Siddiqui who I was pleased with) about items I did not want at a price that was above the cost to purchase them.  In my opinion such haggling is simply not necessary.  Ultimately the Sales Manager agreed to lower the cost of the items added to the vehicle and also increase their offering price for my trade-in.  Once we agreed on a final price including the trade-in, I then had to listen to the finance officer try to sell me numerous packages (extended warranties, service plans, gap insurance, etc.) that in my opinion were of little value and only increased the monthly payment.  The financial officer then wanted to videotape me refusing these offers.  I declined.  The end result - it took over three hours to complete the purchase of a great vehicle when it should have taken half that amount of time.",4.0

We made a verbal agreement on price and set up an appointment to pick the car up today, March 20, 2013 at 11am. An hour later he called me and said he needed me to come in that evening and purchase it because another family was there to look at it. I informed him it is an hour drive and already 9pm and I wouldn't make it by closing. He then asked me to please scan the photo of my cashier's check and e-mail it to him so he could hold the car for me. Thankfully my bank is open 24 hours and I was able to get the check. I sent him an e-mail with the photo attached. He called and said he received the e-mail but just wasn't sure he could hold the car for me or not and to call him first thing in the morning. I called at 9am on March 20, 2013 (2 hours before I was scheduled to pick up my car) I got Kitt's answering machine so asked to speak to anyone in sales of preowned vehicles.

123,"November 03, 2012","If you drive 250 miles from Louisiana at 5am to pick up a car...and they say the car (a 2005 Honda Accord EX) is all ready for you to drive off the lot. DRIVE IT FIRST BEFORE SIGNING ANYTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I mean, most used car dealers have a low rating in our society...and for good reason. But these guys take the cake. They not only give you the old song and dance ""well, you don't have to buy it"". But the Honda Used Car Department gets downright nasty. It's laughable for me now, but David Cochran never smiled or was pleasant to me right away. It went downhill from there. REALLY. 
I am a 6'-3"" 51 year old Architect and he flat out thought he could intimidate me. Like I say, it's laughable now...but when I took the car out with the salesman, the rotors were so off, as soon as I put any brake pressure the whole car shimmied and shook. Thank God for Mr Morris Potts in Service who took care of it and was very nice to me and had a very nice smile. I told him ""a smile goes a long way in dealing with your customers"". But he, and only he at Gillman Honda, ever was pleasant the whole time I was at their MASSIVE facility. They do have selection above and beyond the whole State of Louisiana. But you better have a Valium handy cause your probably gonna need it. 
BUYERS BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
That's all I can say. And they had the backing of USAA, which is only open to Military personnel and is a company I have been using for EVERYTHING the past 23 years. I don't give a xxxx who reads this at Gillman, I openly give my name because I want everyone to know that just because they have been in business since the wheel was invented, your last customer is your most important customer. 
As in Architecture, my reputation is all I have, and I can't just tell a client after I started a project ""you don't have to use me"". First, they would probably sue me, then it would get ugly. At least that's how I think it would go down...after working for 24 years, it NEVER came to that. But what ya gonna do, Used Car Dealers deserve the low social status they have in our society for a xxxx good reason. But my Mother and I had a good laugh when I got back because she needs the car (she was in an accident) and after 9 weeks and still not fixed, she needs the car more than I do right now. And it did get me home. We'll see how long that lasts...

126,"October 19, 2012","I purchased a used vehicle from Gillman Honda Houston Southwest. I live 250 miles from the dealership and agreed to purchase the vehicle after looking at many photos of the car, and after speaking to the sales staff about the vehicle's condition. Price seemed very good initially, but as is often the case, when something seems too good to be true, it usually is.  Both salespeople were friendly, but after we reached a deal, getting paperwork from Gillman (purchase agreement, installment contract, odometer disclosure, etc.) was very difficult and required multiple voice and e-mail follow-up's.  Finance Dept seemed far more interested in selling me their high margin add-on's like gap insurance and an extended warranty, than actually getting paperwork signed and deal closed! When I chose not to buy any of that stuff, I was kicked to the curb as far as they were concerned.  Adding insult to injury, when I arrived I was disappointed to find a vehicle in much rougher condition than what the photos had indicated. Numerous scratches, dings, and gouges on the body. (I have many pic's of these defects and can share them).  Someone had tried (very badly) to paint over some of the worst defects with touch up paint.  No one at Gillman ever mentioned that, and certainly did not give me any photos of the numberous defects. Interior looked like it had been totally splashed in cooking oil, and felt greasy, and tacky!  I have already spent about 4 hours trying to remove the grease from all of the interior surfaces.  Taking the vehicle to Service King to repair the most severe body defects on the car. Instead of good deal, I bought the Gillman Turkey nobody wanted!! Shame on Gillman, and shame on me too for letting my excitement for the car override my sensibilities!",2.6

When I arrived at the dealership, I told Marisa that I had an old car (1999 Intrepid with 190,000 miles) that was not running, that I was credit challenged and had very little money for a down payment. I told her that I was looking for a pre-owned Civic. She kindly smiled at me and said ""Please have a seat. I think we can help you and I have a car in mind for you."" Then she went to work. In no time at all, she had a deal put together that was just perfect for me! It was for a much better car than I ever thought I would possibly get and I also got about twice as much as I was expecting for my trade in. And, the monthly payment was affordable. What person in my position wouldn't like that? Maria handed me off to Kimberly in the Finance Department, who also did a great job and had my paperwork ready in no time. She did a very through job of explaining what it all was for, including the terms of my loan and optional coverage that I could purchase.

I would like to have the kind of experience where you go in and get a car in 2 hrs, it has never been any less than 5 hours and sometimes I have spent the entire day.
Well, this is my fourth honda and I am a faithful returning customer, unfortunately, this does not always count for much even though the dealership really thinks so.

Here is a question for you to forward to HONDA corp. Japan...

Why can't you make vehicles with ALL of the available features?, just as you would not make a car without a minimum of safety features, why don't you add a backup camera, keyless ignition, Nav equipment, aren't these really things everybody need?
Why don't you figure them into the minimum price and set the standard?
You would be surprised at the response!!!!
But I wonder, will this ever reach the people that really need to read this???

We had to wait for the vehicle we wanted (which we understood and were fine with) but I was uncomfortable with not knowing what was going on.

197,"November 27, 2011","I bought a 2010 Toyota Corolla Car from Gillman Honda. Before I sign the paper, the dealer told me that this car don’t have any problem, no accident. But, I checked the Autocheck report when I got home, and find that the car have an accident 03/10/2011. 

Then, I come back to Gillman Honda at their next working day. The dealer assures me that the car only has the minor accident and not affects anything of the car. And they also didn’t admit it’s their fault that didn’t disclose the accident history in the car and claim that they don’t use Autocheck report as an excuse.

They are very rude, unprofessional, and lie us about the true situation of the car. Don't do any business with them!

205,"November 16, 2011","Raymond Yu was awesome! The first quote I received from Raymond Yu included all relevant transactions costs; it was this initial transparency that gave me confidence in this dealership's ability to meet my family's needs regarding my new car purchase.  In all interactions with Mr. Yu, he was very forthright, honest, friendly, thoughtful and represented the dealership very well.  I would highly recommend Mr. Yu.

Benzie Vachira, Accessory Specialist, was very friendly fellow; I also liked dealing with Mr Vachira.

Sherman was also very friendly and helpful.

In fact everyone I interacted with in the New Car Sales Department was a pleasure to deal with.  Used Car Sales at Gillman was another matter.

The only person I didn't quite care for at this dealership for was my initial conversation with the Used-Car Manager CJ Jackson, about the trade-in value for my Subaru.  I had initially purchased my Subaru Legacy Outback from Gillman in 2007, it only had 33,000 miles on it, was in great shape, yet Mr Jackson somehow felt that I was asking too much by simply asking for the mid-market average on NADA's website. I understand the Dealership is trying to maximize it's margin on every deal, but I found this manager's demeanor to be a bit aggressive, an Alpha-Dog style that didn't quite meet my expectations with the way I was treated by Mr Yu and his associates in the New Car sales office.  I think this gentleman should not interact with customers in the front office, perhaps a career managing the mechanics in the Service Department is a more suitable role.  The used car market is hot right now, no need to be greedy.  It was only after another Honda Dealer agreed to pay $1100 more than Mr Jackson that I was able to return to Gillman Honda and get the deal done.  Mr Jackson, you almost blew it! The new car sales folks are can do, the Used-Cars department should intern in New Cars.

Again, Mr Yu was awesome and in no way to I want to leave the impression that I am dissatisfied with my overall experience buying a new car from Gillman.  Buying a new car should be fun and it was dealing with Mr. Yu.",5.0
206,"November 15, 2011",It was a great experience and Kitt was awesome on showing me the 2012 Pilot I bought. Giving me the new features that I wasn't aware off. And the price was excellent. Will definitely buy another vehicle from Gillman. Thank you very much,5.0
207,"November 14, 2011","Lijo was a very good salesman and provided great customer service.  We shopped for our 2012 Odyssey all over Houston and Lijo offered the best price that no other dealer in the region could beat. My wife and I are parents to 17 month old twins and have another baby daughter coming in March 2012. We were in desperate need of a great minivan since our Toyota  Sequoia couldn't conveniently accommodate multiple passengers.  Lijo got us the color,  style, and quality we wanted and never pressured us to buy. I really liked his professionalism, attitude, and integrity that he represented of Gillman Honda.  We traveled across the county to purchase our vehicle and would do it again provided that Lijo is our salesman.  Lijo will forever be our New car salesman next time we need to buy a car.  All I can say in closing, &quot;Excellent! Excellent! Excellent!&quot;.  

Thanks again Lijo.

211,"November 06, 2011",I have been looking for a car for about a month now and have visited in person or on the internet 4 other Honda dealerships but Gillman in Houston was the only one that gave me the time of day and actually listened to what I wanted.  The salesman Najam Siddiqui went out of his way to accomodate my request and the way I do business.  I must admit I would not have purchased a car from him or Gillman had they been pushy or tried to tell me what I wanted.  I am very pleased with my purchase and will highly recommend the dealership but especially Najam Siddiqui. ,5.0

214,"October 31, 2011","We were referred to kit through USAA's online car search tool. After we entered our search criteria, our request was sent to a number of dealerships across the Houston area. Several responded to our request, but none were as efficient, honest, and fair as Kit was. Kit gave us a no-hassle drive-out price that beat the other dealerships and was objectively fair according to both USAA and Consumer Reports. Still, we were tempted to see if other dealers (particularly the dealer with whom we had initially test-driven the car) could beat Kit's deal. 

Those other dealers all claimed they could match Kit's deal, but we soon found out this was not at all true. Although we were very clear about the features we wanted, the other dealers were intentionally vague about what they had on the lot/ what they could get from the warehouse. While we knew we would probably not get exactly what we wanted (with dealer accessories, etc.), we at least wanted to know what was actually available so we could make an informed decision. It was impossible to get a straight answer over the phone from any of them. Kit was the only dealer who was honest and upfront with us from the very beginning; when we asked what colors he had, he told us; when we asked what options the car had, he told us. A representative at another Houston-area dealer flat-out misrepresented to us what he had available so that we would come to his dealership first. I informed that dealer that my wife was 8 months pregnant and had no interest in coming out to be shown a different car than what was described. He said he had the vehicle, so we drove out to see him. When we arrived, we discovered that, not only was the vehicle different, the drive-out price was much higher than he had agreed to on the phone. He had his manager tell us that they had the only Odysseys responsive to our request on their lot and that he would not release them to any other dealers, so we had no real choice. Good thing for us we knew Kit had what we wanted. We got up, walked out, and drove straight to Gillman. 

When we arrived, Kit exceeded all of our expectations. It was obvious that we should have gone with him from the very start. He was friendly, efficient, informative, patient, and honest. Also, he didn't say ""I told you so,"" even though he had earned the right to! 

We were also pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to secure the dealer incentive 1.0% apr financing for 60 months. We were expecting to get some kind of run-around, but we absolutely did not get one. We qualified, Kimberly gave it to us, no problem at all. 

Overall, this was the easiest, most efficient, most satisfying car-buying experience I have had (I have owned six new cars in my life). Kudos to Kit for making it so easy.

218,"October 24, 2011","I bought a 2008 VW Golf R32 which is more expensive than most of the new Honda's that they sell.  The car was not checked well during the inspection and when I was checking the car I found the front daytime driving lights did not work.  They just said that it does not affect the car driving and not to worry about it.  They also didn't know how to put the front seat back down and I had to wait about ten min for someone to figure it out.  Then it didn't have an owners manual so they couldn't figure out how to turn on the lights either.  Then there was another problem with the engine insulation hanging down when I opened the hood and they said "" don't worry about that""  Also.  Even the sales manager tried to just expain that it wasn't anything major and don't worry.  Until I insisted that he call VW to see if that would be covered by the warranty from VW.  On top of that there was only one key with the car.  Every car that I have ever bought new or used always had at least two keys with the car. Also, They didn't even offer to give us any water after we were waiting for about two hours.  I had to ask, and they told my father who drove all the way from San Antonio to take me to pick up the car to go find the drinking fountain around the corner.  All this could have been avoided if they would have check the car better during the inspection and ordered the parts ahead of time and had it fixed.  Personally I think that all cars should have the owners manual in it and if it doesn't they need to order one and have it in the car.  They even told me the VW dealer was just around the corner.  The car was on the lot for several months so they had plenty of time.  The only thing they did to fix this was give me a discount on the car.  But it would have been better if the car was right when we came to pick it up. ",2.2

Buying a car for your family + kids is a big decision, and working with someone like Raymond who knew all the safety features and convenient perks of the car put us at ease that we would be purchasing a car that was reliable and high in utility.

MORRIS POTTS has been my service advisor at Gillman Honda for a number of years, and he has always given me excellent service.  He knows the history of my vehicle, and often has been extremely helpful in helping me anticipate problems ahead of time.  He is invariably friendly and thorough, taking me back to meet the technicians so they can show me exactly what the problems are, and giving me various options about repairs.  Gillman Honda is fortunate to have Morris Potts in their employ.",5.0
225,"October 15, 2011","I bought my Honda Accord in 2001 from Gillman. Several years ago, I met Morris Potts in the service department. Morris is my person of choice when I take my car to Gillman Honda for service. I am certain he treats each of his customers the same way, but I really appreciate the way he looks at my car's service history and makes service and parts recommendations according to it's age and mileage. Because of the relatively low mileage on my car, going by the mileage alone could mean costly repairs if preventive maintenance according to the age is not closely followed. I remember a couple of years ago when Morris told me the timing belt was probably being close to needing replacement due to age. I didn't have to do it that day, but it could go without any warning and the consequences would be costly in repairs.  I was having some other work done and told him to go ahead with his recommendations. It was a good thing, because the timing belt was, in fact, very worn. I would never have thought to ask about my timing belt.

This past week, my car would not start. It is only the second time it has not started. The first time, a dead battery was the problem, so I thought it might be the battery again, but it was only 2 years old. I talked to Morris and he said he needed to have the car to check out everything, not just the battery. I called the towing service at Gillman, and they were at my house that evening, within 30 minutes, to pick up the car. I told the driver to be sure Morris Potts handled the service. Morris called me in the morning to touch base, and he called again in the afternoon to say my car was ready. The problem had been the battery, which was replaced at no charge. Because of the battery's warranty, there was also no charge for the tow truck.

I trust Morris Potts' advice and the service department's excellent team to maintain my vehicle in safe condition. My advice to ladies who may read this is to find someone at a dealership you can trust to give you good advice when you take your car to be serviced.

Good value for money when buying both new and used car.

229,"October 09, 2011","This was the greatest car buying experience I've ever had. I did all of my negotiations online. Lijo was awesome. He was very attentive and responded to my messages promptly. I drove from Austin to Houston to purchase my car. When I arrived, all of my paperwork was ready to be signed and I was in and out within an hour. My car has been detailed and ready to be driven before my arrival.  

I already had my vehicle appraised at another dealership and was so disappointed that I went to Car Max to see if I could get a better value on my car, which was a 2003 Honda Accord Coupe. Gillman accepted my Car Max appraisal and that pretty much sealed the deal for me. My finance manager Moe was also great to work with. He explained everything to me and made to finance portion very easy.  

I have purchased vehicles before but this was by far the best experience.  I am a Honda fanatic so I am sure when it is time for my next vehicle, I'll be right back at Gillman to be taken care of.  Thanks Gillman!!!",5.0

238,"September 21, 2011","Having purchased many cars, trucks and vans from many dealerships over the past 30 years, this experience is the icing on the cake.  Mr. Kitt Kanya is the most professional internet sales manager in the Houston and surrouding market. I took a different approach in buying my Honda through the internet. Having contacted all dealerships and receiving all internet sales quotes back, I called two back that there pricing were very close but the experience between both was night and day. The other dealership sent a quote but did not honored their quote as their fine print reads that they can add dealer accessories which will not reflex the final price. So why shop the internet if the price they quote is not the final price. Well come to find out most dealerships do that just to get you in the door. No so with Gillman! Not only did I call to confirm but they had exactly what I was looking for. Model, Color, and options etc. Other dealerships were trying to sell me what I was not looking for. They claimed they had what I was looking for but just another tactic to get you to there store. No so with Gillman! They honored the price! Had exactly what I was looking for! Kitt Kanya, Internet Manager was experienced and new his product very well from A-Z. Test drove,explained every detail above the van and we were in and out of there in a timely manner. Financing and Services offered at the dealership was explained in detail also. I never write reviews because they never meet my expectations. No so with Gillman and Mr. Kitt Kanya. They earned it and well deserve a positive review. Thanks from my family and I.  Ignacio     ",5.0

So next up come this other guy (Asian) and tell me that they had to charge me $107 to diagnose the problem because my alarm was tampered wit, in other words saying I put I aftermarket alarm, which I didn't.( they thought I did cus in my key chain I had my garage remote to open it). Last thing that ticked me off was when they said we are not gonna wash your car. First of all I wasn't expecting one or wanted one. When everything was done and over(I didn't pay the 107 cus they didn't took the time to look that I hadn't a extended warranty) he had the nerves to tell me that gillman was gonna call me and ask for a customer survey and to make sure I give them all 5 stars?

The test-drive experience was easy and effective - minimal paper work, friendly introduction of the vehicle and a heads-up of the whole purchase process.

258,"August 22, 2011","I had a 2004 Hoda Odyessy that I bought from them brand new. I had multiple electical issues too many to even list, they misdiagnosed multiple issues, charged me $800 to replace my starter but the last straw was when the transmission went out not once, but twice. They replaced it the first time under the extended warranty at 45,000 miles, then it went out again 4 years later with 99000 miles. I explained that I thought Honda was a repiltable company that would stand behind there product...I sure was mistaken. There only rebutle was to offer to replace the transmission for just 2450 since I was such a good customer. If you were a bad customer if there is such a thing they want 6K even thogh the mini van is only worth 6K with a good transmission. After researching to see if other people have experienced similar issues I found out that Honda lost a class action law suit for 90 million already due to selling faulty transmissions. Apparently they didn't learn there lesson. I found 100's of owners that have or had my particualr year have experienced the exact same problems. The original transmission they sold for my year model is faulty and they never even changed the design flaw, so the one they replaced it with and wanted to replace it with again are also faulty. I will never ever but another Honda again and I also plan on taking legal action against them. Do yourself a favor and don't buy a Honda.

281,"July 20, 2011","Car shopping alone as a single young woman, I was mentally prepared to stand up for myself, in case any salesman should try fast-talking me into a car that was not in my best interest. This preparation was completely warranted based on my experience at Gillman. 

More than once I was encouraged to consider a vehicle (Fit) which in my opinion was worlds apart from what I expressed interest in buying (Civic Coupe). The value of my trade-in was low balled (based on KBB value as well as current Car Max appraisals). I was pressured to agree on a price before I could be informed what interest rate I would qualify for.  Even before sitting down to deal, the salesperson seemed bored and somewhat annoyed to walk around the dealership to show me the specific model I asked about. When I found the selection of cars on hand to be insufficient, it was suggested that I place a $500 deposit allowing the dealership to locate a more suitable vehicle.

I understand that the salesmen may not be in control of what inventory they have on a given day. However, I resented being shown colors, styles, even models I had no interest in, rather than being given a straight answer: ""We don't have what you're looking for."" I was also irritated to be given the line ""We would never pressure you into a car that you don't want to buy"" followed immediately by a barrage of questions making it difficult for me to get up and walk away from the table. Although their manners were passable and their lines industry standard I'm sure, I was unimpressed and uncomfortable with the sales staff at Gillman Honda.",3.3

It is rare when you can really say someone had a pleasant experience while buying a new car, traditionally it is a tedious, stressful ordeal akin to having teeth pulled. But this time I can honestly say I am happy with my car, and the buying process.
 The salesperson Siddiqui was very patient and helpful from the very first moment, and little by little I let my guard down and just let him do his job..I didn't have any long waits, arguments or unpleasant surprises. I am positive I would buy another car and/or recomment Gillman and Mr Siddiqui to anyone looking for a new car, Siddiqui is not only knowledgeable, but respectful and easy to talk to, he will go out of his way to help the customer and make them feel at ease.
As far as management I  dealt with MR Ghazi and MR Peasley whom were both extremely helpful and friendly, I ended up spending a little more than I had planned, but didn't mind it too much because of the people at Gillman.
I have bought many cars in my lifetime, who knows 15-20 just like anayone my age but this is one of the few times if not the only one, I didn't suffer spending money.

He listened and worked really hard to get my deal going. He was understanding and I felt bad that once the deal hit Finance. Lawrence's manager, Marcus (I think that was his name) had him running back and forth and making things really difficult for me. Can I put down this? Can I get my husband to co-sign? Asking questions, assuming there was a reason behind me not wanting to add my husband. I am 30 already and wanted my own car finally. Lawrence didn't question, just understood and respected it, wanted to get the deal going, end of story. I understand you try to make the most money off of a sale but I think I was overly frustrated and even Lawrence was. Lawrence and I were told the deal could not happen but when Moe in Finance found out he told Lawrence that was not true and of course the deal I wanted initially worked out. I nearly walked. I did walk actually but came back to talk to Lawrence again, I am glad I did. If the process went from Lawrence to Moe it would have been the smoothest experience ever. I am not going to let one person ruin the name though-Honda was a great place to purchase my 1st car from! I will go back as soon as I am ready for a new car back to Lawrence. He was so helpful and so patient and didn't question my silly requests.

315,"June 01, 2011","Out of 3 cars , this was my second honda buying from Gillman this memorial day weekend. What I like most about them is their excellant and extra ordinary customer service especially Marisa Hernandez would go beyond her service. She will try to help you out as much as she can from every other side so that customer could be happy and save money at the same time. She is the most caring sales consultant and advisor, I have ever seen. I am very pleased with her service. Good Customer Service really makes a difference. She is patience and caring for her customer. Because of her service it didn't take me long to make a quick and easy decision on buying the car I have always dreamt about. Going to Gillman I feel like I am visiting my relatives. I have been driving honda all throughout my life. Now we are planning to buy another one soon from Gillman.",5.0

318,"May 30, 2011","Mr.Najam Siddiqui was absolutely wonderful to me and my husband.  Treated us with respect from the first moment we met him on the car lot.

Saddiqui was straight up and honest, didn't play games with us.  That alone impressed us.

Mr. Saddiqui is an asset to your dealership.  I vote for him to get a substantial pay increase...SMILE

Also, Michael Peasley, the finance person and the gentleman that showed us the accessories and programmed my cell phone were also pleasant to deal with and nice to us.

All of them had a great sense of humor and made our experience at Gillman a memoriable one.

I did not have to meet him in person to make the deal. My contact with him was mostly by email and when I call, he answered the call and was very courteous and friendly.

324,"May 17, 2011","We've always gone to Gillman for our cars. I love the customer service and the friendly environment that you feel when your there. The only thing that could have been fixed is the pricing on the car. There was barely any room for negotiation due to the Japan crisis and the hold on production of cars at the time of purchase, although I do understand that in a few months other are going to be able to go and price the car lower because the availability will be better but thats ok. I love my new car and Donald was very patient with finding the right car for me. We went through several cars and specials and deals for the past 2 weeks with calls and emails he was very on top of things and was ready to help with any changes or change of mind on a car that I had. All in all great place to shop for a car! ",4.6

On the other hand, Gillman Honda has given me a brand new 2011 four door for a better and lower price, and the color was awesome. I left the dealership satisfied. I thank God, because the experience and the car has been a blessing. Yes, I would definetly recommend this dealership to anyone who is looking to buy a Honda. :)",5.0

330,"May 11, 2011","After having spent the previous 3 months in the selection process for my new replacement vehicle we decided on the Honda Odyssey.  Initially worked with another Honda dealer in Houston who made the deal sound good but when it came time to make the deal they added $2K to the price of the vehicle.  I called Gillman Honda and they had the exact same model, trim and color in stock.  They beat the price of the other dealer and honored their price when I arrived at the dealership.  No hassles, good people to work with and nice facility.  I had quite a few add-on accessories installed also and they did a wonderful job getting that all done within one day.  Vehicle was delivered on-time the next day as promised.  The next day I noticed one of my newly installed fog lights was cracked. Their accessories manager, Ms. Germany, took care of it immediately no questions asked and now we are happy campers!",5.0
331,"May 10, 2011","Let me begin that this was my first time purchasing a brand new vehicle but I had to make that step in life despite my nervousness. The staff at Gillman Honda was SUPERB. Let me begin.

Marisa Hernandez (Sales Consultant) welcomed me with open arms, showed to the car I wanted and made my time with Gillman great. She knew was she was doing but more importantly, she did not feel like a salesperson to me, but an old friend. I trusted her in whatever she said... not because of her knowledge but because she was able to relate with me and have that connection. She let me test drive the car (2012 Honda Civic). I remember joking with her from time to time, it was a great environment. In the end I believe the strongest Sales Consultant that Gillman Honda has is Marisa Hernandez. Honestly, if it was not for her, I most likely would have not bought a car within 2 days. So if you are reading this Marisa, THANK YOU!

The next person that made an impact was Sal Ghazi (Sales Manager). I did not get to talk to him much, but when I did I immediately trusted him. He was very nice and professional and kept things simple. I remember in the end of my purchase there was an error on my final contract for the car (No ones fault, just a misunderstanding). Marisa and Sal immediately took action and corrected the problem for me.

Benzie Vachira (Accessory Specialist) was also a pleasure meeting. I wanted to add a few things to my car and Marisa informed me that Benzie was the guy to talk to... she sure wasn't wrong. Benzie let me know that all the parts were not available and informed me of everything that was going to happen and how long the installation would take, etc. On my second day at Gillman Honda, I ran into Benzie again and (this is what impressed me) he just came up to me and started talking. To me, that was great. This let me know that he was there for my best interest and not to just rack up the price of the car.

Next we have Asim Zamir (Finance Manager). Asim was great by all means. I informed him that I would be asking him many questions since this would be the first time I would be buying a car. He welcomed the questions with open arms, letting me know to ask as many as I wanted. Asim never once made me feel pressured, he keep letting me know that all he was doing was advising me, not telling me what to do. In the end Asim and I discussed a few things regarding my contract, and it was great. He informed me of every possible detail and for that, I will always be grateful.

Last person we have is Tim! I'm not sure what department he was in, but he was one of the last people to talk to me in reguards to my insurance policy on the brand new car. Tim is full of life, he made my final moments at Gillman Honda hilarious. We joked around, while figuring out the insurance policy. Tim is a great person, he introduced me to the maintenance team, showed me what to do when I got my oil changed, informed me when my plates would come in and so much more! Tim is a great asset to Gillman Honda.

These people are a huge asset at Gillman. If you are ever interested in buying a new car (or even used!) the people above are the people you want to contact and deal with. No one else.",5.0

He's very  helpful and informative, and catered to the type of car I wanted to get. He knew I was a graduate student and needed an affordable car. He also made an extra effort to sell a car to me that was put on hold so I really appreciated that. When we negotiated the price of my new car, he already knew my budget and the range I was willing to pay so I was glad he didn't try to push me to pay for a lot more than what I was willing to pay and it didn't take too long to settle together on a price we can both agree on. He definitely took take care of me throughout the whole process of purchasing my car as a first time buyer. ",5.0
347,"April 20, 2011","I am very pleased and satisfied with the service given to me when I purchased my 2011 Honda Odyssey from Mr. Robert Doolittle, Fleet Manager at Gillman Honda Sam Houston Pkwy through the American Express Auto Purchasing Program.  Through this program, I showed my initial interest in purchasing a new minivan, such as the Odyssey, the Sienna, and the Sedona in the greater Houston area.  AMEX gave me its Price Protection Certificate for each type of vehicle and a target price to negotiate for when I contact the AMEX-referred dealers in my area.  I immediately received various emails and phone calls from these dealers who gave me their own Internet Price quote (based on the MSRP) for the vehicle I was considering.  

To make a long story short, Mr. Doolittle’s professionalism, sincerity, and experience clearly came through from the initial email I received from him.   As I learned more about the way each dealer tried to get me to buy from him and what my wife and I wanted in terms of a new minivan, I was able to focus my car search to just the Honda Odyssey.   Moreover, when I saw that one dealer’s initial Internet Price quote for the Odyssey seemed to be the best deal but really was not because of the necessary sales tax, documentary fee, title fee, license plate, inspection fee, full deputy fee, and dealer’s inventory tax, the “drive-out price” that Mr. Doolittle initially emailed to me from the get-go was the clincher.  Robert sticks to his word and won’t try to justify adding some other fee that wasn’t originally quoted.   He may even absorb a loss in return for referrals and repeat customers.   I only had to go to the Gillman dealer once to meet Mr. Doolittle, do all the paperwork, and drive out with my new Odyssey.  

I highly recommend to any car purchaser who uses the AMEX Auto Purchasing Program to 1) know what you want, 2) pay attention to how the dealers initially communicate with you, 3) show real interest, 4) do your homework, and 5) make the dealers give you their final “drive-out” price for the vehicle you are considering.  Also, remember that there is never any pressure for the customer to purchase within any given amount of time.  You can always decide to postpone your purchase and do the whole process of soliciting quotes again any time in the future.  Keep good records of price quotes on paper.  

If you are in the Houston area and a Honda is one of your options, then I highly recommend Mr. Doolittle.  He will make your car buying experience exceptional and worry-free.  I am 100% confident I did everything the right way for this purchase.

However, during financial process, I found it was not a good deal after all. Using scare tactics with my credit score, they would not approve me with .9% interest as advertised. The approved rate by Honda Financial is 3.9%. The consultant then worked on the monthly payments with 3.9%, came up $440 a month (without discussing for whatever reasons).  After 1 financial consultant, the second consultant again talked about monthy payments, $400 then 380 a month, again without the breakdowns. The third consultant came. He tells me I must buy 100k protection and gap insurance to get approve for .9%. That means that I must spend $1600 more to get the .9%. That is after I went home figured all out.
But after all, my inexperience with interest rate have prevented me from making a good decision. .9% costs extra $350 from negotiate price for 5 yrs. 3.9% costs extra 380. The different is $30 for 5 years.

They wouldn't give it to me.  But I was almost forced to test drive the car (they do it so the potential buyer will develop an emotional attachment to the car).  Didn't work.

Still won't show me anything in writing.  Now almost 3 hours into the visit.  9PM exhausted.  Told them I was leaving.  Then finally printed the contract.  He took the contract off the printer and tore off the top page and folded it and placed it on the other side of the desk.  I asked why he removed the top sheet. ""Oh, that goes to the bank.""  

""Can I see it?"" 

""See what?""

""The page you tore off my contract.""

It was turning into a bad comedy.  Eventually he gave it to me.  I compared pages.  The page showed a more comprehensive breakdown of my fees that didn't show up on the page I was offered:

ENHANCEMENT FEE $1,300.  What is that? I asked.  

""Oh, that for the 3 years oil change you requested.""  Really, so much for free.  Also wouldn't disclose the APR.  Tacked on all kinds of other fees.  Felt so slimy I walked out of the place disgusted.  Then they have the nerve to run after my car with his ""sales manager"".  Saying they'd drop the fees.  Whatever.  Wasn't going to waste another 3 hours of my time with the sleezebags. ",1.0

If there were more Automotive Salespeople like him, buying/leasing a new vehicle wouldn't be such a stressful event.  Although dealerships ""claim"" they try to make it an enjoyable experience, Andrian Loskot and Gillman Honda Southwest made that a reality for me and my family.  It is also worth noting than even a good experience can turn sour when working with the dealership's Finance Department.  That was not the case at Gillman Honda Southwest.  Going through our paperwork with Kimberly Williams was also smooth and easy.  Thank you very much for making our car buying experience enoyable.

384,"March 15, 2011","My experience with the sales guys was outstanding. They were very responsive, helpful and courteous.  Both Kit and Nang (not sure of spelling, mgr of internet sales) were great guys and i would be happy to buy from them again.

However, I was VERY unhappy with your finance dept.  The lady that worked with me assumed that I was an idiot and, withour informing me, added a bunch of finance insurance (Gap insurance, life insurance, etc) to my transaction!  She tried to rush me through the process and tried to make me feel like I was an idiot for asking questions about her deceit.  A direct quote of our conversation:

Me:  It says in this disclosure that I am paying for this gap insurance, is this correct?

Her:  It is included as part of your loan.

Technically this is not a lie (the cost of the insurance was ADDED to the loan amount!) but this was definitely deceitful.  She knew that I was asking if this was coming out of my pocket and she gave me the clear impression that the cost of the insurance was included in the Honda financing program.  It was only upon further, and much more direct questioning that she admitted that it was being ADDED to the loan amount.  When I caught her she had no choice but to tear up the already completed paperwork and start over!

I also found the 'Documentary fee' to be a bunch of crap - this is another cheat but it wasn't worth arguing.  I decided to let it go but I was unhappy with this fee.

My impression of your sales guys was great.  They gave me a good price, made good on their promises and addressed all of my issues.  But, my experience in the post-sales process was terrible.  I feel that the finance department deceived me and tried to trick me into buying things they knew I did not want.  It was a deceitful process by a person who was clearly trying to cheat me.

This is the second car I have purchased from Gillman but the next time I want to buy a Honda I will go elsewhere.

386,"March 10, 2011","Wow!  Where to start?  God is so good!  I started my search for a vehicle over a year ago and just had not found the right sales persons that I felt would be honest, have pride in delivering a quality product, and see me as a person first, then customer.  My sister purchased her vehicle with Gillman and suggested I go there since her experience, in her words, was ""awesome.""  I did nto know where they were located and she said, ""Off Southwest Freeway, you can't miss them because the dealership is lit like a ""halo.""  I thought this odd until I met Emilio, Tim Chow, and Sal Ghazi.  These men represent what every dealership should have their salesmen aspire to be as ambassadors for Honda.  I mulled over my decision for my own personal reasons, however, Emilio was very persistent in calling me and not to the point of agitation, but with a followup that made me feel that he really wanted to make a deal that would help me in my decision-making.  Most dealerships I have encountered only have you meet the Managers after you say no or have sealed the deal.  Not at GILLMAN!!  You meet them upfront and not as a pressure tactic, but to let you know that you are a valued customer and anywhere in the process you can call either of them to ask questions.  I received all their cell phone numbers (including that of the Sales Manager, Sal Ghazzi) and I especially appreciate the attentiveness, level of being thorough, and openness demonstrated every step of the way.  Now, I would be remiss if I did not tell you that I especially liked the business ethics, professionalism, and human touch and kindness as a Christian from Tim Chow.  Being a Christian myself, I knew that if this deal was not right, God would not allow it to happen.  I received Tim's customer service as ABOVE AND BEYOND, all the way down to my drive-off in my new car last night.  Emilio and Tim walked through this process with me and I appreciate the deal that I was given.  I chose outside financing only because I had an established relationship with my bank, but don't think for a moment that I would not have considered Honda financing, because I believe that they would have been very fair.  I did purchase other options that I could have done commercially, however, I chose have Gillman do the work because I know their craftsmanship will be the same as their customer service, ""PRISTINE!""  I am happy with my purchase highly recommend everyone that have never purchased a vehicle or looking to buy another to first - go to GILLMAN, second - look up my salesmen and the Manager, and third - DRIVE AWAY A WINNER!!!   God Be The Glory!!  Thank you GILLMAN.  I will continue to deal with you ALL.",5.0

I went to several other dealers before Gillman and had people try and take advantage of my naivety. I walked in late on a Monday night and met Smiley. He was absolutely wonderful. We didn't even look at cars that first night. We just came and talked to him about the financing and what it would take. He was never pushy, and answered every question my boyfriend and I had. He was exceptionally honest, which I appreciated. And he spent quite a bit of time talking things over with us, even though we hadn't committed to a vehicle yet. And when we did decide to go that route, he was quick to get the ball rolling. Throughout it the sale, he was prompt at staying in touch with me and keeping me in the loop.

I live close to Gillman Honda so one day, I stopped by at night and tried getting some price information. After Zhao learned that I was a serious buyer and had been looking for a new car for a while, we went to the price negociation immediately, which was a smart decision from him. Zhao was willing to make a concession on the price and I finally bought Odyssey within my budget.

Zhao looks very professional and is an experienced sales consultant. He tried his best to answer all my questions concisely and correctly. He never misled me during our negociation. 

I will definitely buy the second car from him later on.

The experience of buying an automobile is not one that my wife and I enjoy.  Besides the stress of having to agree on which car, which model, which color, which features, etc, the treatment we receive at car dealerships has often been less than professional.

This time I decided to solicit prices via E-mail from Honda dealers in the Houston area.  I filled out the “Quick Quote” form on your website and your Mr. Raymond Yu had a response in my E-mail Inbox the next day.  It was a complete quotation, showing all pricing, just as I had requested.  I sent him an E-mail with a few questions regarding his offering, to which he responded within an hour.  We arrived at your dealership at 9:30 AM and I was driving my new Accord off your lot by 11:15 AM.

I found Mr. Yu to be very businesslike and professional in his dealings with me as a customer.  He was very accommodating and expedited the clean up and prep of the car.

This was one of the most pleasurable car buying experiences we have ever had.  The treatment we received, as customers, by your Mr. Yu is a credit to your dealership.  I have already mentioned, to several friends, the good experience we had with your dealership and will continue to do so in the future.

450,"December 21, 2010","I was shopping for a CR-V via internet sale depts at various dealerships in Houston. CJ at Gillman Honda addressed my concerns and price range with no hidden fees or long speeches about how other dealerships try to charge hidden accessories and such. Also, when I shop for vehicles through my email, I prefer that none of the dealerships call me and just email me their responses. CJ was the only person who actually respected my wishes regarding how to contact me if he had questions or concerns for the vehicle. All the other dealerships called me and kept me on the phone for about 1 hour each time telling me all kinds of things I did not want to discuss over the phone. 
CJ was straightforward and quoted me a drive out price after two email exchanges and when we went to the dealership to get everything settled, we test drove without any pressure or concerns, and got out of the dealership in about 2 hours (which is quite a plus for us since we have spent sometimes 4-6 hours in other dealerships). Additionally, we ended up seeing some scratches on the tint of the back of the CR-V rear window prior to us driving out of the lot...CJ told us to come back the following week to get it repaired free of charge (their service dept was closed by the time we finished purchasing the vehicle). When we came back the following week, it was quick, efficient, and no hassle. We were very pleased with the no hassle philosophy of the dealership and CJ. 
Another item that always makes me decide on whether to go back to a dealership or not is the follow up regarding the license plate. Most of the dealerships we purchased vehicles from do not follow up regarding the receipt of the license plate. Gillman was different...they called me and sent a letter to inform me that the license plate is ready for pick up. I definitely recommend this dealership!",4.4

It is safe to say that we are in good hands at Gillman Honda and that should be every customers motive and feeling that they will get when they walk in.   Please convey our regards to all staff members especially to Mr. Ghazi, Mr. Johnny, Mr. Asim, etc.  I do not have Mr. Gillman's contact info, so please forward this if possible.

 

I will be there tomorrow by 2pm to have the pinstripe applied on the Pilot, please let me know if they are any changes of plans.  As for the survey, you will get nothing but good remarks and constructive, positive feedback from us.

The sales person who sold it to us told us if we had any issues we can always go back to him and he'd help us, but after driving it off the lot we started hearing some sounds coming from the car. We took it back to the same sales person and we left our car with him for a few hours. After getting it back, we still heard the same sound. We took it back and this time left it there for a whole day. Then we told him we were stll hearing the same sound and he said it was just bad luck, but it was a completely new car. We took it to maintenance ourselves and the people there were able to fix it and the sound was gone. This sales person didn't care to look thoroughly enough to find the issue so we had to do it ourselves even though the warranty states that all of these things were covered. BUT this time around we went to Suman and Johnny and they treated us well. They were respectful towards us and tried to work with us to give us the best price they possibly could give us.

As an employee, he reasonablly upholds Gillman Honda's policy and interests; as a friend and a human being, he has been very friendly, very truthful and very helpful to customers. I must say he is a trouble shooter and makes everybody happy to accept the final result.
That's why I went to Gillman Honda Southwest and bought Honda Pilot on April 28, 2009, and Honda Accord on December 20, 2010, both with great help from Raymond. That's why, During the past two years, I introduced my friends and colleagues to Gillman Honda and contact with Raymond.

I have been extemely satisfied with all services received from Gillman Honda Southwest, and give them my highest rating and regards for their handling of the matter.

We had to special order the vehicle and we were updated on the shipping status regularly and it arrived before the expected date.  An absolutely beautiful vehicle.  When we picked it up, we were given a tutorial on how to use all the features.  Bao was so patient and went through everything with us and made sure that we understood everything, thanks Bao.  It's amazing how much time the entire staff spent with us and everyone assured us that they would be available if we had any questions, concerns or needed assistance with anything.  I have never before had such a pleasurable experience buying a vehicle.  There was never any pressure while we were looking for the vehicle, the salesmen were very honest and Kimberly went through all the paperwork making sure that we had been informed of everything.  Stacy and Mike were amazing and made sure that we were kept updated about the shipping. 

We will recommend this dealership to all our family and friends.  We have given the highest rating across the board for this dealership as we felt like we were dealing with family and are we are so grateful for everyone's help and assistance.

487,"November 09, 2010","My husband and I bought a CRV from this dealership last night.  We had an EXCELLENT experience.  Everyone was friendly, kind, honest and made the experience very positive.  I have NEVER had that experience with a car dealer before.  I would recommend this dealership to ANYONE that wants the kind of car buying experience you dream of and never get.  Everyone was honest and up front.  Nang and Kitt worked together on sales.  As a matter of fact we followed Nang from another dealership in town after meeting him only once a few days earlier because our first impression of him was so positive.   Moe in finance was patient and ran through as many scenarios as we wanted.  He gave us solid advice and made sure we understood how the numbers ""ticked and tied"".  And that we understood how much interest we were paying for the life of the vehicle.

Incidentally, a few months ago we helped my parents buy a CRV from Goodson Honda West and that experience was the exact opposite.  At the 11th hour the paperwork was showing hidden costs for things we didn't want - like $250 for some paint protector that they refused to remove from the quote so they ended up reducing the price of the car.  They were aggressive and used the stalling technique to wear us down.  We got the EXACT same car but the price was a lot less (part of that was the time of the year and incentives but I know we still got a better deal).  After the experience at Goodson I was not looking forward to this experience but it was fantastic.  I only wish I had another Honda to buy.  This dealership is GREAT!  When you go ask for Nang and Kitt in sales and Moe in finance.  You won't regret it!!

500,"August 15, 2010","I inherited a 1994 Honda Accord from my mother. The ironic part is that this 94 Accord was my wife's first car before we got married in 1995. When the lease came due on it, my mom decided to buy it from us for the remainder of the lease. My mom got sick and wanted me to have the car back. It has 130K miles on it, but I needed something to get me to the Park & Ride.

I was driving my Accord on 288 north on a Saturday afternoon, when the engine started racing, but I was getting no forward power. I quickly put it neutral and pulled over. A Safe Clear tow truck saw that I was leaking fluid. I had not performed any service on the Accord, and had not chosen a service location. I had done some research, and found out Gillman Honda had a very goood BBB rating, which is important to me. My problem is that I live in Pearland, and Gillman is in Sugarland. I chose them to and I'm glad I did. Their service department was open on a Saturday which was fantastic. I could actually talk to someone and describe what happened. When we got there, I was met by Shang Shahriari. He took my information, and informed me that it was near closing time. He also told me about the diagnostic fees up front, and that it would be applied to the final bill. They would be able to look at it first thing on Monday, and he would call me Monday afternoon with what needed to be fixed.

As promised on Monday afternoon, he gave me the news about the repairs. I also told him that I didn't want to sink a lot of money into the car, due to it's age. Shang acknowledged this, these repairs were needed in order to determine if further work was done. On Tuesday afternoon, he called to say that the initial repairs seem to be all that is required,and I could pick up the car. However, this is where Gillman stepped up.

During this same time, My father was going through cancer treatment at MD Anderson. The hospital called on that same Tuesday, to inform us that my father was being discharged into Hospice home care. So that meant I had to make a 9 hour trip back to Oklahoma to be with my Dad. When I got this news, I had a lot of other business to take care of, and knew I was going to be away for about 2 weeks. On Wednesday I called Shang to tell him I would not be able to pick up my car since I was leaving the following morning. Before calling him, I had visions that the dealership would say ""Oh I'm sorry, but we can't hold on to your car because we're not covered for that"", or ""Sure we can hold your car..... for an extra 20 dollars a day storage fee"". That is what I was expecting. But what I got from Shang was ""Sure no problem. Let us know when you get back in town, and we'll have it ready. Hope your Dad is feeling better""

To be perfectly honest that is exactly what I wanted to hear. I did not {and could not} want to be thinking about my car. I wanted to be thinking about my Dad, and that is what Shang and Gillman Honda provided for me. While I was in Oklahoma, my Dad finally succumbed to cancer, so I had to be up there for the funeral. 

Eventually I was able to pick up my car. They were great about having it ready. The price was exactly as was quoted to me before I left. They also provided a list of recommended service that should be considered in the future. The car has been running great. 

Just because of the way I was treated, I will be bringing back my Honda to Gillman for future service. It is worth the trip just for the customer service. I would recommend them to anybody.",4.6

510,"November 29, 2009","If you want a 1950s-style buying experience, then Gilman Honda is the place for you! You can enjoy being the recipient of a textbook-prescribed sales pitch! 

Our salesman, Mr. Okoroji, was cordial and polite, so I believe that my experience illuminates a top-down philosophy.

#1 Establish a rapport with the customer.
I believe Mr. Okoroji's good manners were genuine.

However, that was the last connection. In spite of the information I provided, he launched into the total sales technique (that I believe he had been trained/required to follow.)

#2 Talk talk talk about the resale value.
(That's only good if you sell it back with rather low mileage, but I drive my cars forever... and I've had 2 Hondas... one traded for $400; the other for $1800).
#3 Try to get the cusomer excited about a paint color.
(I'm not excited about parting with over $20,000 for any color.)
#4 Take it for a test drive
(Drives good; it's a Honda; did I mention I've had 2 Hondas?)
#5 Try to get the customer to take the car home overnight
(I don't want to drive it home if I'm not going to buy it.)
#6 Try to create a sense of urgency: I can only offer you this price today; Honda could increase it.
(I'm not going to make a $20,000+ decision on the spur of the moment.)
#7 Use phraseology such as ""your car"" to make the customer feel connected.
(Obvious ploy; doesn't work.)
#8 Ask the customer ""how much do you want for your trade in?
(You know what? I can subtract. I want to know what the bottom line will be.)

Then they took my car to evaluate it, and came back with a final offer that was pretty much the MSRP before dealer added options.
(Oh. Really.)
(Why does it take so LONG for the salesman to come back from the sales manager's office with ""nuthin""? I truly wonder what they're all doing back there.)

My face: clearly disappointed at the offer.
#9 Repeat previous steps: resale value, take the car overnight, urgency
(Oh, would you LOOK at the time? Better be going now...)

#10 Ask the customer what it will take to get you in the car
(Oh, gosh, it would have been a better offer, but this has taken at least an hour and I need to go now...)

I'm a hostage though; they still have my car keys from evaluating the trade in value, so NOW:
#11 The manager comes out to shake my hand, and ""try to make things right."" 
(No, thanks; I've had enough and it's time for me to go.)

Finally, I'm out of there.

#12 The salesman calls me at home this week. 
(I suspect they make him do that, so I ask him not to call me again, please...)

So, after that
#13 The MANAGER calls me at home!
(Grr.) 

Again, my salesman was cordial and polite. I believe this is a dealer strategy, and that my salesman was operating without choice).

BTW, I WAS able to purchase a car elsewhere within a week of this experience. I received a better value dealer offer and after that, also a higher trade in value.",2.7
511,"April 26, 2009","When I first came to the dealership it was in response to a car add they had posted on a website.  I went into the dealership and was greeted very nicely by a salesman. I was told that he wasn't aware of the car in the inventory but he's check.  A few minutes later he came back and said it just came in and he can show me, it was in one of the other gillman dealerships next door. He asked me how much the internet price said the car was (an audi TT) I told him 15,900 is the list price.  He said that the price couldn't go any lower and that we could not negotiate it any lower.

After viewing it I noticed the car had some minor back-end damage, he said they would fix it and I could come back and look at it in a few days or he could call me to come back and see it although I did not give out my number.  I did come back and decided to go through with the deal.  I checked online before going back to the dealer and sure enough within the 1 day between when I originally saw it and the day I decided to go back the price had dropped nearly 1000 dollars!!  (and it couldnt get any lower?)  The sales manager and financing manager we worked with were great. They were both kind and courteous, and they really made me feel like they were working to get me the best deal. Even after the 1 day price drop, the sales manager even came down on the price a bit more to accomodate me. The whole process took about 3 hours at the dealer, from test-drive to financing.. we did a lot of waiting.

They were very nice and tried to work out the best deal.  They told me to take the car home for the night and bring it back the next day while they work on getting the best finance rate for the car. That was possible the best thing they could have done for me.  I drove the car the next day and disliked it greatly. I also found that the back tail lights of the car would stay on even when the car was turned off, draining the battery.  Knowing this was a problem I took the car back and told them I did not want to take the car but would be delighted to choose something else from the lot.

I came back on a saturday when the dealership seemed busy, but my salesman wasn't. I think between me not taking a malfunctioning used car and the rush of new potential buyers made him feel like I wasn't worth his time as he seemed to be avoiding me.  I did find 2 other cars I was interested in, but after looking for my salesman for an hour we were greeted by a number of eager salesman.  As we were being helped by another salesman, our first salesman came up to me and told me he already had a working file with all of my financing and that I should continue to work through him.  

After test driving a lancer and deciding I didn't like that either I had one more car to see, and my salesman had abandoned me once more.  He called me after I left the dealership to check on me, but I didn't actually speak with him. I called him back and told him about the other car I was interested in.. the price I would like to spend on it, and if he could work the deal out and let me know and I would come back and as long as the car checks out I would buy it.  He told me that I could wait for monday or go with the other salesman that helped us before and see what deal he could make for us.

I got a lot of mixed feelings and I have yet to finalize a purchase... I'm considering going to another dealership, but the car I want is at this one...  If the salesman I was originally working with had just given us his attention for an hour he may have had a quick sale. Instead I now have to wait 2 days before I can purchase the car or go with another salesman at the gillman subaru dealership and have him rebuild my file, recheck my credit, etc. A big hassle.  Also today I was approached by a lady rudely asking questions to me.

When I asked why she needed them and that we already had a salesman she said ""This is for the General Manager"" ... that doesn't explain anything..... and the attitude could be left at home, I wouldn't mind giving you information if you explained yourself and had people skills.

Also, for curiosity sake I checked up on the audi TT with the malfunctioning tail lights just to see if service ever got it fixed.. sure enough the car was still in service.  I don't know if its good that its in service and not on the sales lot, or bad because its been over 24 hours and service couldn't fix the problem?  ",3.0
512,"July 03, 2006","I did not end up buying the Honda, solely becuase of a family discount with another maker, but it was a very tough choice.  The options and pricing on the Accord seemed great, but what impressed me most was how friendly and helpful the salesman, JP (John Paul), was.  He answered all my questions, even when I came back the second time, but wasn't pushy at all.  I definitely recommend Gillman - and JP - to anyone in the market for a Honda!",5.0
