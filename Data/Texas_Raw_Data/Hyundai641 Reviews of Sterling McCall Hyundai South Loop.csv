0,"May 16, 2020","Really one star is to much for these people. After purchasing my vehicle I was told that they would have to send me home with a loaner. It took weeks before they even would get back to me on the progress of my vehicle. I had to pick vehicle up and did not even make it home before check engine light came on again. These people are rude, never call back, and difficult to work with. They also lie. They said my newly purchased vehicle passed inspection on the day I picked it up. Same day it was having issues and engine light on so I took it to a mechanic who put it on diagnostic machine and told me there was no way it just passed. Now I am making payments on a car I have not been able to drive and can't drive until I get it fixed. ",1.0
1,"February 01, 2020","I love this team. They are courteous, prompt, and have shuttle service. Typically, about a 6 hour turnaround when dropping off. Convenient location for the Houston Med Center",4.6

3,"January 24, 2020","I was planning to take my car for its regularly scheduled service and a light appeared on my dashboard.  I stopped by after work and talked to one service person who was obviously tired and ready to go home.  He shared every reason why I couldn't get service that day and may ""have to wait for a while because there was a car that had been in their shop for 2 weeks.""  I tried to remain positive and opted to go online to schedule another date and time (and service tech)!  Fortunately, Stevi was assigned to my service appointment.  I arrived a little tardy due to the weather, but she was very pleasant, kind, professional and helpful with my concerns.  She scheduled my Uber and kept me updated throughout the day with details of what was done and items of concern.  She was very thorough and I trusted her to ""take care of me"".  I am happy to share that Stevi did just that...helped in my time of need and made sure I was on the road rolling in safety!  I told her manager, Craig Murrell to ""take good care of her"" because she is the example of a caring salesperson with great customer service! :)",5.0
4,"January 21, 2020","From test drive to drive out, it takes about 5 hours to purchase a vehicle at this dealer. My review is not on buying a vehicle but what to expect for the years to come after purchase. I purchased 2 Genesis and an Elantra from this dealer so I think I‚Äôm a loyal Hyundai owner. 
*October 2019- took my wife Genesis because the driver side seat heater stop working. I was told that the ‚Äúmodule‚Äù needed to be replaced and it was being ordered.
*November 2019- took in vehicle to have part replaced and seat warmer fixed. Unfortunately, I was told by Mr. Sandoval that the ‚Äúmodule‚Äù didn‚Äôt fix the problem and I need a new seat. I was told I would  be contacted when seat arrives.
*December 13, 2019- after a month and numerous voice messages to Mr. Sandoval, I emailed him in regard to the status of the seat that was supposed to be order. Mr. Sandoval told me the part was on back order and that he will ‚Äúget in touch with me‚Äù when it arrives.
*December 30, 2019- after two weeks I decided to do my due diligence and call the parts department myself. I spoke to Chuck and he told me that the seat comes in three pieces and that it cost over $5k and it can be at the dealer in 5 business daysüò±. I immediately email Mr. Sandoval to tell him what Chuck told me. what do you know, Mr. Sandoval replies with, the ‚ÄúTech‚Äù ordered the wrong part and he wants me to bring the vehicle back for diagnostic. Also, the ‚Äúmain diagnosis tech‚Äù will be available from January 6, 2020.
*January 20, 2020- drop off vehicle at 7am. Didn‚Äôt hear from Mr. Sandoval and it‚Äôs 3pm. Call numerous times without and answer. Decided to stop by and check on the progress. I was shocked when I was told that no one had looked at my vehicleüò°.  Decided that I wouldn‚Äôt wait any longer and just took my vehicle back. Invoice # 173515. 
In summary, unless you are getting a new car for practically nothing, I suggest you try another brand. I think the service department has to much on their hands to provide any kind of helpful service. My lease is up on my Elantra and I think this experience has made my choice.",1.0
5,"January 20, 2020",I switched to Sterling McCall South Loop because its location was very convenient for me as it is on my way to work and next to a Pappadeau restaurant.  I never regretted the switch as the service is excellent and their prices more reasonable than other dealers.,4.4

I was approached not only by Paige the customer relations liasson and Craig the service manager and the issue was resolved.  No trying to make it my problem, claim no problem or blow it out of proportion. just resolved. Things happen.

It is  that kind of attention and assistance that keeps my family and friends returning to Sterling McCall Hyundai. John was very patient with me because I was a confirmed Tucson owner but was interested in the 2019 Kona new features. He literally let me put the cars side by side and make my final decision.

At my convenience, the dealership sent someone to my house to pick up my vehicle, and complete the tire rotation. In addition, they detailed my car, washed it, and filled up my gas tank.

I am appreciative of the dealership's interest in making good on their promise.

74,"May 24, 2019","To be short, I went to the dealership that morning to get an oil change on my 2014 Hyundai Sonata. I had no intentions of buying a car. Absolutely none! After my oil change was completed I went home and checked my mail where I found several refinancing loan mailers. One of them stood out amongst the rest because there was a hand written sticky notes addressed to me. I took note to the details and called the dealership. Mark and I conversed and I asked him to help me under what refinancing meant. He walked me through it connected me with Lamar. Lamar made me feel completely comfortable and confident that I could get the car that I desired. He even helped guide me as some of my car choices were obviously unrealistic and out of my budget restrictions. Lamar is someone I can now call a friend and a consultant. He also had a tag team buddy Dylan who was very knowledgeable on the inner workings of the vehicle such as the smart features. He took the time to show me every feature no matter how small and even served as a point of contact in case I needed assistance while on the road. I will always recommend this dealership to my friends and family because of the teamwork, honesty and the way the go above and beyond for their customers.

101,"February 23, 2019","I've waited about 8 hours to post this review in order to give myself time to wind down and think through the entire experience.  it's still the single worst experience I've ever had with a car dealer.  The level of dishonesty is truly mind-boggling.

I've been looking for a pick-up for my soon to be 16 y.o. son.  The dealer website as well as the Cargurus.com website both listed a 2011 Toyota Tundra available at South Loop Hyundai.  It looked nice and was in our price range.  It is also a little over a 2 hour drive from our town to their location.  I called 1st thing Saturday morning to verify they still had the truck and ask a few questions.  Karen answered my call and said she would check to verify that they still had the truck.  I explained that we would be driving a long way and that I didn't want to waste a trip that far. 

She called me back and said they definitely had the truck.  I asked her if there were any issues or any damage not visible in pictures, no matter how small or insignificant.  She assured me the truck was in great shape and that their service department always does a thorough inspection before they list a vehicle for sale.  I said OK, that I would drive down with my wife and son.  She asked to schedule an appointment and I gave her the time we would arrive.

We caught some traffic on the drive down to Houston and we were running a little late.  Karen called me back to verify that we were still coming.  I apologized that we were running late due to traffic and asked to verify that the truck was still available.  She said it was and that she'd be happy to see us when we arrived.

We arrived at the dealership and were greated at the door by a salesman who was clearly expecting us.  When I gave my name, he knew exactly which truck I was interested in and IMMEDIATELY SAID THAT THEY HAD SENT THE TRUCK TO AUCTION EARLIER IN THE WEEK BECAUSE IT HAD ""LOTS OF ISSUES"".

I thought maybe he was talking about a different truck.  I pulled up on my phone the truck I wanted and explained that I had verified with Karen twice that the truck was available.  He immediately became very defensive and said that the truck I wanted was gone and had issues.  He actually said ""you should be glad we aren't selling you that one"" and proceeded to tell me he would find me another, similar one at one of their other dealerships.

I immediately told him ""no"" and walked out clearly angry.  First one, then a second manager followed us to my truck and apologized... sort of... they clearly had no idea who Karen was and after looking at the phone # she called me from, they told me that was someone from their internet sales team... located somewhere else entirely.  The manager said they sent the truck to auction because ""it wouldn't even start"" and they ""don't sell vehicles with that kind of issue"".

It is absolutely, 100% certain that they knew they didn't have that truck on the lot when I called the first time.  They didn't care about anything but getting me to their dealership to try to pressure me into buying something else.  By the way the salesman was waiting for us when we arrived, he clearly knew they didn't have the truck and he had clearly already talked to Karen.  If he hadn't, he wouldn't have known my name or which vehicle I was interested in.  Either of them could have called me to let me know they didn't have the truck, (I know they had my phone #, they called mid-trip to verify I was coming).  Instead they wasted almost 5 hours of my day plus the expense of gas and eating out just to get me to walk in their door.

There isn't an apology they can offer that will undo what they did.  They were deliberate and determined in their dishonesty.  They have thoroughly and completely earned as much distrust as is humanly possible to give them.

I sincerely hope that every single potential victim (liars can't have customers, only victims) reads this review and chooses to take their business elsewhere.",1.0

132,"November 30, 2017","I have wanted an Azera since renting one in 2015.  Unfortunately, it was always a bit out of my price range so I ""settled"" last year for a Sonata Hybrid, which was a great car and got amazing mileage.  I bought the Sonata at South Loop as well.  Because I had visited the dealership and expressed an interest in the Azera, Michael Stewart gave me a call and asked if I would be interested in a new 2015 Azera they still had on the lot.  I told my wife I had to give it a shot since Hyundai was not bringing the Azera back for 2018.  Mike and Jose Reyna (Finance) worked with me and although I had put 29,000 miles on my Sonata in 16 months, we were able to work a deal.  As a returning customer, I received some additional discounts and they handled all the paperwork to transfer my extended warranty and service policy over to my new Azera.  I was never pressured and never felt uneasy, as I have often done in many dealerships over the years.  I LOVE my Azera!  It truly is the best car nobody ever heard of.  I get asked about it at the drive thru windows, the gas station and in parking lots, especially if they see the headlights on.  Great smooth ride, quiet and spacious interior, huge trunk and pretty good MPG for a 6 cylinder. So far I am exceeding the EPA estimates.

152,"October 28, 2017","I'll make this brief and to the point.

Bought new car thought mud guards were included. Due to confusion, we agreed to pay for the parts, dealer would comp the install. Made arrangements to have the work done when the new license plates came in.

Plates came. Made appt to install plates and mud guards. Get to dealer, Brian Hoang(??), Service Advisor, new our name and was ready for us, except he didn't know about the plates. He calls sales rep (dealership not yet open, only service) and tracks down plates. We explain to him we made first appt of the day because we had to go to work. He expedited the service for us.

Car is ready, but....NO MUD GUARDS!! Service manager Aubrey Cook intecepts us as we're walking out to the car, noticing the look on our faces searching for the mud guards. Aubrey falls all over  himself apologizing, explaining that the guards show in stock, but the computer was wrong.

Here's the EXCEPTIONAL part of the story: Before my wife and I could utter a single word, Aubrey repeats his regret about the guards and explains that as a means of compensation for our time lost with the appointment, that he topped off the gas tank and did an exterior wash and...wait for it...wait for it...

HE COMPED THE MUD GUARDS!!

I tried to explain that that wasn't necessary, but he wouldn't have any of that. He told us he'll call when they're in and when we show up...WITHOUT AN APPOINTMENT...he'll have one of his service techs take care of us.

Attention all other car dealers: THIS how customer service is supposed to be. Not necessarily the free stuff, but rather, and more importantly to the point: Owning up to the mistake and doing WHATEVER is necessary to make it right with the customer.

189,"September 21, 2017","Excellent staff especially my dealer, the manager and Naza they were so patient with me and to all my concerns, they even suggested tips on financing and refinancing my car",5.0
190,"September 19, 2017","After having a total loss of my Hyundai Genesis during Hurricane Harvey, I decided that I would purchase a new car of the same make and model that I had previously. I made initial contact by the internet to start the shopping process. Once the Internet Manager discussed what I was looking for and my immediate concerns, she advised that she had spoken to her Sales Manager and that they were able to find financing and that she was at the point where my family and I could come and go to the financing department to finish the purchase. We arrived and found out that what she said was not true. We agreed to go ahead and negotiate even though they initially were deceptive. The sales man takes us to a car that they had picked out. When he opened the door, I noticed discoloration on the floor board and a smell that led me to believe had been flooded. I asked the sales man at that point whether the vehicle had been flooded. He stated that the dealership had not been affected by the flood and they had confirned that none of the cars on the lot had been flooded. We go back inside to discuss financing and the sales man begins to agressively discuss the benefits of leasing and I advised that I was looking to finance a vehicle. He responds that the vehicle would be much cheaper as a lease. And that more than likely for them to meet the amount of what I had set as my monthly payment limit, leasing would be my best option. I asked if he could give me an idea of what my monthly payment would be with financing versus leasing. Of course all of the numbers for financing were over my limit. We began to discuss again leasing with him explaining again how this purchase would be better as a lease with the fact that my car that I had previously didn't have gap insurance and there was a balance that would have to be added in to the purchase amount for the new vehicle. Several times I left the dealership throughout this negotiation because I felt they were wasting my time when I would only agree to the terms that I had initially asked for, before setting a foot on their property. Each time, they would call and tell me that they would meet my terms. When I would come back, it was the same thing. They would start again offering conditions that did not meet my conditional limits. I am upset with myself for not walking away then. However with my home being uninhabitable from the flood and losing my vehicle too, I would now identify myself a motivated buyer. We finally agree to the lease and go to financing, each tine they would negotiate a monthly payment for the lease, the allowed mileage would decrease without advisement. The sales manager would state a certain amount of miles for one price, the sales man would gloss over the mileage and each time they would advise that it wouldn't matter because more than likely since I was loyal to the brand that when the end of the leasing term would occur, I would purchase the same brand and there would be a mileage waiver due to loyalty. So the finance manager started by stating the details of my purchase including allowed mileage, he advised that the monthly payment would be based on 10,000 miles although the sales manager had just said 12,000. I stopped him and told him what we had been told, he contacted the sales manager, who then comes to the finance office. He again states that it won't matter because I was loyal to the brand and would purchase the same Make of car at the end of my lease. We agree to completing the financing. After all the papers were signed the finance manager asked why we agreed to a lease, I told him that the sales department had advised that this was the only way they could meet my monthly payment limit. He calculated what he thought would be the amount as financed, it was a little more than my limit but I asked could I change to finance, I am not sure still days later what was his response when I think about it now. We finish and go back to the sales man who makes delivery of the vehicle. When I get in, I noticed that they had sprayed some type of fragrance that smelled like an air freshener. I thought it was weird that a new car would have been sprayed with air freshener which was not done with the previous car that I bought from the same dealership a year and a half ago. I haven't met a person in my life that doesnt like the new car smell. The vehicle had 19 miles on it at the time of purchase and should have smelled like a new car. It's late the dealership is closing, I just go with it. The next day, Thursday I drive to work and back and the car still smells like the air freshener. Friday morning, I open the door to get to work and the car smells like mildew. I contact my husband and we agree to meet so that he could assess the car. On the way there, I am nauseous the whole time. We meet. He smells it and agrees that the car did smell like mildew. We call the Sales Manager and he told us that if the car smells and we had concerns to definitely come to the lot and they could swap it out for another car to ensure we were satisfied. They take the car to the Service Department where the Service Manager and my husband inspected the car to confirm there were other signs of water damage including rust on the brake disc, the shocks, and other aluminum parts of the engine. There were parts of the suspension front and back that showed corrosion. My husband points out the signs of water damage. The Service Manager then admits that they had, ""two cars that had flooded."" The Service Manager tells my husband that he disagrees. As they continue to discuss the service manager says that if we were not satisfied that we could go back in and just swap out the car. We go back to Sales, they leave us waiting for an extended amount of time. The Sales Manager finally comes back and says that since they didn't see signs of damage there was nothing he could do. We express our dissatisfaction. He agrees to go back and negotiate with the General Manager to see what they could do to ensure we were satisfied. He comes back and says the General Manager agreed to allow me to choose another car of the same model with the same features. All of them still have the same discoloration of the floorboard and the smell. The discoloration made the grey carpet look green in spots. I asked if they could show me a car that had been delivered after the burricane, the sales man advised that they didn't have cars that had been delivered after the flood. We find out that they had not submitted the financing paperwork and the Finance Manager states that he didn't get my signature on the right line on one of the forms. I have never re-signed any paperwork and am concerned that they would forge my signature because they seem to serve customers with no morality. We expressed dissatisfaction again. I call customer service of the credit card that I had used for down payment, I was advised that the dealership had put a hold on the amount put had not claimed it so it was still considered pending and if they didn't claim it within 72 hours it would release the hold. My husband tells the Sales Manager that he wants to go to Dallas, San Antonio or Austin to look. I tell my husband that there are other dealerships that are closer to our home. The sales manager stated, ""everybody's cars in the city were flooded."" I tell him that this may be true however every dealership was not going to try to sell their flooded cars. We leave with the agreement that they would not claim tbe money and were free to continue shopping elsewhere. As we are driving away, the Sales Manager contacts us and asks that if he could get another vehicle from one of the cities my husband had named, would I be interested. I agreed that I would. The weekend passes and we have no contact with the dealership especially because my husband's mother had a stroke and passed away. The sales manager contacted me on Monday asking what colors did I want. I answer and ask him how I would be able to confirm that the car was coming from another city. He said he would be able to verify. Today, we call the sales manager to find out why they had claimed the funds. He stated because he was going to be able to get a car in either later today or tomorrow. We agreed but gave the condition that we would need to have evidence that the car came from another city. He stated that this was not a problem. We get off the phone. An hour later, the sales manager calls back and says that now the General Manager would not authorize bringing in another car since they didn't agree the first car had been flooded. My complaint is with the deception they used to make the sale, the inconsistency in the information they would relay, feeling pressured in to leasing a car, not fulfilling the remedy that they kept promising would result in an undamaged vehicle, and the continious lying that they did. I am at a point where there is a loss of my money in a product that would cause health concerns and not be able to provide all the safety that an undamaged car would have. My desired settlement would be either a complete refund or that they fulfil the continued promises to bring in another car from another city not affected by the hurricane. I feel they continued to delay until they could take my money and once they had it to deny us any recourse to ensure our satisfaction. The sales manager kept repeating in the initial call that he wated to ensure that we were completely satisfied. However in his follow up call, there seemed to be no concern to do what he promised.

233,"July 27, 2017","We agreed to buy a demo with a damaged rim only because they promised it would be replaced. The salesperson looked at the rim, rubbed his fingers around it, then stated they would order another one to replace it.

Now that the car is with my son who is away at college in Arizona, they want to claim they can repair it. They would have to grind off so much of the rim for repairs, the safety of the rim would be compromised.

So had to make a new deal with a sales manager since the inter manager Lady was not free. She is a phony-to get people to the dealership. And this new ""deal"" was the usual song dance ad haggle!. Finally, we were promised the car we wanted if we made the deal right then and made a downpayment. We did, but the car didn't arrive on the promised day or the week after .After 2 weeks and several reminders later it was given.  4 weeks later had to go back since they messed up the paperwork.

257,"June 27, 2017","The dealerships good points are they presented a lower price than other dealers and honored their price when I refused to accept any dealer add-ons (No back and forth haggling).  Also the girl that handled the closing paper work was very personable and professional, and we closed the deal very quickly and efficiently.    However, the sales staff was much less personable and professional.  We waited an excessively long time upon entering the dealership just to buy the vehicle (approx. 2 1/2hrs).  I had agreed to a purchase price on Friday, and came back on Saturday to purchase the vehicle.  My wife and I sat in the lobby for well over and hour before the sales agent came back to us after initially greeting us.  She handed me papers to sign while sitting in a chair in the lobby.  I had to ask her if we could move to a table.  She then took me to a bar type table in the service department, rather than a table and chair at an office.  We then waited another hour until our paper work was ready for signature.   Once the paper work was finished, I again had to wait some 10 - 15 minutes to receive the keys to my car.  The sale agent was attempting to sync my Bluetooth when she realize the gas tank had no been filled and told me to follow a representative to a gas station down the road to get it filled.  I followed him, filled the car up and then drove home.  The car also had not been washed or cleaned.  I am fine with the lack of review, setup, and cleaning of the car at delivery as this is the 3rd sonata I have owned and I know how to use most of the car's features.   This purchase was all about price which is what South Loop gave me.  It was however very frustrating waiting on their sales people.  The sales team needs to practice better efficiency and professionalism.  They probably made very little money on my sale, and that is probably why they had such a don't care attitude towards me.  I will however, consider them again as they had the lowest price and honored it.",3.2

270,"June 16, 2017","I'm going to reiterate what I wrote on the previous page:  So, extremely pleased with the vehicle itself. Very happy with what I got. However, after finishing negotiations for my lease, I was completely forgotten about for roughly 3 1/2 hours. I was told by my salesman that finance would be getting to me soon to finish paperwork. I followed up with my salesman twice by walking over to his desk on why there was such a delay. To which he mumbled ""they're busy."" I considered leaving the dealership when one of the manager's walked by me who looked puzzled since I'd been sitting there for so long. I told him what was happening and he walked over to finance and told them to get my paperwork started. Thus, no one had been notified that my negotiations were finalized. I was at the dealership from 9:30AM til 7:30PM. Paperwork took an additional 2 1/2 hours because the lease wasn't printing out right and kept being filled out incorrectly. I asked if the odometer was noted on my lease and asked if it matched what was currently on the car I'd be getting. I was told ""yes"" saw that they noted 10 miles on the odometer and trusted that this was correct. When I got home with my ""new"" car I noted that there were actually 450 miles on the odometer. At this point, I did not even feel it worth me bringing it back up with the dealership because my experience and customer service were so poor. No one gave me information on when/where I'd be paying my lease. No one told me when I should bring my car in for routine service. My salesman did not even walk me through my car, it was someone entirely different as he was nowhere to be found. All in all, I needed a car and I ultimately got one, but I will not be returning to South Loop Hyundai to renew my lease in three years.",1.8

1.0 star rating 8/2/2016
Taught my son a valuable lesson today - that many dealership service departments are crooked and to avoid them as much as possible. We took his can in for a recall. I do all of my own maintenance and many repairs since I don't trust dealers. I only go for warranty and recall work. Got the car back along with a list of recommended services. These included replacing the ""excessively dirty"" (their words) air filter and cabin air filter. Funny, seems that I replaced the cabin air filter just 4 weeks ago (!) and the air filter 14K miles ago (Hyundai service schedule says to replace it every 30K). I challenged the service guy and asked him to bring out the mechanic. Naturally, he pulls out the completely clean cabin filter and can't explain the replacement recommendation. I pulled the air filter and he also conceded that while somewhat dirty - of course, since it been in use for a year - that replacement was not needed at this time. No apologies from either person, but then again why apologize for intentional acts? I then spoke to Aubrey the service manager. He agreed that neither filter needed to be replaced. There's no way to convince me that this was some random accident. It's an intentional attempt to take advantage of customers who won't know enough to challenge them. PLEASE learn at least a little about your car and its needs, or find a trusted person to help you. Many items are replaced on a schedule. Know that schedule and your car's history so you don't get screwed!!!

FWIW we had a positive sales experience when we bought the car from this dealer 2 years ago, but trying to steal my money in the service department still gets them only the 1 star.

UPDATE: I've changed my review from 1 star to 2 starts. The dealership general manager called me very soon after this review was posted. He apologized and said that written up the tech who did this. He also said that he's only been the GM for a few weeks and is trying to make improvements. I truly wish him luck. +1 star for a quick service recovery effort.",1.5

517,"January 29, 2016","About a month ago I was doing research in preparation to purchase a car. While doing my research on Autotrader, I saw that the Hyundai Veloster turbo was listed at an extremely low price. Surely, there's a catch. 


The dealer is offering a dealer discount of $3854, and Hyundai is offering a discount of 2750. The MSRP for this car $23,845. Given that, the car's selling price should be $17241 plus ttl (doc fees). I go to the dealership last night, do the test drive and I like the car. The car isn't for me but that's a mute point. So I tell the guy I would like to purchase the car. I ask him what the out the door fees for this car would be. So, of course he doesn't know so he has to talk to his manager. He comes back with a piece of paper and on one of the lines there's ""options"" $3,000. I stop at the ""options"", and ask the salesman who is helping me, what options are on the car. The window sticker is clear as day and the stickers shows only two added features floor mats, and auto dimming rear view mirror. The salesman points to a piece of paper and says well the options includes the hyundai care package. I read the form in front of me. The care package includes.. Tinted windows Wheel Locks Nitrogen chip resistant Clear Bra ""Free"" First Oil Change Pin Strip Design 5 Years Roadside Assistance. So the car I am looking to purchase does not have tinted windows, it doesn't have a clear bra, and I doubt it has Nitrogen already in the tires. I don't care for a Pin Strip. Wheel locks are important but they generally only cost about $50. Free oil change that i have to pay for is not free. Hyundai cars come with Roadside assistance I believe. I tell the salesman i would like to decline that ""option"". He then explains I cant decline that ""option"". Of course I don't understand, if it's an option isn't optional. His response is well if you decline that option we have to reduce our dealer discount. Again I do not understand that. He says well we offer that dealer discount to off set the cost of the ""optional"" Hyundai care package. I explain to the salesman how, that absolute ridiculous. If that's the why don't you just offer the car with an $800 to $1000 dealer discount. He responds well one of the competitors, Ron Carter Hyundai started it and because of that they are unable to get customers to come to their store. The salesman can see I am annoyed so then he starts asking me questions such as well what is your ideal monthly payment. to which i respond it's not about monthly payment its the sales price. There's too many factors such as interest rate and term of loan so monthly payment is the last thing i am worried about. He goes in the office several times with new numbers, but the numbers still do not work. Then his manager in his infinite wisdom suggests that I just pay $1200 for the options. To which I respectfully reply I am not going to pay $1200 for something I do not find value in. I guess the salesman's manager got tired of him coming in his office so many times to close this deal. The manager then comes out, the manager ask me what's the problem i entertain him and explain to him the situation even though obviously he already knows. The manager brings out the final paper. The ""Options"" is removed however the dealer discount has been reduced by about 600. 


Horrible business practices!!! I have requested to speak to the general manager about this issue. I also called their corporate office but they pretty much said we will talk to them.

A sales manager called, followed up with today and stated that the discount of $3,854 was contingent on certain options* being installed on the car. He stated that the discount without the options was less.
However those options have not been installed on the car. the sales manager said well we just received the car and those dealer options* were going to be installed on the car. But the car was at the dealership last month. oh well. But what i found the most entertaining is that he said me purchasing the car for my mom is a ""straw purchase""???...Which is illegal. 

Apparently it's against the law to purchase a car for someone else. So parents you're not allowed to purchase cars for your kids because it would be illegal.

After going back and forth with the Used Car Manager, the GM - Sam got involved and made a very stressful situation, pleasant and fair.  I paid for the towing and radiator repair that I authorized and towed the car back to the dealership and Sam traded the car ""FULL VALUE"" for another car in inventory.

An extra 3000 for South Loop dealer extras (free oil changes, clear coat, towing, etc.) I have no interest in that.  Apparently it is not optional.  Now I am pissed bring me back my car.  They go and get the manager and he says I should have been told that on the phone....right.  Can he give me 1500 dollars off?  No I want the car at the price I agreed to.

I have been here for 2 hours now and I want my car but they are ""getting it"" I wait another 30 minutes and say I am going to call the police because they stole my car.  Voila it appears.  The manager never came back and I hit the road.

Make sure to tell them not to shoe you any numbers at all until they have run every piece of information they need.

528,"January 12, 2016","Overall it was an average experience.  Originally, I came in with a friend of mine who was the top salesman/manager at David McDavid for 10 years straight and he was able to watch the numbers for me and what they were presented. 

Even when I had financed set up that they couldn't beat, the faxed over an invoice to the credit union that was $2,000 more than what we had negotiated.  My friend picked up on this and stopped the draft immediately until we went back to the dealership and talked to them.  They did fax over the correct invoice.

Delivery took 2 days.  The care package they charged weren't all on the vehicle and were going to allow me to drive off without tell me.  It was my friend who went through the list and had them initial every item that was missing and I had 30 days to come in to get them all on.  I brought the car in the following day and everything was put on.

The delivery of the vehicle and when I took possession it seemed that people were ready to get us out of the dealership.  They weren't very friendly!

537,"January 05, 2016","Typical new car sales tactics but to a level I've never experienced before.

Crystal clear I didn't want any options but the first written price included a $3000 option package that was worth maybe $500 (insulting). The car wasn't on the lot and the salesman lead me to believe the options were already on it. I was asked if I would take the car with the options if I didn't have to pay for them but then the next written price still had them even if greatly reduced to $599. 

While the car had been cleaned before I picked it up it had colored dots on the tires or rims that I questioned. My salesmen said they would wear off, I took them off in the parking lot. The driver side floor mat, bottom rear window and drivers side mirror were dirty.

The passenger side mirror clear film protector (option package) had to be replaced due to becoming disfigured and has done it again. Also when picking up the license my car registration address was missing my unit number so I had to go online with the TX DMV to fix it.

To be fair the customer service and quality of work ratings are based on only the passenger side mirror clear film protector.

They did replace the first one promptly while I waited.

This clear film protector fit fine when installed. However now that the bottom came loose and disfigured again either something is wrong with the piece or the installation, whichever it is you would think they would have figured it out by now.",3.2

When I walked in I made it very clear that I was looking into several dealerships for an economic car within my budget. Although Josh knew there was a big possibility he wasn‚Äôt going to make a sale that day he still took the time to show me my vehicle of interest, allowed me to test drive it, and explained anything and everything there was to know about the car. One of my biggest turn offs are pushy salesmen and I loved that Josh didn‚Äôt pressure me to sign off for a car that same day. 

After researching all the pros and cons of the different vehicles I had in mind, I happily decided to give my business to Hyundai! Josh reviewed important information about the vehicle with me, including his recommendations on who to have service the vehicle, and Stephen made the financial aspect as painless as possible (thank God).

583,"September 21, 2015","I regret giving my business, time, and hard earned money to South Loop Hyundai and ultimately Hyundai as this is one of their corporate dealers. 

Went to buy a car from an online ad on Auto-trader. Called ahead to make sure car was available and if they would honor online pricing. The rep on the phone told me to come in and they would take care of it. Got there and the car is unavailable, they wont honor the price because they don't know where that car is. So they ask what I am looking for and at what price. It happens to be the one in the showroom so they said we can have it. I confirm before they remove it for a test drive if the price they quoted is for this car. He assures me yes. Come back from my test drive and I'm ready to buy. He then tells me me that this is once I just drove is actually $2,500.00 more. If I wanted the original price they guaranteed me it would have to be another color and car.(our sales rep was a used car rep and they never allowed someone from the new cars to help us) It takes 5 hours for us to get to a price that both parties except. The manager never once introduces himself or comes to talk to us. Instead hides behind large tinted windows as the associates come to him and he sends 2-3 manager liaisons on his behalf. The manager liaison offers to give me tints and all weather mats if I agree and sign on the price after 5 hours of negotiations. After I sign they say they can only honor the tints or the mats because tints cost $300 and mats cost $500. (really ever heard of Amazon or Groupon) We agree on tints (with a manager liaison) and now it has been 7 hours and the finance department tells me that with a 780 credit score the best interest rate I get is 3.99%.Then tell me that they prefer not to use Hyundai Financing because they are horrible to deal with. So I ask for quote still to compare to the one from Wells Fargo. He goes into another office and 5 minutes comes back with a quote that is higher then 3.99%. I feel he manipulated the information to get that rate. Anyways now as we go to sign I look up and confirm the tints, and he (the financing guy) says according to his understanding they are not giving us tints or mats. At this point I am infuriated and my wife begins to cry out of frustration with these people. Then as we decide to walk away after 7+ hours at this place dealing with this and he(the financing guy) says "" I feel bad for you too so I'll go ahead and take care of it."" I signed on the price because they told me they were including tints and mats. Your not doing me a favor because your giving me half of what you promised. Also he states its ultimately his decision about selling the car to us. So why the heck did we spend our time talking to other people?  The only nice thing was the last technician that stayed till very late to show us the features of the car. Besides him, everyone else was unprofessional, disrespectful, rude, and a liar. Don't trust anything they say. Would not recommend buying a car at this dealership. In 2015 the customer has more knowledge and access to information that reduces the need for long traditional negotiations. Ultimately in the future they will get rid of dealers since there are no ""deals"" to be made. Everything is a rebate of some short or a price deduction based on a specific qualification. The internet price reflects that for disabled war veterans who are recent college graduates who previously also bought another car from Hyundai. Never think you are getting a deal on a car. The prices are inflated to accommodate this annoying song and dance at a dealership. It disturbs me deeply to know that I went through that to get a car. I was frustrated that I had spent my entire day there, and therefore refused to leave with out a car. Knowing I would have been treated much differently at any dealership, I regret doing my business with Hyundai at South Loop.

We love are Sonata and were very happy with the level of overall service. BIG thanks to Armando Pena for making me feel like part of the family.

When I noticed the amount was too high and I went thru the Bill of purchase and saw the extended warranty amount and the gap insurance that was added there without my consent and without asking me, as soon as I told him to take it off he forced me to buy I had an APR of 8.5 he said if I don't buy that he is gonna bump my APR to 16%. he was too rude and didn't even bother to answer my questions.",1.0

After visiting South Loop, they now have his maintenance business in addition to my own. Highly recommend. ",5.0

615,"July 09, 2015","I had been to several other dealers over the course of my car shopping experience. It had been a long, hot and tiring day when I ended up at Southloop Hyundai. Tony was quick to help me and show my the cars I was looking for. He was helpful during the test drive and encourged me to fully expeience the car. He took me on a route that allowed to really test drive the car, (entering freeway, over train tracks, long open distance to test acceleration.) Tony didn't make me feel bullied into buying a car or making a decision I wasn't confortable. There had been confusion on the pricing of the car and he worked hard to get me to a price I was comfortable with. Overall it was a good experience and I got a car I am truly happy with.

621,"April 27, 2015","I highly recommend South Loop Hyundai, especially sales person Cheryl James. I initially went to another dealership in the area, Ron Carter Hyundai and test drove a Genesis. I was unimpressed with the dealership and salesperson. I knew I wanted Genesis, but I did not want to purchase from Ron Carter. I then went to South Loop and met my salesperson Cheryl. She was extremely professional, answered all my questions, and offered me a very fair price. As for my Genesis, I love it!

622,"April 21, 2015","UPDATE: I was contacted by Darrell Thompson, General Manager at South Loop, the day after my original post was published (SEE BELOW, 4/18/15).  He looked into the matter, and agreed that what I experienced was no way to do business.  He then offered to make things right ... and he did!  I pick up my new Elantra Limited today.  It's far from the norm for upper management to get involved with day-to-day operations on the sales floor ... but to Darrell's credit, he did just that, and resurrected the transaction.  That's customer service at its best.",5.0

625,"March 29, 2015","I went to this lot with the intention of leaving with a car that day and I was excited.  The only salesman available was the floor manager, and he was the WORST salesman I have ever dealt with.  I tried to show him the deals that I had seen on their website and he pushed my phone back at me and said he saw them 100 times a day.  He also told me that his phone was blowing up and that he had other customers waiting.  So I stood up and told him to go see about those other customers because i didn't appreciate the way he was speaking to me and I was leaving.  After I left, someone from the dealership called to try and get me back and promised to give me a great deal.  However, that individual actually defended the bad behavior of the salesman.  I will NEVER give my business to South Loop Hyundai, EVER.  And I will tell everyone I know to avoid them at all costs.",1.0

630,"February 10, 2015","I worked with Salesman Paul Jones for two weeks and when he texted me the deal I went in to make the purchase. When I got there they wouldn't honor the deal even though I had it in black and white. One sales manager Alonzo agreed that I had every right to expect them to honor the deal and that's nice, but they still wouldn't. If you look at their website, don't kid yourself into thinking the sales price means the sales price. Even though the web listing starts with the MSRP, then subtracts a dealer discount and any rebates, Sales manager Justin will explain that the listing doesn't include dealer preparation charges for tint, wheel locks, etc. so the sales price is actually a couple of thousand dollars higher than what they advertise.

Where I come from, ""sales price"" means the price you will sell the car for. From top to bottom, this was the worst run around - deceptive - typical dealer rip off experience I have ever had and I have bought a few cars in my life. Save yourself the trouble, these guys cannot be trusted and will not honor their word. Terrible black mark on the industry",1.4

633,"December 29, 2014","I did my test drive on 26 Dec 2014 and was ready to make a purchase(2015 Hyundai Sonata LIMITED). Sales specialist - Cheryl James helped me on the final drive out numbers, she is very polite and friendly .

Next step is the finance, they took my information and i have filled the form.
After 15-30min, they came with an estimate of $566- 590/ month, with a duration of 60months for a $0 down payment.
When asked what was the interest rate, the guy told me its 5.6%.
But my negotiated drive out price was $28,000.
5.6% of $28,000=$1568.00
So, the total payments per month is= $492.80 [($28,000+$1568)/60].

I walked out of the dealership that night(26 Dec 2014). The next evening(27 Dec 2014), the finance department called 2-4 times to my cell and text me saying, well they have a low interest rate to offer which is somewhere 3.69% and I said no, next offer was some 2.56, said no to it .Finally they have asked me the interest rate I'm looking for, replied 1.99%.
They replied its only for tonight, please come to sign the papers, i have also requested for a Cargo tray along with this this deal.

I went to the dealership by 8:30PM same night, the finance guy showed me the options and features and asked me to sign on the paper. Here is the interesting part, the paper says
460/Month for 75 months(increased the payment duration) which is $460*75=$34,500.
I was shocked and asked him to re-calculate in-front of me and show me the numbers. He said the numbers are right in front of you on the paper.

i said not interested, he said"" at least we tried"", to me that was a funny line. Yeah, right they tried me to fool around with the numbers.

----
Here's good and bad things about this dealership.

GOOD:
Some of the sales specialist like Cheryl James are very good they try their best to get you the numbers you looking.

BAD:
Lot more...
Service Department and Cautious on the *finance department.

---
After reading some of the bad reviews i gave a try 'coz of the good sales specialist and though i could get my service done at other stores.

Hope this helps future customers who are in market buying a car.

Happy holidays...

640,"August 07, 2013","South Loop Hyundai had a white 2011 Hyundai Sonata listed for $14,877.  The next morning, we called to make sure the car was  still available since we had to drive from Austin to look at it.  Alfonzo assured us it was.  When we looked at the website again, we noticed the price dropped $1000.  Perfect!  When we arrived, we told Keith we were looking for the white Sonota that was listed on the Internet (there was only one listed).  He took us to the car.  We test drove it and loved it.  Then we noticed the mileage was a bit lower than listed in ad.  Keith then tells us we have the wrong car.  The one we just tested was $17,800!  We asked about the car we requested.  After investigating, Keith tells us the car was sold 3 days earlier.  (Then why the drop in price?). We asked to see a car like the one listed.  The manager, Brian, came up with a few cars, but none were offered near the price of the ""Internet special.""  What a bunch of scammers!",1.5
