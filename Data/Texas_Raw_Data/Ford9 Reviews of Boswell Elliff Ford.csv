7,"October 18, 2016","Best experience I have ever had in buying a vehicle. I had called and spoke to Mario about a vehicle on their lot. I told him the deal I was looking for and he said to go over and we'll make a deal. When I got there we wasted no time. They took my truck for appraisal and we went to test drive the new truck I was looking at. When we returned, the deal was already laid out. It was the deal I was looking for but still squeezed out another $250. 
Experiece was so good, my mom also purchased a vehicle there.",5.0
