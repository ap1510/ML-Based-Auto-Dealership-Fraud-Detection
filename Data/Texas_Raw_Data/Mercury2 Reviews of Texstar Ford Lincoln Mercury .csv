Sam, Brett and everyone person you deal with at that dealership is first rate.. It just doesn't get any better! To bad they don't sell Jeeps, my life would be so much easier. ",5.0
1,"December 05, 2013","Sam is the most personable Service Manager I have ever met.  Service centers are right up there with the dentist or a lawyers office for me, and Sam blows that away.  I feel comfortable and confident in what he says.  You just don't get that ""I'm about to be gouged"" feeling.

Work was performed quickly and professionally.

Brett at the Quick Lane is the same. 

Both always remember my name and simply get things done.

Every single person I've met in both shops reflect their leadership. 

The service department is exceptional, top to bottom.",5.0
