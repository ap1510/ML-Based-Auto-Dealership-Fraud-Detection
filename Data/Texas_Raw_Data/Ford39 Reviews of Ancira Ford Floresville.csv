0,"May 14, 2020",Took my 2019 f350 in for 3 recalls and front end has the death wobble when I hit a pot hole. Also side marker light was broke . Which I told sales person about it weeks after it came in that it was cracked . We’ll because I live in Houston and didn’t get it fixed right away they would not cover it . They had to replace rear inter fender well because it was cracked but would not replace front mud flap . For about 250 dollars they lost my business . It’s not about the money . O well plenty of other dealerships . The service dept were great management sucks,1.0
1,"September 23, 2019","Something to share with people......This happened at Ancira in Floresville, Texas.........Friday,Sept 20, 2019, at 1pm.....The original experience was very positive...we saw a vehicle we liked, stopped in, provided all of my personal information, they test drove my trade in, made us an offer, we counter offered, it was 3 hours later and we had to leave...upon leaving the ""shake hand"" deal was, the sold sign would remain on the vehicle, we would return Monday, September 23 ,2019... morning..This way the finance officer would have time to find a good interest rate. I gave him the name of the 2 banks I dealt with. We discussed what interest rate we wanted to stay at...He, the finance person stated he would work on it Monday..September 23, 2019..The dealership was closed Saturday, open for a few hours Sunday. We asked, upon leaving Friday to be sure they would hold the vehicle, which means don't sell it. We were assured and shook hands with the sales person, Ray and the finance specialist. We received a text at 10pm on Sunday, September 22, 2019, 4 hours after closing, from Ray stating the vehicle had been sold today!!!!! We asked him why, this was promised to us and he stated he was just told to inform us it had been sold. They closed at 6pm....Why were we not informed sooner. Better yet, why did they sell this vehicle out from under us. My credit report has been dinged due to the inquiry. We were planning on picking this vehicle up on Monday, September 23, as promised. We were assured we were safe and the vehicle would be ours. We asked if we needed to put anything down on it to hold it and they stated no, the sold sign is on it as well as your name. Lesson learned. A car sales person is just that. No morals, no values, just hey yeah shake my hand and its a deal. But at this car dealership its the whole crew....the sales person and the financial ""expert."" I will be calling the manager of this dealership in the morning. Chances are if the sales person(maybe find something else to sell other than promises to people who believe that your words are true) and the financial ""expert""(only an expert at the art of deception) are corrupt and dishonest, so is the manager. I will also place a complaint to the better business bureau due to an inaccurate and misleading ding on my credit report, mismanagement, untruths and misconception to the public. I am required to give a star grade...I will give a one star for the clean bathrooms....",1.0
2,"November 15, 2018","My first visit to this dealership.  I needed service for the Ford airbag recall on my 2010 Ranger.  I spoke with Bill Cass who ordered the correct part for my truck; and called the next day to set my appointment.  He did explain it could take up to 2 hours so I could make plans. 

I met with Luis in the service department.  Luis asked if they could take me somewhere for the duration which I appreciated.  I spent time there looking at the new vehicles and chatting with other personnel.  Everyone was very friendly. 

I wasn't there to buy anything and still was treated as a valued customer.",5.0
3,"July 05, 2018","Ancira Ford Service Department in Floresville Texas really needs to reevaluate the way they do business for their customers. The lack of customer services and professionalism in the service department is by far mind blowing. The Service Manager and front desk service advisers have no integrity what so ever, when they laugh and joke by telling you that your vehicle that you bought less than 7 months ago brand new has a defect that can cause the vehicle to be stolen in front of your face. Then they tell you that the warranty will not cover set defect and that they want to up charge you so they can profit. This is when I headed to San Antonio and went to another Ford Service Department with awesome customer service, and they quoted me almost $300 less than the Floresville Dealership did. I was taken back at how a Dealership in a small community can treat their patrons like that. And for them to upcharge on a part and service that the other dealership will do for less on the same parts and service is price gouging and bad business practices.",1.0
4,"December 07, 2017","This dealership ranks absolutely as the worst service I have ever received in any consumer related aspect. The maintenance department is rude and are always looking to stiff the customer with more fees. The vehicles themselves are horrible, not worthy of new. I would never buy from Ancira again or even Ford for that matter.",1.0

11,"July 07, 2017","I have been purchasing vehicles now for several years from Ancira Ford in Floresville, the service and treatment is superb, Andy xxxxx has always treated us very well and his staff is fantastic, and people like our salesman Justin Lavelle is the reason we keep coming back, he was very helpful and knowledgeable from start to finish.

12,"June 13, 2017","They are just a great group of people and offer nothing but good service in both sales and service. I purchased my five previous vehicles from Ancira Ford, and plan to continue doing business with them for many years to come. I also use no one else but Ancira Ford to perform service on the vehicles that I have purchased from them.

13,"June 08, 2017",Let me start with the service is excellent and quickest around. Dealerships in San Antonio had one week wait while Ancira had 2 days plus they fixed my vehicle within those two days. Guys on the drive were very professional and nice. I highly recommend this dealership.,5.0
14,"September 12, 2015","When I walked up I asked an older gentleman for a sales person, he directed me to the Service area. I explained I wanted to buy  a new car and he said the man standing at the service desk was a salesman so I went in. The guy at the desk said he wasn't a salesman and sent me the back way in....well pointed where I should go anyway.  I went to the counter and asked the receptionist for a salesman in a loud voice.  Four men in dealership shirts looked up from their phones or a away from the TV  to look at me then went back to what they were doing.   Guess who finally sighed...really,  he sighed. ..and approached me?  Yep the first guy I talked to!  Before you wonder, I am a 45 year old professional,  retired military and had just got off from my civil service job at Randolph.   I will take my business to another dealership.",1.0
15,"August 12, 2015",On line service appointment is worthless and not paid attention to.  I received 2 responses to online  request stating they were looking for the vehicle I wanted to purchase.  I didn't ask to buy a vehicle only get mine fixed.  Dropped vehicle off and told they'd need a day to order the parts and a day to install.  2 days go by and no status update.  I go by the dealership to inquire what's going on with my vehicle and informed they received the wrong parts so parts are on order and they MAY have my vehicle completed by closing time.  I stress MAY have.... Totally incompetent.,1.2
16,"May 07, 2015",I have bought 3 cars from Ancira Ford and have had nothing but great service.   They're friendly people who are easy to work with.  My salesman Mike Summers makes the process so easy.  I love not having to deal with the Hassel and stress of some bigger stores. The services department is very friendly as well....Great Customer Service!   ,5.0
17,"September 19, 2013",Scammers and Jokesters.  Do not go there for anything.  They will try there best at the service dept to bleed you dry.  Sold me a lemon and will not back warranty.  Was told it is fords problem?  Well this stealership has turned me away from ford forever.  I will make sure all the people around me and my generations to come will not buy a ford again thanks to Floresville ancira.  If ford gets ahold of these comments I pray they drop this dealer.  I will now sell off all ford stock and watch them sag as gmc grows bigger after gov. help.   True ford didn't take money during the recession and it shows in the crap they have put out the last years.  O I own a 6.0  I recommend never buying one unless you want to be broke and mad all the time.,1.0
18,"May 14, 2013","We purchased a used truck at this dealership and have had nothing but problems with it. We have put in a new engine, a new transmission, and the list goes on and on. Something goes wrong with our truck roughly every two - three months. We have had to get two different loans to cover the repair costs. Not only has the truck been a complete lemon the time required to have the truck repaired is amazing. The first time took three weeks, the second time took one month. They keep your vehicle forever but never offer a loaner. Don't they realize people need a way to get to work??? At this point I would love to sell the truck but we now owe much more than the truck is worth!",1.4
19,"August 27, 2012","I was met in the parking lot by an older person and told him I wanted the price on a F150,extended cab,v6,automatic, He escorted me inside and had me start all over and explain to some young kid in one of the booths again what I wanted again. He informed me that he could give me a truck with an access cab with a small space behind the seat and I said no I want an extended cab not the small cab and not the 4 door crew cab.I need the price on a new extended cab with a V6 and automatic. Now he informed me that I could have a 4 door colorado that he has. WOW THESE GUYS MUST HAVE MANY DEGREES. The question was {what is the price on an super cab,V6,automatic]. I don't want to see the 4 door new truck or the access cab or the 4 door colorado. The only thing that I learned from Ancira is that it is a super cab and I can't even get started on a price for what I want  I will have to go back to Chevrolet.  this is the second time you have missed this customer. The last time was simular and I went down the street and told the salesman what I wanted we worked up the price but they didn't have anything close so the salesman found one and had it shipped in and I drove it away 3 days later. This was my first chevy I have always had fords untill now. ",1.3
20,"January 04, 2010"," Want to thank the staff @ Ancira Ford Mercury, have bought already two new superduty trucks in less than two years not to mention that i live 170 miles away in Laredo, Texas and every time tue truck needs maintenance I rather drive up there for a profesional and fast service. thanks for everything Billy Herrera and Keith Dunsford.

21,"December 23, 2009",This salesman worked very hard to find the automobile that met our specifications.  He went out of his way to accommodate our needs.  Great person to deal with!  Gave us a great price on our trade in to get the payments to stay within our budgeted request.  Would recommend this dealership and salesman to you!,5.0
22,"December 23, 2009","My salesperson, Kerby Kale, was very professional and informative.  Note only did he look for the exact truck that I wanted, but notified me when it was there immediately.  He had the truck ready very quickly. Any issues I have had since it's purchase have been quickly taken care of.   It was a wonderful experience.  I will always buy my vehicles from Kerby now.

23,"December 22, 2009",We went to Ancira Ford looking to buy a truck.  Our experience with Ancira Ford was one we would recommend due to our sales person Warren.  He was very courteous and very knowledgeable about the vehicle we were looking at.  He greeted us with a warm friendly smile and answered all our questions including pricing issues.  We were impressed with his service even after the sale.  We continue to take our vehicle to Ancira Ford for all maintenance issues due to Warren's consistant concern to make our visit the best experience overall.  We definitely will buy from Ancira Ford again.,5.0

25,"December 22, 2009","I was very impressed with the professionalism in which Kerby Kale showed me.  He was awesome.  Not only did he keep an eye out for exactly what I was looking for, but when it came in he got it ready for me before it ever went online.  Any issues I have had he has taken care of immediately.  I would never buy a car from anyone else, so Ancira should consider him a very big asset.  Especially since I get a three year itch to buy!  I really felt all of this needed to be said, as I am a very pleased customer!",5.0
26,"December 22, 2009",Warrens knowledge of the vehicle I was looking for was excellent. He answered all of my question/concerns that I had. The dealership worked hard to get me in my price range. They made me feel like I was the most important customer that they had. All of the employees espically my sales person were very friendly. I would recommend Ancira Ford and Mercury to anyone looking for a new or used vehicle. ,5.0
27,"December 22, 2009",Kerby was great to work with!!  I got to the dealership a little later than I anticipated and Kerby stayed late with me to get the deal done.  He was very professional.  This was the first time I bought from Ancira and when I have to buy another car I would definatly use Mr. Kale again!  ,5.0
28,"December 22, 2009","We are Ford lovers, and american cars in general.  We especially feel in these tough times for american auto dealers we must support them.
At the time we began looking for a new car we were driving a 2000 Ford Focus wagon.  We loved the car but it needed a lot of work.  We weighed whether it made sense to pay the repair bills or find something newer.
On the lot at Ancira Ford Mercury in Floresville we spotted a beautiful 2008 Ford Fusion with only 20,000 miles on it.  It truely was a cream puff car.
We were in a postion to pay cash for the car and Mr. Kale and all the staff did everything to help us get the price we could afford including a decent trade-in on our Focus. We totally love our new Fusion, especially the Sync System.
Not only did we get a beautiful (almost new) car, but we also made life long friends in the sales and excellent service department.
We would and have already recommended Ancira to many of our friends and family because of the wonderful experience we enjoyed in working with all of the staff at this dealership.
Thank you Ford and keep up all the hard work you've done to keep america's foremost auto company going.  ",5.0
29,"December 22, 2009","Working with Warren Whitley was the BEST experience that I have ever had at a car Dealership.  He treated me with respect and got the best deal for me without any hassell or haggling. I was greeted at the door by all of the salesmen and they all made me feel welcomed and did not make me feel that I was just another customer, they made me feel special. From the time looking on the lot, test driving, paperwork to financing, I experienced the best customer service that I could ever want to receive from a dealership.  I guarantee that they will have all of my repeat business along with any other customers that I can bring their way.  I have no problem with referencing them and I will do it with confidence that they will also get treated just as great.",5.0
30,"December 22, 2009","Very friendly atmosphere. Excellent choices on the lot. Good down home type of dealership, no high pressure sales.

31,"December 22, 2009","Bobby helped me and my wife in every way possible to help me get our new truck. He showed me every vehicle I wanted to see and road test.  He is an asset to your organization.  I have referred/suggested several of my freinds to see Bobby when they are ready to purchase a new Ford. I am happy with my vehicle and sales experience!

32,"December 21, 2009","My salesman was very helpful and knowledgeable.  He found just the right vehicle for me after talking with me about my driving habits, passenger and cargo needs, and fuel usage expectations.  He answered all my questions easily and didn't pressure me.  He even found the right color for me, too!  Bill was also honest, while being courteous, in explaining my trade-in and financing options.  My vehicle was ready sooner than I expected and in perfect condition.  He helped me understand the features and how they might be of use to me.  He even set up my cell phone with the SYNC feature, which I now can't live without.  This was truly the best buying experience I've ever had with a vehicle. Bill knows his stuff and Ancira Ford Floresville is the best.

33,"December 21, 2009","Kirby, my salesperson, was easy to get along with and did not pressure me. The service department has done the work that they said they would do and at the price quoted. Everyone in the parts department have been nice except for one woman, she stayed on the phone a looooong time while I stood there. It did not sound like a bus. call. I left before she got off the phone.",4.8
34,"December 21, 2009","We needed a car and found a used car that was in our budget. Our salesman, Robert Hagelgans was very helpful and very professional and also answered every question and concern we had since it was a used car. He made the process very smooth along with the rest of the Acira staff since we live and bank in two different cities other than Floresville.
We did have a couple of problems later, but they were taken care of quickly and courteously.
We would and have recommended Robert Hagelgans and Ancira to other family and friends. We have really enjoyed our car. Even though it is a 2005, it is like a brand new car to us. Thank you.  ",5.0
