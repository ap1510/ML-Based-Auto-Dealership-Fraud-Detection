She attended my concerns and made sure I replaced only the parts I need by checking the mirror and the other parts of the mirror.

After I received the price of replacement, I was concerned because the price was higher than the quote I had gotten last month. Luckily, I still had the quote from last month and I showed it to her and she was able to get the price down. She was able to also get my car washed without having to wait long. 

Thank you Cynthia and I really appreciate what you did by finding my Yeti tumble that I left in the lobby, she even washed it for me.

I totally trust Cynthia with any repairs and car checkups.

I called my wife to discuss the price and we were going to buy the vehicle. Then general manager came and told me he will pay $7000 for my car. Then I told him this is so unprofessional that they are changing the deal in 5 minutes. I asked the copy of the offer telling them I will call Toyota.
