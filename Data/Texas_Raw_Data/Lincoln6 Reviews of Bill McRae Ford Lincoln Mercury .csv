3,"April 21, 2017","My 2001 F150 was making a rattling noise so I thought I'd let my 'home town' ford dealer fix it. $2800 later I'm told that its fixed and come get it. I'm so disheartened when I start it and the exact same noise is still there! I feel that Debbie, the service dept rep, misled me in telling me that the noise was fixed! The service manager said they could work on it more, but there may be additional costs. Since then I found out that it was just the torque converter. I will not ever let them touch my vehicles again. Do not trust this service dept! After speaking with several other people from this area, I've discovered that many people have had bad experiences with this place",1.4
4,"December 08, 2016","I just wanted to say how greatful I am to the Bill McRae Service Department personel. My wife was on a trip to Fort Worth by herself and had car trouble and had to stop at Bill McRae Dealership to find out the problem. They got her right in, found the problem and fixed the problem and got her back on the road in a very short time.

Thanks Again, Bill McRae Service Deptment Personel

5,"January 13, 2016","A little over a year ago, December 2014, my husband mentioned to one of the salesmen at Bill McRae that some time in the New Year we would be looking for a good used mid sized SUV while waiting on some routine maintenance on his pick- up. The next thing he knew, that salesman came driving up in a beautiful 2011 Lincoln MKX- like new, one owner, about 40K miles. They had taken it as a trade on a 2015 frim a repeat customer.  Needless to say it far exceeded our expectations in what we would be able to find. The whole process was very smooth and within less than 24 hours I was driving out with my new to me car. We have truly enjoyed everything about owning our Lincoln, and about our maintenance and upkeep visits back to Bill McRae!",5.0
