102,"March 01, 2019","Nobody can answer questions or even look up information on your vehicle.  Had to argue about warranty and tire protection and roadside service which took almost 4 hours to complete.  Have had to pitch a fit to get a loaner vehicle without scheduling far in advance and have to demand vehicle delivery after they screwed up.  Made an appointment for driveway service once and nobody showed up and no follow up phone call.   Overall, very disappointing service in the 18 months since moving to the Valley.",3.0
103,"February 17, 2019","We purchased this beautiful G wagon in the end of October 2018. I waited almost a yr for it. We were completely satisfied UNTIL Dec 24th when I received a SOFTWARE ISSUE which left the vehicle at the dealership for about 3 wks! 
From the sales person to the service department, even to the GENERAL MANAGER, they gave us different reasons for the problem and they were trying to figure out how to fix it. They also said that ""They were flying an engineer from Germany to fix the problem"" LMAO!! 
They did, however, pay 1 month of the car payment, (Bravo! for trying to ease the situation on a purchase of 156k). A person who is able to purchase this kind of vehicle does not need a reimbursement of one month payment! WHAT WE NEEDED WAS A G WAGON THAT IS THE REPRESENTATION OF WHAT THIS COMPANY PROMOTES!  

The windshield cracked, which I let the sales person know (He did say to contact him directly for any problems with the vehicle) This took place on Nov 24, 2018 and  I assumed that the windshield would be ordered promptly. TO MY SURPRISE IT WAS NOT due to it being ""BACKORDERED"". This is very upsetting since they do charge about 3k extra for the WINDSHIELD PROTECTION PLAN. Since then... I have gotten another crack on windshield and another crack on back window. The windshield cracks were ""sealed"" by a local shop which they payed for. The window, I had to pay for which cost close to $280 without the installation fee (I have no idea what the fee is). 

Another very upsetting situation is that I payed for the window on Feb 4, 2019 and have yet to receive it. The sales person told me it would take less than a week to get it while the service department said 7 to 10 days. 

I have plenty of pictures and texts to back up this HORRIBLE SERVICE which is NOT THE CUSTOMER SERVICE I WOULD EXPECT FROM MERCEDES BENZ.   

I advise to new buyers to ask as many questions about this new G Wagon in regards to the computer softwares, the glass quality, the protection plans...  I have driven Chevrolet  most of my life and DEFINITELY the quality of the glass is 100% better than that of this BEAUTIFUL CAR. Also, think about buying a G Wagon in San Antonio or at another place because I do not recommend this dealership. I will also add that the loaner they gave me when they kept the G wagon was a tiny car! nothing comparable to a G Wagon, and I will add that I received the loaner the next day or third day of them having the G Wagon. The service department nor the sales person offered the loaner ASAP.  You make your judgement on that. 

I decided to write a brief review on this purchase now because THE DEALERSHIP IS A TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT  with CUSTOMER SERVICE and the MAIN MERCEDES BENZ office HAS YET TO RETURN MY CALL (call made out last week)  WITH any reasons for the window delay, the windshield backordering status.  

The vehicle has a beautiful interior, exterior, the engine sounds amazing... but this kind of customer care makes me regret CHOOSING this vehicle over a PORSCHE. Next time we get a vehicle it will NOT BE FROM THIS COMPANY. ",2.2
104,"September 26, 2018","Went to MB of SJ. I spoke to a young man whose name I don't remember but I believe he was the son of the dealership owners. I admit I was dressed very casually, wearing jeans, tennis shoes and a tee. I was serious about buying a nice SUV but waited for about 20 mins before anyone bothered to speak to me even though several sales people walked by me and not bothering to ask if I had been helped. Finally, the young man sat down with me and basically implied I couldn't afford any of their vehicles. He seemed totally uninterested in making a serious deal with me. I was very disappointed in the way I was treated. I feel I was negatively stereotyped.  I left and drove to the Cardenas dealership in Harlingen. I bought a nice SUV at their place. They were very nice, they offered me something to drink and were very respectful... and I got a great deal. ",1.0

106,"December 23, 2016","My wife and I visited several Auto dealerships looking for a new Car. We stopped at Mercedes-Benz of San Juan. We were greeted by Joe Trevino, of the sales staff.

We looked things over, drove it and told Joe we would think it over.We took a couple of days and I called Joe we wanted the vehicle. We discussed price etc, and came to terms. 
Joe has been the best salesman I have ever used, and I am old. Since we took delivery we have called for help, as you all know the new cars are different. Joe has been there for us, he also has taken time to call and make sure we are happy and if there was anything we needed.

I first went in with a misconception about the type of client Mercedes Benz would cater to, but I became ecstatic with the level of professionalism demonstrated and immediately felt the sincerity and honesty Brandon lived up to. Not only were we engaged in becoming part of the Mercedes Benz Family through Brandon's excellent customer service and sales but working with with an awesome team  such as Lionel, Arturo,  Mr Franco, and not forgetting that wonderful and extremely courteous lady that greeted us at the door with a smile and offering us the array of amenities they offer while you shop in PEACE. To add to our first time experience with Mercedes Benz while we were there, to our surprise we had the pleasure of meeting a great couple we had only seen on TV prior to visiting Mercedes Benz of San Juan, yes both Mr and Mrs Cavazos came up to us and made us feel at home. I truly enjoyed seeing some character traits that you rarely see at car dealerships now at days, first and foremost good ethics and awesome stewardship stood out amongst MB Family and of course listening to Mr Cavazos come out of his office singing in a loud voice with such joy was a once in a lifetime experience for us.
