0,"June 11, 2016","On Saturday June 11 had a  appointment for my truck to have bumper and oil changed . Service was short handed . Fish and Pedro were wonderful doing all they could do We waited 3 1/2 hours there only to come to find out the owner pulled Fish off of a waiting paying customer just to move cars !  Not only were we waiting 2 other customers too !This is totally not customer service it shows he could careless about his customers ! What can I say ""Dick""Scott name says it all! A wise suggestion is your never to OLD to take some customer relations courses , might need a few refresher courses .

1,"October 04, 2015","I purchased a 2015 Ford Expedition from this dealer in January. From the point of sale to delivery there were no surprises. I was kept apprised of the schedule for delivery each week. After make-ready, the vehicle was delivered promptly and I was given a thorough walk-around. This is the fourth vehicle I  have purchased from this dealer and will definitely recommend them to my friends and family. ",5.0
