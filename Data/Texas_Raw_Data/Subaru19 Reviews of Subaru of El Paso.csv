0,"May 27, 2020",I recently purchased my new vehicle from this location. Nathan V was great is helping us find the right car and getting us into the price point we needed. The process was easy and smooth. I can’t recommend Subaru of El Paso enough! ,5.0
1,"February 14, 2020","Took my Forester for a recall notice & a TSB repair. Worked with Crystal; she was fabulous. Our visit was seamless & her customer service & knowledge was impeccable.

Our previous experiences were terrible, but that was before the current owners bought the dealership (~ 1/29 of 2018) Obviously the new owners have made significant changes.",5.0
2,"July 28, 2019","I would give 0 stars if I was able- they conned me out of a $15000 paid-off car for a lease of $38000. I tried to get all the info and be prepared, but essentially they took advantage of my ignorance and I agreed because I trusted them. They didn’t tell me about the $600 a year in taxes, the $425 extra a year for insurance, the $300 disposal fee. When I tried to get out 2 weeks later, they said I could not. I tried to get out at a year- they said no. I tried to trade it in at the end of last year- they would only get me into a 7 year old used car with much less safety and quality. I have a disability that requires me to have certain things in a car- nothing extravagant but required nonetheless. At the end of the lease, they were very apologetic but basically told me it was my fault for being ignorant (their word), that Subaru is what a “certain class” of people expect and they are able to pay for it. When I chose not to extend the lease or get their used cars, they added several steps and hoops to jump through that no one ever mentioned. I’m a single mother and a teacher and I did the best I could. Now I’m starting over with nothing as an asset. I’m holding my breath to see how many fines, fees and additional surprises will be on the final bill. I have no doubt that this will not get a response because it’s not positive, but it is true.",1.0
3,"April 24, 2019","I stopped by several times to see what deals they had. They heard my story and saw that I would need time to be ready so now they avoid my calls or emails.  They made it very obvious that they were upset that I did not buy the vehicle right away.  I have tried calling, texting and emailing the reps and they just avoid my calls.  I guess that when I am ready to buy, I will just go to Albuquerque or another city since this dealership does not want my business.",1.4
4,"November 23, 2018","Very Disappointed!!
Black Friday SupposidSale...
We saw a used 2016 Jeep Wrangler at the lot with a sale price painted on the windshield. The salesperson showed us the jeep, we test drove it & fell in love with the jeep. Once we're inside the office, the manager comes in and tells us they made a mistake and gave us a higher price for the jeep. They didn't want to honor the price. They didn't even want to play with the numbers. 
Not a very ETHICAL practice if you ask me. ",1.0
5,"October 07, 2018","They lost over $2000 in parts that they took off my car after they charged me $1200 for an engine teardown. I could not have anticipated them treating me so poorly here, even after I showed them pictures I had taken when I picked up the car and I had a witness there with me that proved I did not pick up the parts. Now I’m just just waiting until I finish paying out of pocket for the rest of the parts soon so I can show that as expenses when I sue them.",1.0
6,"January 29, 2018","It was my first time buying a car and I was very nervous. I didn't know what I was really looking for and I've heard all the horror stories of young ladies getting a car on their own and getting raked over the coals because they don't know anything. However, I loved working with Jesse and later Mike. Jesse was very kind and helped explain what I didn't understand as well as speaking slowly for me to understand better. They both answered my questions and eased the process considerably. I would 100% come back for future business!",5.0
7,"January 21, 2018","Purchased a clean, nice 2013 Subaru Crosstrek a couple of weeks ago. I wanted to give my Impreza to my pet sitter so they helped get best deal with 0 down. When I discovered the Crosstrek logo on the back was missing the ""K"" Jesse ordered a new logo no problem. Great experience overall!",5.0
8,"January 16, 2018",Went to Garcia Subaru to look at a vehicle I believed inwanted to buy. Knocked out a test drive with Jesus and decided it was exactly what I wanted. Considered waiting until after an upcoming move but he assisted me in getting the price I was willing to pay. Very professional and not pushy at all. We’ll informed on the vehicles he sells and overall resulted in a great experience. ,5.0
9,"January 04, 2018","As everyone knows is hard to find a honest seller and delalership. I went to Garcia Subaru just to see, with out interest on buy, they tread me as a king and don’t subestimes my look, I went straight to the point “he never put down my knowledge in the product or lied me trying to sell me some “dream!” He just make it happens!!! Got accesible numbers for me and ended up buying my new STI. I’m a Subaru enthusiast and this is my 2nd Subaru. Is you are interested in buy a Subaru, go straight to Jesus Vazquez he will give you what you want at the best price posible, if I did it, everyone can. ",4.6
10,"November 11, 2017","Staff is Disrespectful and has no knowledge. I’d rather go buy a Honda type-R for 20,000 over MSRP than deal with this dealership. ",1.0
11,"September 08, 2017",Had problems with my Forester in June.  Took it in had computer reset.  Went back car was driving poorly. They replaced the engine. Got car and cat struggled going up hill.

13,"February 28, 2017","My husband and I could not believe how comfortable we felt the minute we walked into the dealership!  Our salesperson, Marco Flores, invited us into his office to ask us specific questions to narrow our search and find the vehicle we would love. His vast knowledge and professionalism as he took notes and described the vehicles we were discussing made decisions much easier. He took so much time with us to ensure we would find the right vehicle we could not believe our good fortune. No high pressure tactics, just the facts. Thank you, Marco, and Garcia Subaru for a WONDERFUL car buying experience!!",4.8
14,"February 25, 2017","I am a full time plumbing apprentice and part time student. That being said i have a budget and didn't need nothing fancy, and when i said that to other dealerships i was pretty much told to go somewhere else... But that was not the case here! The staff here were eager to help and worked with and for me. Ask for Paul Lucero and you'll receive the upmost courtesy and professionalism, turning you stressful search for a good vehicle into a fun and unforgettable experience. Satisfied customer.",5.0
15,"February 17, 2017","If you ever want help go with Paul Lucero he's so helpful he helped me find a perfect vehicle for my family, he works with your budget doesn't pressure you to buy something over your budget so you leave without regret. ",5.0
16,"February 09, 2017","I wouldn't give them any stars in El Paso. The only one that asked if they could help me was the lady that was working at the counter for servicing vehicles, I would not buy a vehicle there. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. Go to Albuquerque!",1.0
17,"July 03, 2016","After a lot of research I had determined that I will buy Subaru Forrester, touring and knew the exact trim level that I wanted. One evening after work I stopped by to check out the car hoping to buy it in a month's time or so. I went for a test drive and loved the features. When I told the sales person that I will be back as this is the car is the only car in my list, he refused to let me go. The salesperson kept me for a total of 5 hours trying to convince me to buy the car right away. He even went on to accuse me of lying when I resisted his pressure tactics. 

I was so humiliated that I cried all the way back home. I am 57 years old and this was my first new car. I had so looked forward to this moment and had spent so many hours researching my first new car. 

It has been 6 months now and I can not make myself step into the dealership again. Unfortunately there are no other dealerships close by and so VERY reluctantly I am researching again and this time have eliminated Subaru from my list

18,"March 18, 2016",You can't reach anyone when you need too! Poor communication between their customers. Very indifferent towards customers. It's sad that this is the only dealership in town!,1.6
