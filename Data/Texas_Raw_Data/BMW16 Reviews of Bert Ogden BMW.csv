0,"May 14, 2020","Avoid this dealership if you're interested in a pre-owned car, the moment I agreed a price I was told everything was good then a day or so went past and I texted Mario who assured me it was being serviced, what a complete and utter lie. They sold the car and didn't tell me, I was willing to put down a deposit but they said nothing. If you want to buy a BMW go to San Antonio BMW. I will never buy from this dealership.",1.0
1,"April 23, 2020","FAILED:  To replace the disability plate on my trade-in with a disability plate for my new 2020 BMW Z4 as promised. FAILED: To properly register a clear title ( No Liens! ) with the DMV when the car was registered. This was the fourth new car purchased in the area in the last 10 years and the only experience I have regretted.

3,"September 03, 2019","Congrats to the entire service team at Bert Ogden BMW McAllen. The team is very efficient, polite and professional. I recently moved from another state and have an older model BMW but the staff continues to make me feel welcomed. Makes me even think about upgrading to a newer model, thank you Mr. Edson. Keep up the great work, I appreciate all the help.",4.8
4,"July 01, 2019","Worry free, no time wasted and extremely pleasant while being helpful: I don't even worry about my car anymore because I know that should something go wrong I can count on FRANK at parts and services to fix it. They know my time is valuable so Frank always makes sure the problem is resolved in a timely manner so I don't have to take time off of work. The best part is that they will pick up my car wherever it is and either lend me a car or pick/drop me off where I need to be. I honestly love that about my dealer. They are very AVAILABLE.

10,"September 20, 2013","I get a call from Mikkal Payne about a recent visit to Bert Ogden BMW and wanted to know how he could help me get into the vehicle I was looking at.  He asked me about my last visit and I told him the salesman, Leo, was not helpful at all and didn't really bother to help make a deal.  He assured me he could help me after making it clear I did not want the run around.  He said he would work on a deal so I would arrive and pick up the car.  I reaffirmed what my expectations were and told him I didn't want to waste my time as I did the first time around.   He assured me this would not be the case.  Guess what? I sat there for two hours trying to cut a deal.  Why I believed this experience would be different is beyond me.  I will say this salesman at least took the time to explain the features of the vehicle but was completely dishonest in getting me there.  I will never purchase a vehicle from Bert Ogden BMW nor recommend them.  ",1.5
11,"July 17, 2012","watch out! Bert Ogden BMW likes to sell vehicles with undisclosed damage.  we bought a New BMW X6.  after a week or so we notice some spots on the paint so we contacted the dealer ship and we were told it just needed to be buffed. so they buffed several times with same result. well now we are told that the vehicle need new paint.  Now they refuse to help or replace vehicle.

14,"October 30, 2011","My daughter and I went looking for a used car as she had been in an accident and needed to replace her vehicle.  The sales person approached us and right away wanted to get us to test drive a car. So we did. As soon as the drive was over I asked how much the car was, he said it was better for us to go inside the office to discuss the numbers, so we went inside. When inside I asked how much the car was and the sales guy refused to give me the price of the vehicle and said that it wasn't important because he was sure he could get it and the monthly amount I needed it to be. I said, ""How can you say the price doesn't matter? Of course it matters."" He then asked for my license and I asked, ""What do you need my license for?"" He said to fill out a paper, I asked, ""What's the paper for?"" He then raised his voice and said, ""I know what I'm doing, I've been doing this for 11 years!""  I then said, ""So you need my driver's license to tell me the price of the car?""  He said, ""Yes"".  I gave him my license only to see where this was going. He came back and then I asked him again, ""How much is the car?"" Again, he said, that the price didn't matter and that he could get it at the monthly price that I needed the car to be.  I told him that I was getting information so I could discuss it with my husband because he was working and couldn't come with us to help look for a car.  The guy got very upset and said, So no matter what I do you'r NOT going to buy a car from me!""  He then got up and walked out of the office. I don't know what this guy was trying to do but I told my daughter let's get out of here and we left.

I don't know what kind of business this is but selling cars is not one they are trying to do there. This sells guy was rude, unprofessional and  an idiot if he thought intimidation was going to work in selling a car.  I gave his manager an earfull before I left. I hope he got reprimended for the lousy job he did in not being professeional.  I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy and will definitely not purchase a car there no matter how much I needed one.  

I am happy to say that we purchased a great car at a great price and with an excellent sales representative that was not only professional and knows how to treat a client but also has become a trusted friend that will have my business as long I need a vehicle.  Great job Frank Smith Toyota!

15,"June 15, 2010","bought a car off of internet on 5-19-10, told deal done, arranging transport
found out backhandedly check wasn't cashed{3 wks later} and i needed to get a new 
loan at a worse rate. manager jim returned from vacation 6-14-10 and renigged on steve's promise ,from al, to cover my extra costs{loan} for starters.
ceasar was great, would have like to bought the car from him on initial contact 1 month ago.I understand why they didn't cash check, apologize, and cover my cost and time. They don't care about customer service. they'd rather seel car to someone else w/o discount than resolve this matter ethically and practically. 
i'm in chicago, so i'm glad i'm not stuck with further problems. who knows what they would of sent or pulled ultimately. watch out, waste of time classic rip-off dealer.
probably  not malicious as just clueless. but it doesn't matter. much wasted $ and time. ",2.3
