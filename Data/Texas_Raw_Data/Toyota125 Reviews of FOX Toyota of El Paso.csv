24,"November 30, 2018","The owners are not keeping up with their own employees standards. The owners never return call about the toyota techs and advisors, mgrs  do not do good work and advisors do not check on quality. Their attitude is degrade customer, blame them but demand their money .   No one supervises work. There is no shop forman. Repeat issues from over charging for things you don't need to leaving things in engine bay, to not doing work you asked them to. Very poor quality. Mr. Fox needs to reprimand the service ir keep going downhill for bad quality and horrible customer relations where they have intimidation 5actics and argue with customers. Angry apathy is not customer service. Neither is blaming customers for techs and awfull advisors attitudes. They scam customers. Managers make excuses that 8t is human error instead of expecting repair work to be done to Toyota standards.  ",1.0

I really don‚Äôt know how the sales manager ‚ÄúEric Ortega‚Äù is a manager. He was unprofessional, rude, unmannered much more disrespectful. I hope he does not talk to his mother or wife that way.

41,"April 20, 2018","On April 18th, at round 1pm I went to Hoy Fox dealership on 11165 Gateway Blvd W.  When I pulled up and got out of my car, a young salesman approached me and asked if he could help.  I told him yes that I wanted to look at a 2018 Tacoma and what kind of features they had on them.  We walked over to where there was one parked and I asked him first if he had any different colors besides white.  I say okay.  Then, at this time, I told him that I was just looking so see what they had to be able to make a decision.  He asked me if I was going to buy today.  I said no, not today.  He told me if was not buying today to come back when I was ready to buy and just walked away and left me standing in the middle of the lot when I was ready to ask more questions when he did that.  So, I left and I will not come back and I will let other people know about my very bad experience.  I recognized from your employees list below and his name is Adrian Armedariz.",1.0
42,"April 05, 2018","High pressure sales insisted I sign a contract at 9:30 p.m. at night.  Then, when I got into see the finance guy he insisted I buy the GAP insurance.  At first I said no then after further discussion I agreed.  By the time I got home I called the sales guy and told him I did not want the GAP insurance.  He said no problem and that he would alert finance and that I would need to sign some paperwork in the morning.  I arrived the next morning as soon as they opened and signed the refusal of GAP insurance.  I asked Matt (the finance manager) twice if my payment would go down to the original amount which he replied yes - twice.  Now, after two months, I found out my account was credited the GAP amount but my payment did not change.  I am paying the higher amount for a shorter period of time.  However, at this rate I will now pay off my vehicle in 62 months.  I could have financed the entire amount for 60 months at 0 percent interest rate.  I have a real problem with being pressured into signing things then being lied to.  Although I am happy with my car, I will not return to Hoy Fox since I no longer trust their upper management and high pressure sales - whether it be signing at night or insisting on the add ons during the finance process.  Matt lied to my face and did it in a way that I believed him and trusted him. Scary.  ",3.4

47,"February 01, 2018","Spoke to 2 sales rep on a day I called in about general info on  a truck Hoy Fox listed as for sale. Both asked for contact number to call back with info on the truck. One sales guy named Al Herrera called and texted that I needed to go in because it was going to sell fast due to low miles :A lot of pressure. The other very professionally provided his name as Raulio (forgot his name) info and confirmed it was still there and to contact him when needed. The fact is the truck was SOLD already! The dealer closed on Monday. I filled out online credit to see if qualified and requested NOT to have Al as salesperson because was not stopping the sales calls, texts and leaving messages for appts I never agreed to or set and sales manager Jaime was also telling me about appts he made that I never initiated or agreed to. Very deceptive. I said I needed to see about qualification terms before being bombarded by harrassing sales tactics. On Monday truck was removed as sold so no need to keep my information in system. I asked it be deleted after continued sales calls and since nothing there in the $20000 range for a Tundra or Tacoma. Texted the screen shot of continued sales email from Al after they told him not to call. Sonny told me to talk to their attorney and hung up on me when I said it is harrassing and would report as predatory business tactics and scary to be so pushy. When I texted his response to Jaime R the sales manager that is pushing the sales guys to call excessively then pretending they aren't he replied he could not help me since he was told I had gotten an attorney ( which is a lie by Sonny who was the one to refer me to dealership's attorney). Just lots of typical used car sales dysfunction. Do not buy from there. Very pushy and double dealer scam artists. ",1.0

67,"July 21, 2017","I was a loyal Honda customer but am now a converted Toyota customer. I always use Consumer Reports to help me in my decision concerning car purchases.  The Toyota Yaris was rated among the top 3 in small cars recommendations.  I went to the Chevrolet dealer and the car salesman did not want to make a deal with me at all.  Next on my list was Toyota. I had heard about the quality and reliability of Toyota vehicles but to see it was quite eye opening (the Yaris also had more standard options than the Chevrolet vehicle).  I was impressed by the friendly and professional customer service, knowledge and willingness to make a deal of the car salesman.  Their follow up services are impressive and are for the sole purpose of ensuring that I am aware of all that was included in the sale.  You are not dropped after the deal! There are plenty of bonus services from my free oil changes for two years to free emission inspections to comply with my yearly license renewal.   I wish I had purchased Toyota vehicles earlier.

115,"February 01, 2017","We traded in our vehicle in order to lease a new one. When we signed paperwork we were told that it was an even trade. We didn't have to pay anything extra. A couple of months passed and we started getting statements and phone calls about having to pay about 1,100 for other fees and wear a tear on our trade in vehicle (which was an excellent condition when we turned it in). We have been trying to solve this problem for about 2 months now and keep getting the run around. The sad part is that we are not the first ones that they do this to. We've come across other people that have had the same problem with this car dealership. It's a matter of time that this place will eventually have a bad reputation. As for now we will no longer do business with them. We will warn others as well. ",1.8

119,"July 22, 2015","Had scheduled my new Highlander purchase for July 15, 2015. Arrived on time and was promptly greeted and offered a seat and coffee. My contact arrived promptly and the process began at 10:00 am. Miguel De La Mora handled our purchase and was quite excellent in introducing me to the new 2015 Highlander. After a quick tour of the vehicle, Miguel took our information and made arrangements to transfer the vehicle. Miguel was prompt and quite professional in all his actions.  A short time later I was introduced to Matthew A. McCoey, who completed the financials and our purchase arrangements were complete. In just over an hour I had my new car! I should mention that I selected and ordered the vehicle over the internet as I was driving over six hours to purchase from Hoy Fox Toyota! I highly recommend Steve Fox, Barry Nester, and the entire Toyota team at Hoy Fox Toyota.",5.0

121,"November 28, 2012","Had an appointment set up with J. and when I arrived I was left waiting for a good 20 minutes then sat a desk with other salesmen talking among each other and i was never acknowledged, after they were finished J. decided to come out and finally greet us, I explained I was looking for a new Prius but right off the bat was taken to go see a used model, once I explained I was not interested, I was taken to go see only on the outside the new models, back at the office he was so quick to dismiss me when I said my husband was deployed and needed to consult with him, after that it was all down hill, he gave me basically the same price on the used Prius than on the new ones but was very quick to say that he could only sell me that one due to my less than perfect credit history, and invited me to leave the office. I know there where people waiting for him but I had made an appointment.

I just went to spend my time and gas to receive a rude treatment by J from hoy fox Toyota.",1.0
122,"August 08, 2012",Wow!  Where do I start?  These poeple are crooks.  They will try and force you to buy extended warranties after they agree to a price and tell you that it is required for the lower interest rate they've already promised you.  Then they tell you you still don't qualify for the lower rate once you've already agreed tot he crappy terms.  Stay away from these con artists!,1.0
123,"April 30, 2011","THE SALES MAN WAS VERY KIND, PATIENT, HELPFUL, AND VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE WITH THE FOUR-RUNNER HE SOLD US. HE NEVER PRESURED US TO BUY, GAVE US OUR SPACE, AND TIME TO MAKE OUR DECISION. MANAGEMENT WAS COOPERATIVE AND WILLING TO GO BEHIND THE NORM TO ENSURE OUR DECISION WAS TO OUR SATISFACTION.",4.8
124,"April 26, 2011"," I had a wonderful experience at Hoy Fox Toyota in El Paso Texas last week. Being a First time car buyer is difficult especially if nobody is with you but they made the business easy and fun.I got to experience to test drive the car that I wanted, they give you time to think, they give you personal tips on how to handle the car. Mr. Casares, the employee who patiently explained in detailed the all-abouts of Toyota Rav4 is awesome.He is very enthusiastic and did a really excellent job in his task. I also appreciate Mr. Mathew's versatility and kindness. He helped me to get an affordable full coverage insurance. These 2 employees are new in the area but incredibly great in this business.  I would be recommending Hoy Fox Toyota (Gateway West, El Paso) to my friends and families!
