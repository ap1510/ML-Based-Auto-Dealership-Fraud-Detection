I really enjoyed working with Chris and appreciated how he worked with me. I trusted him and he made me feel at ease. He's a great salesman in that he never pressured me and always listened to what I wanted. 
The vehicle arrived and it was everything I wanted with the exception of the weather proof mats we agreed to but Gullo made good on the promise and provided WeatherTech mats. They look great!
I would have given them a 5/5 but the aftermarket protection package I purchased did not turn out as I expected for the price paid. After some discussion with Pedro he made it right. I really appreciated the fact that even though I was upset he always treated me with respect and we worked out the issue.
I fully recommend Gullo Ford in Conroe and I especially recommend Chris Whitehead as sales and Pedro as service, They both treated me as you would want them too and I got what I consider a good deal. Next time I am looking for a new vehicle I will save myself some time and go straight to Gullo and Chris.

238,"December 08, 2019","JR was a pleasure to work with. My husband & I had been looking to replace my SUV that flooded three months ago. We'd visited a ton of dealerships in the Houston area & were going to make a final decision this past week. Visiting Gullo Ford 45 minutes away was a last minute decision, but I'm glad we took a chance. I called the dealership the day before to find out if the cars I wanted to look at were still available. I was greeted by a nice young lady on the phone who got me transferred to used car sales where I spoke with JR. He was great & got my phone number, sent me a text and FOLLOWED up with me the next day! There was absolutely no pressure from the test drives to negotiating a purchase price. There were also no outlandish fees & I appreciated not having to sort through BS line by line. I do think that the fact that the dealership is family owned plays a part in the family-like atmosphere which is a plus. I was greeted upon entering but not 'hounded'.

My family always purchases cars with pre-approved financing of our own, but decided to have JR & Jeff see if they could get us a better deal and they did. 

My husband is due for a car in the next year or so and we plan on coming back to Gullo to see JR. In fact, I told Jeff that I'm so glad I didn't allow the Yelp reviews to deter me. I think often times people take time to leave reviews about unpleasant experiences, but as an avid Yelper myself, I know the importance of giving kudos to service-based businesses when they do a good job so kudos to y'all & happy holidays!",4.2

Mary Chan was my sales rep and she stayed in touch across my buying time period. I never felt pressured, but she probably did with my needs. She is great to work with for new and used cars. 

Financing was smooth and fairly quick to navigate. I did learn my finance guy wishes he was a left handed bowler, and who also has a side interest in taxidermy. He handed me my paperwork on a Gullo imprinted flash drive and I was driving home 30 minutes later.

After you purchase a vehicle multiple people call you about forgotten items during the process. Very annoying.

I dealt with Nidia on my initial visit to look at the dealership (I'm new in area) and see the selections of F-350 trucks.  I was extremely impressed by her knowledge of the systems on the vehicle.  She listened as I told her my needs and suggested several vehicles that would fit my needs.  She did not try and oversell or pressure me into a  more expensive truck.  On my return visit, Nidia was with another client so she asked Ben to continue with the sale to show the several trucks to me and my wife.  He spent quite a while going over the different options were available on the different vehicles that we had narrowed it down to.   During our wait for financing, we talked with Ben about our exploits during our last two years of traveling the US and found him very personable.   He found out that I was a Vietnwm veteran and he thanked me for my service which I really appreciated.  Overall we believe we received a good deal and met two incredible people.

608,"October 16, 2017","I have never had  a worse experience at a service department in my life.  I towed my 2007 Ford Escape Hybrid to the dealership after the engine stalled in the middle  of the Interstate with a „Stop safely now“ sign on. Within a week they told me that I had to replace the DC/DC converter. I trusted them but luckily I bought an used part which saved me over $2000! That did not resolve the issue though.
They kept my vehicle for nearly two months w/o any resolution. I even provided them with a compiled list of error causes which I researched for hours on the internet. No success. Most of the time I had to call them to get an status update – what a terrible customer service! After five weeks I wrote an email to the regional manager in order to get Ford Motor Company involved (I asked for the provision of an experienced field technician  and a loaner). Both requests were denied by referring to an internal Ford policy which does not provide these services for vehicles older than 10y. Apparently, Ford is not able or willing to resolve security issues of their own vehicles – so much about their comittment to customers and hybrid technology. In the end, the dealership made me still pay nearly $1000 for labor and parts although the vehicle was not running! Scandalous! 
Brought the vehicle to an independent garage which diagnosed and fixed the issue (series of damaged wiring harness) within 48h for less than Gullo charged me. Also they confirmed my suspicion that the replacement of the DC/DC converter was unnecessary – the damaged wiring harness caused the error code and the DC DC converter not to work. Scandalous! I wrote them an email to ask for a refund but they just evaded by saying how much labor they have not charged me for.
Two lessons learned: 1) Ford Motor Company is not comitted to its vehicles once they are outside the warranty period and provided no support despite an obvious security issue and lack of repair progress at the dealership. This was the last Ford vehicle I have purchased! 
2) The Hybrid technicians at Gullo are unqualified, discouraged and inexperienced. I never felt appreciated, adequately adviced and supported by Gullo Ford – neither by their “certified“ technicians nor by their service manager and service advisors.
In a nutshell:I am highly disappointed and will never return! If google allowed me to give 0 stars I certainly would do so!",1.2

Quincy answers questions he has the information on, and knows when he doesn't have an answer...and then he goes to get it. He has a strong knowledge of Ford's product line, and makes a point of expanding that knowledge when he finds a gap.

777,"October 22, 2016","I purchased a new F-150 from Gullo Ford in 2014 which was a pretty good experience. I returned last week believing loyalty mattered to Gullo. 

It is normal to expect that trade-in appraisal would come somewhat low. They appraised my trade-in at far less than KBB Instant Cash offer (usually less than trade-in range) to the point I felt insulted. At that point, I decided to see if we could work a deal without trade, but that appraisal left a really bad taste. I didn't get a good feeling, so I ended up sleeping on their offer and I'm glad I did. 

I went to different Ford dealership instead. I've got much better deal on my trade (definitely inside the trade range) and also a great deal on my new 2016 F-150 Lariat. They genuinely wanted to make a deal happen and worked with me. 

What a bummer for Gullo... they speak a great game, but their actions and methods don't. All in all, they lost me as a customer.

I WAS A LITTLE MAD BUT THEN THEY SAID THEY FORGOT TO CHARGE ME $399 FOR WINDOW TINT NOW I THINK I AM ON CAMERA AND THIS IS A JOKE BUT IT GETS BETTER. SO WE NEGOTIATE THE $399 WINDOW TINT TO $199 AND THEY SEND ME INTO FINANCE REMEMBER I SAID I HAD PERFECT CREDIT SO I KNOW GOING INTO FINANCE I WILL GET 0% FROM FORD.

SHE SAID OH YES YOU DID GET 0% BUT YOU WILL LOOSE OVER $5300 IN REBATES. I SAID GET THE SALES MANAGER BECAUSE HE TOLD ME BEFORE NO REBATES WILL APPLY TO THE PRICE ON SPECIAL. SO THE DOG AND PONY CIRCUS ACT GETS BETTER SHE GETS THE MANAGER AND HE SAYS TO ME IN FRONT OF THE FINANCE LADY I EXPLAINED TO YOU EARLIER ABOUT THE REBATES AND I SAID YES YOU DID THAT THE SPECIAL PRICE YOU CANNOT USE ANY REBATES SO I CAN USE MY 0% AND I WILL BE ON MY MARRY WAY. THEN THEY LEFT ROOM CAME BACK AND SAID WE CANNOT DO THAT THE PRICE OF THE TRUCK WILL GO UP $5300. WELL AT THIS POINT I HAD ENOUGH AFTER 4 HOURS OF THIS CIRCUS ACT SO I SAID F$#$ THIS I AM LEAVING.

The Finance department is a joke and doesn't have a clue as to what they are doing I was sent home with paperwork to have signed by cosigner when I returned it they couldn't be bothered to check and give me my copy they wait a few days then start hounding me that they missed something. If you would have checked it when I returned it the this wouldn't be an issue. Pretty much only go here if you aren't in a hurry and don't mind sitting around for them cause they will make you wait.they will never receive my business or any of my friends. They have no idea how to treat a customer. Oh the manager will offer to buy you a cup of coffee. It's free everything else costs though. They also messed me out of the 250 down payment assistance they supposedly were giving and the 500 dollar college assistance. Jason Banks makes you wait so long that you forget everything so you are just ready and to leave.

794,"April 29, 2015","Went to Gullo Ford in Conroe TX looking for a new/used SUV for my wife. Walking the lot, we found a fully loaded used Ford Edge. A salesman named Brandon came out to meet us. This guy didn't know much about the vehicle even though he worked at a Ford dealership. I really didn't need his help to figure out if we liked the vehicle or not so I let it go. We found a piece of the tailgate interior that was missing (small 2"" x 4"" rectangle) and Brandon assured us that he would replace it. Then I noticed, as we continued to look at the vehicle, that he couldn't remember my name or my wife's name. Anyway, I made a deal and we went off to the finance department. This lady was rather brash and was trying to rush me, which I didn't appreciate but let roll off my back. Throughout this process, I realized that this person couldn't remember our names either. BTW we have very common names. We bought the Ford Edge that evening and felt good about the deal. Now I just need to get the tailgate fixed up and we will be finished. Well Brandon, who still can't remember our names, decided to become even less customer friendly and wouldn't return any voice mails that were left. So I went into the dealership again and had him paged. After 20 minutes and another page, he finally showed up and gave me the sob story about his personal life. He again promised to fix the tailgate and keep in touch with us. Admitting that he had not done a good job of that this far. Well, 2 weeks later and 2 more voice mails not returned, I went back into the dealership and had him paged. After about 10 minutes of waiting and about 5-6 people asking if I had been helped, I was getting rather upset. If I was a cartoon, I would have had smoke coming out of my ears. The used car manager named Willie noticed and came over to inquire. I informed him of the promise made and lack of communication from his salesman Brandon. Willie did what any good customer service minded manager would do and took my problem over immediately. He set up an appointment and got the tailgate fixed. While I was waiting for the service to be completed, Brandon passed me 3 times and made sure to continue his level of customer service by not acknowledge me at all. Nothing has been said, no voice mails returned, no apology offered for the horrible customer service that I received from Gullo Ford in Conroe Tx. I am very sorry that Brandon was working that evening and we ended up doing business with him. I am very sorry for stepping foot on the Gullo Ford car lot. I offer 1 star and only 1 star to Willie the used car manager for his involvement. Otherwise this place sucks! ",2.0

796,"December 19, 2014","Gullo Ford is by far the closest and most conveniently located Ford Dealership for us. We really tried our best to give them first and last opportunity to sell us a fully loaded 2014 Escape. We gave them the itemized quote of Ryan Ford and they still couldn't beat it so they lost the initial sale. We also got the full 7 yr extended warranty and the maintenance/tire care plans.
We thought no problem since we can always use them for service with our Ford ESP. My wife has taken it in twice to them and both times has been told the Ford ESP wasn't in the system so they couldn't do anything. Ryan Ford even sent them copies of all the paperwork.
The first question out of their mouth every time is ""Did you purchase this from us?"". The answer is a resounding ""No, but we have the Ford ESP"". I guess this drops us down their priority list because my wife has had to wait each time as others are ushered ahead (no appointments allowed). There is an air of rudeness with how they handle customers as can be seen by their abysmal reviews online here and other customer service rating sources.
Bottom line is this: If Gullo ever wants our service or future purchases, they should send a manager down to Ryan Ford in Crosby TX (West of Katy on I-10) to learn how people like to be treated. I can not praise them enough and even if I ever moved out of state, I would still buy from them.",1.5
797,"October 06, 2014","The service department is by far the absolute worst. On my first 2 visits there was zero communication between the advisers and myself. Both times I had to find out my vehicle was complete by inquiring myself...after they said my truck wasn't even showing in their system. At least a dozen calls went unanswered at the service dept.  First visit was due to a failed warrantied brake caliper that overheated the rim, causing the balance weights to fall off of the tire.  Requested to have a balance performed and covered by the dealership when I dropped it off--they agreed and never performed the tire re-balance...also requested an oil change be performed.  When I picked it up, they didn't have a record of me requesting that or the oil change and said it (balance) wasn't covered under Warranty anyway.  Second visit, dropped truck off Thursday for a faulty EGR valve and again when I called Saturday...no record of my truck being there.  Went to Enterprise on site and there wasn't a rental authorized from Gullo so I paid out of pocket.  Even the Enterprise rep could not get a hold of anyone at the service department after 6 tries to authorize the rental on the warranty.  Save your time and have the work done at Planet Ford 45 or Tomball Ford where you actually receive customer service.

I am always recieving flyers in the mail from Gullo wanting to purchase my vehicles back, so the other day while getting my oil changed at Gullo I decided to let them look at my vehicle and give me a cash price. Chris Pinto introduced himself and explained that he would inspect the vehicle and give me a price. I gave Chris a call later that evening and he explained to me that Gullo would buy the car for $10,000. I thought this was a fair price for the car and setup an appointment with Chris to come in and sale the car. The day of the appointment I called Gullo to speak with Chris to make sure everything was still good with the deal and the receptionist explained to me that Chris was not at work today! This is when I started having doubts, but I spoke with the manager David Bracewell (who I personally bought my last vehicle from) and he assured me to come on in that everything was fine and Gullo would buy the vehicle for $10,000 just like Chris had explained to me prior. So I take off work that day and my wife juggles her work schedule to make the appointment to go to Gullo and we get there and David and his salesman offer me $7,000 for the car. Chris Pinto and David Bracewell lied to me to get me to the dealership and try and lowball me on the price. I dont appreciate being lied to and the dishonest tactics Gullo tryed to pull with me!!!!!

The first time my fiance and I went out just to look, ended up test driving. The second time I went out, my dad insisted on going so that I wouldn't get screwed around with the price as I had never bought/financed a car before. Met with the same sales guy as the first time. Test drove the car again, I knew that that was the car that I wanted. He kept leaving the lot to go take phone calls, which pissed my dad off so he was quickly losing interest. Once we got inside to look over numbers, of course the advertised price that's on the marquee is for the ""ad car"" that the guy says they hadn't had on the lot for almost two weeks, go figure. My dad starts asking questions about price and financing, the guy does the whole ""let me go check with so-and-so"" bit a few times. Ultimately, the price of the car ended up being about 7500 bucks over what the ""ad car"" was going for and they would not budge on the price. The only upside of my visit to this dealership was experiencing what car buying SHOULD NOT be. I did buy the new Fusion, however, I went to Ryan Ford in Sealy.

Upon 3 differnt visits, I was dissapointed each time due to what seemed to me as deceiving business practices. If you don't feel like reading all the details (sorry, I had to ""vent"" somewhere), I'm basically upset becuase of the gimmicks they pulled. I know it's typical for a dealership to do this, but they offered me my worse car-shopping experience as of yet.  I would not reccomend them to anyone.

The first time I just went to look, knowing the price of the Mustang I wanted would be too high, so I didn't want to have my credit run.  The salesman told me about this ""special offer"" of $5000 on my mustang and (me being inexperienced with car buying) I believed him. I then let them run my credit & afterward he realized he had made a mistake -- it was $5000 off of the Saleen, not the base model I was looking at. Then he tried to get me to sign some paper saying I agreed to this much-too-high price. I left dissapointed with no car.

A few months later, I went back checking on an add I saw on T.V. advertising $7,000 off MSRP. I asked a salesman (different from the first time) about any specials they had & he told me they had $5,000 off.  When I questioned him, he had to ""go check with his manager"" and came back happy to tell me that it WAS $7,000 off.  Unfortunantly, and the salesman was unwilling to negoiate.

I came back a couple days later to try again with another salesman. I wound up getting the same guy, but we got somewhere this time. He called his sales manager Mike over to discuss things with me. Mike told me my price estimates were way off -- I pulled out the paper I printed with calculations and he said ""oh, I guess you are right."" Then he came back with an offer saying that the special of $7,000 off ended two days ago. He reassured me it had ended when I seemed suprised. Then I showed him the paper I printed straight from his website that said the offer hadn't expired yet. He walked away and I didn't see him after that. I tried to talk for a bit after that with the finance people, but they seemed unwilling to work as well. Once again I left dissapointed -- but this time I'm certain I'll never be going back.",1.7
