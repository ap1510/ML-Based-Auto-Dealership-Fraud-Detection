He never pressured for details and was very amiable and casual throughout the process, yet never failed to exhibit professionalism.",4.6
1,"May 09, 2020","We are very disappointed after 3 days of back and forth. We have been shopping for a CT6,  and decided to drive 4 hours for this specific car.  When we got there the Nathan was unavailable, so we spoke with a different rep. As we were getting ready to test drive the rep told us he had to ride along. We explained that we didn't feel safe doing that because of Coronavirus. So he went to get the manager Jeff for approval. To which Jeff informed us that because of thefts they have to either ride with us or give them the keys to our own personal vehicle. He acted as if current license current insurance, and our own personal vehicle being on the lot was not enough. Needless to say we left because our lives are more important than an insecure manager, and a test drive. Social distancing is still in affect, but this location does not want to honor that. Please know that we have done a test drive on 3 other vehicles at 3 different locations,  and this has never been an issue. ",1.0

4,"March 07, 2020",Jeremy Nelson was our salesman and he delivered excellent customer service. My husband and I purchased a Cadillac Escalade. Jeremy was very professional and he was patient with us as we made up our mind not to get the Armada but to get the Escalade instead. I would also like to thank everyone involved with making this happen!,5.0

despite problems with our insurance this dealership stepped up to provide help with a loaner vehicle for us.  they also went above and beyond to ensure quality parts were installed versus insurance recommendation to install salvage parts.",5.0
6,"February 06, 2020",The entire staff was very understanding and was willing to work with my situation and truly find a solution that I could live with and I am very happy with the decision.

7,"October 12, 2019","Purchasing or leasing a new vehicle can be exciting and draining at the same time. Rest assured, you will be able to embrace the thrill of driving off in a new vehicle AND exceptional customer service at Garland Cadillac. They were able to provide me with a great selection of vehicles to choose from, while simultaneously ensuring that I was getting into a vehicle I could afford, as well as LOVE. 

Be sure to ask for Robert Villa. Robert and Jeff Rosser are a strong team that will work hard to make sure that you are a happy, lifelong customer. ",5.0

9,"September 14, 2019",I have bought many cars in my years but I must say that this was the best service I have received! The GM personally came out to thank me and all the managers treated me with respect even though I had many questions! I highly recommend that you go and see them to buy your next car! They will treat you like family from the second you enter the dealership! Ask for Jeff or Rez! Great management team!,5.0
10,"September 04, 2019","We drove a considerable distance to get to this dealership because of an advertised price on a vehicle.  I exchanged text messages with Rez about the vehicle, but he never disclosed the reconditioning fee of $1100 until we got there.  He said it was disclosed online, but I couldn't find it.  I would never buy a vehicle from this place if they aren't up front with their pricing.  During my search for a vehicle, I visited 4 additional dealerships of which none had hidden fees. I wonder what else they are trying to cover up?",1.0

16,"April 17, 2019","Problem 1. I found a Cadillac online from this dealer and when I went to look at the car it was not there. The sales lady Chris(spellcheck) was amazing and wanted to be sure I had the car I desired so she offered to show me a few other cars of the same model and year. I was about to finalize the price but the GENERAL SALES MANAGER Jeff(namecheck) came in to continue the negotiations.  Well Jeff was RUDE and VERY UNPROFESSIONAL, and threw his GSM title around as if he was better than everyone around him and he as if he was the one who makes the price. He pretty much told me I would have to pay almost $3,500 more than what was listed after the Saleslady Chris showed me my take home price with tax and other fees included.  Jeff attempted to intimidate me into buying the car by saying he can sale 15 of these cars in 30 days, and I didn't need to know his bottom line.  Thanks to Jeff, Garland Cadillac did not get my business, and I still Bought the Cadillac XTS I wanted at a much better price, lower miles and  with a much better GENERAL SALES MANAGER and team in Irving.

17,"April 16, 2019","Timely service, friendly, professional. Identified our performance issue, took corrective action and then explained what actions they took. Our service rep Michael made sure we were not inconvenienced time wise, by providing a loan car to us until servicing had been completed the next day.",5.0

19,"March 31, 2019",Service at Garland Cadillac is always fast and great.  Good quality workmanship by their staff and they are honest and dependable to find critical repairs needed through their through diagnostic procedures. ,5.0
20,"March 11, 2019","I bought a 2018 XTS which was supposedly ""certified pre-owned"" before I left the lot. At the very end of the deal, with all the paperwork signed I was told by Jimmy Williams, there was an open recall on the car for an O2 sensor, (even though the AutoCheck History report stated no open recalls). Williams claimed that it was no big deal & could be fixed in about an hour & bring the car back on Mon. On the way home I decided to give the car my own personal cleaning/detailing & discovered the two front tires on the Passenger side had sliced/cut on sidewall & Drivers side starting to peel/cut on sidewall), the salesperson, Williams & myself had made note of the treadwear of the two front tires during my initial inspection, I was given a “we owe” two tires @ cost document to be used about 2 months down the road to replace the (based on treadwear) . Upon seeing the condition of the tires were more urgent than expected, I immediately called Jimmy Williams & was told I would be taken care of because ""I am his cadillac customer"". Come Mon 1st I was told the recall was closed but had not been updated? Regarding the tires, I found out what being a ""cadillac customer"" to Williams meant, me, the ""cadillac customer"" would be given the unmatched privilege of the ""run-around""""double-talk"" 3+ hour wait and above all that a $290 invoice for two new tires on a cadillac that I had owned less than 48 hours!  If that is a what being a ""cadillac customer"" is about, next year I will be a ""continental customer"". By the way, on the other side of the service dept loud angry shouting is heard from another “cadillac customer” , I pointed that incident out (because I was at the point of joining in the shouting) Jimmy Williams reply to handling angry “cadillac customers” quote: “I will handle them all as they come”. It appears the  “used car” salesman, the one we all dread dealing with is alive at Garland Cadillac, but he won’t be doing as well as he thinks, when word gets around about the angry “cadillac customers” they are able to handle. It appears Williams thinks angry customers are normal and essential parts of doing business? What a sham; what a shame!

27,"January 21, 2019","I am a first time customer.  I called the dealership to find out how to schedule an oil change. The lady on the phone connected me to the department. I quickly made the appointment. I arrived the day of the appt , was greeted promptly. My car was taken back immediately for service.  We waited in the customer lounge and drank hot coffee until they came and told us the car was ready. They washed the car and I must say they did a better job than the car wash I pay for.  all in all it was a very pleasant experience.",5.0
28,"January 05, 2019","My experience at Garland Cadillac was the exact opposite of ideal. I chose to buy a used Audi Q3 from them because admittedly their price was fantastic compared to others that I had found up to that point. The salesman I then dealt with was also wonderful so I took the plunge and decided to buy the car. The part that brings the entire facility down is the manager, Brad Bemis. While I was looking at the vehicle, he made me feel as if I shouldn’t be buying a car without my husband present (I’m a woman). On top of that, after I purchased the car, the key did not work. When I asked Brad to help out he told me it wasn’t his problem and I should take it to Audi Dallas. When I told this to Audi Dallas, they were very taken aback that a dealership would say such a thing and because I didn’t buy the car from them, they unfortunately couldn’t help. After going back to Brad yet again, he said he didn’t recall that conversation at all and could fix the key for $300. I explained that I didn’t believe I should pay for this because I just spent thousands of dollars at his dealership. He countered that my car was not expensive enough for him to care compared to others on his lot. He then proceeded to imply several times that I was lying and that I was unreasonable throughout our conversation. It’s a shame almost everyone else I worked with was pleasant because their management completely ruined my experience. ",1.4

33,"October 25, 2018","The quality of service was poor, compared to what I ‘d received in the past from Massey. Even my experience with Michael was less pleasant than what I’d experienced in the past.  After waiting 2hrs I expected to receive all requested services. I asked that my vehicle be washed along with my service and a piss poor job was done. Wheels and windows were still filthy from the past weeks rain. The body of the car may have been rinsed off at most. Dirt was still on the vehicle as well. I’ve yet to receive a return call from Michael about my complaint. ",1.8

35,"October 05, 2018",You would think after spending over $70k dollars at a dealership that you would at least be treated average. Not the case here...the service techs have always been rude to put it mildly. I absolutely dread calling them to schedule my oil changes. The service tech always makes you feel like it’s a bother. So much so I don’t take advantage of my “FREE LIFETIME” car wash service because either my 2018 XT5’s (yes I bought 2 of them on the same day) come back dirtier than I delivered it to them because they use dirty rags or I’m always told how “Backed Up” they are. The ONLY reason I return to that Garland Cadilac (formally known as Massey Cadillac) is because Sewell Cadilac is too far from where I live. With that said I will not purchase another Cadilac in the future because unfortunately that is the closest dealer to me. Save yourself the headache DONT GO!,2.4

He showed me the Jeep, answered my questions and offered the customary test drive. He did not pressure a sale and when I told him that I was going to go look at another vehicle I had identified, he thanked me for considering theirs and let me know that he would be able to help me later if I needed him. I did opt for the Massey vehicle and upon my return to their dealership, ATA quickly executed my cash purchase- no hard sale options or financing pitch.

Brian was helpful from the moment he answered the phone, found the vehicle immediately, and arranged a time for me to come to the dealership later that day to start the process. They were able to complete the transfer, get financing, and meet all my expectations in around a week. My new car is everything I hoped, and the experience of purchasing was easy, fast and painless.

60,"February 26, 2018","This is the second time I have took My Cadillac CTS-V for body repair. This first time was good. This time was horrible.

The attention to detail is not there at all. Both my wife and I noticed a spot on the paint they had to buff out when we arrived to pick it up. This should have been noticed before the customer noticed.

Part of the repair was either repairing a wheel or a whole new wheel. Jay told us that I had an after market wheel. This is 100% false. A manager should know what he is talking about, especially at Cadillac dealer. My wheels were an OEM wheel that was offered by the manufacturer not a dealer. He sent the wheel to get repaired. The wheels were black chrome wheels. That was very plain and obvious to see. The wheel shop ruined the wheel by painting the wheel. There was zero discussion about how they plan to replace the ruined wheel or anything.  
I am wanting to keep the old wheel as a back up just in case.
This wheel should now be replaced to compensate for the ruined wheel at this point.

I am now driving with mismatched wheels... NOT HAPPY!!

These wheels are not easy to find. I am still waiting on the replacement wheel.",2.4

65,"January 08, 2018","Bottom line:  A++++ dealership with a professional staff!  We were out of state buyers in search of a replacement SUV for our family.  Contacted the dealership by phone prior to travelling to Texas to verify vehicle was available.  From first contact, our Sales person, Jarryd Armstrong, was extremely friendly and professional.  I shared with him my concern on purchasing a vehicle in Texas and getting it registered and titled in the state we lived in.  He alleviated my concerns and relayed the process to do so.  We scheduled an appointment with him and other dealerships around the area to look at SUVs we have been researching.  Decided to stop by Massey Cadillac first due to our initial phone conversation and glad we did so.

When we arrived at Massey, our pleasant experience continued.  We were met by Jarryd Armstrong and was introduced to the Director, Jim Palmer.  It was evident after meeting with Jim, that the friendly and professional environment was embraced by all levels of the team.  

As you all know, buying a car can be an arduous process.  The Massey team, was very efficient and was able to alleviate us from the painstaking process while offering a fair price.  We were able to drive off the lot happy and excited to share our experience.

Thank you Jarryd, Jim, and Massey Cadillac staff for the wonderful experience.  We will definitely be back and will spread the word. ",5.0

I had such a horrible experience with them lying at the other dealership that I actually returned the car to them and demanded a full refund. I called Brian at Massey’s and he said the car was still available and the original deal was still open to me. I was welcomed back in with open arms and purchased a super nice car for my daughter. Brian and JB were so nice to me and treated me very good after I backed out from buying the first time. I thanked them welcoming me back and being beyond honest with me about the car I purchased.

72,"October 26, 2017","I was in the market for a dependable used vehicle for my 16 year old daughter. I found a vehicle online at Massey Cadillac. Ata Barakat was extremely prompt, friendly, and helpful from the very first contact. I Went to check out the car, where O was greeted by Ata and Tresh Goodwin. Both were extremely friendly and cordial, and I ended up buying a super clean, well cared for 2008 Toyota Camry.  Negotiations were very easy and relaxed. Also extremely quick. I was there only about 1 1/2 hours. There was a significant chip in the windshield that concerned me, so I asked if they could repair it. They said, “”Of course, no problem.”  I scheduled a time to bring vehicle back, and when inspected by their glass guy he said that the chip couldn’t be repaired. Ata and Massey then came through again. They told me that they would replace the whole windshield since the chip was unrepairable. I didn’t even have to ask, they offered on their own. Here I was a customer at a dealership that sales brand new Cadillac’s of all kinds, and I had purchased a $7,000 used Camry with an escalating windshield issue. Due to this they could have easily blown me off, and sent me on my way. They did not. It was the exact opposite.  They treated me the same as if I had just purchased a $100,000 Escalade. This day and age that type of service is hard to come by. Truly first class operation from top to bottom. I was blown away, and my daughter is happy as can be.

Mr. Barakat was so kind and considerate taking as much time as I needed to understand all details he presented.  An unexpected plus was the beautiful color (Silver Moonlight) he found for me.  Mr. Barakat is a great salesman, very  friendly and a really sharp dresser!  

It is important to point out that my husband (and now me) only wanted to buy cars from Massey because of Michael Davis in Service.  He is a first class people person and has always taken care of us in a professional but low key and friendly manner.  I'm sure he treats all his customers the same way.  He is a real plus for Massey.",5.0

Of course when Mr. Massey actually ran this dealership it was the best and customers were treated with the utmost respect. This is not the case anymore...I wouldn't buy another car nor have any service done there ever again. I brought my CTS in to have it repaired for damage from hitting debris on the highway. First, I was put off, lied to and then when came to pick it up my drivers seat had quit working. Until I brought it back for this....no one said anything about it...then I was told it wasn't working properly when they were fixing the car. Upon further investigation and looking under the seat one of the employees house key was found under the seat...hummm was my car being driven by employees as their private vehicle??? What went on with my vehicle while in the care of Massey Cadillac. I was also told at that time they would not diagnose the problem unless I paid between $800 to $1200 dollars. My insurance company even asked them to diagnosed the problem to see if they would pay for the seat....after waiting a week and a half...I called back again and was told that my insurance company had not gotten back with them. I called my insurance company to see why they hadn't gotten back with Massey. I was then told by the adjuster that this was not true...the insurance company was still waiting on Massey to diagnose the problem and then they would determine if they would pay as part of the insurance settlement.

108,"September 19, 2015","I purchase a pre-owned 08 Cadillac CTS. We've noticed a huge slash on the back passenger tire which is also visible in the pictures we took on last Friday evening. Contacted the dealer and they were closed. I definitely understand I signed an AS-IS document, however, this issue is something I take very serious due to the fact we could have experienced a blowout on the freeway, not only damaged the vehicle, but we could've been injured. I'm just lost for words at this being overlooked during the initial inspection of the vehicle and wondering if the dealership would replaced the tire. NOT

Secondly, I questioned Ata, my salesrep about not being able to open the back passenger door from the outside when he attempted to sit in the back prior to our test drive. He stated the child safety lock is on and opened the door from the inside.I was so eager to purchase the vehicle that I forgot to mention and verify the door was working properly. Well, since then I've now attempted to open the door from the outside and it will not OPEN.

Lastly, my initial request before finalizing the deal was to detail the inside of the vehicle and and attempt to remove the visible stains on the panel, seatbelts, and the seats. This was not done and it shouldn't be an expense for me due to purchasing and doing business with Massey Cadillac.

He did not have to do that but insisted and did it with a smile.. I can assure you I will be recommending Don Massey Cadillac.

111,"December 02, 2014","Sales experience -- 5  GREAT!!
Service after the Sale -- 1 POOR

Purchased a car entirely by text, phone and email.  Sales process worked seamlessly and delivery by my salesperson Sam was arranged at my home.  Took a half day off work to get possession of the vehicle.  Was EXTREMELY happy at this point.

Signed a bunch of documents at my home and Sam gave an in-depth explanation of the cars features.  Noticed what appeared to be a defect in the paint at this time and Sam assured me Massey Cadillac would fix it.  Later in the day I found that this paint defect was in fact a door ding.   Massey apparently has a program for vehicles purchased from it and repaired by it whereby a salesperson delivers a loan car to the person's home and drives the car in for service, later returning the car and picking up the loan car upon completion of the repairs (this is fabulous in theory, not so great in practice for people who work.) 

Notified the next day that Sam forgot to get my signature on a document, so took another 1/2 day off work so he could bring the document to me to sign.  After waiting at home an hour past our arranged time, he rescheduled to another day, so another 1/2 day off work.  He also took a photo of the door ding and told me he would be in contact with me at a later date to arrange for delivery of the loan car.

Arrangements made a week later for repair of the door ding, so another 1/2 day off work to be there for the loan car swap.  Less than an hour before our appointment, Sam tries to reschedule to another day.  I CANNOT take any more time off work, so I have decided instead to have the car repaired (at my own cost, including the cost of a rental car while being repaired) because I don't want to deal with multiple more 1/2 days off work.",3.0

115,"February 01, 2014","My husband and I were only looking at cars a few Saturdays ago.  We were considering either a Audi, BMW or Cadillac. I had never driven a Cadillac before and thought I should drive one before I made my final decision.  I was really leaning toward a BMW.   Our intention was to go to Plano and as we drove down 635 we saw Massey and my husband said, ""hey let's stop there.""  We did and were fortunately greeted by Frank Martin.  From that moment on we were treated the best we have ever been treated by a salesperson.  Frank was courteous, knowledgeable, patient and just perfect for us in every way.  We intentionally did not bring my car so we would not purchase that day.  However,  our overall experience and the car itself is what changed our mind.  I really believe if we had any other salesperson that day we would not have purchased.   Frank is a true professional and I would definitely highly recommend him to anyone.  You've got a gem in Frank Martin!

116,"January 31, 2014","When I contacted Massey I knew the exact car I wanted and the lease deal I needed to make it work for me financially.  Massey had the Motor Trend Car of the Year CTS VSport I wanted and Sam and Thomas accessed excellent GM pricing programs and a US Bank lease deal that far exceeded my expectations and was considerably better than the recent lease we did for my wife's new Panamera.  I've owned and driven Mercedes S Class, BMW 7 Series, Audi A8 and Bentley Continental GT.  The CTS VSport in my informed opinion is equivalent to and in many cases a better car (exterior, interior, drivetrain, fuel economy, performance and handling) than those cars and when price is considered, is a much bigger bang for the buck.

I understand that we didn't have a warranty on the vehicle but it was my understanding that everything was checked no problem. However, upon leaving the dealership and driving about an hour I had to stop at the gas station to fuel the vehicle my husband was driving and smoke came from beneath the hood and the service light came on that indicated to service tire monitoring system. I would say I was very disappointed because I had only had the car an hour and problems had occurred. 1/23/14 we brought the car into Cadillac dealership in Texarkana and the oil cap on top was not fitted properly causing oil to spill out and the two back tires sensors are gone. I was really disappointed in hearing that so soon like in transit of getting the vehicle the problems happened an  hour from picking up from the dealership. I'm thankful that through this ordeal the dealership is more than willing to get things taken care of and cover cost all the issue's that has taken place.

120,"January 21, 2014","In Dec. I bought a Certified Pre-Owned DTS, paying extra for the CPO certification.  There was no copy of what this meant, only a sign in the lobby that said it had been thru a 172-point inspection & refurbishment.  I also bought the $4200 Luxury Easy Care Gold Certified Wrap warranty to get coverage up to 100,000 miles.  I took delivery on 12/11 in icy conditions and didn't go over the car with a fine-tooth comb.  This is my 3rd CPO Cadillac, and what that meant at Sewell, and also at Massey when Wayne Massey was involved, was that they would do their best to make it like new.  All I had to go on was experience, as there was no written info on what was or was not covered, and the salesperson, while very good in other aspects of the sale, did not explain it.  The next day, on the way to College Station & then on to Houston, a Service Tire light came on.  I didn't worry, as OnStar had sent me tire pressure readings on 12/9 & they were all 34 lbs or better.  It never occurred to me that there was a nail in the tire.  It was there when I took delivery, as the cracks in the tire from where it was parked for an extended period with a flat tire are still visible.  There were a number of issues, and by the time we were back from our trip I realized that the car needed a good going over.  The holidays were here, a couple of medical issues occurred, and I decided to wait until I could make a complete list instead of dealing with it piecemeal.  When I called my salesperson for an appointment, he asked me what the problems were.  I said I had a list & didn't want to have to read it over the phone, but he asked again so I mentioned the Tire Light, large (over a sq. ft) red stain in the carpet in the back, hail damage, and that I hoped to change out the floor mats (they are black rubber & look like they belong in an 18-wheeler, not a Caddy with light beige carpet.  When I picked up the car I thought they might have turned them upside down for me to protect the carpet from the ice & mud, but no).  He put me on hold, and instead of coming back with an appt time, he said that his manager, ""X"" had said they could have done something about the mats a month ago, but not now.  So before I even got there, I was slapped in the face with lack of customer service.  I had 8 issues total--at the top of the list was the tire--I now knew it had a slow leak.  While Michael Davis was very helpful that day, soon my salesperson came out to tell me the floor mats & hail damage were a problem.  Ultimately, I was told by ""X"" that I had bought a  used car as is.  When I was called & told the car was ready, I asked about the tire.  Michael said he hadn't seen a problem (even tho it was the first thing on my list).  I point-blank asked if it was Massey's policy that I have to bend down & air up my tires every two weeks (I am 5'1"", 62 years old & have a titanium plate in my neck).  He said he would look at it, and ultimately did fix it, stressing that he had gone ""above & beyond"" for me.  I didn't understand as my Gold Certified Wrap includes a Tire & Wheel Guarantee.  But after doing my own research online, I see that the CPO certification doesn't cover tires.  This dealership put me at serious risk, letting me leave there with a nail in the front tire in icy conditions, by not simply explaining the warranty to me so I could have been aware.  And despite a written notification of the problem, they would have let me leave again with the nail still in the tire had I not pressed the issue.                      ",2.2

The Acadia at Massey was listed the day we planned to make our final choice. I worked with Sam in the internet department, and was pleased with his communication. We decided to see the vehicle on Friday night. Sam alerted me that he would be out and I would be directed to one of the floor team to work with at the dealership.

We contacted Joey to alert him that we wanted to see it. When we arrived, Brian Hershman had the vehicle ready to view and test drive. We liked it, and added it to the list of potential SUVs. The negotiation was not the ""normal back and forth to the sales manager's office to show how he was working for us, not the dealership."" We liked that approach and appreciated the candid and open conversation. We made a fair offer and it was accepted in minutes. I feel we both walked away happy, which is the best way to do business.

129,"November 08, 2013","Great experience. Was searching for an ATS online. My first inquiry was through Cars.com which got calls from Crest and Frank Kent. While they were eager for the business, they didn't have the car I was looking for. Then I put in an another inquiry through another site (can't remember right now which one) and got a response with two ATS's which were interesting. I got an auto reply from Thomas Bies and a follow up call  from Christine Bennett. We spoke about Masseys inventory and she said she would follow up with an email. Christine's first email to me was sent directly to my spam folder. After a brief misunderstanding about what I was willing to pay and a call from Tyrone ?, we made a deal. 

My experience with Frank Martin and the rest of the dealership was fantastic once I arrived. The Ipad was unexpected and a great bonus. The offer for my Saturn was somewhat expected but very sub-par. I was offered $3000 for it and sold it the next day for $5000 to another dealer. 

Two minor issues. First, there was an issue with one of the FOBs which I am still waiting to get resolved although there is an email saying someone will be in contact. Second, when I activated my On-Star, I was notified of a recall. Your maintenance department was also notified and they have subsequently sent me an email. While I have had a great experience at Massey, it is over an hour drive for me to get there so bringing the car in for a recall is not convenient. It would have been nice if the recall was caught prior to the purchase.

Overall, I am very happy with the car and the experience so far.",4.6

132,"October 18, 2013","Dear Mr. Bies,

I am editing my initial dealerrater.com experience submitted on October 18th to reflect on the actions taken by you and your team to remediate the discrepancy in pricing of my recent Cadillac SRX purchase. I applaud you and your staff for the professionalism and effort to work in tandem with GM to understand and resolve the correct GMS pricing on this vehicle. Your behavior reinforced the business model that Massey Cadillac so proudly stands behind. It was unfortunate that the timing of GM's launch of the new GM Employee Discount program could not have been more seamless for the dealership and the beneficiaries of the GM Friends & Family program. 

Perhaps on your next visit to the GM Renaissance Center or in your communication with the Cadillac regional sales director you can reinforce the frustration experienced by the Cadillac customers and your dealership team in executing GMS transactions. By voicing the customers concerns, hopefully actions could be taken that lead to better communication and training before initiating such a companywide change in incentive programs.

I received the Purchase and Delivery Satisfaction Survey email from GM yesterday and have submitted a “Completely Satisfied Experience” to General Motors. Thank you again for resolving my issues and exceeding my expectations. I look forward to sharing my experience with others who are considering Massey Cadillac for their next vehicle purchase.

A Completely Satisfied Customer,

John F. Leikert

He was able to answer every question I proposed. He offered us beverages and gave us a grand tour of the dealership. Everyone was polite. Also, before I drove off, Edwin made sure that I knew all the basics steps in driving the car. Finally, I am very appreciative of all the free gifts Massey Cadillac provided for me.

He located another SRX to test drive. George never pressured or rushed me to buy this vehicle. George gave a tour of the facilities where I was introduced to the shop manager. 

George was truly a surprise by not making me feel like I was taking up to much of his time.

139,"July 25, 2013","I came into Massey because I had driven an STS the first year they came out back in the 1990s. I really loved that car. In the years that followed, I moved away from the luxury cars and thought mostly about gas mileage. Here we are with gas prices at almost record levels, but the thought of driving a Cadillac was too strong!

I was given GM Thomas Bies' name from a co-worker. I was told he was a great guy, on and off the show room floor. I couldn't agree more. Thomas had me meet Richard Wells the first day I arrived. Richard was on top of his game. Friendly, knowledgeable and funny. He made me and my girlfriend feel at ease. We took a test drive, and he sat with me in the XTS and explained all the ""essentials""...and there's a lot of bells and whistles in the XTS! 

When I came back the following week, Richard was not available, but Franklin Martin stepped in and didn't miss a beat. Here was another very friendly,  knowledgeable guy who answered all my questions, and even told me about other available models so I could make the best decision.
I ended up choosing the XTS! I drove it home yesterday, and could not be happier.

I want to thank all of you at Massey. What a great buying (leasing) experience.

I WILL BE BACK !!

141,"July 12, 2013","This weekend I inquired online about a specific 2010 vehicle I was looking for (CTS Premium with low miles in an acceptable color) and was invited in by Massey's internet manager, Brad, to look at one you had in inventory. He called Monday when I was on the way to meet with Sewell in Grapevine. I made the appointment with Massey for after my meeting with Sewell. The Sewell people were wonderful, and close to my home; and I though I would likely come back for a car there.

Leal greeted me at the door and we drove the black 2010 Premium CTS I had initially inquired about; I did not care for it, once I saw it, and was going to go back to Sewell to buy the red one I saw there, even though it was substantially over my budget at $32K+. 

Sensing my uneasiness with the Sewell price, Leal showed me some other CTSs, and I liked the low-mileage silver 2011 CTS Luxury model Massey had on the lot at ~$25K, which was closer to the price I wanted to pay. It did not have all the features of the Premium but I decided I didn't really want to pay so much extra for them. Leal and your team worked with me to get to an agreeable paice for certifying and purchasing the vehicle. I deove it home to show my husband and came back Tuesday to purchase it.

I noticed a bump on the left front bumper which Leal addressed with your team; they agreed to repair this at no additional charge next week, and give ma a loaner Cadillac to drive while it is being repaired. 

I was treated couteously and respectfully throuhout the entire transaction and got a CTS that is perfect for my needs. I have named her *Sparkle*

I'm happy to give a response on our experience with Massey Cadillac.

My Wife and I, came in to view a Kia Sorrento, that we had seen on the internet.  There we met Mr. Richard Wells, Sales Consultant. 

From the beginning, Mr. Wells, were very open to our needs and what we wanted.  He made our visit pleasurable, relaxable, and enjoyable.  He explained in depth all the information we needed to know about the vehicle, and why the car we were interested in was worth the purchase.  Although, we would have love to purchase a Cadillac, but my wife wanted a more fuel efficient vehicle. 

I appreciate Mr. Wells, not being a pushy Sales Consultant.  Our experience was worth the drive from Tyler to Dallas.

Ms. Alexa, was also informative about our purchase and the financing that we discussed.  Her given of herself made our experience with her also relaxing.  She was very open and willing to assist us.

They gave me a loaner so i could run errands while the tinted and prepped the vehicle and I left on a full tank of gas.   If I lived in the local area I think I would actually like to work there.    The GM took time to speak directly with me and the sales team gave us an amazing travel mug with the Cadillac emblem that my wife proudly displays on her desk.   I have spent and ridiculous amount of money on new General Motors vehicles but this is the first time I have every received any extra's from General Motors.   I switched from Ford  (my parents always had a Lincoln) after they would not fix as issue with my Limited Excursion (51K) and then charged me 90.00 to tell me they would not fix it, and before that I had been a loyal Ford owner and new car buyer for a long time.  Five,  General Motors cars later and I will still not step foot on a Ford lot as the Cadillac experience is so superior.  I buy a new car every 2-3 years and next time I am skipping all the shopping around and going straight to Massey.

I've witnessed Thomas Bies, the General Manager, go above and beyond to ensure satisfaction for his customers. He's very approachable and very enjoyable to work with. 

Thanks to Moe Serour's customer service in the service area, I am a repeat customer for my car care needs. He very quickly learned exactly how I want my car cared for and has not disappointed me yet. Per my initial request, he continues to thoroughly check my car for damages such as scratches, knows exactly how I want it washed each and every time, and remembers to ask for my favorite mechanic - all without ever having to remind him. More importantly, I completely trust his judgement when he recommends service needs for my car, thus I never feel taken advantage of. I recommended Moe to my friend who also purchased a car at Massey and she quickly understood why. I highly recommend Moe to anyone looking for an excellent service advisor that you can trust!

Stephen Rattan has become my favorite mechanic at Massey. His knowledge, experience, and straight-forward approach to recommending service needs is greatly appreciated. I trust Stephen's work enough that my service consultant always asks Stephen to work on my car for me. I don't know if am even supposed to request a specific mechanic, but that's the kind of customer I am, and Thomas, Moe, and Stephen never let me down. ",4.8
182,"September 05, 2012","I have to say that when my daughter and I walked in the door on Friday 8/24 Bill Scarbrough introduced me to Lesly Etienne and they both went above and beyond to help the two of us.  Edwin Carter was who I orginially asked for but he was tied up with a customer. We were there at the dealership about 4 hours & they allowed my daughter to take the SRX Crossover home and we thought the deal would be closed on Saturday.  When we returned on Saturday we realized that the deal did not go through and my daughter was highly disappointed as well as myself. It took over a week to get the approval done & we were not expecting to put $ down to seal the deal but had to.  On Friday, August 31st we signed the papers and my daughter was one proud person with a baby on the way I now know they both will be riding in a safe vehicle.  Thanks again to all that were involved we appreciated your help and all that went into getting the car buying experience pushed through. I would recommend this dealership to anyone.",4.8

184,"August 02, 2012","I visited Massey Cadillac on the recommendation of a radio personality and was told I would be very happy.  I can tell you from the moment I arrived with my wife I was met by the Salesman Franklin Martin and GM Thomas Bies.  Both men were very cordial, professional and offered their assistance without even knowing my reason for visiting Massey.  I was treated like a VIP and both men did not hesitate to show me a vehicle and even volunteered to take me on a demo ride.  I have never met and been assisted by a car salesman and manager who were as experienced and knowledgable as Thomas Bies and Franklin Martin.  I felt confident with the numbers proposed to me during the sales process and I trusted both gentleman and their business acumen.  I have rated both Thomas and Franklin very high as they are probably the best team of sales personnel I have dealt with in purchasing a vehicle.  I feel assured my future business with Massey Cadillac will continue to meet the high standards I experienced in my purchase of the vehicle. I look forward to have my vehicle service and maintenance requirments done at Massey Cadillac.",5.0
185,"July 25, 2012","When we visited the dealership we were really just exploring the possibilities of buying a cadillac, however there were various positive attitudes and actions that brought us to the conclusion to buy.  First and foremost was the salesman's willingness to be open and personal with us like he was eager to help and was providing us a valuable service instead of just trying to sell us something.  Second was the zero percent interest offered as part of the deal.  Finally the sales manager was willing to work with us based on our particular needs and the value for our trade-in.  All-in-all it was a very positive experience that could very well result in us being devout cadillac people from now on.  Thanks Massey! ",5.0
186,"July 23, 2012","I saw the 2011 Cadillac on the internet and call. I talked with Bill Scarbrough, he was very clear on the car and what it would take for me to purchase the car. Was very nice in his discussion, it almost felt like I knew him. I am very much a person who likes to have someone to be upfront with me and no high pressure sales talk. I am to the point with people and I like the same back. 
I was introduce to the sale manage and the service manager also the sales associate George Diaz who picked me up at the airport and made my visit also very good.
If I owned a car business I would want the people I came in contact with to work with me.
Thank you for a pleasant experience at your dealership, it is not the normal for me to fly so far to purchase a car.

But, not at Massey Cadillac. My experience was over all, the greatest I've ever dealt with. The team was the greatest and went over and beyond to meet my expectations. They were people friendly and accommodated every need. They offered us something to drink as we waited, they were on top of their game and never left us out of the loop. At the end of it all, we were put into the vehicle of our dreams and I couldn't be any thankful than what I am. I would not change anything about my experience that I had at Massey Cadillac. This team cannot be beat! Thank you so much, Massey Cadillac team! ",5.0
191,"July 04, 2012","I first dealt with Sam over the phone before going to see him. He was very helpful before and during the transaction, even suggesting driving the vehicle I bought as well as another vehicle I thought I was interested in before we even started negotiating. The negotiation was very short and was not adversarial at all. I got a fair price that both I and the dealership could live with. Sam was a real professional and was a joy to work with, which in my experience is a rare find when buying a new car. The lady in the finance department was also very helpful and was very easy to work with. The car I bought was a new trade in and had not even been readied for sale at the timne I purchase it. The dealership did everything they needed to to make sure I drove away on the same day. This is a wonderful dealership and I will recommend it to anyone I know that may be looking for a Cadillac, or a nice used car. Outstanding Dealership!!!!",4.8

Bill Scarbrough was quick to get numbers together and was very accessible by phone. George Diaz delivered the vehicle, completed the paperwork and spent the time necessary to demonstrate all the vehicle systems. 
 The Massey staff provide an enjoyable buying experience!

198,"May 31, 2012","My wife and I had the privilege of purchasing a 2012 SRX last night. To be honest, I communicated with 5 different local Cadillac dealerships on pricing. At Massey, I worked with Bill Scarbrough and he was by far the very best in responsiveness, listening to what I wanted, asking appropriate questions, and got me the very best deal in Dallas! 

When I arrived, I didn’t even make it to the receptionist before Lesly knew who I was and greeted me. 

I was a little apprehensive that I might see a different price than what was quoted, but everything was exactly as promised! Bill had the SUV cleaned, detailed, and a full tank of gas. This SUV will be my wife’s and she was calling everyone last night telling her friends that this was the best experience she had in buying a car. 

Kudo’s to your team, and I’ll be looking at Cadillac’s when I am ready to replace my Lexus!

Many thanks to your great organization!

200,"May 17, 2012","I have gone to Massey for Service/Body shop (accidents; hey they happen) and now for sales.  My experience with Service & Body shop has always been outstanding! Pat and Gerald and Alex are always friendly, always smiling, and always remember my husband and myself. Even when I call and leave a message for some little question like “what does this button do?"" I always get a call back either that day or the next morning.

On sales at first I did have a new sales man; he had only been there a week or so. Taken into consideration we did follow through with him, hoping it would be better. End result he said what he wanted to get us in the car; and when it came down to the line he was trying to not produce and make excuses.  He needed to listen to what we were wanting and looking for, not just the price differences and how much he would be making off of it.  I did let his superiors know the he needed just a little bit of polishing. As for everyone else, I was always warmly greeted, addressed on more than a professional level every single time I was there.  Other sales men had seen us on location in the days prior to purchasing and even the days after and always said “Hello, How are you today? Can I get you something while you wait,” etc.  While I am not happy with my sales man, everyone one else went over and beyond to make sure the experience was beyond pleasurable.  There is not one doubt in my mind that even if my sales man was different, the level of kindness and personable attention given to everyone on the premises would be the exact same as it was!

201,"April 25, 2012","In january ( 4 months ago) I purchased a used 2006 cadillac cts from Massey Cadillac. It had 103,000 miles on it. Less then a month after I bought the vehicle, which happened to have a clean history, I had to take it to the shop for what turned out to be bushings.Fine whatever, after 100,000 miles I can expect to change out some things. But last week my car started to basically break down. When I get on the gas it makes a horrible stuttering noise, and randomly jolts when I'm driving. I've noticed that the noise it is making has gradually gotten louder and has been there since I bought the vehicle. I found out today that I have to replace my camshafts because it is causing 4 out of the 6 cylinders to misfire. The problem has been there all along and i'm pissed. Apparently a woman can't go into a car dealership and trust the people working there to sell her a car that works. I didn't know it would be necessary to have to bring a mechanic along who could comb the car and make sure that I wasn't being sold a lemon. So now i'm facing $2500 upwards in repairs in a car that I have owned for LESS THAN FOUR MONTHS. I am so angry and I feel absolutely taken advantage of.",2.0
202,"April 08, 2012","I bought a used Mitsubishi Montero Sport from Massey Cadillac on 3/24/2012 (for my wife), but was not allowed to take delivery until the evening of 3/26/2012 so that Massey Cadillac could run it thru their Service dept .  I thought this was odd because the engine area had already been steam cleaned and looked spotless, but they told me they would clean the interior and do a State Emission Inspection test.

My wife drove the car home from Massey Cadillac on 3/26 (20 miles), I drove it once to work on 3/28 (21 mi RT), we drove it once out to dinner to Jason’s Deli on 3/30 (10 mi RT), I drove it once to Riverbend Sandler retail store on 3/31 (20 mi RT), and then on 4/2 my wife noticed the Check Engine Light came on and stayed on when she started the engine.

On 4/4 I drove the vehicle to AutoZone (1 mi RT) to get the free check on the Engine Fault Code that was causing the Check Engine Light to go on.  It was error code P0301 which is Cylinder 1 misfire condition.

I called Massey Cadillac several times and they denied that the Check Engine Light had been on while in their possession and refused to fix the problem.

So I took it to a Mitsubishi dealer on 4/6 to diagnose the underlying problem .  They said oil was/is leaking into cylinder 1 and that was causing the Check Engine Light error P0301 (cylinder 1 misfire).  I asked them how long this problem had been going on.  They showed me the rubber connector on spark plug 1 that was so swollen due to the long term oil leakage that it could not be forced back into the normal hole in the valve cover.  They also pointed out that someone (Massey Cadillac) had recently cleaned the whole engine area and sprayed it with silicone spray to hide the oil leak problem.

When the Mitsubishi service dept. opened up the valve cover to repair the problem, they said someone (Massey Cadillac) had already been in there before them and had not put the gaskets back on properly and had damaged the gaskets (which must be replaced).  The total cost to fix the Check Engine light problem will be $1100.

On 4/6 and 4/7 I called Massey Cadillac multiple times and they denied that they had done anything to the engine to hide the Check Engine Light condition and refused to fix the problem.  When I pointed out that they had claimed that they had not done anything to the vehicle when the obvious truth is that the engine had been steam cleaned and silicone sprayed on it (which they did not deny doing), they still denied responsibility.  

It is now obvious that they did something temporary to try to get rid of the oil leak into cylinder 1 that was causing the Check Engine Light condition, which then allowed the vehicle to pass the State Emission Inspection test on 3/26 which result falsely or fraudulently  implied that there was no existing engine problem.

Given the fact that the Mitsubishi service dept states that there is factual evidence for a long term oil leak that was affecting cylinder 1 and is causing the cylinder 1 misfire,  and given the fact that Massey Cadillac had steam cleaned and sprayed silicone to cover up the oil leak, and given the fact that Massey Cadillac refuses to have a conference call with the previous owner to determine if the previous owner was aware of an oil leak and a Check Engine Light problem, there is sufficient evidence to convince a reasonable man that Massey Cadillac has conspired to defraud me by taking steps to hide a Check Engine Light problem that would not have passed a State Emission Inspection (due to an oil leak in cylinder 1) without Massey Cadillac taking steps to hide that problem.

They were very understanding with helping me find the right car for me, even though I couldn't decide between their variety of cars. With their patience and guidance they helped me find  the Eclipse.

205,"May 09, 2011","5 months ago, my fiance' purchased a used Lincoln Navigator and got it at a reasonable price, or so we thought... Within 45 days of purchasing the vehicle, 2 coils and two tires had to be replaced, the stereo/dvd/navigation system quit working and most recently the air conditioning is working at either full blast or off, no in-between. The tires and coils have been replaced at close to a thousand dollars combined, however the stereo/nav system is possibly going to cost around $1700.00!! The air conditioning hasn't been checked out yet. When initially asked about the stereo system, they could offer little, to no help other than offer one solution that didn't work and another that would cost hundreds of dollars as well. They have no kind of warranty or compromise on a twenty-some thousand dollar vehicle... An offer to share some of the cost could have been offered and would have been appreciated. Instead we were told ""sorry, these things happen"". You'd think that a Cadillac dealership would be a reputable company and stand behind it's products...new or used.

When we got back to the dealership Franklin sat us down and discussed out options. When we decided on the new car but knew we were upside down in our trade he spoke with the general manger, Nasu.
