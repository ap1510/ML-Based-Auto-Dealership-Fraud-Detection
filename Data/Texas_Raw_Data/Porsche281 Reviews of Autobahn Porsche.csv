I've come to know the mechanics (Justin and Jeff), service folks (Trevor) and parts folks at Autobahn Porsche (Anthony and James), along with John Hamilton my salesman who sold the Targa to me.  Having some knowledge of cars helps so they don't have to explain everything to me.  Some parts for Targa's come only from Germany others from U.S. based Porsche warehouses.  I love working with them and learning from the mechanics on items I don't know.  I always know roughly how much time it takes to get the work done.  The only variable is how much work Justin and Jeff are buried with.  They nearly always are right on the quote for cost and 99% of the time the car is ready when they say.

We came in concerned that a Porsche Macan was slightly too expensive, and Bob Hall really worked hard to meet our budget and car requirements (instead of trying to convince to go outside of our budget). We ended up leasing one of the loaner cars for 39 months - which was PERFECT for us.

Also, along the same lines, props to the head of finance - who got an EVEN better deal than Porsche leasing - when there was a problem with my application. My credit score was 724 - which bumped me out of the lowest rate from Porsche leasing. He got us a CHEAPER deal than Porsche leasing's best rate using US Bank on his own.

Also, the Porsche is awesome. We would definitely lease another... ",5.0
