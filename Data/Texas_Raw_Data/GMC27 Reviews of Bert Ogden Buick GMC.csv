1,"March 10, 2020",I took in my vehicle for an oil change. Your prices are ridiculous 78.00 too much. Burns Motors and Pharr Toyota have better prices.,3.0

3,"January 07, 2019","Went to this dealership today 1/7/19, my last time was a year and half ago, receive a negetative experience in the sales department and went to buy elsewhere. Came back again today thinking that maybe things have change but I was mistaken. Went in because of an advertisement on their internet page of a truck with an amount of discount. They didn’t want to honor the discount and if they did I would have to buy an add on, extra cost that wasn’t necessary for me. Bert Odgen dealerships are not honest, transparency and sincere. They will screw you if you let them, Buy elsewhere where you feel that they are honest.",1.0

6,"December 15, 2017","I had to bring my truck in for service due to a check engine light. Being from out of state I felt more comfortable bringing it to a dealer for service. I guess I was expecting service like my local dealer, and did not receive it. Burt Ogden had 1 service writer who I had to wait to talk. after talking to the service writer I decided to make appointment for Monday morning since I plans for Friday and they are not open on the weekend. Took the truck in on Monday morning and service area was a mess of cars after service area open for a hour. Had to wait again to talk to a service writer to get the truck checked in. I get it Monday morning and having to wait your turn, nothing new there. What was disappointing is having to wait all day to be contacted about what needed to be repaired. I had already taken it in and knew it was a O2 sensor, Even told the service writer the exact code and what was wrong. So waiting all day to confirm what I knew was wrong already and then have to wait till the next day after setting appointment to have the service done was not ideal. On to the next day go pick up the truck get stopped at the driveway by salesmen asking what we were there for. Picked up truck after waiting and paying. Again normal part of any transaction. Make the payment get my keys and given receipt. Thanked for choosing Burt Ogden have a nice day. Again stopped by same sales force blocking driveway to leave. Here is where the local service of Bergstrum GM of Wisconsin stands apart and is in my opinion much more customer focused. 1: Takes the time to go over what was done even if it was just a simple oil change. Burt Ogden did not offer to explain the bill. 2: Offers a complimentary car wash with any service and asks if you want one at time of drop off. Burt Ogden did not offer or mention this. Was told by family member who we were visiting that there was a sign there about a free oil change if a walk around was not offered. again not mentioned by any service writer. 3: Not blocked from entering or exiting by a team of sales people. Overall Burt Ogden did fix what was wrong with the truck but the lack of personal service was a let down.",2.5
7,"December 07, 2017",The dealership was slow at first no one was really out side walking the yard took half an hour for someone to talk with. But from that point on very tentative answered all my questions ,5.0
8,"October 26, 2017",Lousy service not helpful.  Nor would he explain why the charge for the battery when it wasn't even 2 yrs old. All he would say was that their policy had change  I asked why we the customers were not notify in writing.  Seams to me all in your company's mind is to cheat the customers .  Last time I'm ever buying anything from you.  To make matters worst is that I bought 2 cars from you on the same day.  ,1.0

12,"March 16, 2017","Sad to say, but it's been a disappointment there at Bert Ogden GMC with the my truck that I purchased brand new (GMC Sierra SLT crew cab 2015), so the truck was not cheap. I've been very patient and taken it over 12 times over these past two years to get it fixed and nothing was resolved. If you looking to purchase, take in consideration that your brakes are going to squeak after the 5 month and their response is that it's absolutely normal. If the employee would of at least brought it up during the test driving it, i would of taken it into consideration before purchasing. Also their so called fixes only last for a month or two and then the problem reappears. 

FYI it was around 6,000 miles when the problems appeared and as of now my truck just hit 20,000 in the span of two years. I been making monthly payments just so I can have my truck visit their shop and try to get fixed. 

Oh yeah, instead of fixing my truck, their other response was "" Purchase a new truck"". My truck had only been 1 year old when I was told this.

*bert Ogden, I'm still waiting for the specialist that was going to check my brakes and it's been 2 years*",1.0
13,"June 30, 2016","Was in car accident on april 1 and after 3 months my truck is still not repaired, no one calls me to keep me updated on status and went i call them they tell me they are short handed and that they are too many cars being worked on . If they would of told me this before i would of gone somewhere else. They have not met three date lines already and now they stop giving me date lines and no one has call me since june 9th. Thinking they just dont want to fix my truck. If possible wound not give one star on this",1.0
14,"June 01, 2016","I want to post a “Thank You” to Bert Ogden GMC, Mario (Manager) & of course Jacob for the painless car buying experience. There was no pressure from the salesman and at every step of the process, the staff worked to meet all requests presented in such a short time. I was in town for a few days and Jacob (my Sales Rep) was patient and informative describing different vehicles meeting the criteria given. I think I put the pressure on him to find me a vehicle, at the right price and to include my trade in with no $ down all in a day's work. After selecting the SUV that fits me & my 6 kids, he worked quickly to close the deal so that I can report back to my unit (I'm active duty military). I purchased an Acadia and look forward to my next purchase (upgrade) from Bert Ogden GMC. The follow on care for has been exceptional. I have received several calls from Jacob just to ensure continued vehicle satisfaction. He is very honest and is definitely an ASSET to their sales team and represents what a real sales person should have and represents himself in a such a manner that makes me proud to own a GMC from Bert Ogden! I will be a life long customer.",5.0
15,"September 16, 2014","I had to call service again at 4pm and was finally told leak was located, Alfredo wanted to know who had replaced the windshield, told him it had not been replaced since I bought it there just about 2 years ago. Said leak was coming from a gap where seal was broken. Said it would get repaired tomorrow, that I'd have to leave it. Told him I couldn't my only source of transportation. Said he'd let transport know to pick me up so I could get my car. Well had to pick up my car without repair of the leak. Returned it this morning to get window fixed, he said there would be no cost. While sitting there again waiting on transport to bring me to work, I overheard a conversation about loaners (cars) and how they were available but not for oil changes, this was not offered to me, it sure would have made things simpler and I wouldn't have missed 1 1/2 hours of work. Well anyway even though I was not treated or offered this service, I am glad my car is getting fixed and at no cost to me. Thank you Bert Ogden. I would not entrust the care of my car to anyone else. Now I'm hoping they'll get fixed before the end of the day and perhaps delivered to me at work before 5. Just wishful thinking on my part.",4.6
16,"September 16, 2014","Had taken in my Enclave for a leak that appears to be coming from the overhead light area. They said they ran it thru the carwash and had not found it after multiple attempts. Well with recent heavy down pours it is leaking again!!! Now even more, afraid that they wouldn't take my word I made to their service center on Saturday, a nice Sales man named Alfredo and his supervisor acknowledged the leak, the sales manager got pictures and all the info. I took it in this morning spoke to Alfredo in service, first thing he said you're no longer under a service contract. He took my keys went and got info from car, didn't even ask me about leak or it's origin. I gave him name of sales man but I might as well have been talking to the wall. Called him at 244 because I hadn't heard anything. He couldn't even give me an answer, asked what I had taken my car in for?!?!? The told me he'd check and he's call me back. Needless to say it's  315 and still no call back. I did get a ride to work and that was great. Service not so sure. Still waiting.",3.4
17,"June 13, 2014","At our arrival we knew what we wanted. We drove the Sierra 1500. A very nice truck. The problem started when a sheet with pricing was brought in. We were offered $13,000 for our 2013 Buick Verano. We found out that it was worth $18,700 by refinancing. We were offered only $ 4,000 worth of rebates. Then to top it off we were charged for $1,700 because we had not accepted to pay for a package which was already applied to the Buick Verano when we bought it. Imagine to charge us for something already bought and payed for. 

A week later I was able to go to another GMC dealership and within 3 1/2 hrs I had bought a GMC Sierra sle Texas edition for a very good price with just over $ 8,000 in rebates.

Im well aware that any dealership is a business first, but it stays in business by returning customers. We tried to be those customers but were shushed away. Ni modo. Better luck next time. Mariano",1.4

21,"September 24, 2013","Thanks for the fast and friendly service, Alfred made it fast and easy, I was offered to wait in the waiting area I was offered coffee or water together with sweat bread, or if I didn't want to wait they had someone take me home or else where then they would pick me up later after the vehicle was ready",5.0
22,"September 20, 2013","I am a long-term customer of Bert Ogden, and one of the reasons is the great service I recieve from the dealership and Cris as well as the other employees immediate attention --- very detailed, very friendly, very respectful, and I never have had to bring the vehicle back for lack of or any mistake in service.",4.8
23,"September 19, 2013",They picked up my suburban from the office which saved me time.  They kept me informed of the work with respect to how long the repair would take and the cost of the repair. ,4.8
24,"September 19, 2013","The service manager has done an excellent job getting my car in for service when needed. Not only has he gotten my car in when needed, but the time that it takes is very reasonable for what is being done.  I appreciate the friendliness and respect that is shown for the customers. I always recommend people to have their car serviced with Chris Hatzold.",5.0
25,"August 25, 2013",I felt that my experience there at Buick GMC was very satisfying because Juan was very nice and helpful and the car that we purchased is just what we were looking for.,5.0
26,"August 15, 2013","This is the first time that I purchased a Buick. I had always admired the brand. When we arrived we were put at ease by Martin Aguirre, the salesman. He was very professional but very friendly. He helped us throughout the whole process. He was patient with us explaining every single thing that I had a question about. He put us at ease and made it very pleasant to purchase our Buick Escalade at Bert Ogden, GMC/Buick. I would highly recommend this dealer and Martin Aguirre, our salesman.",5.0
