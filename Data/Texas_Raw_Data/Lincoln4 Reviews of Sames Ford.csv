0,"May 26, 2016","Last week I contacted Addison at Sames about needing to find a reliable new vehicle. I had a specialty car that I just could not get used to. On my way to see them I stopped at a few dealerships (who wouldn't) and was treated like I couldn't afford anything on their lot that I was interested in as well as being offered trade values WAYYYYYYYY below book. When I arrived at Sames Addison greeted me personally even though he does web sales and development. Introduced me to a sales person and explained my interests. By the time I was done picking out the vehicle I wanted the staff had already had my trade values set and started working on putting a deal together for me. I explained I had my own financing and THEY ACTUALLY RESPECTED IT and still treated me like a good customer (rare for most lots because they think they wasted their time on a tire kicker). My sales person Brandon followed up with me with the information I requested for my bank and stayed in constant contact when I needed assistance. I ended up buying a very nice new 2016 F 250 lariat ultimate package for a great deal less than I would've anywhere else. They made sure my experience was smooth, seamless and professional. I will buy from Sames Ford again. The entire staff is great and I had assistance from the porter to the GM thank you all!! I love my new truck!
