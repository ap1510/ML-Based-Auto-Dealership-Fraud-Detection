0,"June 27, 2020","Not happy with the service but because I am credit challenged I have to suffer. I was charged $1000 for ""Accessories"" on a used car. That was not detailed cleaned on the inside. By the way the salesman lied about. I had to go a buy a light bulb for the headlights because it was out. Torn leather seats. Plus I had to bring it back up there a day after getting out of the hospital. Because the person that changed the oil didn't take the time to make sure he/she did their job properly. This was my 2nd purchase from Grubbs and it will be my last. I will politely take my money to another dealership. Also I would like to add. Before coming to Grubbs I purchased 4 vehicles and sent a few customers to my previous dealership. Because they weren't liars, delivered what they promised, and Customer Service was on point.  My salesman left which is how I ended up at Grubbs. I am grateful for the full tank of gas, and the GM saw me and took my complaint seriously and had them look at my vehicle right away. I appreciate that. However having to come to the dealership after being in the hospital for 4 day because of an employees lack, is unacceptable. Hey I have bad credit, these are the things you deal with right, being taken advantage of. I feel like I got screwed with no lubricant! I will use this vehicle to help get my credit back on track. And go elsewhere for my next purchase. Have a great day...... Now not even having the car 6 months. It broke down on me as I was driving. Had to push it out the street(I hurt myself in that process). It needs $1000 worth of repairs. I purchased a warranty. But guess what! The warranty doesn‚Äôt cover the repairs! Boy did Grubbs screw me over when they sold me this lemonü•∫ I have made 5 payments on the car. And it broke down. And do you think Grubbs Nissan will do anything to rectify it. Nope. Can‚Äôt get a return call or email. I hope these people sleep well at night!",1.0

After addressing the issue with service, I was told they weren't responsible for the damage, which clearly correlates to the before mentioned installment.

28,"December 18, 2019","Very disappointed in this dealership. My husband and I went to Grubbs Nissan back in 2016 trying to trade up into something better and after spending hours there getting my car appraised, test driving and picking out a car we went to talk numbers and got side swiped by their ""Final Pricing"" and ended up leaving making no deals. Come 2019 and the dealership is advertising big sales deals with rebates, up to $3k over KBB suggested and we decided to try them one more time to see if hopefully they improved the way they did business but sadly no. I was hoping they'd give me a better ""deal"" than just $500 over KBB but would not and when the vehicle we originally wanted posted online was suddenly a higher amount then advertised the previous day they told us all their vehicles have about $3k in accessories on them and when we requested a vehicle without the additional they told us that wasn't possible and that it was online in the fine print. Thankfully we had a screenshot of the vehicle we were originally looking to trade up into and that's when the rest of the false advertisement and b.s. with it's all in the fine print. The way this dealership does business with false advertising vehicles for one price then providing way higher numbers after they get you in the door is bad business. We would have loved to have gotten the vehicle they advertised at the price originally listed online but once again same sales tactics just to get people in the door, waste everyone's time and run people's credit to make it look like they have higher numbers than they truly do.
Customer Service and Friendliness is on point until they get you in the door and you can prove they are running a scam on you then their whole persona changes and they trying to tell you other dealerships are doing it too.",1.0

43,"October 14, 2019",My brakes were stiff & car wouldn‚Äôt start Sunday. Took it for diagnostics; felt the brake switch needed to be changed based on online reviews. Jimmy helped me and turned out brake switch needed to be changed. I was still under warranty which was a good thing. Jimmy also called and said my brake fluid needed to be flushed && there were 2 air filters that needed to be changed (those 3 not under warranty). Also I had been having an issue with the front detector on my car. It was malfunctioning && it was changed as well under warranty. Overall I‚Äôm very satisfied. I drive my car everyday so I‚Äôm glad it was fixed in one day. They also provided me a car for the day. I asked about an extended warranty && he spoke with me about it and also informed me not to let them sell me anything! Loved that. Not many salesmen would do that. ,5.0
44,"October 12, 2019",Sales lied about the sale figures put all the sale tax in before deducting the trade in value.  Offered the lower than blue book value on your trade.  Added all kinds of junk into the sale price and could not explain what they were.  Had to ask the manager come out to explain the details.  Took pictures of my trade in with my personal belongings for advertisement.  Finance depart forced you to buy all kinds of craps to get commission.  They even changed the sale price too.  Stay away from the place.  This place is dangerous!  Mylake Green is the only one doing well by showing me the features of the car and instructed on GPS system.,1.0

60,"August 26, 2019","My wife had recently totaled her vehicle and our insurance company supplied a rental car that was due to return on 8/26/19 so it was urgent that I found a replacement. I live in Kansas City and older vehicles tend to rust quikly from the treatment we put on our roads during the winter months. So I was looking for a 2013-14 Yukon or Tahoe in Texas because I know they are rust free. I found a Yukon on Grubbs website and called and spoke with a lady named Donna and requested additional pics of undercarriage to ensure there was no rust. Donna gave me a number to a guy named Brian to ask him for pics. I called and left him a message and recieved no call back. I called back the next day after I didn't here from her and she did not return my call. The next day a man named Kevin reached out to me and he was very helpful. I requested multiple pictures of engine compartment and the undercarriage of the vehicle and Kevin sent them in no time. Once I knew the vehicle was what I was looking for he turned me over to Keith Wilde and said he would call me asap. That was on Thursday and I still have not heard from Keith in 4 bussiness days. I called Friday and spoke to a guy named Charles I believe and asked to speak to the GM but he denied my request and said Keth would call me back. I told him I've been waiting on Keith for a couple days and already had no faith in him calling me back but still would not put me through to the GM. I'm not sure what Keith does there but I do know that he cost Grubbs Nissan the sale of a vehicle I was very interested in. The whole experience in trying to buy a vehicle from Grubbs was horrible, except for Kevin that guy rocked!¬†I bought a Tahoe elsewhere. ",1.4

The dealer was calling my Husband to have him bring the car in because the d4al was not moving as quick as they wanted although this has nothing to do with my husband. I thought the dealership calls the finance company not vise versa.  Then they sent a Tow truck to come and get the car at midnight and the driver was going to pull out a gun out on my husband all for a misunderstanding.  The tow truck driver dragged the car from the house while it was still locked then when he go across the street on green oaks then he hooked the right way. One of my neighbors caught this on tape . I called the next morning and the manager lied to me and told me the deal did not go through which is a lie the finance company did not say that. I do not recommend this place to anyone. Now we do not want to do business with this place they went through all this and all they had to do is communicate .

We were adamantly direct and ask several times that it be removed.  After that he said with the payment we agreed too he would charge $3400 for an extended warrany in our payment?  So we promptly said please remove it and give us the lower payment. So he removed some of the cost instead then told us it was removed. 
‚ÄúWe trusted he did not add a warranty‚Äù After getting home and seeing the papers he had added a $2450 warranty to our contract and did not show us it was still there.  He Lied to Us to our face.  We have filed a law suit against them and I have filed complaints all the appropriate regulation offers for consumer protections to protect others from this process.  We were repeat customers so we trusted them.  This was deceptive and not a way to do a customer.

99,"February 05, 2019",Worst Nissan dealership in the area.   I made service appointment for 8:00 am Saturday morning.  Upon my arrival there was no less than 25 cars in front of me.  The dealer was clearly overwhelmed as there was only 2 service advisors working.  After waiting 40 minutes to speak to an advisor I was told the wait time was 3 to 4 hours for an oil change.  When I questioned the young man who was working with me I was told there was a lot of walk ins. So the wait was especially long.  Why do they take appointments if walk-ins take priority.  I will not return. ,1.0

He is straight forward and he knows both purchasing a vehicle and leasing. We told Geoff we wanted to think about it all and we would get back with him. When we returned home I got a call from a different Nissan dealer with just what I was looking for. Both the price and the automobile were exactly what we wanted. 
Fortunately my wife said let's call Geoff back and see what he can do. Immediately he matched their offer and we went back and filled out the paperwork. But Geoff didn't stop there he walked us through all the features of the car and followed up with phone calls to see if we had any questions about all the features on this car. We are extremely happy that we called Geoff back and we will be back to Grubbs from this point on as long as we can deal with Geoff.

This seemed to fix the problem for a few weeks until I began experiencing the gears getting stuck again when accelerating and riding rough (feeling a slight jerky motion) when making a rolling stop. I called the Service Center to let them know the problem still persisted. The Grubbs Nissan Service Advisor told me that my warranty had ended because the miles on my vehicle exceeded the 100,000 mile warranty limit AND that the recall notice was a public campaign led by Nissan. He said when your car has over 100,000 miles you will begin to have problems. I guess what he is telling me is that Nissan vehicles are only good up to 100,000 miles.

128,"July 05, 2018","I bought a Nissan Rogue S in February at which time the salesman (Raghu Manickam) and the sales manager (can't remember his name) told me. If you buy today we will throw in a free maintenance plan for as long as your finance agreement and free car wash and detail service ""just come on by"". Well today I went by for a car wash and detail and found out both the sales manager and Raghu are no longer there. And the service department tells me they have no control over what sales told me back in February and  I do not have car wash and detail on my deal but if I wanted they could wash it and do a light vacuum. I said ok so they washed it but did not vacuum. I was also told my maintenance plan is basic and covers 2 oil changes and tire rotations only for 3 years. This is not what I was told and I wish they would have put that in writing when I took the deal. I also looked at my sales contract to try and figure out if they wrote that on any of the paper and noticed not only did they put me in for 3 years for only 2 oil changes per year and 2 tire rotations they charged me $ 1,343.00 for the maintenance plan which the sales manager and salesman told me was ""thrown in"" to make good if I bought that day. I see why both individuals I dealt with are no longer there. I wish I would have paid more attention when I signed the finance agreement with Tu Nguyen over in finance. Because he started telling me I would have a maintenance agreement but it would  raise my payments. I told him nope, sales manager is throwing it in for free to make the sale. He called over to sales and spoke to the manager and said ok but it will only cover the basic. I said ok since it was free. So I am out $ 1,343.00 for what ? Oil and tire rotations ? This was a rush deal on the sales part and its my fault I did not look at the finance agreement before I signed it. See I'm old school and I would like to believe people are good on their word. Guess not so because they want to charge me this crazy amount, I will not buy anything else from them. I will get my oil changes and tire rotations because I bought the farm.",2.6

130,"May 18, 2018","Recently leased a 2018 Nissan Sentra from Grubbs. My wife who is the primary driver said the USB port was not working. I tried another charging cable and validated the USB was not working properly. I was thinking this was a non issue to take it in as it is still under warranty. WRONG!!!! Service person comes back after having the car for about an hour and states that we damaged the port, shows me a photo of the internals of the USB port and said due to our neglect this would not be covered under the warranty. Oh and by the way the part to replace is about $400. I declined the repairs, one because of the rediculous repair price but two, WE DID NOT DAMAGE THE PORT!!! We are being accused of neglect. Doesn't matter if we didn't they are refusing to cover the issue under the manufacturers warranty. I should have used my better judgement from my past experience with Grubbs not to go back there, shame on me.  How can they determine if this was neglect on our part vs faulty part? They can't! The car has less than 700 miles, we have had the car less than a month. My fault for staying with this dealership, but I have learned my lesson. I have three years of this type of service (BS), but then after that I am done. The least that I can do, is tell others to stay clear of Grubbs Nissan or any other Grubbs dealership for that matter. Customer service is lousy, no intention of trying to retain customer or show good faith in customers when they tell them what happened to the vehicle is in fact what happened. We have been Nissan owners for nearly 20 years, purchased/leased over 6 nissans in that time. But this is it for me, no more Nissans, no more Nissan dealerships.

He did not offer a loaner of any sort and I was stuck at home for a week and when i tried to call him back, he never answered my calls, or returned them.  I had to call other advisors just to find out that he's busy.... At this point, I'm beyond upset and my wife stepped in at spoke with the Service Manager,  who was apologetic and wanted our business so she offered a free oil change.  They replaced a valve and installed a transmission radiator to see if that will do the trick.  A couple weeks later, the transmission started whining again so my wife called Grubbs for a week until she was able to talk to Kristi Mills, the new Service Manager.  The SM that I originally worked with is now on maternity leave but Kristi was more than helpful and apologetic when my wife gave her a piece of her mind.

Going to try and make this simple. I was in the hunt for a new car and had my eye on the 2011 5.0 GT Mustang. It was a Sunday and Jasmine (sales mgr) actually called me back!! I told her my story and what I was looking for and what my payments needed to be, well me and my husband went in to look at the car Tuesday night. Jasmine referred me to sales associate Jeanette. HUGE MISTAKE (the reason why I don't like to speak to different people) I had to re-explain myself to Jeanette and what I needed my payments to be and she quickly gave me a look like NOT HAPPENING. She came back with HIGHER numbers and I quickly said NOT HAPPENING (she didn't show no interest) As me and my husband were getting ready to leave Jasmine called me and said that they are trying to work with me and meeting my number were going to be hard. Well they ran our credit (without us giving them the ok)...well lets just say me and my husband walked out with no car. Next day Jasmine calls me back still TRYING to sell me this car (she talked a pretty good deal) either way me and my husband went back up there and purchased the 2011 5.0 GT Mustang (after they dropped the price). NOW COMES THE REAL PROBLEMS. 1. when I test drove the car there was a light on and Jeanette said it was because the tire is low, two days later when we purchased the car the tire was on a flat and had half a tank of gas. In Jeanette's own words ""Oh it got late so I wasn't able to have them look at it and everyone around here has been driving this car. You cant stop and put air in the tire at the gas station"" I just looked at her and SMH (but kept my mouth shut). Fast forward. Friday I had to drop my car back off for service. I sent email to Jasmine, didn't hear back from her till Monday via text stating she forward my email to Jeanette. Tuesday I called and NO ONE knew NOTHING about my car but would have a tech advisor contact me, but NOTHING. Wednesday I call and NOTHING. Thursday I call and get ugly and finally speak to Jeanette and she tells me ""I was going to call you, I just spoke to the tech advisor and he said he had to order a part and don't know when it will be in"" (LIES) Friday my car was ready. Spoke to tech advisor he told me that Jeanette DID NOT GIVE HIM ANYTHING ON MY CAR UNTIL THURSDAY!!! SMDH!!! Oh lets back it up real quick. At the night of purchase I asked about 1000 times to see the service report and got nothing but excuses!! Service report was not emailed to me until AFTER purchase was completed and LORD BEHOLD the price they sold the car to me was WAY over market!!!!!!!!

A rep emailed me and told me that he would be working with me his name was Aziz. i advised him that i was working through Yes Credit he said that i would still need to fill out a application there. So I did he came back and said that without a co-signer or a good down payment that there was nothing that they could do for me. Remember that Yes Credit said that I was approved for a payment of up to $920 a month. So I called Yes Credit again to ask them how the program worked. They told me to go back in and talk to a certain manager. So I decided to go in person and was told to go talk to James the used car sales manager. He tried to pair me with Aziz again and I advised him that I had not got a good feeling from him. James then put me with Ernest who was great through the complete issue.
I explained what I was looking for and that I would be trading my truck that was having the transmission rebuilt. James came back with a trade valve without seeing or test driving my truck of $17,000 and they showed me the Pathfinder that I had found on line. I liked it so we made the deal i went to finance and signed the paper work almost even drove off the lot with it that night but since they didnt have my truck I had to wait. I got my truck back Monday and took it to them. Granted its a Dodge Ram 2500 HD Quad Cab. James came out took pictures and kept saying that it was the biggest truck he had seen and that he had driven and that he was really scared to drive it in the parking lot. then keep saying that the transmission did not feel right no him even through he made sure to keep asking if it should drive like this. Told me that he did not understand diesel HD models. But he keep saying that the transmission was bad and that it was not worth the $17,000 and no deal. So I left that night.
The next morning I took the truck straight to Apple Automotive in Euless and had Apple test drive it. Apple said that it shifted fine and that there was nothing wrong with it. So then i drove it to Don Davis Nissan and talked to Tony there. I explained to Tony what happened at Grubbs and he came back and said that they would like to see truck so i should them and gave him the keys. Tony came back with the numbers and off they made will decided that we had a deal and I bought a Brand New 2017.5 Nissan Rogue from Tony at Don Davis Nissan. After all the paper work was done and Tony and the Finance Manager where standing outside going over my Rogue James form Grubbs called me and told me that i could bring truck back in and he could go over it and again and I told him that after the way he had treated me that the sale was off and that I was in the process of buying one somewhere else. He keep trying to push and talk me into going back to Grubbs Nissan. I keep trying to explain to him that I was no longer interested and he keep trying to push and was very rude. I even explained to James that he was dealing with a Disabled Veteran with Bipolar and PTSD issues and that he was upsetting me and he just keep on and on. I had to end up just hanging up on him.
Whats even funnier is that my wife says that her ex-husband years ago had got thrown out of the same dealership cause of them  trying to do him wrong too. Seems like poor customer service has not changed there.

161,"September 14, 2017","Sales person I worked with at this dealership completely misrepresented the 2012 Armada I went to inspect.  A vehicle he told me that was owned by the dealership-owner, himself.  

I flew in from Kansas City to purchase the SUV with only 21,000 miles, that sales person said was in excellent condition. I was very specific. I don't want to see a door ding, a scratch - anything at all.   

I am very particular (relayed many times to the salesperson), and he assured me that the vehicle was in fantastic shape.  I was also pinning my reliance on the condition on the fact that, hey, this is the owner of the dealership's car!  It should be perfect...   

Prior to arriving, they wanted to charge me additional for tinting (already completed and not included in advertised price) and some kind of bio-clean... together, another charge of almost $1000 - added onto the price advertised.  I should have been wary right then...   

Upon arriving, every bit of trim on the vehicle was corroded, with pockmarks and discoloration due to some unknown cause - possibly salt from Colorado where he had it titled.  There were also scratches most of the way down the passenger side.  The only photos they had sent me to that point,  since the car was a new listing, were the salesperson's phone photos of the car with poor resolution.  

When I pointed out the obvious problems with the chrome trim/wheels, I was told that he thought 'it looked good for its age', but he then reversed and said that it was priced for the adverse condition.  The scratches he said 'could be buffed out'; then, why weren't they just buffed out!? What a load of...  

Manager tried to help, but the corroded, chrome trim and wheels needing replacement were appx $4500 for the parts alone, not including labor.  He tried to explain to me that I was still getting a good deal if they just added these part's costs to the vehicles advertised price.  Thanks, but no thanks.  

They even offered another vehicle that was  similar and on their lot. But, they would not even provide me any pricing information until I drove it!???

Please know however.  I was very nice/patient, but firm, the entire time.  I was just really, really disappointed. 

No offer of ride to/from the airport, soda/water.... anything.... after I spent almost $400 to get there in flight and overnight hotel, just to be  severely let down.  Then, I had to purchase the additional flight back at almost $300. 
Total of $700 and two of my days - wasted!

My opinion:  This dealership should have specific people who handle internet sales on used cars/trucks with out-of-town buyers and vehicles purchased for delivery out of state w/o an inspection.  These persons should have impeccable honesty and be absolutely forthright - with detailed pictures of the shortcomings as well as the good.

I worked with salesman Siddarriss Swann, who was very friendly and a pleasure to work with.

  But this time was different ,it all started with me just pulling up  to the service center and my door was opened.

I was greeted fairly and just felt welcomed but this situation wasn't the turning point for me. 

I expected to wait like any other place but meeting the service manager was the highlight of the day.

 He acted so humble and offered me things I didn't know cars needed and explaining it put everything together. 

On to the wait, it didn't feel like a wait at all,
 I was constantly catered to ,checked up on and given an update on what was going on. 

Finally the car is ready---

As it pulls up I Notice a different --THE CAR IS CLEANED , and not your run of the mill average run through the wash here you go but detailed like service along with when I should come in, what needs to be done soon. 

Next a full check up in writing  followed by an email with the concerns that may arise. 

Ok I grab my keys and approached the door as I  hear a calling ""MR harris, if there's anything you need please don't hesitate to call me"" (THE SERVICE MANAGER) I am shocked because you can't even get a service manager to talk to you now a days they usually send there pawns to answer questions or deliver bad news ... no not this one MR Derrick Phillips is not only  one of the best service managers I have  ever met ,he is HUMBLE and treated me like a celebrity  and that made me feel more like than a customer it dignified I am a rock star , even if this is my first time and for that I  Applaud MR DERRICK PHILLIPS OF GRUBBS NISSAN FOR A JOB WELL, SPECTACULAR, AWESOME job-- thank you sir you have made my day ---

And food for thought I live in Arlington but work right down the street from that dealership and I will be driving just so I can get that service ever time and just the  Mere fact that I seen everyone he has come into contact with-with the same service --

 Yes I will always refer and drive any length and time as long as Me Derrick Phillips is employed there ... thank you again you sir are the true winner by staying true to your self and remembering that ever one including him self will always be a customer somewhere ",5.0

The battery was manufactured and labeled from the manu less than 18 months ago, so it was obvious it was under factory warranty.  They were refusing to replace the battery because i didnt have the pirchase receipt with me.  If u can look at the batter and verify the manufacturers date.  If it was made less than 18 months ago then there was no way it was purchased before that time. So why are you required to have the receipt.  They wouldnt let me take the battery out if the car either.  I had to jump start the car and have someone physically follow me to the dealership so they could try to reject the warranty replacement.

339,"August 16, 2016","If it were possible to assign a negative star rating to describe our experience at Grubbs Nissan this past weekend, that's what we'd do. Ultimately, the bottom line issues were extremely poor  communication, high unprofessionalism, broken commitments, and complete inconsideration and lack of respect for a customer's time and value as a potential buyer. 

Thursday, at 6:30pm, we walked into the dealership with clear intentions to sell our current vehicle at a set price and we wanted the payout to us at the close of our deal, not rolled into a trade-in value on a new vehicle. Our sales consultant agreed to the set value we requested and the payout terms, which is the catalyst to us proceeding to do further business with this dealership, and purchase a new vehicle. As soon as we agreed to have the required credit background check on this transaction, to begin the new vehicle purchase process, things began to unravel. 

When speaking to the pre-owned sales manager about the terms and conditions of our new car purchase, we noticed the  amount they agreed to buy our current vehicle for was included in the amount they expected us to finance with them. For example, if Nissan agreed to pay $3,000 for our car (""trade in allowance""), there was a $3,000 ""trade in payoff"" netting against the trade in allowance in the detail of our financial agreement for the new car, essentially, meaning they were going to LOAN us the money they agreed to PAY us for our trade-in, and keep our car (= $0 value for the car for us). After 45 minutes of debating with the pre-owned sales manager, he finally agreed to remove the trade in payoff line item and handle the purchase of our current car separately. 

Thinking the primary reason for us coming to this dealership had been handled and was ready to process, we began pursuing additional business with them to start our search for a new vehicle. Originally, we were speaking to the sales consultant about buying a used car, but upon hearing about the new car rebates and incentives, we decided to pursue a new vehicle instead, especially given the pre-owned vehicle we were considering already had 30,000 miles on it but was being presented to us at the same price as a brand new vehicle. This process took another 3 hours of our evening with a lot of unnecessary back and forth, easily avoidable had our requests actually been listened to. Ultimately, at 10:30pm, the sales consultant tells us that the vehicle we want is not on their lot and they'd have to have it delivered the next day. One positive takeaway is that they allowed us to drive home a demo vehicle for the night. 

Friday morning, we sent our sales consultant a VIN # of a vehicle that had exactly what we wanted, but it was at another dealer location. He assured us that particular vehicle would be delivered, and told us we'd have to pay a $250 delivery fee that WOULD be refunded. We were hesitant to do that because we were speaking with the sales consultant over the phone and were not comfortable providing credit card details in that manner. When documentation of this refundable $250 transaction was requested, they said they could not provide us with that information. After another debate with the dealership management, a copy of a locate and deposit worksheet was texted to us and the $250 was waived. Interestingly enough, the form clearly states that the $250 fee MAY be refunded, if the vehicle delivered is not exactly as you ordered, or if Nissan Grubbs cannot provide the vehicle as described on the form.

Around 2pm, the sales consultant calls and says the car is en route and will be at the dealership in 15 minutes. Around 4pm, we were told the vehicle was at the dealership. We ask for the VIN # and mileage to register the vehicle with our insurance company, and the VIN# does NOT match what we provided earlier Friday morning. Turns out, they had a vehicle that matched our specifications already in their inventory. Don't understand the need to have a vehicle delivered that was already there, but go figure. Perhaps they were hoping we didn't contest the $250 charge and could make some easy money.

PART TWO:


We arrived at the dealership about 6pm to complete the new car purchase transaction and receive our agreed-upon payout for our current vehicle. Before heading to the finance department, we reviewed the intent to purchase form and agreed on the details, which clearly showed that the offer for our current vehicle was not rolled into the financed amount and was handwritten in the notes below, as a separate transaction. We were then asked to sign a form that specifies what Nissan owes the customer and that the customer owes Nissan (henceforth called the ""Nissan Owe/Customer Owe"" form for purposes of this review). In both sections of the form, it clearly stated ""nothing was owed"" from either party. This prompted us to ask if the agreed-upon payout check amount was not listed on this form because we would receive it upon signing the finance agreement, which is what we were expecting based on the opening conversation regarding our current car on Thursday evening. Our sales consultant then tells us that we will not receive our payout check until the new vehicle loan was funded, which could take up to 5 business days. Mind you, the payout of the current vehicle was not dependent upon the purchase of the new; they should have been mutually exclusive. The agreed-upon terms of the payout of the current vehicle was the deciding factor that catalyzed our willingness to do additional business with this dealership, and with that commitment not being upheld by Nissan, we expressed our displeasure and frustration with the lack of clear expectations and asked to speak to the general sales manager. 

The initial presentation of the general sales manager was an air of concern for us as customers of Nissan; however, when we relayed the details of everything that had transpired and all the time that was spent (now over 5 hours over the course of 2 days) to do business with them, we quickly realized that they place no value on us as people in general nor conduits to the success of their dealership. His demeanor went from ""I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do"" to one that was quite patronizing and highly unprofessional. At this time, we decided to terminate all business with this dealership, but we asked for copies of everything we signed for our own documentation purposes. He refused. Repeatedly. We felt it in our right to obtain this information, given the outcome of the transaction. Since he refused, we pursued the assistance of local law enforcement. The officer clarified that our concern was of a civil nature, but to help make amends, he recommended that copies of all documentation signed be provided to us. The sales manager claimed that he did not want to do that for competitive business purposes. We asked that if he didn't want to give them to us, that he'd shred them in our presence, so we were comfortable they would not be misused. The sales manager then said he had to retain them for customer documentation purposes. (Were we really customers if we didn't do business with them? Go figure). At any rate, we ended up getting the documentation with all financial numbers blacked out and left. 

This was a detailed account of poor customer service, lack of respect, and outright lies. We are grateful that we did not commit to business with this dealership and would encourage anyone who thinks they might want to do business with them to think twice.

UPDATE 8/15/2016

Let me tell you how Karma works in your favor when DEALERSHIPS try to get over on you. So after all the hassle that Nissan Grubbs gave me and my family, we sold our older vehicle on 8/14/2016 (SUNDAY) for the same price they were trying to get over on us on AND we received it in CASH! 
On Monday(8/15/2016) we went to Southwest Nissan in Weatherford, TX. We received the same vehicle with a BETTER package (moonroof, leather seats, crash avoidance, EVERYTHING) for $1,000 LESS than what this shady dealership tried to offer. BETTER CAR & BETTER SERVICE. GOD is good!!

340,"May 16, 2016","My wife and I live in the Wylie area and had been looking for a '16 Maxima when we found the Grubbs Nissan site. For 2+ weeks they had a Maxima SL on their site, brand new, with 3 miles for under $32K. I went online and inquired about the car and they assured me the vehicle was on the lot. I told them we'd come over and look at it the following day. The morning of the following day, one of the sales reps called to set up an appointment. I confirmed with them that the car was there. Verified the VIN, etc. Told them we'd come over after work (about 6PM) and that we would call before we headed over. That evening we headed over, giving them a call and they assured us they would pull the car out front for us to look at and test drive. 
After driving for an hour and a half in rush hour traffic, we get there to find that not only do they NOT HAVE THE CAR that they have been advertising for the past 2+ weeks, but that it was a demo that one of their sales reps was driving and the car was out with the rep. Oh BTW, it also supposedly had over 1500 miles. 
They then tried to sell us on another car but by this time we were just fed up with their BS. These guys are ""crap"" and I am in the process of writing a letter to Nissan USA because that type of advertising and behavior is reprehensible.

Very responsive and honest.  But as soon as it came time to negotiate price I was immediately transferred to the Pre-Owned Sales Manager (JR Ali), and the whole ""buying a car"" experience really went sour.  Customer service was horrible.  I was given ultimatums.  There was no desire to want to educate me with the entire process.  Oh yeah, this is my first time buying a vehicle and I made sure to let everyone know who I was in contact with so extra attention could be given.  Well anyways, we finally agreed on a price (verbally-because I live in MO and the dealership is in TX) and everything was good to go.  Just iron out details and plan accordingly for me to fly down to get vehicle some time in the near future.  Well not so much.  The verbal agreement happened late afternoon on Friday, while I was still at work, and I told my sales rep and the sales manager that I needed to wait till I was finished with work, get home to discuss everything with my wife and then try looking at flights to get there sometime on Sunday.  Saturday was out of the question because flights were full and the only flights I could get wouldn't get me to TX till around the time they closed.  Little did I know that dealerships are closed on Sundays.  With all of that being brought to the employees at Grubbs Nissan's attention I was given an ultimatum that I either find a way to get there in roughly 24 hours from the time that we verbally agree upon a contract or I risk losing the truck.  I contacted the General Manager of Sales at Grubbs (Edwardo Jordan) and left him a detailed message around morning time on Saturday and never heard back from him.  Needless to say my sales rep texted me around dinner time on Saturday saying that, ""the truck got sold early afternoon...maybe this wasn't written in your karma after all!!!!"".  Just pure filth.  I really can't say enough bad things about this dealership to deter future buyers from ever buying from Grubbs.  On top of this, I tried finding out information about warranties offered through Nissan and  could never get a hold of ANYONE!  Left two messages after speaking to a receptionist who had the worst customer service.  I am really thinking about contacting my lawyer to see if it would be worth suing this dealership over the fact that we had a verbal agreement in place and they owe me a similar truck for the same amount that was agreed upon.

Jose in the finance department was excellent as well. As you know the finance portion of the car buying experience is usually the boring and tedious part. My wife and I did have to wait for about 30 or 45 minutes before we began signing papers, but that's normal as far as I'm concerned. Once we sat down with Jose, he clearly explained all the warranty options and other add-ons typically offered by finance. I declined any additional coverage, but unlike other experiences Jose did not badger me into buying more nor did he try to guilt me into getting extra coverage. That is not to say he didn't make a second attempt at selling me the extras, but I didn't feel pressured at all. It should also be mentioned that despite being short-handed in the finance dept that day, Jose never had any moments of frustration that is typical when you are overwhelmed with customers.

I TALK TO MY GENERAL MANAGER & TOLD THEM WHY YOU GUY WALKED OUT AND HE SAID GO AHEAD AND MAKE THE DEAL AND HE IS WILL TO GO AHEAD AND MEET BOTH OF YOUR PRICES.  BOTH YOU & TB SO PLEASE GIVE ME A CALL AT THE NUMBER 817-891-1507 THANKS BY).  I informed the older couple that I was with about the voicemail.  I called Giulio back and said we will be back to sign the papers but we needed to get something to eat after being in the dealership for several hours.  Giulio and I talk several times before the day ended.  I even asked him to text me the finally numbers to make sure we was on the same page.  He text me the information with the break down.  The last call was from Giulio at 7:21 pm with the suggestion that we wait until the next morning at 9:00 am to come in to sign the papers because he hasn‚Äôt had the chance to prepare them.  We agreed because we was tired.  The next morning I called Giulio to make sure everything was in order.  He said yes that they had pull the 2 cars around and for us to come in.  Once we arrived Giulio gave us the keys to the new maxima & altima while sitting in the waiting area for them to complete the paperwork.  After Giulio kept coming back to us asking us questions about information that we had already provided to them in writing we started to get suspicious.  About 45 min. later Giulio came with the final paperwork.  The paperwork had totally different numbers.  The price had increase substantially.  You can image we was shocked.  He tried to explain why the numbers had changed.  We said no and that this is not what we agreed to and this is not the numbers that was on the paperwork before.  I showed him the text and let him listen to the voicemail that he had left.    Of course they tried to justify their actions by blaming the Manager Keith and the General Manager for not understand what the other one had agreed upon.  We decided to leave because when someone tries to deceive you its just not right. 

I hope our experience will help others to seeking the car search somewhere else.  If a business can‚Äôt be honest with their customers they don‚Äôt deserve to be in business. There are several Nissan dealership in the DFW area.  So when you see the name GRUBB NISSAN please think twice about entering into their establishment. I will be contact several others company regarding our experience to make sure the salesman Giulio, Manager Keith and General Manager will never get the chance to do this to anyone else.  I have all the documents, voicemail and texts to provide that this company shouldn‚Äôt be in business.

365,"October 07, 2014","It's sad to say that my experience with Grubbs started out extremely well. Only to end as a complete disappointment.

The sad part is that the management team didn't even acknowledge my feedback, instead they did exactly what they are doing on Yelp now...acknowledging any kudos and avoiding addressing dis-satisfied customers.

Even though my test drive and initial conversations led me to believe it would be a great experience. As a pre-approved customer I thought this would be a slam dunk.  

Their Internet Sales representative was responsive and attempted to help me close on the vehicle.  Somehow it was taken over by the Sales Manager and that's where wheels came off!  It took two days and 5 emails from me in order to get the buyers order detailing the costs for the vehicle. To make make matters worse I was emailed and told that they were busy with customers.  So, of course I had to ask for a clarification if I was perceived as a customer.  

It was disappointing when I received the quote from the team lead to not even acknowledge what had transpired (including an irate email from me), but it was passed off as making sure that the car was ready when I had acknowledgement from the Internet Sales Rep that it was being worked on.  So it was a flat out LIE.  Then I was asked to come out to close the deal that night to help the team hit end of quarter numbers, despite my previous emails with the team that I wouldn't be available due prior commitments.

It's sad to say that the price was settled and the only step left was the review of the Buyers Purchase Agreement, so I could see the fully loaded price. Upon review, I indicated the fees were high for me and I requested either they be reduced or the price of the vehicle be reduced to offset this cost.  

I received a call this afternoon informing me that I needed to be ""educated"" on this expense, which was quite insulting especially since he continued to call me buddy and friend  I've bought a number of cars and am quite familiar with the car buying fees involved.  

Nonetheless, I was informed that I was surprising the team with my request because the price is done and that I had no choice but to accept this.  So I decided to not proceed with the purchase through this rep.

I let emailed the manager about what transpired and was not surprised to get a response.  

I would not recommend speaking directly with any of their sales management team unless you want to be spoken to like you are a child. ",2.0

367,"July 24, 2014","I agree with all the other reviewers. Unfortunately did'nt read reviews before going there. They are Rip off...LIARS. Stay away! 
I would giev them not even ""0"" ZERO but system wont let em select.

They lied to me on the car condition saying its good but A/C was broke and they promised me they would fix it and give it WITH warranty. When I negotiated warranty for whole car for 90 days they agreed and signed papers. After going  to finance guy(who wanted me to buy extended warranty) they would just staright out decline and when I showed them paper work they just SNATCHED it from my hands and said ""this is dealeship property and we will do whatever we want 
to"" and walked off. Their so called MD of sales was worthless with NO empathy and not even apologetic. ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS MANAGEMENT.

Let me explain why all this happened. I think you need some surveillance cameras in the property because most probably you might not believe what they did to me. 


The accord listed online says its in good condition for 7995, BUT the A/C was broke. I started dealing with Victor Oscacio and he took my information and talked to AK Khan. They called the technician who did the inspection and discussed in the office for 30 mins and finally came up with quote saying that he reported the fault when he checked it but his manager did not record it. They promised me that they will fix the car and put a new compressor, BUT the catch was they were charging ME for that. Which I opposed and said they need to reduce the price. I was asking for 7500, they were saying 8K and Victor called up AK Khan (THE Director of pre-owned sales) to talk to me since I was not convinced. 
Here starts the lies.....Khan says the AC is just fine, it just needs a little repair and they will do it only if I pay 7750. I did not agree for that because I lost credibility in them by this point already and said how can I believe that its not gonna go bad once I take it home. Here comes another lie...they were gonna give me warranty for 90 days and asked me if I will buy then. First I said NO and I almost walked off then comes Aziz Rahman. He started this thing all over saying he will get his manager to agree with him to warranty if I pay 7750, I said if I get warranty on the whole car , not just AC I will pay 7600. I expressed my concern of not believing, he said its GRUBBS dealersip which is been in business for 42 years and moreover he dont lie so we can trust him (which didnt even last a whole hour). He assured me the warranty and brought all the paperwork including the one paper which says warranty is for 90 days. We finally made a deal based on warranty  for 7700.


When we finally went to financial office where I met Mr Alvin and MR SAMMY (the only nice and honest person of all your employees I dealt with). Alvin while going through all the papers said there is no warranty and offered me extended warranty. That made me mention my 90 days warranty. He called Keith in sales and was trying to confirm that I should not have got it. I showed him the paperwork signed by Aziz and his manager agreeing to it. He walked over there personally and brought back AZIZ after 20 minutes and he was bluntly lying saying ""oh we just signed the wrong paper"" and wait its not over yet I did not agree and asked him to send AK KHan because he also agreed to it. Khan walks in straight and says ""we did not give you any warranty"", as soon as he said that I showed him the paperwork which they signed and said I will not buy if there is no warranty, that's when he SNATCHED THE PAPERS out of my hand. I don't know if you are shocked by this behavior but I was absolutely. I said NO..you cannot do this. you cannot bully me like this..........he said ""this is dealership property and we can do whatever we want to"" and just walked off on my face. I did not know what to do and how to react I was so mad and turned red and went to MR Sammy, explained him what happened and asked for your number. He was sooo apologetic and asked me to wait and he would get the general sales manager. 


Which is MR Edwardo Jordan, the most inconsiderate manager I have ever seen in my entire life. I wish I had not spoke to him, because that only made my hatred towards the dealership worse but nothing better. All he would ""SAY"" was I apologize with absolutely no feeling whatsoever. I already mentioned this to him and saying this again that HE DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to please me or convince me. All he said was I apologize and I will give you the 90 days warranty you asked for. FYI, I was not asking or begging, I was PROMISED the warranty. So you are not doing a favor to me, after all that lying and rudeness this is ALL a GENERAL MANAGER OF SALES could do for me. Seriously?
That explains everything I hope. He would ask me what he can do for me to make me happy, everything he would do was superficial because he was biased, I said if he is been manager for 30 years he should know better of what he can do to please a customer. Which apparently he had no clue of. He would not even try to please me by any way.


I was there for 4 & 1/2 hours, wasted my time, energy, and also got a credit check on file and I guess even the title was issued under my name. but all this for nothing.
I drove all the way from Downtown Dallas even though there are several of car sellers here on Lemmon Ave which would probably sell for very cheap as well but I wanted to buy at a TRUSTED dealership, which was not the case anyways.",1.0

Mr. Michael offered a free fuel tank as an apology but we haven' t got it. We were not there for free anything we were ready to buy. We ended up buying a Nissan quest. We got to finance and the problems begun no computer system they made us wait over 2 hours and  nothing they made us come back the next day . In addition to these the information given to us was one but later we realized they had giving us a higher pay off amount for our trade in and they pay off was actually less. They had us 3 weeks.

It made us feel like a hot potato nobody was willing to take action and responsibility some of phone calls were even with a tone of sarcasm and a rude attitude (Cheryl) it is been over a month and we are still trying to get our money back.

370,"February 11, 2014",Jim Driskell is very helpful. The service department on the other hand I can not say that. I purchased a 2007 Honda Civic and in the agreement they would replace the battery(corroded posts) and battery cables(due to corrosion getting into the cables). I brought the car in to have this done and came back a following day to pick it up. It was raining so I did not check under the hood till later. I found they had only replaced the battery. Second time in now to fix the cables. My wife takes it in and they just cut the ends off and replace those. So now the factory post covers do not fit and all the red no-ox all over the battery looks like crap. So now after a few weeks mehdi daruwala sends me an email wanting me to fill out a survey on Grubbs. Which I did and with all the negative things I said in the survey you would think with him being a GM I would here something back. NOPE. I heard from my salesman Jim Driskell and he is working with me to get the issue fixed. But as far as mgmt and the service department I would not recommend them at all.,3.6
371,"January 18, 2014","Normally not a person that will write reviews but must relay the very pleasant experience that I had with Grubbs Nissan and Nasouh Elsadi in particular.  Recently purchased a 2012 Sentra for my daughters and the sales people that I delt with were extremely professional and knowledgeable on their inventory.  We settled on the Sentra we liked and were able to negotiate a fair price.  The most impressive part of the experience came after we returned home and realized that an important feature that we had wanted for the car was not included.  While we had discussed the feature (many features were discussed) early on during our sales process, I had neglected to confirm that is was actually available in this particular car.

I returned the next day and spoke with Mr. Elsadi.  I believe that he had every reason to deny my request but after discussing he agreed to provide the feature at no charge.  After setting an appointment at the service department for the install we are good to go and all truly love the car.  Huge appreciation to Clint in the service department for the excellent care and wonderful install.

374,"August 23, 2013","I purchased a 2011 Nissan Xterra from a non-Nissan dealership back in February. When I purchased this vehicle it was still under the manufacturers warranty because I am still under 36K miles. I took it into Grubbs because I was noticing some leaking from several areas when it would rain or when I would take it through a car wash, also my left blinker would not turn off after a turn. I explained to them where I was noticing all the leaks from and my experience up to this point was great, they even gave me Altima to drive because they assumed it would be a few days until my car was fixed. About 4 hours later I received a call from them stating that my vehicle was not under warranty because there had been previous rood work done, and their assumption was that my vehicle had been in an accident. I did have the CarFax on my vehicle that is CLEAN, and they then advised me I would need to return my rental and come pick up my vehicle. I complied and drove to the non-Nissan dealership where I had purchased the vehicle about 4 months prior. The graciously agreed to look at it and fix the issue, even though my purchase was a used vehicle and an ""AS IS"" sale. They found a leak in the seal of my drivers side door and the hose seal that led to my back window, all which should have been under my manufacturer warranty and had NOTHING to do with the roof of my vehicle. The parts Grubbs had pointed out to me that they thought had been replaced in an accident where shown to me to be the original from the manufacturer because of different manufacturers marking/stickers. So a week later when it rained and I was still having a problem with water leaking I called Grubbs on 6 different occasions stating that I didn't feel they did an adequate job and evaluating my situation and I wanted them to look at it again because I felt that it was a manufacturer issue. On a side note, I not only called Yvette 3x but I also called the service supervisor 3x and left messages, none of my calls were returned. They said they would advise me to take it back to where I had the work done because that would be better. I called the general service phone number and the lady I spoke with (not Yvette or the service manager I had left messages for)said if it was found to NOT be a manufacturer issue than I would be responsible for $190 diagnosis fee. When it was all said and done I took my vehicle to Texas Nissan of Grapevine and they repaired my vehicle no questions asked and gave me a rental. They made NO mention of my vehicle ever being in an accident and they know how to take care of their customers! I don't believe my vehicle was EVER in an accident and I do NOT trust Grubbs Nissan to ever work on my vehicle. On a side note, Grubbs never fixed my blinker either.",2.5

They treated me very nice and thank me for driving out there cause they saw my addresses and knew I drove from Mansfield to their location. 
And their prices were very reasonable they save me $513.00 from the other service shops I went too and kept me updated through the process and there shuttle took me to work in Arlington . I would recommend anybody that has a Nissan or non Nissan to take your car for service they do a good job!

380,"May 10, 2013","Upon arriving at Grubbs Nissan, I was welcomed by Greg Williams.  He asked me a few qualifying questions and began assisting me in finding a used CPO Altima that would fit my requirements.  Greg was very pleasant to work with and answered the questions I had.  He was more than willing to quickly locate a 4 and 6 cylinder Altima for me to test drive.  We did our test drives, and I settled on a specific vehicle.

Having already visited another Nissan dealership which ended unsatisfactorily (within one week of visiting Grubbs Nissan), I was hoping this second experience would prove to be better.  Thankfully, that is what happened.  After determining which vehicle I wanted, Greg helped me work with the Sales Mgr to agree upon a trade-in value.  Patrick Jordan and I spoke and we ended up settling on a deal, and he sent me the specifics the next day via email to confirm.

Greg also offered me the option to take the vehicle home over night.  I could sense he knew I was serious about making a purchase, and he was just as serious about doing whatever he needed to do to close the sale.  I really appreciated his effort from the beginning and his follow-through each step of the way - including after the purchase was finalized.

My only major complaint comes in the area of financing and completing the necessary paperwork.  That process took too long for a Tues night with no other customers in sight.  Granted, the finance manager was working with a trainee, but the process could have went more smoothly.  I would have appreciated more professionalism in response to me declining various offers.

The finance manager was visibly and audibly frustrated with my decisions, as was evidenced in his tone.  Was I overly surprised by a less than stellar finance office experience? - No, but the experience could have been better.  I've been through a horrible finance office experience, a great one, and then this one fell somewhere in-between.

Overall, I'd say my experience was a 4 out of 5.  To clarify, none of my ratings of <5 have any bearing on Greg Williams.  He is a 5 all the way.  He was a great representation of Grubbs from start to finish.",4.2

The first service was on the drivers door because it was not sealed good from the factory.  They said they ordered the part and 2 months later never heard from them.  We called them and they had to order the part again.  Finally got it in and it was the wrong color.  They installed it anyway and we are stuck with it.  Second service call, employee named Jeff treated my wife like an idiot and I had to get involved.  They ended up giving us the service manager(Clint) and he took care of service call.  Third service was a flat tire and oil change.  On this trip, they said they couldn't repair a minor flat that was caused by a small screw between the treads in the middle of the tire.  They wanted us to purchased a new tire.  They took over an hour to let me know this and didn't get to the oil change.  I had the tire fixed at a Walmart just down the road without any problem.  Last service call, said it was beyond the covered service period(15K miles), tried to explain our last problem(would have been under the service period) and they just baulked and we paid for the oil change.  The lady ask if we wanted a new air filter for $30 and my wife asked if we needed one.  The lady said she didn't know, but it was her job to ask everybody for the new air filter... What a freaken joke!   We just purchased a new vehicle and would have purchased it here, had the service been there.

What is the website for if you are not going to take advantage of it? This was a huge waste of my time. I had to go over everything again with Yvette, even though I had already scheduled the appointment and listed all the issues. Very annoying but I stayed polite and didn‚Äôt let her know that this upset me.

3/30  11:13-I called and left a voicemail for Yvette

3/30  2:39- I called and finally got Yvette- only to find out I left my car @ Grubbs for a day & half only to find out the ‚ÄúCertified Technician was not able to duplicate any of the issues‚Äù At that point I was asked to come ride with the technician to diagnose the problem‚Ä¶?? 

The customers that are showing up during the construction should not be dealing with this kind of service. I would think you would do everything possible to make your customer happy? When I left Yvette knew I was not happy, therefore why didn‚Äôt a service manager reach out to me to see what could be done? 

The fact is the front end IS popping when the brake is applied. I notice it every time I back out  of my driveway and apply the brake to shift from reverse to drive.  This is not a unknown issue and very easy to research using google and entering ‚Äú2012 nissan maxima front end popping when applying the brake‚Äù  
 
In addition to the front end popping I‚Äôve also notice the driver seat and the passenger seat both rock as if they were not tightened down. Again this was something the technician was not able to diagnose??  This is a common problem and I am not sure why the technicians are not recognizing the problem? ",1.8

The original sales rep that secured the appointment was not available so I tried the online chat option as I had some additional questions about the car.  Wally Bello took the chat and quite frankly told me to call the toll free number again and ask for Haji.  He then ended the chat. No thanks guys!  I am working harder than you are to sell the car, really? ",2.0
395,"February 04, 2013","Had a great used car buying experience here last week.  Went in after finding the car I wanted (a 2012 Dodge Charger R/T) listed with a great price on the Internet.  Price was further reduced just before I arrived and happily honored once I got there.  I worked with Shone Alestock during the test drive, inspection and on into the purchase process and he was friendly, low-pressure and great to work with the whole way.  Definitely very pleased by the experience.

Once I decided to buy the car, we worked out a very fair deal and had all the paperwork taken care of super quickly by Brandon Fraikes in the finance office.  There were no unexpected mystery fees, everyone was very up-front about costs when I asked, and the only things added ""below the line"" were complimentary value-adds.  Grubbs really did take all the hassle out of buying a used car!

Many thanks to everyone at Grubbs for offering a top-notch experience that I'll definitely remember -- and recommend to all.",5.0

Many times I was discouraged and he reassured me that it would all work out.  After several test drives & a bunch of No's on my end, I finally chose a 2007 Camry which I love. His customer service & will to not give up on me was Great. I would & will go back when I purchase my Maxima. Thanks Greg.  ",4.0

My interest rate on 10-year-old cars would be around 26%. On a whim, I called Grubbs Nissan, speaking with GSM Jesse Hull. I told him my sad credit story, assuming the worst. A day later, Jesse called me back with the best of news: He and his dealership could get me into a brand-new 2012 Nissan Altima immediately at an 18% interest rate, allowing my payment to be very manageable. Imagine my surprise; this was beyond my dreams. I raced into the dealership to sign the agreement, which took about 15 minutes. This is my first new car in over 20 years and I couldn't be happier. I have a better car than I ever imagined, which can hold my entire family comfortably, at an unbelievable interest rate! On a 1 to 10 scale, I'm giving Grubbs Nissan and Jesse Hull a 14 !!!

Mr. Malone was an amazing gentleman, down-to-earth and honest - something I was wary about, I have heard the horror stories of dealing with typical car salesmen and I was blown away by the exceptional customer service and the care and understanding he had for my own personal needs and wants.

413,"September 11, 2011","WARNING! High Pressure Sales Tactics are used by the pre-owned sales staff. I was shopping for a Nissian SUV to get some price quotes so I could compare prices from another dealerships offer and weigh my financing options and check rates. He took me to the finance department and left me wiith another high pressure finance salesman selling me an extended warranty for 2000.00 I told him I didn't want--he wouldn't take no for an answer. He kept talking and I couldn't speak.  My payment is almost double what I went in telling Michael LaMarr my budget would allow.
Within 3 days I took the SUV in to have a scratch buffed out- which was removed. EXCEPT! When I got the SUV back and did a walk around the bumper had a crack that wasn't there - when I pointed it out,,, salesman Cliff Roberts said, ""That was already there and can't be fixed--you will have to replace your bumper!""

Grubbs shares an interest in many different types of motorsports.  I've personally watched them generously support grassroots motorsports events, not only as sponsors, but as attendees and enthusiasts.

420,"April 26, 2011","I shopped online for months and ended up going to Grubbs based on positive reviews of the dealership. My local dealer had many negative reviews and I was unhappy with a visit to another local dealer the week before. When pulled into Grubbs I parked on the used lot by mistake. I ended up meeting salesman Dan Daniel. He worked on the used lot but was nice enough to show me around the new lot. They had a nice selection and Dan braved a test drive even though I warned him I had never owned a vehicle with a standard transmission. After driving the car I knew I had to have it. A few days later we worked out a deal. Dan had the car polished up and went over the whole car with me. He even got the blue tooth paired with my phone before I left the lot. He called a few times the week after to make sure I was figuring out all the buttons and such. When plates came in he helped me round them up. He even scheduled my first oil change which will be coming up soon. I'll be sure to stop by and tell him hello when I'm up there. 

For me, the salesman makes all the difference and Dan is a good guy. If your in the market for a new or used vehicle give him a call.

425,"April 12, 2011","I ordered a 2012 Nissan GT-R from Grubbs back in early January.  I chose to use Grubbs because of the positive experience I had when I bought my 2011 GT-R from them last year.  The car was delivered at the end of March. 

I dealt mostly with Bill McKenzie throughout the time from order until delivery.  Bill was very patient and understanding with me, which was good, because I contacted him regularly about the status of my ordered car.  I bet the last two weeks before I took delivery we talked daily either by phone or email.  Once my car landed at the dealership Bill made sure it was sent to make-ready as quickly as possible so I could take delivery without too much delay.  I greatly enjoyed my experience with Bill.

The management team from Eric Grubbs on down did a very good job making me feel at home during this buying process.  I know some folks knock the GT-R because it is only sold through ""pedestrian"" Nissan dealers, but I will say I felt as well taken care of here as I have at any Lexus, BMW or Porsche dealer I have dealt with.  Even now, three weeks after taking delivery, whenever I arrive at the dealership I get greeted and welcomed by name by members of the management team I dealt with during the buying process.

I appreciate that Grubbs is still an independent family owned operation.  I feel like you get a more personal experience at an independently owned dealer.  I like knowing that if I ever have an issue I can speak to the owner himself to get it resolved if needed.  Plus, I own a small family business and like to support other locally owned businesses in the area.    ",4.8
