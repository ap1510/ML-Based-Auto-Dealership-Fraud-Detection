0,"June 10, 2020","The experience that everyone else is sharing defines what my girlfriend is currently going though!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Being widowed she bought a new 2007 Camary and PREPAID for the LIFETIME OIL CHANGES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Now they will NOT honor her PREPAID LIFE TIME OIL CHANGES!!!!!!!!!!!!
What kind of mentality do the management have with this dealership???????????? Why were they so HOT to have her PREPAY when she bought the car new?????????? OH, I know $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
Like the others NO ONE at the dealership has the Ba___ to call me. I have tried all the same people listed with NO success!!!
I was a business owner for 35 years in Plano purchased many company vehicles over the years and have never heard of such BS!!!!!!!!!!!!
I have already told about 8 people that were looking for a car what JOHN EAGLE is doing and they ran the other way!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I truly hope this situation will be the demise of management or that JOHN EAGLE goes UNDER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

1,"June 02, 2020",When we purchased our 2012 Camry from Sport City we paid extra for lifetime oil changes.  Today my wife tried to make an appointment for service and was told that they cancelled the program.  I find this confusing since I still own the car and I appear to be living.  They are not returning my calls.  This is nothing less than theft!  We will not be going back to Sport City Toyota for anything and we recommend everyone staying away.,1.0
2,"May 08, 2020","Went to John Eagle Sports City Toyota today to get service for my 2009 Tacoma Truck, which I purchased from that dealership.  I have used that dealership for all my repairs since the original purchase.  Today I needed brake work, free lifetime oil change, console light bulb replacement and a state inspection.  I was informed by the service man, they no longer honor the free lifetime oil change. I told him they could not cancel that service since my truck purchase stated free lifetime oil change.  He said the whole program had been canceled. That my truck had received the maximum amount of free oil changes.  I stated, it was a lifetime obligation by Sports City.  He said it had been canceled.

I told him I would go elsewhere to get the service I needed for my truck and I left.

John Eagle Sports City Toyota has lost a customer.   ",1.0
3,"May 07, 2020","Very disappointed that Sport City would cancel lifetime oil change agreement and ruin their reputation over a small amount of oil.  Purchase my 2007 Tundra, which currently has 111,00 miles on it,  because of the lifetime oil change.  Went in this month for my oil change and was told that the program had been cancelled even though the agreement states ""non cancelable"" and ""non transferable"".  When I questioned how they could do this I was told by the General Sales manager, Wiley Jackson that ""I got my moneys worth out of my oil changes"" when I stated that their was no monetary value on the agreement he said, ""you people just use us as a slush fund and get your maintenance done somewhere else"" 

I then contacted Gary Gray the General manager by email, his response gave no apology for inconvenience it was just very abrupt and I was told that there was no mistake, that the program was not being followed by the customer and that taxes and shop fees were not being collected or paid and so it wasn't a good program for the store.  The program was intended for customer retention and was a reasonable loss for that purpose.  In other words, you haven't bought another vehicle from us so we are cancelling our agreement with you because it doesn't benefit us.   

I have been considering purchasing a new truck for a few months now but now know that I won't be purchasing it from Sports City.  Very disappointed in their customer service and unprofessionalism.  It could have been handled much better.  ",1.0
4,"April 24, 2020","I bought my car at Sport City Toyota, Dallas in 2013. I bough an extended warranty package including also  lifetime oil change. Today, March 22,2020 took my car to the service and I was told that the “life time oil change” is not good anymore! How fair is that! Very disappointed with this dealership!",1.0
5,"April 17, 2020",Contacted service dept to schedule lifetime oil change and was informed offer no longer valid because dealership had been sold. I will never purchase another vehicle from this Toyota location.,1.0
6,"April 15, 2020","Purchased my vehicle new 2010 and was given lifetime oil changes. This agreement states it is ""non cancelable"" ""non transferable"". I am the original owner of the vehicle and have had all the service work on this car done at this dealer. Today I'm told the lifetime oil change program has been ""discontinued"". They are no longer honoring it. There was no communication to customers that were still using this program. Attempted to contact Gary Gray, General Manager but no response. I encourage anyone having this same issue to contact general manager & if no results then contact regional toyota to complain. Can also file complaint with Better Business Bureau & Texas Department of Motor Vehicles.",1.6
7,"March 24, 2020","I came in at !:20 p.m. on 3/24 during the Coronavirus pandemic.  Of course, I hated to be out - but one does need to have access to their car.  In short, I live at 3:45 p.m.

I have been a customer of this dealership and 4 vehicles!  I told the person who checked me in that this was the third  battery in less than a year for my 2014 Avalon and wanted to know (1) were they replacing because it’s under warranty with a rebuilt battery?  No response.  When the fellow (Brent) who was at lunch came in - he didn’t approach me; I had to go out (at this point 1 1/2 hours waiting).  He said “I’ll check on it”.  Then 1/2 hour later he came to tell me they were checking on the battery.  Again, I reminded  him of the past 3 batteries. He said there were 2; guess I know how many and not to worry it was on warranty...... another 1/2 hour, my car was pulled up.  

In short - no answers to my question as to why 3 batteries in less than a year!   AND, the place was almost empty; people came and went.  I had an appt and I WAS the last to leave.  Unacceptable!  I always used Carlos Ramirez wh9 left after they sold.   I hope someone at Toyota reads this my questi9n still needs to be answered!",1.0
8,"March 21, 2020","This is the worst dealership i have seen. The service personnel are rude and unprofessional! They always try to overcharge and they don't even let customers talk to mangers for complaints. They just tried to charge me $77 for my regular oil change which i pay $59 all the time. And when i asked to talk to the manager they said he is in the meeting. Eventually,  i paid $62 . Raymond was so unprofessional. He told me i will pay $77 next time if i come there for a service. I will never go back and i will tell my friends not to go there!!!",1.0
9,"March 02, 2020","I bought my vehicle at this dealership because of the lifetime oil change because this dealership is not close to me but was woth it for this reason. I was told today because this was costing them money this lifetime was now cancelled. How can you cancel a lifetime warranty. It is not my fault i hold on to my vehicle and advertise that these vehicles last so why are you surprised that there will be years of oil changes.

11,"November 27, 2019","I recently purchased a used, 2015 Toyota Highlander Hybrid from Sport City Toyota.  My used car dealer was Jesse and he did a great job!
He answered all of my questions and handled the negotiation in an upfront manner without pressure.
The car is in great shape.  I was able to see a full CarFax report and Jesse explained the history of the car that he was aware of.  I was able to take my time during inspection and the test drive was very straightforward.

There is one thing that we are not happy with, we purchased the vehicle late of the day, got out of the dealer at 10pm, the next day we found out there is a chip on the right side of the vehicle and another scratch on the left side, we trusted the dealer to inspect their car before they sell, but this happened to our car.  Today we had to bring the car back to touch up that, which interferes my life and job.  Ted took care of us very well.  However the dealer should inspect their vehicles very well before it's ready for sale and make sure no chip or scratch to the new vehicles.

I call and of course it’s gone. No I didn’t have a deposit to hold the vehicle but the least you could do is give me a call and let me know. I had to find out less than 4 hours before my flight, and of course with airplane cancellation fees, and this fee and that fee, I lost out on $257...  gone to nothing.

100,"April 06, 2019","I like the Sienna I bought In June 2018. However, when I was signing the Vehicle Buyers Order, there was an item on there that had not been mentioned before. The salesman (I think his name was Dolph)  told me it was for 5 years of oil changes. Since I live it Fort Worth, I told him I did not want it because I would not drive that far for service. He said I should be able to use it anywhere and if not, let them know and they would refund it. Sure enough when I went to Freeman Toyota in November to get my oil changed, it was not honored. Mallorie, the service advisor, researched it and told me it was for the Sport City Oil Change Program and was not transferable. I called and spoke to my salesman at Sport City who said he would speak to his manager and call me back. He did not. I called the finance manager several times, but my calls were never returned. I was out $599 for nothing. As far as I am concerned this is deceptive trade practices so BEWARE!",2.0
101,"January 29, 2019","UPDATE:  After SIX months I was finally told today that they (Sports City Toyota) accepted my lease from a leasing company that they don't do business with.  I called numerous times, I visited the company numerous times as did my husband and they NEVER ONCE got back to me.  I called Les - the leasing manager at least 40 times to get this resolved.  Because this has taken so long my remaining balance was sent to collections and my credit went from excellent to fair.  The general manager Jeff Russian had the audacity to tell us, ""Well why didn't you just pay it and worry about it later??""  Well WHY DON""T YOU DO YOUR JOB AND TRAIN YOUR INCOMPETENT EMPLOYEES SO THEY DON'T ACCEPT LEASES THAT THEY ARE UNABLE TO CORRECTLY DEAL WITH????  I turned in my car with Florida plates, they knew it was an out of state car and didn't check who I had financed through.  I called at least 100 times and NEVER got a call back.  This is the WORST customer service I have ever had to deal with in my lifetime.  THIS IS THEIR FAULT!  THEY ACCEPTED MY LEASE RETURN!!!!!  I SHOULD HAVE BEEN TOLD, ""WE CAN'T ACCEPT IT!"" I should have driven it back to Florida myself.  Worst experience ever.  WILL NEVER do business with Toyota again.  I'm going to post this experience I went through everywhere possible.  The worst employees I've ever dealt with.  If I acted the way these people act at my job I'd be fired immediately - as would most people.  They don't care at all about their customers.  NEVER RETURNED ONE CALL!!!!!!!!! All of this could have been easily avoided if they actually knew how to do their job and told me, ""Oh sorry, we can't accept your lease here.""  Complete fail on their part.   

DO NOT RETURN A LEASE HERE.  They are completely incompetent and haven't trained their employees to deal with lease returns.  I turned my lease in July 31st and later received a bill with a late charge for another months rent because they didn't process the paperwork until the 16th of August!  When I called to get this settled I was greeted with what would be the equivalent of a bunch of hysterical children having no idea what to do.  They keep trying to blame me because I didn't know the name of the person that took my information when I turned it in, who assured me they would process everything and that I had nothing to worry about as I'll I had to do was fill out a piece of paperwork with my name and account number and the millage on my car.  The whole process took about 10 min and then I SAW HIM GIVE MY INFORMATION TO THE MANAGER.... so clearly it should be documented somewhere.  They then changed their tone and told me that there's a ""special"" person you turn your lease into - WHY WOULD I KNOW THIS???? WHY WOULDN""T THEIR EMPLOYEES KNOW THIS?  When I was greeted at the door and told them, ""Hey, I'm turning in my lease!""  why wasn't I told, ""Oh here's so and so... the lease guy!""  The woman on the phone called me an idiot and hung up on me - that's how unprofessional these people are.  I then called back and spoke with the leasing manager and low and behold he was able to find that special piece of paper I had been asking for the entire time that had the date of when I turned in my lease.  He too was extremely short and was obviously irritated I was bothering him.  This is a scam.  They are literally scamming people.  I am going to contact the BBB about this.  Ye be warned!",1.0

106,"March 20, 2018","I found a car I wanted on the internet and visited the dealership on a Friday afternoon. Upon arrival, Curtis was circling my car waiting for me to approach. As soon as I did, he pounced. I didn't even get within 100 yards of the front door. The car I went in to see was ""just purchased' so we went out on the lot to look at other options. After a while I found another car I was interested in and we went inside to run some numbers. This car had been on the lot for over 90 days and was at the rock-bottom ""blow-out price'. I made it crystal clear what my maximum monthly payment should be and had already been pre-approved by my bank. However, Curtis assured me that Toyota would be able to get me a lower rate so he ran my credit and offered me a much lower rate. After reading another person's review and after this horrible experience, I am terrified to think about what damage might have been done to my credit and the fact that this man now has access to all of my information. We went back and forth for some time trying to reach an agreement that was closer to my asking price and he kept disappearing to see if he could make it happen. *eye roll* We couldn't agree on the numbers and I had to leave so I reiterated the exact monthly payment that I was not budging on and he said he would see what he could do and asked if I could go back in the next day. Before we even sat down to talk about the car, I had let him know I was unavailable the next day (Saturday) and continued to say that throughout our conversation; although, I was open to coming in if we could agree on the rate I was asking for. Through the evening, we texted back and forth and he reassured me that he would be able to make the deal happen if I could just come in the next day. Mind you, he had a copy of my DL, car insurance and paperwork in his possession, yet throughout our 3 days of exchanging texts, he never once spelled my name correctly. This is a very small, but very big detail when it comes to customer service. He misspelled my name 3 different ways during our interaction. customer service 101 - know your customer.
Saturday morning at 7am, I texted him and told him there was no way I was going to be able go back in to the dealership. He sent a string of condescending and passive aggressive text messages pressuring me to go in and attempting to make me feel like I was putting him in a bad position with his finance department. The messages were unbelievably unprofessional and disrespectful. I was honestly shocked at how he was talking to me, but I had a nasty feeling about him the second he opened his mouth. I held my ground and told him I was absolutely not going in that day and if that meant the deal was done, I was okay with it because I was not going to be strong-armed when I was already clear about my unavailability. He didn't respond for 3 hours, but when he did, it was a passive aggressive text completely unrelated to the car-buying process ... followed by ""lol"", naturally. I told him I would be in on Monday after work and that was that. Monday rolls along and he called and texted me that morning to see if I was coming back in. I told him I would be in after 5:30pm, again, and he said ""cool I'll see you then"". It took an hour to get to the dealership in rush hour traffic, but when I pulled up (and before the car was even in PARK, another salesman was standing right in front of the car. I almost didn't get out because it was so aggressive. Who does that?!?! The guy was so close he could have touched the hood and was looking at us through the windshield while we parked and sat in the car. I've never seen anything like that. When I got out,  he immediately pounced (been there, done that) and I told him I was there to see (Shady) Curtis Lacy. Curtis went to get the keys and wouldn't you know .... IT WAS JUST SOLD! When he told me I thought he was kidding so I just sat there for a while. He didn't apologize and offered the following: ""you know, this is what happens when you don't jump on a good deal. I have people all the time that say they're coming in to sign paperwork on a car and they never show up. Matter of fact, I can show you text messages."" This was clearly a dig at me for not going in to close the deal Saturday. He showed no remorse or emotion at all. I honestly don't even think the car was sold, and if it was, why wouldn't he have given me the heads-up? He hasn't followed up at all.

108,"July 18, 2017","Some people get addicted to meth, some people get married to someone that they never actually loved, the biggest mistake of my youth? Trusting the sales team at Sport City Toyota. In the process of trading in a car they deliberately changed the deal we had agreed on, almost ruined my credit score, and falsified my information when they submitted it to the bank all under the guise of “trying to save me money”. If you’re looking on these websites because you’re deciding whether you should buy from Sport City Toyota or go to another place, I strongly urge you to seek other options because honestly going here has become one of the few regrets I have in life. If you’re curious about the entire story, keep on reading but be prepared…it’s going to be a long one so don’t continue if you have the attention span of a goldfish.

The day started off normal, I went to Sport City because I needed to get my car serviced and as I was sitting there I noticed one of the sales people (I’m omitting his name because the General Manager is the only person that truly needs to know who it is) was walking around talking to the people sitting in the waiting area to get a feel for their situations. He stopped and spoke to an older man that was sitting there about his vehicle, and I remember hearing him talk about the fact that the man had a lot of positive equity in his car and was trying to explain why that was a good thing. The man wasn’t completely interested, so the salesperson ended the conversation and attempted to find some greener pastures. I happened to be sitting there, and I’m generally a friendly person so when he engaged me I smiled and introduced myself. Then he said a sentence that will forever haunt me because it was the first lie in a string of lies that led me to the worst decision of my life, and that sentence was “I just want to save you some money”…of course the idea was appealing, and he seemed (I emphasize that word) like a genuine person, so I decided to take him up on that offer. 
We walked back to the sales area and started talking. We went back and forth about what I was looking for in a car, what was going on with my current lease, and after a bit he brought in another member of the sales team to take over. The new person and I continued the conversation, and we went out to look at some of the cars he was talking about. At this point I was completely uninterested because the deals he was offering were all laughably bad, and I made that fact clear to him. As the discussion started to fizzle out since it was clear that I wasn’t going to bite, the other sales person came back into the picture and asked what was wrong. I explained everything and he said “Oh, so it’s just the car” and then headed on back to whatever lair he would go to when he’d disappear. 
After waiting for a bit, the second sales person came back with a huge smile on his face saying that I would be happy with what they had for me. They had found a car that had just been returned that was only a year older but was a better model and had about 19k miles less than mine. This was night and day compared to the last deals they had brought, so I was intrigued and decided to pursue this one a bit further. This was a mistake. We discussed my terms, and I was very adamant about the fact that I didn’t want to make any kind of down payment on the car and that I wasn’t looking for any kind of huge increase in my payments. He understood. Around about this time, the original salesperson came back again and started talking about the rates they could offer. There was some jargon about how I had negative equity in my car, and I would have to take care of that which was okay with me. He then gave me the range of prices that they could get financed, and I told him that if he could get me the lowest number on the range without me having to do a down payment we would have a deal. He immediately shook my hand on that and had me sign a paper that showed that I agreed. He then mentioned the fact that in order to get this deal, I had (and he stressed the “had” part) to get approved for a Toyota Credit Card. I thought this was a bit strange, but I agreed because I figured there was no harm in getting a credit card, in fact it would help me since having more accounts actually helps raise your credit score (I tend to be a bit of a nerd when it comes to my credit). He scurried back to his lair and returned after a beat to let me know that I had been approved because I had (again I stress “had”) fantastic credit. We got back down to business signing some of the basic paperwork, and my curiosity got the best of me. I decided to ask him about the credit card and what my obligations were for it in regards to whether I had to spend money on it regularly or what. He said nothing. I continued to pry and indicated that I thought the portion of my negative equity would be put on the card which caused him and the other salesperson to laugh and deny that…but that’s all that was said about it. 
At this point we were pretty much on the path to closing the deal, so the second salesperson wanted to get another signature on a mock contract. As I looked over the contract I noticed that there was something incorrect on it (it was something basic like my name or phone number), so I let the guy know and he hurried to get it fixed. He came back with the corrected contract, but I noticed a new problem with this one…the deal we had made was changed to be 3 months longer and the payment was adjusted to be the highest side of the range of rates. I pointed this out and he looked surprised then ran back to check what happened. He came back and assured me that it was “just a typo” and that it wouldn’t affect the deal at all. This again seemed kind of sketchy to me, but I decided to take his word for it and signed it.
After this they handed me off to finance in order to complete the deal. I signed everything as it came to me until finally we got to the last signature and the finance person told me what I was going to pay…it was the deal that was “just a typo”…I mentioned the fact that this was incorrect and he stated that if we decreased the amount of months it would increase the payment amount. I didn’t know what to do since I had signed everything else, so I just signed the last line.
Fast forward to the next week, I received a call from the bank that provided me the loan but I missed it. The next day the finance department from Sport City called and stated that I would need to call the bank back and confirm the information that was submitted to them regarding my financial situation. The rep went over what was sent, and I came to a startling realization…the salesperson had sent false information to the bank. When asked about my job at the dealership, I told them my accurate wages and that I technically hadn’t started the job because I had just been hired; however, the information that the rep told me they gave to the bank was 20k more than I make and had me working for the place for 6 and a half years…which would mean that I started when I was 16. Now I don’t know if that’s standard practice, but I do know that if I knowingly submitted incorrect information to a loan provider it would be grounds for termination of the contract.
So with all of this happening, I figured things couldn’t possibly get any worse…then I got a letter from the Toyota credit card company. I opened it and literally felt my heart drop. The letter showed that I was responsible for a 4 thousand dollar charge on a 5 thousand dollar limit card. This was shocking for 2 reasons: 1. I was not told that this was going to happen, I can guarantee that I wouldn’t have gone through the deal if I had been told and 2. I don’t know if you’re aware of this but having a balance that’s that high will ruin your credit (personally, mine dropped over 40 points because of it). Now I’ve never been depressed before, but I’m pretty sure I know how it feels now. Nothing could bring me any amount of joy; music and singing are some of my greatest passions but for the next few days even my favorite songs failed to make me even smile. It was hands down the lowest point I’ve ever gotten to in my entire life because in that moment I realized that as a 23 year old I had increased my debt load by over 10 thousand dollars simply by being agreeable and trusting a person who claimed to have my best interest in mind.
As the days went by, my shock was replaced by disgust which then became indignation. I couldn’t believe that a person would go out of their way to cause another person to go further into debt and be so shady about it (especially since they’re supposed to be professionals). I decided that I would try to find a way out of this deal that had caused me so much heartache because everything about it was done in a gut churningly sketchy way. I reached out to a lawyer to see what could be done, and they stated that we may have something because of the credit card situation since they had never heard about that being done before. Unfortunately we weren’t able to pursue that route because *surprise* there was no paper proof that showed the sales rep said I had to get the card to get the deal (it’s almost like they had done it before and knew how to cover their tails). I should also note that in the process of talking to the lawyer, I found out that they had put the charge on the credit card and said it was a down payment…which if you recall was exactly what I said I didn’t want. The sketchiness was over 9 thousand at this point but now it was clear I wasn’t going to be able to get out of the deal, so I just resigned to the fact that this was going to be a new part of my life. However, I decided to make it my personal mission to do my best to make sure that this never happens to anyone else.
I got in contact with Sport City’s general manager and let him know what had happened and that I wasn’t telling him about all this because I wanted him to make it right, it was a bit too late for that. I explained that this was just me giving him the facts in order to hopefully help fix the problem with the sales reps. We then went through several phone calls where he tried to make things better by righting the wrongs because I think he even realized that the way this situation was handled was unacceptable. I will admit he was able to do a lot, he removed the charge from the credit card and lowered the payment slightly. However, the entire time it felt almost like I was pulling teeth. He would try to do the bare minimum to see if I would accept it then go a bit further once I didn’t respond with enthusiasm and when it came to the end he refused to give me the deal that I had initially wanted. So honestly now that I’m writing it out and thinking about it fully, he wasn’t even that interested in completely making things right…he just wanted to make sure they didn’t lose too much money while trying to calm a disgruntled customer. Which I guess is all we are to them…customers, not people. We’re just the things that they use to make sure they make their numbers and get paid at the end of the day…huh…well I’m going to wrap this up now because thinking about it too much still puts me in a bad mental space and apparently makes me see the true motive behind all their “kind” gestures.
I used to honestly believe that all people are inherently good and that if I was kind and treated others with respect, they would do the exact same thing to me. But after this whole ordeal, I now realize that I need to guard myself at all times because some people will try to take advantage of me when I’m not expecting it. Now in the long run I will take responsibility for the fact that I signed every document that they gave to me but again, it was just because I couldn’t fathom that people would be so untrustworthy and shady with how they treat other people. So congrats Sport City…you’ve successfully added another cynic to the world.
So for those of you that stuck with me this entire time, I appreciate and am slightly amazed by your attention span and hope this has helped you make your decision. For those of you that didn’t…well it doesn’t matter what I say, but I hope whatever cat video you clicked on to escape this made you giggle.
P.S. Another few small housekeeping things that they failed to take care of is the car was still dirty when they handed it over, they didn’t fill up the gas tank, and they didn’t give me a second key…these pale in comparison to all the other things, but I figure they should at least get an honorable mention.",1.6

 Mickey was very courteous in helping me scheduling and completing my 20,000 mile service appointment on my 2016 Camry.    In my 4 1/2 years in Dallas, he has been very honest and straight forward in helping complete service and repairs for my cars.)

Mickey never attempted to sell me on anything that was not necessary and when there was a repair, he took plenty of time to educate me on the problem and the choices I had with the risks and benefits with waiting for repairs.

Congratulations to Sport City Toyota for having Mickey working there - he is a valuable asset and a great helper inhaling me decide to get a new 2016 to replace my 1999 Camry, even thought I did not have 200,000 miles yet.  Mickey referred me to Sam Butt, who worked with me to buy the car that is great (I just took a 7,800 mir driving trip across the western US states - it was a dream car and performed above the advertised gas mileages posted on the window sticker.

The one suggestion i can give to you for improvement is to make immediate improvements in the customer waiting area.  I was forced to wait in the new car sales area and the music was blasting and the coffee was old.  Our other car is a Mercedes, so we may just be used to being taken care of at Park Place, but I do think you could make some improvements.  Create a more relaxing environment and make fresh coffee.

170,"November 01, 2016","I visited this dealership expecting a great sales experience as my wife experienced a couple years ago when she bought a used 2012 Toyota Camry SE. It was not the case. I had just visited Toyota of Plano and was looking at a 2014 Toyota Camry SE and wanted to stop by Sport City Toyota to look at a 2013 Toyota Camry SE that was advertised on the internet. I pulled into a parking space and 3 guys were standing together near the parking space, I got out of my car and they asked me what I needed. I told them I was looking to buy a car. Then one of them asked me if I was looking for Frank. I just looked at him and showed him the car I was looking for that was advertised in the internet. I asked him where the car was and he said he didn't know and would have to look. We walked up to the Used Car Building. Instead of walking beside me and talking to me on the way up he walked in front of me and never said a word. Very unprofessional in my opinion. He came back out with the keys and said, ""Here it is parked right here but it looks like someone is trying to buying it"". He didn't offer to ask if i might be interested in looking at another car or ask me what i was looking for to make a recommendation to sell me another car. I told him I was looking at another car at Toyota of Plano that was a 2014 and this car was a 2013 and how much he could come down on the cost of this car. He said they both had the same mileage and this was as cheap as he could go. Made that decision without even talking to the Sales Manager!!! I just walked away and headed back to Toyota of Plano and was treated with respect and professionalism and the way a customer should be treated that is making an investment for a car

I'm not sure what has happened between the time my wife bought her car and my experience a couple Saturdays ago. The Sales Manager and GM should be ashamed of themselves to hire these sales people and condone the unprofessional conduct and sales practices of these salespeople. Based on the previous reviews my experience doesn't seem to be an isolated case. Seems to be a pattern. ",1.0

When I returned the next morning another salesperson told she wasn't in yet but would inform the manager that I'm back. I saw that person talking with the manager's office.

I waited about 15 minutes then walked out and the manager didn't even try to stop me. I tried calling her that afternoon with no answer. When I tried again the next morning when she told me the car was already sold. When I asked her how come, she said about an hour after I left on Monday. When I reminded her that they promised to hold till Tuesday morning she just said she was sorry.

Car price was really $20,253 and then the sales tax. The $2253 could not be separated from the car price I was told later on as it comes with the car and NO WHERE on the sticker was the add on charges. Additionally, I got a quote from Jeff Rushing and the sales manager that day would not honor it. I believe this is deceptive practices and I did not look at the paperwork while I was chatting with the finance manager. I was caught up in the new car frenzy. Preston was my salesman and he was great but I am so mad and trying to find out how I can do something about this because it is just wrong to deceive. So I paid that ridiculous price with all the other fees, additional coverage and my $18,000 car will end up costing me $29,319 AND it didn't even come with floor mats. I have made one payment and I get angry every time I get in the car. It represents my stupidity for being in a hurry and trusting and it makes me sick I patronized this behavior that looks like a pattern.

184,"May 04, 2015","My recent experience at Sport City Toyota was extremely disappointing and overall pretty horrible. We had to deal with 2 different sales people who promised us different things that later were not followed through on. Then they  had the nerve to charge us for something that they promised to give us as a perk. I had to argue with them that Julio and Taurus separately said it would be free and then have them take it off the bill when they swore I was mistaken so we never got the perk we were offered. This happened with 3 different perks they offered. None of the sales guys communicated with each other and the level of customer service was a zero. They just care about getting their money and not providing you with a good vehicle or an enjoyable experience. 

The car gave us brake trouble the DAY after we bought it, so we brought it to 2 separate mechanics. Sport city said that they were lying to us, the car was fine and that there wasn't a problem, and that they wouldn't fix it. We had to threaten to return the car for them to simply tune up the brakes. 

Lastly- aside from the fact that I'm in finance,  monthly payments are a pretty basic thing to figure out with a simple rate calculator on your phone. When my husband went in to buy our car they kept him there for an hour ""figuring out""  4 different monthly payments using the same purchase amount and interest rate! Aka trying to get every cent out of us they can. The whole atmosphere wreaks of the stereotypical sleazy car salesman vibe.

My story- we agreed on the OUT-THE -DOOR price over phone before I drove 2 hrs to this dealership. Upon arrival, the price suddenly changed and had gone up 500. Red flag #1, No biggie, I brush it off. Before seeing the finance guy, I sign some paper work stating the agreed OUT-THE-DOOR price (with the salesman) for which I never got a copy of. Upon seeing the finance guy, I told him I don't want any extra stuff if it's not gonna be free. Dude tells me there's no extra cost and comes up with a price. I'm thinking that's the total price I pay over the terms of the finance period (including interest). Walked out the door only to find out that's not what they meant.

I telephoned the dealership on August 28 and spoke with Jarod Krueger. I explained to him that, due to an illness in the family, I could devote no more than 2 hours to the purchase of a new 2013 Highlander Limited. I asked him if he could make this happen for me. He assured me that he could, whereupon I scheduled an appointment with him for the following afternoon. Jarod paired with Steven, and they worked together as a team to help me. Jarod had the Highlander waiting for me at the curb when I arrived so that a test drive would take only a matter of minutes. Jarod and Steve proceeded to crunch the numbers for me, and, within 30 minutes after my arrival, we had a deal. UNBELIEVABLE!!! If the public knew how Jarod and Steven successfully compressed the ordeal of a buying a new car into a single half-hour, EVERYONE would head straight to Sport City for their next auto purchase. After the signing of all paperwork and the detailing/washing of my new car, I drove off the lot in exactly 1 hour 40 minutes - better, even, than I had hoped for. I must add that Jarod brings a calm and respectful quality to the sales process - he knows his product inside and out, but he doesn't push in any way - that will put him in great demand with all your customers, and particularly with your female customers. Jarod and Steven both are courteous, thoroughly professional, and extremely knowledgeable. I recommend an IMMEDIATE RAISE for both of them! ",5.0

192,"July 12, 2013","I have to say that this was the BEST car buying experience so far! This is my third time buying a car and I have to say hands down that this was a very pleasant experience. From the beginning my salesman was very friendly not pushy at all like the typical saleman you see, he was very helpful and very honest! Usually its the salesmen who do not want to work with you but this man was superb! It was exactly what customer service SHOULD be. He paid attention to my needs my wants and I was being extremly picky and indecisive but she showed no sign of being annoyed instead it felt like he put himself in my shoes! & I spend the least time in the delaership than I ever had at any dearlship. My first experience was at Sothwest Kia which took me a total of 8 hours and when i went back to trade in the car the salesman who helped me was arrogant and very negative. My next car buying experience was at Friendly Chevrolet, the salesman was actually a good friend of mine i thought he was getting me a good deal and I ended getting jipped and on top of that they had my car in service for a whole week never did what they were supposed to and they scratched up the trunk and didnt take responsibility for it! DONT EVER GO THERE, i spent a total of 6 hours there. Last i purchased this vehicle at sports city toyota and the experience was just wonderful I was there in and out within 3 hours! The process was super easy and it wasnt rushed I came out with a brand new car with the down payment I wanted and with the payments I wanted! I highly recommend this dealership to everyone! ",5.0
193,"July 02, 2012","I went here looking for a fairly ""new"" used car, however, this dealership did not get my business and more than likely won't in the future. My husband purchased a car from them a few years ago and had a pleasant experience (although I'm convinced they ripped him off on the price of the car), but mine was not the same. The salesman that I dealt with immediately came an introduced himself to me (good, because I want to immediately be asked if I need help), but once we got to looking at cars he was a little too eager and very pushy. I have been doing my research for the past few months on the cars that I am interested in, and I do not make a rush decision when purchasing a car. There is too much at stake with this type of investment. He seemed to be more interested in making a quick sale then making the experience about me and what I wanted. They also think too highly of their used cars. The same cars with similar specs at other dealerships were costing a few thousand dollars less. My experience was not completely terrible, but I would not recommend purchasing from this place until they learn to put the customer first. I work in sales myself, and 9/10 times what makes a sale is that customer's experience and not the price. ",3.0
194,"April 05, 2011","Bought an '06 Corolla in January '11. Less than a week later, $400 repair crops up. Salesman lied and told me inspection showed car was in great shape. Service Mgr. said need for repair was obvious and immediately noticeable when you opened the hood. Called Used Car Sales Mgr., asked if they would work with me on the problem since it was less than a week after purchase and salesman lied about inspection. He said sure, I should bring it in. I offered to meet them half way and pay 50% of repair.

They looked at it, repaired it then hit me with the full repair bill saying they had ""no obligation"" to make any concession. While it's true there was no obligation, what ever happened to doing what is right? Took the car to another Dallas area Toyota Dealership for another problem one month later. They found two more things that would have been obvious to any inspection by the dealer that were missed, and found that while making the 1st repair, Sport City left the Power Steering fluid reservoi out of its mountig bracket laying on its side on the engine. Could have caused BIG problems. Shoddy workmanship all around.

Called Toyota Corporate to complain, they said Dealership would call to resolve. When Sport City ""Customer Service Rep"" called to discuss, he interrupted me twice while trying to relate what happened, talked over me and shouted me down while trying to explain, kept repeating that they had ""no obligation"" to do anything and then HUNG UP ON ME! And this was supposedly the Customer Service Expert for the Dealership! I have put a call into the General Manger for the Dealership to complain, intend to call Toyota Corporate again and am trying to find out how to get in touch with John Eagle himslef to discuss how customers are being treated in his name.

BUYER BEWARE at this Dealership! Don't spend your $ here! They will screw you and don't care!",1.6
195,"February 06, 2010","I requested quote for a new Camry from one of the websites and was contacted by the internet sales manager at SCT. I asked him for a bottom line price for a 2010 Camry LE V4 Auto, no extras and got a quote for 19,995. I went in along with my friend a couple of days later and met with the internet sales manager. We first test drove a 2010 Camry LE, no hassles in that process. Sat down to discuss the price and it was a bit of a headache. The internet sales manager tried to start off with a price of 21,500. I had to remind him that he gave me a quote for 19,995 already and was expecting an even better price. I was ready to make a deal at around 19,250. He asked me to show him the email quoting the price, I handed him the printout. Said it was only for previous Toyota owners, that wasn't mentioned in the mail, there were no qualifiers. I would not budge from that 19,995. Then the usual sales tricks started. We waited for at least an hour as he went back inside to check with someone or the other every 5 minutes and took 15 minutes to come back each time. Finally, agreed to honor the $19,995 after an hour. I said I needed the price to be less than that. He would not budge any further, so I had to leave. It wasn't a very pleasant experience. The next day I got a call from the internet sales manager and he said he was ready to give me the 2010 Camry LE V4 Auto with tinted windows for $19,300. I also qualified for a $1000 student credit which brought the car price down to $18,300. On the phone I made sure there would be no changes if I got to the dealership that day. The guy was a completely different person that day, he was very professional, courteous and was extra nice. We went back in and got the deal done, there were no issues at all. Got a loan with 0%APR for 36 months. After the purchase, got several thank you notes and calls and during the current Toyota recall, the internet sales manager has been in touch. ",4.3
196,"October 09, 2009","All was good until the sales manager was brought into the picture. I was able to test drive the vehicle and was quite impressed. I would have made a purchase if they were willing to sell it at a reasonable price. My family and I sat down for negotiating the price and told the salesman we wanted to trade in our vehicle using the TX AirCheck voucher. The salesman said he had not seen this before and asked to take the information to his manager. This was a big mistake...we let him see our voucher letter and the voucher itself. Negotiations practically did not exist with this sales manager as he seemed to only want to sell the car for sticker price. My family and I said we were going to leave if that was the case. However, since he was holding on to our voucher, we couldn't really leave without it. After several attempts of asking for our papers back, he yelled at us and asked to be given some ""courtesy"" as he gave us. After his tirade, he threw our papers to the table as his way of telling us we could leave. Not only was he rude, but he was also disrespectful. He belittled my family and me in front of his staff and made a stereotypical racist remark. Needless to say, I will never step foot into this dealership again. 

Save yourself time and frustration and avoid this dealership!

198,"September 14, 2006","My trade-in was being driven by someone on the tollway and not paying the toll. I got a bill for the charges, told them I had sold the car to Sport-City. Called Sport-City, they said they would handle it. Received two more bills from NTTA, called Sport-City again, same thing. I bought my car from them in February and it is the middle of September!! This is such a hassle for me and for no good reason except Sport-City did not do what they were supposed to. I am not pleased with my visit to the City, Sport City that is, and I regret doing business with them and will not do so again",2.2
