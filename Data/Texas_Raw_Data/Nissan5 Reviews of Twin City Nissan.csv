1,"October 09, 2019","I started the car buying process online with this dealership.  Michelle Calloway and Natalie were the employees that helped me and my husband and I just have to say they made us feel taken care of.  Before contacting them, we had tried buying a car at another dealership and we were lied to.  That made us feel like keeping the old car would be a whole lot easier than going through that again.  But, we tried Twin City Nissan and have absolutely no regrets.  They were upfront and honest about the price of my car and they worked with my credit union to make sure all the formalities were taken care of.  Jason Duncan was our salesperson when we got to the dealership and he was just great!  I would recommend this dealership to anyone.  You won't regret it at all.",5.0

3,"April 05, 2015","This is my first vehicle to purchase from a dealership. I chose this place as it's near my house and I've heard several good things about it. I honestly have no regrets. Good customer service and a good selection of cars! When I buy another car, I'm going here.",5.0
4,"March 26, 2015","I took my Nissan 350Z in for service because it was leaking oil profusely. I took my car in on 2/23/15 and got it back on 3/3/15. Yes. 10 days. Now after driving my vehicle a few miles I noticed it was missing while idling. I take it back in and was told that it could not have happened while they  were repairing all the leaking gaskets; that perhaps a rat had eaten the knock sensor harness, which they could not repair. I was told that if it turned out to be the sensor, they could repair that at no cost, but it would take 5 business days to receive the parts from a Dallas warehouse. Unbelievable that a dealer would not have parts on stock but then again that is why I am writing about my disappointing experience with this dealership. I would recommend going elsewhere before using this service department. That being said, the service person was professional and courteous. I think I would prefer just having good service over kindness. ",1.8
