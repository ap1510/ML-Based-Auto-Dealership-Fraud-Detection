1,"June 19, 2020","My husband and I purchased a 2019 Ford F250 from Scott. I took the truck in for the first oil change and a few other things that I noticed were not right. A ticking in the motor, the steering would jerk the steering wheel out of my hand when I hit a bump and and there was grease in the front end that shouldn't be there. The first thing that I was told by Javier in service is the ticking is normal for a diesel, this is a gas truck not a diesel. I got the truck back the steering issue was fixed, I'm assuming that the grease issue was fixed BUT the ticking noise is still there. Service and Scott is still saying the ticking noise is normal. I will be taking this truck to someone that knows a gas engine ticking noise is not normal.",1.0

4,"June 15, 2020","Corey likes to talk the talk but not walk the walk.  He makes a lot of broken promises and is not truthful in what he says he is going to do and what you are going to get.  My tire was losing air so I brought it in.  Now mind you I got all the extra bells and whistles.  Gap insurance, etc.  he told me if anything ever happened to my wheels to bring it to Vince and he’ll fix it not problem.  Doesn’t matter what you do to it.  Well here I am with a nail in my tire that I am having to pay for.  Corey lies like a rug.  Stay clear of him!! ",2.0

6,"May 28, 2020","This is a top notch service department. Compared to my experience with southwest ford and David mcdavid ford, Wax ford sets the bar high. They immediately assisted me with my vehicles issues as it popped the turbo hose while we were traveling with our rv. Nick got us in and back on the road even with the service center being very busy. Nick was professional, personable and made us feel like our needs were of the utmost importance. All ford service departments should take lessons from this sevice department on handling customers.",5.0

This is so nice to have in a dealership, because sometimes a person, (even me) gets anxious. I had so much to do on a Saturday and appreciate the service and treatment from Nick. He is awesome. ",5.0

15,"April 25, 2020","Courteous, friendly, fast, committed to good service. If I need an other vehicle I would give this dealership an opportunity to provide me with one. I believe service departments make a difference in my book, in how they treat a customer that didn’t buy a vehicle from them. ",5.0
16,"April 24, 2020","Aaron the Salesman was awesome, Jose the credit guy was very unprofessional. Wrong address on contract, added extended warranty when we both told him no. Very rude when we had to call back for the fourth time to my wife then me. We had to drive back twice to resign corrected contract it’s about 60 miles one way. ",3.0

19,"April 17, 2020","The service advisor, Austin T. Brown was very helpful and answered all my questions.   I thought the price of the oil change was extremely high, we have always used Waxahachie Ford for our oil change and never paid the price I did on this visit.    I will probably check for a cheaper price next time.",4.4

24,"April 06, 2020","Great experience with the sales department, however the maintenance department is lacking in professionalism. I brought my car for an oil change and they spilled oil on top of the motor on my brand new car, and when I pointed it out they wanted to clean it off with brake parts cleaner. I stopped them there and said I would handle it. When the rotated my tires they damaged one of my wheels with the lug socket, they had my wheel refinished but it will never be the same. I had an alignment done because the steering wheel was slightly misaligned towards the left. After the alignment it was slightly misaligned to the right, but I didnt have time to bring it right back. After a couple weeks i brought it in and said i need my alignment done right before my warranty expires, at which point they tried to tell me that i was out of warranty but they would fix it since they didnt do it right initially if I have 5 hours to wait. After I told them I know it still has warranty and I want a loaner car so I can go to work, the guy said it will be a while before I can get your loaner car because I have to check your car and make sure you didnt hit something. That was a couple hours ago and I'm still sitting in the waiting area.. poor poor unprofessional service here, and lying to me about my warranty should be criminal. I wont bring my car back to this dealership for any kind of service. ",1.0
25,"April 05, 2020","No doubt when covering warranty it is so specific. After reviewing my truck they were able to get a majority of it covered. After all that, the mechanic took the extra time to look aver a electrical problem I had, included it with the service charge..... big thanks for that ",4.0
26,"April 01, 2020","Visited Waxahachie Ford for service our Ford Fusion. From the first phone call to settling up and picking up our car, I was highly impressed. There was no waiting, the service advisor answered my questions and there were no surprises. 
I’ve got nothing negative to say and I’ll be returning if the need arises without hesitation. ",5.0
27,"March 31, 2020","I called the day I needed an oil change and got an appt that same day just a few hours later.
Ray Christian helped me out that day and he was AMAZING and very professional. I also got my tires rotated, vacuumed carpet, and a car wash for FREE all for being a first responder through this scary pandemic time. Thank y'all so much!",5.0

30,"March 22, 2020",I did not have an appointment and needed a motor for my windshield fluid reservoir. I had already been to another Ford Service Dept and they told me it would take two days to even look at my car. My vehicle was fixed in three hours and I was on my way. The Service Writer was extremely competent and friendly. I highly recommend this Ford Service Dept and I will definitely return in the future. ,5.0

33,"March 12, 2020","25 words isn't enough to describe it. Told them our budget and what we were looking for, drove away with much more! Highly recommend! ",5.0
34,"March 11, 2020",We have used this dealership several times over the last several years. It's convenient and a large facility. Usually satisfied with the type of service. I'd give a 5 if the work had been done a bit more timely. Took over a week.,4.0
35,"March 10, 2020","I have had maintenance at the dealer.  It has not been bad.  However, I knew I needed to get the brakes done.  Antonio offered $179 for each axle.  Service took a while and turned out fine.  However, it irritates me that I received a coupon for $99 bucks per axle.  After I inquired, the salesperson (not Antonio) said that the coupon would not have saved me money because the resurface on each rotor is $50 bucks.  In the end, how the heck am I supposed to know if I got a fair deal?  That’s not the impression you want to leave a customer.  Then, another two weeks later, I get an email that says I declined a service and should reconsider.  Really?  It makes me wonder if they really understand all the ads and communications I am receiving.  Again, just my thoughts.  Probably should have just done my own brakes for half the price. ",4.0
36,"March 06, 2020","So far, I have had great service!  The only constructive feedback that I would give would be to have a separate line for those customers who made appointments OR just make it first come, first serve.  It was a little disappointing to pull up and find a long line the morning that I had scheduled my service.  By the time I was able to get in the bay, my appointment time was up and I felt like I should have been made aware so that I could have come earlier.  ",5.0
37,"March 02, 2020","This is the second time I brought my 250 in for service .  The first time they said they rotated my tires 
.  They didn’t but Parker work said they did.
I brought it in this time requested rotation of tires along w oil change.  The paper work said they rotated them  but they didn’t.  
I will NEVER GO BACK HERE AGAIN!!   I live with in  a mile of there also!!  I will go to Michail in De Soto .
 I guess when you prepay for the service package they don’t care about customer service.........
I called 3 times and left messages for maneuvers to call me back .... still waiting...",1.4

39,"February 27, 2020","Repeat customer here, always go to Antonio in service at Waxahachie Ford, he is the best by far!  Excellent customer service, always keeps you posted about your vehicle without you having to ask and no hidden costs!  He goes above and beyond to make sure you are taken care of and your vehicle is properly diagnosed and repaired at the proper rate. We have a F350 Dually so most dealers take forever to diagnose & service/repair, Antonio gives good time-frame in advance to us and is usually 1-2 days at most for small services!  Good knowledgeable techs that fix it right and always return it clean.  Antonio keeps us coming back, keep up the great work!",5.0

Charlie, my latest service advisor, greeted me, listened to what I needed to say, and provided  (what turned out to be) a realistic waiting time to get my truck back. The only downside  (very minor in nature ) was that my truck didn't get washed as I had requested. However, the reason for my visit was service; and that was done well; exceeding expectations! ",5.0
60,"January 22, 2020",The people and the Dealership are great. Everyone I talked to was very pleasant. I chose Waxahachie Ford because it is local and I prefer to support my local businesses whenever possible. Plus many of my coworkers gave them fantastic referrals. I got a key reprogrammed for my car. This is my first experience with any Ford dealer. I am very pleased with them and I will definitely be taking my Lincoln to them for all my service needs,5.0

63,"January 17, 2020","Purchased at Waxahachie Dodge and their sales and service are the worst.  I will never go back to Waxahachie Dodge again. I asked the service manager (Pete Donaldson) a question, and he told me he’d never worked on cars and didn’t know. Then told me he’s the service manager because he is good friends with the owner.  Do not take your vehicle to Waxahachie Dodge or buy from them, go elsewhere and get your vehicle fixed correctly.   Read the review’s, the place has horrible reviews.  You take your vehicle in and it comes out not fixed and with additional problems they won’t take blame for.  My moms Durango was in there for a Bose. Went in, they replaced transmission under warranty, it can’t out making same noise and then more noises from the front.  I was a previous technician, the noise was coming from the engine area, crankshaft pulley, and  tensioner were loose. I asked my mom if they did anything else, the line of BS they fed her was that her bolts to her water pump were loose so they tightened them.  She took it back, they replaced the tensioner and idler pulley.  Noise was still there.  She takes it back, they can’t figure out what’s wrong, had the car another 41 days.  I finally went with her and got the keys, took elsewhere, care was in and out in 2 days. Alternator was going out.  There is still a noise in the transmission because they either over filled it, under filled it, or didn’t fill it at all.  I bought my truck there and still have a bad taste in my mouth.  They lied about trade in value, lied about it having rear USB ports, lied about another truck they had.  Would never show me, they said this brand new truck was in service torn apart to take parts off for a customers vehicle.  I ask service and they knew nothing of it.  I also said no additional warranty, they slid it in anyways.  Had to take it back to have papers redone.  Also put $7500 down, and am real curious where that money went.  They are crooks.  Worse then Clay Cooley.  DO NOT GO HERE.  My review will be left on multiple sites, turned into the BBB.  I have Chrysler involved in this matter and will be addressing it beyond Chrysler also.  They should do honest business and this wouldn’t be happening to them.  ",1.0

Im sorry, but when my wife doesn't have her truck thats not good enough, furthermore, the receptionist said that stanley was the only guy that could give me a status update, knowone else could and to me thats ridiculous, especially when he wont answer the xxxx phone, so while my overall experience was a success, the service was awful, i would never send anyone there to go through that, and as if stanley wasn't bad enough, he tried to coach me to give him an A rating!

89,"December 11, 2019",Never going back..got extended warranty letter in May..took vehicle in but no repair done because they could not find issue as wrench code was cleared so was advised to return when wrench showed back on instrument cluster.  Vehicle was hardly driven as my husband got laid off and then in September he had foot surgery resulting in no driving for 2 months due to complications....Decided to drive again and wrench returned that same day Monday Dec 2 which was 3 days past the deadline on the extended warranty letter expiration.  Dealership would not help even though we were there previously.....FORD customer service would not help even after a case was created for assistance...we will never return - so upset....and the icing on the cake was I had to pay 139.00 for them to look at it.,1.0

So they call me a few hours later and tell me it will be almost $400 to replace one spark plug and the spark plug wire.  I tell them no thanks.  How much are just the parts. He says $50.  I say I will do the work myself and just buy the parts.  He says how about Iee do it for $199.  What?  It was $400 but now its $199 to replace a $8 part on my 2018 truck? No thanks.  I just want to take care of it myself.  He says..well there is a $135 diagnosis fee. (This hadn't been discussed prior...probably because I have a 75,000 extended warranty. He says you are basically just paying for the parts bevause we have to charge the diagnostic fee we have never discussed.  He also says they have already done the repair.

I was told “No $1000” and given a quick explanation that it only applied to cars in their inventory. I called BS because that is not specified on all the flyers all over the the dealership. I was then was that was common sense. I then told that the quote and the internet price from the other dealership would not be upheld because it was to good.and that I should go buy it from them for that price. I complained that they could have told me that an hour earlier after I gave them the quote because it was now that i could not make it to the other dealership. Manager then said if i hurried I could! I did make it and got the price cut another $350 at the other dealership. — Btw - it is Moritz in FW.   Note salesman was ok and apologetic but the dealership and management full of it!

121,"August 02, 2019","My recent experience with a service visit to Waxahachie Ford was somewhat of a mixed bag. On the positive side, Jacob Street, the service manager that I spoke with, was extremely helpful, considerate, understanding, and sympathetic to my situation with regard to needed repairs to my 2016 Ford F350 dually. I found him to be compassionate as well as extremely knowledgeable and willing to go the extra mile to help. They took care of making the repairs to my truck and even washed it for me before I picked it up. This is typical of my positive experience with this dealership over the last 3 and 1/2 years of ownership.

 On the not so positive side, in an effort to save a little bit of money on my repair because of a change in my family situation, I bought batteries from Costco for my truck since the two original one's, that came with the truck, had reached the end of their serviceable life. The dealership charged me a labor charge to put those batteries in my truck. It required the same amount of effort as it would have required had I purchased batteries through the dealership but I saved a few much needed dollars by buying batteries myself and delivering them to the dealership. If I had been told up front that I would have been charged a labor charge to install the batteries that I purchased, I would have put them in the truck myself when I delivered them to the dealership since my truck was parked outside in an open area on the parking lot when I got to the dealership to deliver the batteries.",4.4

This is the second time that my truck has experienced a major mechanical issue after having it serviced at Waxahachie Ford. The first time was in July 2017. I had my rear brakes serviced at Waxahachie Ford and the very next day my brake system master cylinder mysteriously failed. Thankfully, it did not cause me to have an accident. I had to pay over $800 to have the master cylinder replaced at Waxahachie Ford.

This latest service visit was for an oil change. I drove my truck home, but later that same day I started it and the Electronic Throttle Control failure light came on. I do not believe in coincidences, especially when they happen to my truck that has been operating trouble free before I took it in to Waxahachie Ford for service.

I received an email inquiring about my service visit the next day, Thursday, and I replied to it the same day. I did not get a response on Friday or Saturday so I had my truck towed to a different repair shop, since the owners manual recommended not to drive it.

I will not go back to Waxahachie Ford for service.

Beware this dealership.  I came in with cash in hand to purchase a new vehicle they had advertised on their website.  I called first to ensure they still had the vehicle in stock because I had to make a two hour drive to see it.  I also brought anhi potential trade in that I had just received a $9200 Kelly Blue Book offer on (was a real offer that I decided to take).  First issue was that the vehicle had 5000 miles on it which was not disclosed on the website, nor disclosed by the dealer when I was on the phone with them.  The sales person told me once I arrived at the dealership and said it was still ""technically"" a new car because it had never been titled.  Well ""technically"" it has 5K miles on it, so it is a used car.  Well, it only gets worse from there.  The first thing is that the dealership only offered me $6000 for my trade in (on paper) which was significantly lower than the KBB offer I had already received.  So much for matching like the internet sales person said on the phone.  Second, they spent 30 minutes ""doing the math"" in the head office with the general manager and came out with an offer, if you call it that.  So the offer was that with my trade in (remember $6000) and I pay the tag/title and tax, I could walk away with a new car for only $1200 less than the internet advertised price.  So not only were they not taking any $ off the price of the vehicle for the 5000 miles they put on it because ""technically, its still new"", they were trying to hide that they were really only giving me $1200 for my trade in that I already had an offer on of $9200 (that remember, their internet sales force said they should match).  I took the trade in off the table and looked up the top dollar (dealer expected price) value for the vehicle I was interested in with 5K miles on it and offered that price to the dealer (This is available from many banks, USAA is the one I used), even showed them the estimate.  They didn't even want to discuss, guess they plan on finding some poor soul to pay full price for a used car and take $14,000 of depreciation instantly that is really the dealers responsibility.  Let's just say, that if you are looking at the demo 2018 Red Durango SRT off their lot with 5K miles on it, and they are asking a dime over $55,000, you are covering their depreciation costs for driving it, and losing big time.

( Wednesday Ladies Day ) I have always received good service and the folks are real nice here at Waxahachie Ford.  The service techs always showed me where the lounge area was, but I told Javier I was familiar where it was. As I was waiting in the lounge area, I received an email from Vehicle Service Video from Waxahachie Ford. At that time my battery on my phone was really low, so I did not look at the video. I was really disappointed when a young man came to the lounge asking me if I had a white Expedition instead of using my name. Then when I checked out Javier asked me if I had looked at the video and which I said no. So he showed me the video and said I had a oil leak and the tires were in need of replacing soon. I was aware of the tires, my next project.  Javier did not even discuss having the oil leak looked at or repaired. In my past visits , the service tech that was helping me at that time always came to the lounge and talked to me about any findings with my Expedition and discussed repairs and cost.. I took my Expedition to a mechanic and he saw no oil leak. After reviewing the video, the tech that filmed the service inspection video did not mention that there was an oil leak just tires getting old. and  there was no information in my paper work. VERY Disappointed that this visit was not like my previous visits.",4.6
138,"May 27, 2019","Without any warning the engine would not turn over when I tried starting.  Then several minutes later, when tried again, the engine would start.  This same scenario happened approx. a month earlier.  I have a battery load tester and it showed that the battery was still good.  Living in the country, once when I opened the hood there was a rat's nest with the rat making a hasty departure through the wheel well.  The rat chewed through a cylinder's solenoid wire causing the engine to run on one less cylinder. 
I thought maybe there were additional issues that were just starting to surface.

To be on the safe side, because in two weeks several of us were going to Crystal Beach with our UTVs in tow, I decided to take it to Waxahachie Ford.  I was prepared for worst case scenario.  Not knowing what to expect, I had visions of hundred dollar bills flying out of my wallet.  I went to the Service Dept., told my sad tale of woe to Antonio Galindo.  He asked if he could run a test while I waited in the Service Bay, to which I readily agreed.  Antonio diagnosed the problem, told me what it was, made the necessary parts replacement and I was out of there.  From start to finish I was gone in less than 30 minutes.  And I still had money in my wallet.

It would have been easy for Antonio to check the truck in, run all kinds of diagnostics, call to let me know the bad news, that I needed this and that, etc. that would dramatically increase the repair bill.  BUT HE DIDN'T.  That's how you build loyalty.  Needless to say word of mouth advertising, citing real life personal experiences goes a long way.

177,"February 04, 2019","After taking my 03  F-250 Super Duty to Waxahachie Ford’s Service Department, I have officially owned the one and only Ford that I will EVER own! 
They charged me $5231.00 to get my truck running after it died in the way to a job site one morning. The cost didn’t bother me nearly as bad as finding the truck now was dripping fluid from the rear of the engine block to the rear bumper!
I took it to another shop, only to find they had bent the glow plug harness on the right side of the motor! Which had it puking oil and fuel all the while still running normally. Other than taking a couple of seconds longer to crank over and the massive dripping and oil consumption, it ran. Knowing it was now leaking worse than it ever had, I kept an eye on the oil levels and added accordingly. A couple of days after picking it up it died again. I took it to another local shop figuring it came out running but leaked far worse than when it went in to Waxahachie Ford. After having it towed to the newest shop I left a message with the service advisor (whatever) which he returned TWO days later and after I left a review, he left me a single message telling me if there was indeed a problem with the truck, I “should give them the opportunity to make it right before going online to complain”. You this is how I see it! I GAVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE IT RIGHT WHEN I TOOK IT TO YOUR SHOP ON THE FIRST OCCASSION! You failed to make it right the first try, WHY should I reward your failure by allowing you to over charge me a second time???

JT was my salesman and he created a great experience, along with everyone else who got involved.  He was very straightforward, patient with me being extremely meticulous, and never tried to push.

225,"July 20, 2018","I went in to see how much they would give me for my 2017 Subaru Forester with 11,000 miles.  They had a 2018 Jeep Wrangler JK I was interested in.  I asked the salesman to give me his best offer for my car.  He got the keys to the Jeep so I could test drive it.  I told him I didn't need to test drive it because I had already test driven one but he said his manager required all salesman to make the customers test drive the vehicles.  I took it for a test drive.  No big deal.

The salesman then got the keys to my Subaru Forester and took it around back to get it appraised.  When he returned with my car, he walked in and sat down at his desk in front of me.  I asked for my car keys back.  He said it was unlocked, so I assumed the keys were in it.

Side note:  I bought my 2017 Subaru Forester in September of 2016.  I've had it for 1 year and 10 months and it only had 11,000 miles on it.  So I averaged 5,500 miles a year, which is great.  Also, it was loaded out with every option available.

The salesman then proceeded to tell me that they would give me $15,000 for my Subaru, which was a total joke.  He said I wouldn't get a better offer for it because ""There's not that much of a demand for a Subaru Forester"".  In other words, he was telling me that there isn't much of a demand for 
SUV's.  Yeah, right.

I then told him that I had already taken my vehicle to CarMax and they offered me $21,500 for it which was a guaranteed price for 7 days for the date of CarMax's appraisal.  

The salesman looked at me as if I was lying to him.  He asked me if I had the appraisal from CarMax on me.  I said ""Yes, it's out in the glove compartment of my Subaru.  I went out there to retrieve it and noticed my car keys weren't in the car.

When I came back into the sales office, I told the salesman that my keys weren't in the car.  He told me that his manager had them.

At this point, I was beginning to feel like I was being held hostage at the dealership.

I gave the salesman the CarMax appraisal.  He looked at it and said, ""Let me go speak to my manager"".

He left me in his office and I never saw the salesman again.  He never returned.  Instead, here comes his ""Manager"".

The manager asked me what they could do to get me into a new jeep.  I said, ""Match or beat Carmax's appraisal.""  If they could match or beat it, it would save me a trip from having to go to CarMax in Arlington, TX.  

The manager told me the highest he could go was $19,000 for my Subaru Forester.

At this point, I decided to look elsewhere.  If they had offered me $19,000 for my car at the start, instead of the 15,000 I was initially offered, I might have done business with them.  I live in Waxahachie and it would have been convenient to do the transaction without having to go to Arlington.

I guess Waxahachie Dodge Chrysler Jeep wasn't really interested in selling a new Jeep that day, or at least the Manager wasn't.  He thought he had found a sucker and was going to make a big profit.

A very unprofessional way to run a business.

I left and went to Don Davis Dodge Chrysler Jeep in Arlington, TX.  They matched CarMax's appraisal for my car, and was very professional in every aspect of the sale.

I'm now the proud owner of a 2018 Jeep Wrangler Sahara purchased from Don Davis Dodge Chrysler Jeep.

Don't ever go to Waxahachie Dodge Chrysler Jeep.  They're very unprofessional and need some lessons on how to present themselves to a potential customer.

I was informed my car was ready and drove back to the dealership, where I was disappointed once again. The stain was still visible on my seat and they also informed me my A/C was broken. I do not live close to the dealership, the roundtrip for each trip is about 130 miles. I leave once again in a loaner for the 3rd time and go home. I am called a couple days later and told my car is ready again, so I go to pick it up. This time the stain is gone and my A/C fixed however their ""full detail"" looked like crap. I had water spots all over my car that were very difficult to get off. I did my customer satisfaction survey and got a response from the dealership. They offered me a gift card for the gas it cost me to drive up there so many times. I have not received this gift card in the mail like promised and cannot get anyone to return my phone calls. I also paid for Nitrogen filled tires, and my tires are not filled with Nitrogen. This dealership is a huge disappointment for me, and I am not happy with the quality of the work done on my car. The only thing this dealership has going for them is that their service advisors are very polite. ",2.0

254,"July 18, 2016","First off, I purchased a 2016 Mustang GT, FROM ANOTHER DEALERSHIP because the sales department at  Waxahachie Ford took nearly 2 weeks to return my calls. 

Shortly after my purchase, the vehicle needed service and Waxahachie Ford is only a mile from my home, so I took a chance, and used this location strictly due to convenience. It took the shop a couple of business days for the diagnostics and to order the part (which was said to take 3-5 days to receive). Considering this is a brand new vehicle, I questioned where the vehicle would be stored and I was assured it was immobile, apart, and IN the shop.  The following weekend, I drove through the parking lot of the shop and noticed my vehicle parked in high grass, dirt, and among “junked” vehicle parts, across a rode from the main dealership.  The vehicle was unnecessarily covered in dirt, dust/rock and grime (you couldn't even tell what color it was without getting right up on it).  For the vehicle get to it’s location, it had to have been driven off the pavement, through un-level gravel, and backed into the field. Mustang’s aren’t exactly meant to off-road in any capacity. As disturbing, was the fact that there were clearly empty bays in the shop, open parking around the shop, and an abundance of wrecked vehicles on the paved lot. My vehicle was left completely unsecure, in an unlit, area, and open to the elements. Had the vehicle not been mid-repair, and the dash obviously still apart, I would have taken it immediately. The following business day, I visited the shop and spoke to the man who had previously assured me the vehicle was kept indoors, and he appeared to be surprised it was actually out in the corn field behind the shop. I made sure the car was moved immediately. I noticed that morning, that all of the open parking places on the lot around the shop, were filling as the employees arrived.  For some reason, it was acceptable for this dealership to park a customer’s brand new vehicle, in an unsafe, unsecure, off-road area – to make room for their employees to park on the lot? I was told this was the manager's preference. 

I understand if the vehicle needed to be moved from the bay to work on other vehicles, but let’s not off-road in a vehicle that isn’t yours and especially when you have specifically told the owner otherwise.  

In addition to these issues, after waiting for the part that “couldn’t be overnighted”, I found out that they had actually ordered the wrong part for the vehicle and would indeed, have to wait again.  Miraculously, it was overnighted this time. 

This service center treats your vehicle far worse than they want to treat their own – and the message should be quite the opposite. 

I will never return and I will be certain to leave this review wherever possible.  The center’s response to my complaints was not any effort to actually solve the issue, but more so a surface deep effort to get my vehicle repaired, returned, and get me out of there before other customers hear what may be happening to their vehicles when they aren’t standing over them.
