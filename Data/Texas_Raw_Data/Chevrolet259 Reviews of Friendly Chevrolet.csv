1,"May 27, 2020","I had great customer service by Jazmin Galicia. I originally contacted her by phone , told her what I was looking for and she surpassed my expectations from day one when I showed up. On day 2 I had a new truck! I expected a long drawn out hassle like most car buying experiences can be but she made the whole truck buying experience easy and enjoyable. I would recommend anyone to buy at Friendly Chevrolet! Thank you Jaz! Great people skills!",5.0
2,"May 26, 2020","My husband and I had the easiest/best time finding our dream first vehicle all thanks to Friendly Chevrolet. The name Friendly was given to this dealership for a reason! On top of everyone we talked to being friendly, helpful, and personable, the prices of the vehicles were great as well! We would definitely recommend Friendly Chevrolet to anyone.",5.0
3,"May 26, 2020",My car was recently totaled and I was in a rush to find the right car. Jazmin and the rest of the team at Friendly truly lived up to their name. Jazmin showed me each car I asked about some actually several times over. She never made me feel rushed or pressured simply laid out all my options and let me make my decision. Jazmin was friendly and professional and made sure we were introduced to each department at the dealership. She followed us through each step of the process and made sure we were satisfied down to the very last detail. There were never any surprises because she made sure we had a clear understanding of each step and the final price with all the extras. Nothing was hidden or unclear which made the final offer process clear and easy. The service on top of the concierge plus package offered have made me a lifetime Friendly customer.,5.0

8,"May 18, 2020","Came in a couple weeks ago on the recommendation of a friend who purchased a vehicle here, looking to trade in my 2014 Silverado. I worked with Link Ferch, told him how much I needed on my trade, and what I was willing to do on a new 2500. Link did everything he could, and got me a deal that was basically exactly what I asked for. I was in and out pretty quick. I was able to contact Link after the sale, and he has been nothing but helpful in getting me little things like touchup paint in the event I get a rock chip or anything down the road. I couldn't recommend this dealership and working with Link enough. Great experience. ",5.0
9,"May 18, 2020",I just recently purchased a new Camaro last week and the two young men that helped me went above and beyond. Link and Isaisas were amazing they made sure I got exactly what I wanted. I worked with Isaisas the day of my appointment and Link at closing these two work magic. They kept each other informed of what was going on during my entire process. I never felt like a customer they treated me like they would family. I told Link what I wanted and he relayed that to Isaisas and between the two I got everything I wanted plus some. Isaisas told me a little history of their dealership and how their owner comes to work everyday and that sold me right then. I am beyond happy to be part of the Friendly family and I dont see myself shopping anywhere else....and again thank you guys.... Officer Blakemore ,5.0

14,"April 09, 2020","I purchased a 2017 Chevy SILVERADO LT in August 2017.  Fast forward to 4/2/2020. First time having a flat tire and needing to access the spare tire.  Unable to get the key mechanism out which I discovered online is a common issue with GM locks.  I had to drill the lock out and determined that it was corroded.   Called roadside assistance again because they couldn't remove the lock the other day.  They lowered the spare and it had been plugged and air was coming out of the side wall from a small nick.  I've never accessed it. No one else drives my truck. Therefore, it had to have been done at the dealership.  I called and spoke with Caleb (could be misspelled) and he basically told me that it had been too long since I purchased the vehicle to do anything.  He offered to check to see if they had a totalled vehicle with a spare that he could give to me. However, there wasn't any.  So, I will give Caleb credit that he did do that.   Unfortunately, I asked Caleb to have his boss Jordan call me. That never happen until I called and asked to speak to Suzanne and I got a call back within minutes. Jordan basically told me that he didn't see any notes from his technicians showing that a tire had been replaced or repaired. He stated that they would have put notes if a job was done. That's not true.  As we know we all have workers who don't enter or do exactly what they should do at all times. So needless to say Jordan, the Service Director, told me that he wouldn't be doing anything to replace my spare tire. He stated that he wouldn't be accepting blame for this. I asked him to have his boss, Derrick Mills to call me back, it probably not going to happen. I'm going to buy another spare. It's the principle that has me so upset about it. Apparently, the safety of my family while driving down the highway isn't a concern.  It's getting my blood pressure up and it's not worth it. I can afford the tire and several more. I want everyone who purchases a car from Friendly Chevrolet to make sure the spare is new and not damaged. Think twice about purchasing a vehicle from a dealership that doesn't value the safety if it customers and thinks it service department is perfect. I know from previous experience that they aren't perfect.  Also, make sure your tires are rotated with their so-called concierge service.  My tires were never rotated.  They say they did but I know they lied because they never asked for my aftermarket lock.  ",1.2
15,"February 14, 2020","Brought my car in today to Friendly Chevrolet to get an oil change and an alignment and was told this is your last free oil change, I was like I haven‚Äôt had my car 5 years and neither am I at 100k. The service person says to me it‚Äôs 5yrs a 100k or 10 read the fine print. I hate Friendly service department there‚Äôs a big disconnect with that department and sales. So somewhere someone is lying because this isn‚Äôt my first car with them but it is my last I was told free oil change for 5years or 100k whichever came first well I‚Äôm at neither. This place is nothing like it use to be so I will be taking my business else where and I will not and do not recommend Friendly Chevrolet to anyone.",1.0
16,"January 17, 2020","We purchased a 2019 Camaro online.  We did all the paperwork over the phone, went and picked it up and it was ready to go!  When we arrived, all we had to do was sign the title over and get everything set up and off we went!  Easiest vehicle purchase I ever made.  Thanks, David Walker and Friendly Chevrolet!",5.0
17,"October 31, 2019","I bought a 2019 silverado i was promised leather seats and a 9,000 dll discount 
They kept my truck for more than a month nobody bothered to call with updates the truck has problems with the radio and the screen so they were suppose to fix it as well and when I went to pick it up I find out that the seats were covered with the cheapest material they could find not leather at all , poor vinyl job ever and the factory defects were not even touched they had my vehicle for more than a month I was not even able to drive it and a woman from the loaner dept called me with an attitude saying that I needed to return the loaner ""now"" because the service person had told her that my truck was ready since the day before . I spoke with every "" manager"" available and no one could do anything about it I tried email,messages,calls left messages for Derick Mills and he has not even bothered in returning  the call ...I am stuck with a $44,000  vehicle that has factory defects and no one cares about it ....they just treat you good until you sign the sales contract 
after that they don't care I have previously bought from graff chevrolet ,park cities ford,classic gmc,david mc david ,and never had a problem

21,"August 29, 2019","Friendly's Service Department damaged my vehicle after performing ‚Äúunpublished recalls‚Äù, continues to evade accountability, refusing to respond to dozens of phone calls to multiple people of the course of months.  I should have researched reviews before trusting Friendly to work on my suv.  BBB rates Friendly Chevrolet as a ""D-""  

Took 2012 Equinox (37,260 miles) in for car wash & add air in tires.  Also to schedule a routine oil chg, tune-up & tires rotated/aligned.  Service Advisor approached me & advised me of ""unpublished recalls"" they want to perform.  I was surprised but agreed.

When I went to pick up my suv, I noticed on the invoice it listed ""customer states - check engine light is on, keeps having to add oil, power steering slips"" None of this is true, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WAS WRONG WITH MY EQUINOX, just took in for regular maintenance!  I question why they did this, I was told they needed to write it up this way for the work to be covered under the special warranty.  This is very deceptive & dishonest, shame on Friendly to deceive customers just to get work/paid!  Shame on GM Corporation to allow this to happen!

When I drove off, I IMMEDIATELY RETURNED TO FRIENDLY, my suv had MAJOR ISSUES:  

The body & frame felt like they were moving in separate directions & could jump into another lane & hit someone.  Pulled to the left and when turning left, felt like axel/chassis would crack or the tire would fall off.  

Also the feeling of floating/skating on ice.  Felt a similar feeling of driving a dune buggy in the desert, very bouncy & loose, it was a horrible terrify feeling!  

The engine has a whooshing noise, kind-of sounds like a super charged/high pitched turbo similar of that in a racing car!  At first, I thought it was a cool sound, like my Equinox could be in the next Fast & Furious movie.  However, I knew this was a problem since it didn't sound like this before. 

When idling, the engine seems to want to cut off, even worse if I have the AC and/or ECO button on, like it's choking. 

Sometimes when shifting gears, it is a hard & loud shift/jolt.  

I noticed all four tires were inflated to 42lbs (should be max 35lbs). 

Back right tire sounds like it is rubbing or grinding in the wheelbase 

My Equinox now sucks up gas quicker than getting a brain freeze from a Slurpee!  

I paid for professional detailing, which they forgot to finish twice & I had to return back.  Whomever did the detailing left burn marks/scratches on both my front light covers from rushing.  I'm assuming the damage was from the polishing/buffing machine rubbing on the plastic covers to hard or hot. I was told, I could buff it out, really?  

The air vents makes a horrible grinding/squeaking noise when switching buttons to feet/defrost etc, 

On a positive note... I can whip a U-turn with ease so much better than before.

The digital temperature showed 77, however was 96 outside and was sitting in the sun.  

So Friendly took on a test drive, returned to tell me they were going to tweak & make some adjustments.  I ended up taking my SUV back six times and after several calls, I was told nothing reads wrong, everything checks out.  The Service Advisor I dealt with knew I had PTSD, he said ""I just needed to get used to the new feeling/movements since I was more sensitive"".

Recently took to another Chevy dealership for a 2nd opinion, which they found several major issues & irresponsible mistakes Friendly did (I was informed they left plastic on the timing chain, when they requested the repair order, I was told it was unreadable).   The damages comes to approximately $5000+. 

I contacted Service Manager  Ronnie Smith at Friendly, he said this is the 1st he has heard of this issue & would research it and get back to me.  Well, I have answered every single phone call (lets see... I have won a cruise, microsoft has detected problems with my acct, my social security has been compromised & several calls from cable companies wanting me to switch), but NOTHING FROM FRIENDLY CHEVROLET its been over 2 weeks!!!    

I was told by a former Friendly employee, several employees have left due to the owner being greedy & the way things are ran/handled there.

All I want is for Friendly to take accountability and fix/repair the damages they caused.  I left a perfectly fine vehicle but left with major damages. I want to feel safe driving my vehicle again! ",1.0
22,"August 20, 2019","Worse Car dealership. I had an engine recall drop the car there to get fixed. They broke the car than fixing. Since they worked on my car I got check engine light for low engine oil to pressure. I went back to dealership and they said that its low on oil , just fill the oil and sent me back. Check engine came again and I went again and this time they took my car to inspect. After 4 days they said they cant find any possible oil leak, add a dye and sent me back again and ask me to come back in 500 miles and I went back in 500 miles. They said oil is OK and sent me back. guess what check engine came again and oil is 4 quarts low. And they took the car back and said they gonna open the engine and check again. Yeah you guessed right they didn't touched the engine until then.
And Until then I had the service adviser  called Ivy Yvonne and she is good. She keep you posted every day. But unfortunately she was transferred to a different department and I got a new service adviser called. One of the worse of many at friendly. She didn't reach me for 3 weeks to update about my car and I had to reach her. I called more than 10 times left her messages, paged her over few days to reach her and finally when I reach her she tool my number to reach me. Guess what? she never called me. I had to escalate the case to Chevy. I opened a case with Chevrolet and then the case  was assigned to a service manager called Caleb. Guess what? Its the same story. Its being 7 weeks since I dropped the car that also since they mess my engine when fixing my engine recall and I got no clue about whats going on with my car. I am going to file a case  with Better Business Bureau see if its gonna help me. If you could stay away from this dealer they are not sweet as much as they look. ",2.2
23,"August 01, 2019","It's been said before but Zero Stars if possible. It takes a lot to get me to take the time to write a review. In this case it bears significance because having to deal with car issues is a serious and often expensive proposition. 

Please, please please think king and hard about utilizing ""Not so friendly Chevrolet"" for any type of service now or in the future. I have been trying to help my 26 year old niece with some significant issues with a '13 Camaro. The model is notorious for bad electrical systems that can effect stalling in motion, non starting, AC, heat and clutch sensor. 

This dealership has had this car for 6 months, she attempted to pick up twice only to find that when she drove it off the lot, is stalled and would not start. Every time they attempt to fix one issue they cause another. During this time they have had three device managers take on the issue and they are all no longer working there. 

Zero communication, admittance that they have made mistakes. Apology after apology. My niece finally picked the car up and asked to meet with the GM to get a comprehensive detail of exactly what has happened, status of the warranty if part labor etc. he agreed to meet with her and upon the scheduled meeting time, he ran off like a coward and sent someone to meet with her that has no knowledge of any of the issues. He was kind enough to say... ""we did everything we were supposed to and went out of our way to get you a loaner when we didn't have to"" then he asked where the scratch on the door came from and why was the tank 1/2 full. She had no loaner for three months and a loaner for three. Basically the car has been sitting on the service lot for 6 months untouched with nobody following up. The did manage to get 2500 bucks out of her. 

I could keep going on but these guys are criminals and do not care about you or your vehicle. General Motors HQ doesn't seem to care either. It's amazing you feel like driving American would mean something for an American company. What a joke. It's too bad we don't have public stoning's anymore because I would wait all day for these clowns. 

Please stay away from these guys. You will have a better time giving your money to charity",1.0
24,"July 07, 2019","Worst place ever.  Took my truck to them dor rear brakes outside only wearing out three times within 20000 miles and ruined rotors and calipers every time , after keeping my truck two weeks and not being given loaner so i had to rent one and i live two hours awayand had to drive up there several times because i couldbt get a return call , ever.  When i was told its ready i was told they didbt even change the rotors and that nothing is wrong with my truck , which is 500 miles from being out of warranty.   They hold you hostage till you are just glad to get your car.   Had also ask them to do oil change and they just seemed to have forgotten  .   If there is legal options i will most certainly go down that path but going up against a large company probably will be a waste of time and money . They lost a customer and i was trading my 3500 high country in with them but not in a million years would i now..",1.0
25,"June 29, 2019","Everything that is bad about that car buying experience is fully embodied by this shifty dealership. My experience is that they do not honor their own advertised price. What you see on their web site is not close to their actual price. What you see listed on their cars' windows (""$10,000 off!"") is not close to their actual price. 

Indifferent salespeople. Loud atmosphere. Lack of honesty. I have never had a more disappointing buying experience. I ended up walking away from the table and bought my new care at 5 Star Ford. ",1.0
26,"June 04, 2019","This company is the worst.They have horrible customer service .They will sell you a lemon vehicle and not take responsibility for it. They only advise you to get a new one, not to mention they do fraudulent activities. They have you sign off on a monthly payment and when you leave to get your other party change the whole loan. Also the person who does the application to see if you qualify will open a fraud case against you and say your transfering information from the previous loan knowing this isn't true because the person is with you to sign there part of the deal.

28,"May 14, 2019","Service air bag light was on when I picked up my car for a different repair issue. It was not on when I dropped it off. The drivers seat bracket on my 2012 Chevrolet Malibu broke. Never had this happen with any other car I've owned. Friendly Chevrolet said the cost to repair would be $1150. I checked the internet and found complaints from many, many other Malibu owners who've experienced the same issue. I wrote to GM corporate and they opened a case and contacted Friendly Chevrolet to work out a discounted rate. When the service adviser John Ballard called to make the appointment it was clear in his voice that they were annoyed I went to GM corporate. I took the car in this week to have it repaired. I picked it up this morning and now the ""Service Air Bag"" warning light is on. I told the service adviser about it and he said that the light was on when I brought the car in. IT WAS NOT. The service adviser told the manager, Louis LaBarbera and he immediately told me that the light was on when I brought the car in for repair. I tried to explain to him that it was not on but instead of listening he called me a liar and began to raise his voice in a very aggressive manner. Just as I was leaving I told him that I would contact GM corporate again and he said ""you do that...have a good day, bye!"" His behavior made me very uncomfortable so got in my car to leave the dealership. Just was I was leaving the service bay another customer approached me and said that she witnessed the exchange between the service manager and me. She offered her contact information in the event that I needed a witness. My receipt indicates that I requested a multi point check to be completed on my car, which I did not. There is nothing noted on the checklist about my air bag service light being on. I find that interesting since the service manger, Louis and the service adviser, John insisted the light was on when I brought the car in for repair but NOBODY made note of it or advised me that it was on. It seems obvious to me that something happened to my car while it was there that caused the ""service air bag"" light to come on and they want me to pay to repair it. This is deceptive at best and an attempt at theft.",1.0
29,"April 30, 2019","Sebastian is the BEST salesman I have dealt with in my many years of car buying.  I buy new almost every year from many different manufactures and cities.  This gentleman took care of me from the moment I walked in the door.  He genuinely cared about my vehicle purchase, happiness, and quality of the vehicle; it WAS NOT  just another sale/VIN he sold.  Very attentive and followed up several times after my purchase.  He is a huge asset to FC and would love to rate him a 10!  TOP NOTCH!!!!

30,"February 17, 2019","Drove 3 hours to get a truck I searched for all over Texas, talked about it to the Salesman for a few days and we had everything finalized. I get there and I was pawned off instantly from the lady I was suppose to be meeting and knows everything that me and the guy have worked out. Get a guy that knows NOTHING and now we have to do it ALL OVER. Turns out the salesman I was talking to, was told he didn't even work there.  best part? THEY SOLD THE xxxx TRUCKS I DROVE 3 HOURS TO BUY. I've owned all Chevy products for 15 years, not anymore. Me and my brother went there to both get new Silverados, but we were looked at and treated like we couldn't even afford a bowtie emblem. Really? Because how I look and dress? No respect.

32,"January 14, 2019","I wasted my time at this dealership.  I would never come back.  The internet price is low, but you can't never get that price.  Their sale tactics are hideous.  I dealt with Lakeia / saleperson, her Internet Sale Director Tommy Galattine.  I can't say they are honest.  It was so distasteful that Tommy / the Sale Director had agreed to a price he would sale me the new 2018 Chevy Cruze, and as I was to finish paperwork for finance, he came out and said he could not sale me the car for the agreed price because he would lose money.  At that point, he asked for more money.  I walked away and refused to deal with people who could not keep their words.  It was their sale tactic to wear you out so you give in after already wasting so much time with them.  It was even worse that I wrote to the owner Mark Eddins and the General Sale Manager Derek Mills, but got no response from any of them.

You will be pleased with his Friendly laid back personality, and knowledge of vehicles.  He knew the price range I needed, and delivered. Jimmy Scales the finance manager made what normally would be a stressful time enjoyable. His ability to explain  the financial side made it a pleasant experience. I will be back to Friendly Chevrolet the next time I need a vehicle. Derek Mills has a wonderful team he over sees. From sales, to delivery they were extremely nice, and there to answer any questions I had. Thank you Friendly Chevrolet.

36,"November 12, 2018","When choosing a dealership to lease a vehicle. I am extremely picky. This is also a stressful task for me as I want to make sure I am choosing a car that I will be comfortable with for the time of the lease. Poor customer service automatically play a role in increasing these feelings, however at Friendly Chevrolet I did not have to worry about this. The customer service was great. Chris Matthews in particular did an awesome job guiding me through the process. He acted in a professional manner and was clear in providing me with options. He was not too pushy which is a plus for me. He took the time to listen to my concerns and needs regarding what I was looking for in my next lease. He even went as far as having me test drive a vehicle that matched my request. I would 100% recommend Friendly to anyone looking to lease/purchase a car. Be sure to ask for Chris Matthewsyou won't be disappointed. Overall, all staff members from the front desk to the salesman were great! Thanks Chris!",5.0

39,"November 01, 2018","I have once again visited Friendly Chevrolet for an oil change service.  I arrived without an appt. and requested an oil change.  The service tech received my vehicle and completed the service requested.  I knew going in that there were additional items which needed replacing, but was not prepared to spend the money at the time.  I was pleasantly surprised that the service which I had emphasized, was all that was performed.  No hard sale for additional services which I was not able to afford at the time.  The cost of an oil change on my vehicle is quite expensive but I continue to return to them because I have confidence in there ability to service my vehicle.  Yes it normally takes a couple of hours when I show up without appt. but overall I am very satisfied with the level of service I have received from Friendly.  I will continue to get my service performed there simply because they are the only place which has serviced my vehicle since it's purchase.",3.8

41,"July 05, 2018","I will not waste my time with the Service Dept T Friendly due to the Rude and unhelpful Loaner Car Dept. I had a loaner scheduled and they did not give me a loaner. They tried to use the excuse that my insurance would not cover the loaner. I set there and listened to them tell other customers that Friendly‚Äôs insurance has $1000 deductible and that applies even if your insurance deductible is lower. Then, they try to sell the customer $14/day coverage to waive the deductible. So if they‚Äôre using their insurance, then why do they deny me a loaner. They come up with excuses why not to give you a loaner. Loaner dept also sets there and bashes customers behind their back, as I set there and listened to them. Very unprofessional, both the girl and the guy! Definitely, will take my car elsewhere for service. The free 100k mile oil change and rotation is a good deal, but not worth the hassle of waiting a long time. On a positive note, John Ballard, service advisor, was very nice!",2.2
42,"May 19, 2018","I have really given Friendly Chevrolet's service department the last opportunity to service my vehicle  I purchased the vehicle and that part of the transaction was perfect.  I can't say the same about the service.  I went to get my car serviced today and I noticed for the second time that they stated my tires were rotated as they did on the last visit.  The issue is that  I had wheel locks placed on the vehicle and no one asked me for the key, but the invoice showed that the wheels were rotated.  On my visit today, they stated they rotated my tires again.  I questioned it because I purchased custom wheels and they annotated that the tires were rotated again.  When I asked the service person and the technician stated that the tires were rotated. I advised them that it was impossible to rotate the tires because no one asked for my key to unlock the wheels. They apologized and stated that would take the vehicle back to have the tires rotated. In the meanwhile, I spoke with Micah Springer who lacks minimal customer service skills. He proceeded to tell me that if I knew that this occurred in the past, why didn't I say anything when I brought the truck in.  Well sir I expect you to do the job that  you stated was done.  Also you may want to be sincere when giving an apology and look, the person in the face and I am not your brother so don't call the customer brother. How about this. If the technician sees that there are custom wheels on the vehicle, they should ask for the key.  How dare you try to put the responsibility of rotating my tires on me when it is your job to ensure that what is supposed to be done is done.  So this makes we questions if any of the work that is on the invoice was completed as I am not a mechanic and can't verify that it was completed. After all this and about 30 minutes  I look back to see that my truck is parked and waiting to be worked on.  appt was at 1145.  I arrived at 1119.  It was 1 pm and my tires still weren't rotated. At this point I asked for my keys and said forget about it.  This place literally sucks and needs a customer service overhaul.  Give me a call and I will give you a consult for a fee. 

P.S.  I spoke with Cesar prior to leaving.  He knows customer service and Micah could learn a thing or two from him. ",1.4

47,"January 03, 2018","I have been doing business with another Dealership since 2001.
That said, I have moved and that particular Dealership isn't convenient, so I decided to search my area for an alternative. There were two choices and Friendly had the better reviews and was only about 20 minutes from my house.
The PLUS is that they honored the $20 off oil change that my other Dealership sent me in the mail.

The NEGATIVES:
I don't want to throw anyone under the bus, so I will not mention names - but when the Svc.Mgr. mentions this in the weekly meeting to his/her Team Members, the Svc. Advisor should know that it is them I am speaking of....

When I pulled into the service drive, I was immediately served by a valet, who confirmed I had an appt. for an oil change. He got on his walkie talkie to call an advisor to the drive.... that particular advisor never came.  Finally another advisor came and the first words out of his mouth were ""so what can we break today?""
I am certain this Svc. Advisor was just 'trying to be funny' but a) I didn't think it was funny b) I didn't want to anyone to break anything c) the comment didn't seem to be a positive reflection of the Service Department or the Svc. Advisor's confidence in the Service Department's ability as a whole.

Next...
When we were entering my vehicle information in the system I told the Svc. Advisor that my car was going to show up as being owned by the Dealership where I have been going for all these years. (my car was a Dealer Trade). The Advisor then made several, what I would call slanderous comments about that Dealer/Dealership, to which I made a counter comment that was a positive reflection of that Dealer/Dealership At which point the Advisor said nothing more negative about them.

In the meantime, the Svc. Receptionist attempted to call the Advisor while I was in his 'office'.
Instead of nicely telling the girl that he was with a customer he said, ""You need to turn around and see I'm with a customer"" and the tone was was insulting to the girl and off-putting to me as a customer.  Dude, have a little respect for women in general and especially your customer.... and somewhere in conversation there was a comment made that I gently rebuffed and he said, ""tell my wife that!""  Again, not much respect coming out of that person's mouth for women. (NOTE to Dealership: Women drive 70-80% of all consumer purchasing, through a combination of their buying power and influence.  Influence means that even when a woman isn‚Äôt paying for something herself, she is often the influence or veto vote behind someone else‚Äôs purchase. - Forbes)

While my car was being serviced I went for coffee with a friend (oh, and the Svc Advisor also noted that the little restaurant in the Dealership was decent, but don't eat the eggs - they apparently don't know how to fix them)... while I was at coffee the Svc. Receptionist called to let me know my car was ready - THAT was awesome and very professional!

Upon arriving back at the dealership I went to pay for and collect my vehicle but my Advisor was no where to be seen.  At the other Dealership, my Advisor would have met me to make sure I knew they had completed the work and 'advised' me of anything I needed to do for follow-up - if the Advisor was on break/lunch, his counterpart would have performed this task- instead, the cashier told me these things.

Anyway, I'll probably return to Friendly in the future because of convenience, but I hope that the Employees who are representing this Dealership realize that every word and action reflects on 
Mr. Eddins himself and make a change for the better.

I tried harder than they did to buy a truck here but it got to the point that I just quit. they ran my credit and after that I had no contact from them for over 24 hours. In this time I called 5 times telling to figure out what's going on. I finally got a hold of an employee and they were like oh yea you've been approved for the loan and I then ask what are the numbers and they said they would call me later. I never heard from them again that night. I called back and told them to forget everything",1.6

50,"August 21, 2017","I took my fairly new under warranty 2015 Chevrolet to Friendly Chevrolet  and ended up not having such a Friendly experience with the service department.  After setting up an appointment to leave my vehicle for service a loaner car was going to be provided.  As I walked around the vehicle to see if it had any damage I casually mentioned to the clerk, that It looked good, but it may have a few Oklahoma bugs on it after I returned back over the weekend.  I was then informed by the clerk that my trip was going to be impossible with the loaner vehicle, because they are not allowed over the state line and will shut off and it would be reported stolen.  I was shocked that this wasnt even mentioned until I brought up my short trip.  I was told they would not allow this less than two hour trip, but i could drive it any location in the state of Texas.  I explained that I would have been very upset had I crossed states line not knowing this with my three kids with me.  Its funny when I wrote a 35k check to Chevrolet for my truck there were no stipulations on chasing my check. 
I filed a complaint with Chevrolet who advised me I would get a call back in 48 hours.   A WEEK later i got an email and it stated im sure you are prob back from your trip and Friendly Chevrolet would love to work on your Truck.    I responded with not on your life and I would no longer have my truck Serviced at Chevrolet and the next vehicle Ill buy will be From Toyota who officers much better customer service.   So if you get a loaner car, Dont bother taking it out of town while your vehicle is in the shop under warranty for several weeks.

62,"November 22, 2016","I bought my car at Friendly Chevrolet on September 6, 2016. As of today, November 22, 2016, 66 days since the purchase of my vehicle, Friendly has had it 35 days and counting, because as of now it is still in the shop. I've had to come to Friendly on multiple occasion for the same ongoing problems and it has been personally dropped off by me on 4 different occasions. A company that prides itself on concerige plus (free oil changes, multi point inspections and free loaner vehicles) seems to be a fraud. Every time I ask for a vehicle there is some reason of why they don't have one. Service dinged my rear bumper and the only thing I can say about my entire experience is that I got a fair price for the car. I will never recommend Friendly and truly hate that I even purchased a vehicle from a poorly ran business. Once I brought all the problems I had to their attention Alex basically stated there isn't nothing we can do and tried to insinuate that it was my fault and that there wasn't anything they could but that was only after they wanted to run my credit and sell me a car for 20000 dollars more than what I actually paid with a 3500 dollar down payment and stated that my car was less than 20000 dollars. My car is brand new with less than 3000 miles. Are you kidding me? Kind sounds like sexism if you ask me. Luckily I know the difference between an RS and SS. I will never refer anyone to Friendly and all 66 days have been horrible. How can one the largest volume stores not believe in customer service. I just don't understand. ",1.4

This people damaged my car and wanted me to wait 3wks to fixed my car. They want me to wait after they damaged my car.

69,"May 12, 2016","It all began with my car ending up at the dealership for almost a week. I was told that I would get my car back after the weekend (I dropped it off on a Friday). All I wanted done was the oil change along with all the other services provided with the concierge plus. I was told by other people that it should not take that long to do, if that were the case. Dan told me that the reason it took so long was because of the check engine light diagnostics. So I asked my brother, and he told me there was no code shown on the paper I was given. They lied to me. I kept having to call back rather than Dan calling me to update me on my car. I called him on Monday, and he said it would be done by Tuesday Morning. So I called him on Tuesday, and he said it would be done by Wednesday Morning. I left him voice messages and even called a few times before he finally picked up by Wednesday evening saying that my car is finally ready to be picked up. That is ridiculous that it took that long, but he told me it was ""simply because of the busy work load"" Umm, I had an appointment though? 
I also asked if it was okay to have my car run through the machine wash and he told me it should be fine. Well, when I picked up my car, I noticed a long scatch near the gas tank. He is not to be trusted.

They also didn't have the right code inputed on my customer copy paper. I would have been charged a little over 60 bucks, even though I have concierge plus (perks of buying a new car at that dealership). After I told them I have concierge plus, one of the ladies at the desk said that I still have to pay because I'm only over 5,000 miles. Of course I'm only over 5,000 miles.

70,"February 26, 2016","For many years I was loyal customer and was very happy with Friendly.  About 2 years ago, I needed to replace and engine and mentioned I might be interested in some performance enhancements.  I was then introduced to their ""performance department"" who installed a new corvette engine and supercharger for me. As part of the quote (and this was not cheap) a warranty for 5 years was clearly included.  Long story short, the vehicle never ran correctly and spent more time in service than in the shop. Then the engine failed and guess what? the warranty I was sold was apparently not valid as the company ""went out of business"".  Rather than do the right thing and stand by the product and service i paid handsomely for, Friendly is now insisting that I am the one that needs to buy a new engine. I have already had two attorneys review the situation and they are of the opinion that I am in the right and that this is friendly's problem.  It's mind boggling that this dealer would rather fight over a engine that costs 6k to replace and alienate a customer who has both spent lots of money on performance enhancements and who also bought a new vehicle from them this past December than step up.  By time this is finished, Friendly will most likely spend more in legal fees fighting this than the engine would of cost.  Go figure. ",1.0

The paperwork not so much. I had previously filled out the credit app online a couple of days ahead of time. So finally after an hour and half they called us back to sign the paperwork. 3 1/2 hours is too long to get paperwork ready.

95,"November 08, 2015","Bought a new 2015 Chevy Spark 2LT Labor Day. 

This is a high-volume dealership I had no experience with. Chevy was offering incentives + 0% financing for up to 60 months (for qualified buyers). 

I was greeted by a salesman (Jorge) & after a test drive we went into the showroom (chaotic) to negotiate. This went easily as I had done my homework...2 different ""sales managers"" did the actual negotiations (at different times) while Jorge observed. 

Trouble began talking ""trade in value"" for my vehicle. We agreed upon a value but Jorge was called away & returned with another ""sales manager"" who introduced himself & explained they'd made a ""mistake"" & the ""real"" offer was much lower. They said another vehicle was being valued @ the same time & they'd crisscrossed the values.  Eventually we came to an agreement. 

We agreed to a value on the Spark, a value on my trade & the financing (they had already checked my credit) including I qualified for 0% financing. Based on those figures, I was asked to sign & initial a hand-written quote indicating I would ""purchase that day...that vehicle"". I've never been asked to do that at any dealership before and it just felt shady. 

I sat & waited to be called to the Finance Dept.. The finance guy was professional & polite but clearly his job is to get you to purchase (knowingly or unknowingly?) extra packages such as an extended warranty, ""protectant/sealant"", door ding/window crack"" insurance policies, tire replacement, etc... 

I screwed up by not checking my finance rate BEFORE I signed the paperwork. I verbally agreed to 0% financing for 60 months. I was told by the salesperson AND the ""sales manager"" I ""qualified"" and signed the hand written agreement to it. That evening at home when I sat down and looked everything over I found my finance rate MUCH higher which meant I paid more for the vehicle (than what I agreed to).  I remain pissed off about this. I saw no point in going back to the dealer to debate as I'm certain their response would be ""you should have looked it over better before you signed."". This one deed ruined any chance of Friendly ever seeing me as a ""repeat"" customer and we're actually less than a year away from replacing our 2007 Accord. If the finance guy would have said ""I know we initially said you qualified, (and explained why) but you don't"" I would have accepted that and renegotiated or walked.  But, he didn't. 

Kudos to Marisa in the concierge dept.. She was helpful, patient & professional setting up my Chevy My-Link apps. 

I could write a book on what happened ""after-the sale"" but won't...much...The car has been in the shop approximately 25 (primarily waiting on parts) of the 60 days since I purchased it. 4 service visits and counting in less than 2 months. I never got it off the lot the first day. A power steering sensor went out as I was sitting with the concierge going over Chevy My-Link. 26 miles on the odo. A warped door panel has been replaced. A door lock mechanism has been replaced. AC vents replaced. A brand new car. 

I need to bring it back again for a rattling dash speaker grill but I've had a hit & miss experience with the service department that's left me weary of doing so. A good service advisor but setting up appointments has been a lesson in futility with a lack of follow up on their part (scheduling) or being told they ""have no record"" of my making an appointment. The on-line service appointment scheduler is useless. You may or may not get a response. Best to call. The service bay is as chaotic if not more as the showroom. 

I get periodic generic (system generated?) emails from random ""sales managers"" asking how my experience has been but when I respond with critical detail, I get no response back. 

Their employees seem preoccupied with ""survey"" scores.  The problem is the surveys relate to the folks I have no issues with! My frustration isn't with the salesperson or service advisor.  It's overall customer service, the Finance Dept., Sales Management and Service PROCESS(ES).  

I have more to say about my overall experience some good, some bad but....I won't. 

For what happened in the finance dept. alone I cannot recommend this dealership. 

The ""Concierge"" Service seems more a way of keeping you coming to this dealership for service past your basic Chevy warranty. I've actually started researching other area Chevy dealerships to take it to for warranty service just so I won't have to deal with the frustrations I've experienced @ Friendly. 

Jorge, Marvin and especially Marisa seem on-the-ball but my overall experience has been disappointing...the finance department's tactics (and I suspect management endorses this behavior) ruined their reputation with me. 

I saw a banner add on-line from Friendly that says ""Because You Deserve Better!"". I sure do. We all do.",2.8

He was friendly, I will give him that. The purchasing experience is much greater than friendliness and that is where the dealership fell short.
 
The car I purchased had cosmetic flaws in the exterior and interior, including ripped stitching on two seats, a loosely hanging front fascia/lip due to the 3M adhesive wearing out, wind noise and water entry from the sunroof and a broken clip for the front bumper fitment.
 
Not only would they not put any of these items on a We Owe, they wouldn't help when less than forty-eight hours later, I called about the manual transmission locking up from a worn Master Cylinder AND the transmission is slipping.
 
Oscar said he'd see what he can do and here we are, a month after that promise, not a single call.
 
My plates came in, Oscar said he'd follow up and let me know when they're in.
 
He didn't. I got a call from a Pre-Owned Manager I hadn't dealt with, David, who asked if I wanted them shipped, or if I'd prefer to pick them up. Living an hour away, I chose the former. A week and a half later with no plates, I call back and the plates were never shipped.

175,"October 16, 2014","WORST EXPERIENCE. NEVER GOING BACK.

After going to Friendly many times for various services and maintenance, I decided to go back. I had Friendly replace a part in my car and then the problem came back within a week! When I took my car back in to Friendly, they claimed that this was a completely different problem and that I needed another part replaced for ANOTHER $500. 

After arguing with the service advisor for a good 30 minutes, I decided to pick up my car, declining Friendly's service. The advisor tried to tell me that because this was a new problem, I would normally have to pay the $160 fee for the diagnostic test that had been done, but that they would do it free of charge. Don't act like you're doing me any favors dude because, no matter how many different ways you try to explain it, it was the exact same problem!! After much more arguing, the service advisor said that my car had *magically* reset itself and the problem no longer persisted, but he still recommended that I pay the $500 to fix the unbroken part for good measure...YEAH RIGHT. 

All in all, it is clear that Friendly's employees are more concerned about making a commission than helping their customers. And Friendly is most definitely the wrong name for this company--the service advisors as well as the girls at the concierge desk are far from friendly. 

And just to add fuel to the fire, you would think that after working with the same service advisor for over two weeks on the exact same issue, that he would be able to remember your name or at the very least, look up your car history to familiarize himself with the problem, but no. Frank (service advisor) had no idea who I was and did not remember what the problem was with my car--he finally looked up my car history a good 10 minutes into our phone conversation and goes, ""Oh! I remember who you are now!""...Really? I know you work with a lot of customers, but it had been less than a week and I had left him numerous voicemails (none of which he responded to) explaining my situation. And the icing on the cake, Frank kept calling me by the wrong name even after being corrected AND having my file in front of him! You really know how to make the customer feel appreciated, Frank. 

Needless to say, I will never go back to this dealership. They totally ripped me off--I didn't even need the first part replaced in the first place and then my car just reset itself and everything was fine? What a joke. There's $500 that I'll never get back.",1.0

187,"August 14, 2014","Sales man was a nice and professional young man, however, when it got away from him, to the managers hands and financing, the whole deal fell apart.  The old thinking of dealerships doing the ""ol switch-eroo"" at the very last minute, is alive and well.

I probably would've purchased the car IF they would've told me upfront the conditions and payment.  Since they tried to do something shady, they ended up keeping that ""brand new, 2 yr old camaro"".

A reminder that dealerships will say anything to get you into the car, you like it, then convince you to do something else.  In my case, I was firm and did not move $1 off the original deal.  I didn't need to BUY a car, but they sure needed to SELL a car.  If they like cars sitting in their lot, not willing to be flexible...they can keep it.  Plenty of other Chevy dealerships I can get a car like that from...AND cheaper.

I went to the dealership on Saturday around 6pm ended up finding a very good deal on my Camaro. I decided to buy a manual because the vehicle was cheaper.  I figured it would be easy to learn how to drive. Having never driven a manual vehicle I tried to learn in a day and became very frustrated and realized I would not ever learn how to drive the vehicle. I called the dealership first thing Monday morning because I read that there is a 3 day window where a vehicle can be returned to the dealer, but it was at the dealers discretion if they would take the vehicle back. I was very worried that they would in deed say No to me returning the vehicle. which means I would have been stuck with a brand new vehicle that I could not drive. To my surprise they did in deed let me return the vehicle and I ended up getting a 2014 Camaro automatic with everything that I wanted to start with plus an AMAZING PRICE. Their personnel were all very friendly , courteous and very Helpful. The Atmosphere at the dealership was warm and welcoming. When I first stepped on the lot to look at vehicles, I did not have to wait long for a salesman to come out to assist me and that was the Best first impression of the dealership for me.

He was very friendly, attentive and did not come across as a sleezy rep trying to make a sale. He made me confident and comfortable about our purchase. We had a run in with the service department who was horrible (on this occasion) they took 2 1/2 hours to make a spare key. The guy who started it left for lunch and no one was taking over. Derian made sure things were taken care of, even got his manager involved because he could tell our frustration! He went above and beyond to answer any question or address any concerns. He sat with us during the process. He didn't treat us like just ""another sale"". As we waited he offered to pick up lunch for us and just was so attentive, it was great!!

205,"May 12, 2014","I had been searching the DFW area Chevy dealers for a very specific model car. When I found what I was looking for at Friendly Chevrolet, I called and spoke with Joey. Joey confirmed they had the vehicle available I saw online, and I scheduled an appointment for a test drive later that evening.

When I arrived that evening, my wife and I met with Breck Lowe. Breck had the car already pulled up front and ready for us to check it out. After taking a quick photocopy of my license, Breck handed us the keys and told us to take it out for a drive. Needless to say, we were thrilled with the vehicle, and went back to talking with Breck about details.

Honestly, at that specific time we weren't ready to make a purchase decision. I still had three months left on my lease vehicle and we didn't anticipate making a purchase that night. In our discussions with Breck, we talked about our timing and our need to turn in our lease vehicle. Breck and his sales manager made us an offer, but at the time we were still unsure. Once we made it clear we weren't completely comfortable with moving forward they didn't pressure us at all.

As it turned out, we thought about it for a few days and came back to talk specifics about a deal the next week. This time both Joey and Breck were available and we got everything on the table. Breck and Joey went out of their way to make this the most painless and easy car purchase transaction I've ever been through. Their zero pressure sales technique was incredibly refreshing - especially in this recent economy.

I performed almost everything via phone and internet as I am a very busy man, jimmy was amazing through the entire process even until this day, everything was ready for me to sign when I arrived on my lunch break to pick up my ""Certified Used"" vehicle and the trade in process was simple aswell. With in 2 day with the vehicle I noticed white dotes covering the entire surface was I was washing it I noticed it wash paint, becoming alarmed I started looking closer at my truck the passager side tail light had a hole in it and both rear mates where missing... aggravated I call Jimmy he ensured me that everything will be ok and just to bring the vehicle in and he will have it detailed and the light fixed; and delivered promise.  A month later I went to start my truck and the battery was completely die. At this point im completely done I then take my truck to a dealership in Plano off Preston st.

236,"July 27, 2013","I have bought my last 4 vehicles from Friendly.  

I drove by to look at the new 2014 Silverado.  I walked up and down the lines of trucks.  I peered in and out of vehicles for a good 20+ minutes.  No one offered to help.  I walked up to the office, and no one assisted.  I asked a man if he was in sales, and he said yes.  I told him I was interested in the extended cab Silverado.  He told me that he was sorry that the only model they had was the crew cab.  He handed me his card and said to check with him next week ""when we should get them in.""

I was pissed, because I wanted to test drive the new Silverado.  I left.

I went over to Sewell and looked around at the GMC models.  Strangely, no one at their place wanted to assist me either... LOL 

I got into my truck, started to drive home, and I called Friendly.  I had Francis answer the phone, I told him I wanted to check out the new Silverados.  He immediately said for me to come in and look at your inventory and ""get a feel of the truck""...  I did.

Francis greeted me when I pulled up, he immediately addressed me by name, and shook my hand.  We probably test drove 4 Silverado trucks.  I was unhappy with the ""bells and whistles"" offered on the models.  I was just about wait and I decided to test drive a Chevy Camaro, it was just a whim.  Francis under the impression I was not going to buy.  I FELL IN LOVE WITH THE CAMARO.  This is coming from a total truck man my whole life.  We test drove 4 models, and decided to purchase.  

He worked with me GREAT.  He answered every single question, noted the importance of me being a repeat customer, and gave me an excellent value of my Silverado LTZ trade-in.

Yes, I'm 41 years old, and never had a car with so many gadgets and bells to it.  As I was getting ready to drive off, it started to rain, embarrassingly I could not locate the wiper blade control.  Francis was on his way out (after he made sure I was financed and taken care of), he pulled up behind me and then gave me a ""tour"" of functions on my new car.

He followed up with me today, and just to let you know, please give Francis Oguntosin a huge pat on the back.  He is an excellent member of your staff.  He guaranteed that I will be a continuing repeat customer of Friendly Chevrolet from now on.

Thank you!

239,"June 21, 2013","I chose to purchase my new car from Friendly because I have bought a new car from there before. I certainly was not disappointed. The sales rep I worked was exceptional. He was able to answer every question I had. He was courteous, knowledgeable, and understood my needs in an automobile purchase. His name was Vicente Vargas.",5.0

243,"May 22, 2012",We have bought 3 vehicles new and used from Friendly and it was amazing. We got what we wanted with no hassles or pressure. Everyone was polite and helpful with no high pressure sales. Jimmy was very upfront with us. We try to send friends to them when they are in the market! Great buying experience!,4.8
244,"May 12, 2012","I made my most recent purchase a few months ago and recently brought my truck back for its first service. Things went so smoothly I thought I owed them the time to write this review. I have bought 3 vehicles from them and each time it's easy, fun and simple. I do a little homework before I go and get an idea of what is fair and then go see if I can make a deal. Not only do I make this easy for myself I make it easy for them. I ask for my price that I felt was fair what I want for my trade and they talk to the manager for about 2-5 minutes and then bring me my paperwork. The finance guys were always great they make finishing the paperwork simple and easy too. I like it when you get to deal with people that know how to do their job, and dont treat you like just another person through the door. They went above and beyond what I thought they would or could do. I had my truck clean and ready to go with my Onstar ready for me just to make it easier. 

When I brought my truck back for service this past week I was really pleasantly surprised on how I was treated. I was greeted right away by a young lady who told me she would help get my information about the vehicle and provide the service guy with the info. When the service guy came over to me he was great too asked about my truck and if there was anything that I had noticed that should be addressed while in for the oil change and tire rotation, which there wasn't but its good to know they want to address it seems like a good time saver for me. Then he asked if I wanted to wait or if I would like a complimentary loaner to run errands while it was being serviced!! I took him up on that and I was on the road made a quick stop grabbed lunch and when I got back the truck was done, washed and ready to go. Turns out what was even bigger surprise was they now cover my first service too. So it was free, painless, quick and  thorough. I appreciate good service and this place delivers everytime. If considering a new Chevy there's not a better place you can get one than Friendly Chevy!!",5.0
245,"April 18, 2012","Working with Auto Trader Friendly Chevrolet was recommend as a car buyer. My car was evaluated and I was given a fair sell price. I left the car and expected the dealer to send the payoff amount the next day to my bank. Five business days later, and only after several calls did the dealership send the money. The check sent was not a cashiers check so my bank had to wait to make sure the Griendky check ckeared  Now it is exactly 14 days later and I don't have my money for the car I sold them. 

I simply feel lied to and ripped off. I cannot recommend this dealership. ",1.8
246,"May 01, 2011","I went to Friendly Chevorlet last summer to possibly trade my big truck in for a smaller truck. I had an 08 1 ton chevy duramax dually, loaded with a 6inch lift/35 inch tires/etc. my truck retail price was right at $46,000. It was a very nice truck!! I owed right at $40,000 at the time on the truck. They offered to pay my truck off for me and get me in another used 2008 chevy 1500 texas edition without any balance carrying over to the new truck. The truck i was buying was listed at $26,900 but i talked them down to $25,000 because i was trading in my truck which they really wanted to put on their lot. Everything was fine....... at first. I recently looked up the value of my truck because i was thinking of trading it in because now i need a bigger truck to work out of. The most i can get for my truck right now is $20,000. What has me confused and upset is when i called for payoff on my truck they said i still owed $30,080 after i have already paid a years worth of payments.I have a middle of the road interest rate.  If i would have kept my DURAMAX i would actually owe less than what i do now. They somehow changed some numbers on my contract and really gave me the shaft. I do not think that they care about repeat business nor do they care about their customers. I know for a fact that they purposefully edited the numbers on the contract and i am now seeking legal counsel to resolve this issue. My name is Billy Robinson and my number is 903-258-1995 and I am from Jacksonville Texas. If you are planning to buy a vehicle from them and have any questions then feel free to call me, or if you work for the dealership and want to help resolve this issue then call me. 

In closing, hind sight is always 20/20. I would never had made this deal if all the info was presented up front. Information was intentionally withheld to push this deal through. That is why i would give this dealer zero stars if it was an option.......",2.0
247,"December 05, 2010","I have purchased several vehicles in my life and this was one of the easiest and most pleasant dealerships to deal with. Chris Snyder the sales manager was very up front with what he could do price wise and very honest. The sales consultant david did a wonderful job explaining the truck and all its features and showed me a demo to save me some money which i liked the most!! The finance manager was very pleasant although i am difficult to to deal with at times. After i got done with the finance manager i went to see Chris Malone, she explained everything in detail and just topped off a awesome experience. I have already told several people about my experience at Friendly Chevrolet and will continue to do so, i strongly recommend this dealer to anyone looking to purchase a new vehicle!!!",5.0
248,"November 14, 2010","Friendly Chevrolet is one of the most improperly managed and unprofessional businesses I have ever dealt with.  Here is my experience with Friendly.  I saw a Chevrolet Avalanche for sale on Ebay.  It was a good looking truck for a pretty good price and being that I live in Boston I really wanted a truck from a part of the country where there is no salt on the roads.  I asked James, a salesperson, to send me some pictures of the undercarriage just to be sure there was no rust.  He was supposed to send me the pictures on Monday before 9 pm and when he didn't send them I called and Heather, a secretary, told me they would be sent the next morning before 10 am which they were.  As soon as I received them I called James and told him I wanted the truck.  We agreed to a price and went through the process of completing the necessary paperwork.  I then received a phone call from Heather telling me that there was another buyer interested in the truck and that I needed to wait to see if I could still buy the truck that I thought I had just closed the deal on.  So I sent in my paperwork and deposit assuming that there must be some  mistake, after all James already told me I had the truck.  I diligently called heather and James for the rest of the day trying to figure out what was going on with my paperwork and what the next thing I needed to do was.  The fact that they were ignoring me was my first clue that something wasn't right.  After hours of waiting for a call I tried again and finally I got an answer from James.  He informed me that the truck he sold me that morning had actually been ""sold"" the night before to someone who ""said"" he wanted the truck but had not completed any of the paperwork nor had he made a deposit.  There's really very little I could do from Boston but I told a manager, Chris my story and he seemed willing to try to help me find another truck which made me feel better about the dealership.  Unfortunately, ignoring customers seems to be a common trend there because Chris who was eager to help is now missing in action.  I strongly urge people not to go to this dealership and to anyone who does, stay away from James, Heather and Chris.  They are perfectly pleasant and polite but unfortunately incompetent.",1.4
249,"August 16, 2010","The absolute WORST experience I have ever had! Friendly Chevrolet should be changed to We Dont Care About You Chevrolet. I wasnt at dealer more than ten minutes before the manager told me he couldnt help me without $5000 down on a $12000 vehicle? Before I could laugh in his face I asked what options and solution they had to sell this truck and he said NONE, Sorry we cant help you. I am appalled by the lack of effort and service they provide. The shocker is I went up the road to a competitor and was approved for a BRAND NEW $24000 car with no hassle or down payment, they were glad to accept my trade in. Being that I work in the auto industry I will promise to never let anyone I encounter buy a vehicle from Friendly Chevrolet! ",1.0
250,"May 18, 2010","I came in wanting a truck, not really knowing if I would qualify for one. I met salesman Bryan Chaney and we went right into business. Before I got all excited about a new truck, Bryan made sure I would get approved. After I was approved, then we went and found the truck I wanted. I test drove it and right away I knew this was the one I wanted. Bryan was very friendly, easy to work with and very honest. I told him exactly what my conditions were and he made every attempt to accommodate them. He has very good customer service, to the point were he went to a near by convenient store to pick me up a COKE because the machine at the dealer was out of regular coke. He walked me through the entire process and made sure my wife and I were comfortable. He even gave my daughter some candy which just made things better. I would like to thank Bryan and Friendly Chevrolet for the opportunity they gave me of doing business with them. Mike from finance, thank you also, he was very nice and courteous. He explained the finance processes and made sure I was happy. Overall, this was a great experience and I will definitely buy my next car here.  ",5.0

I did not spend a long time at the dealership and the salesman was always straight with me.",4.8

Just a quick note to say, ""Thank you"" to Kenneth McKenzie for assisting me in the purchase of my car.  You demonstrated professionalism, great customer service and most all you greeted and treated with the utmost respect. You listened to my needs and found the perfect car for me.
 
I will certainly refer you to my family and friends. Again, Thank you!

253,"April 13, 2010",Working with Bryan CHaney was great.  I would buy from Friendly again in the future.  I wish all dealerships would let their sales staff negotiate deals without having to run back and forth to someone the customer never sees.  Ridiculous method that all dealerships have apparently adopted.  Bryan was great to work with though and I recommend anyone shopping at Friendly to request him.  Very courteous and profesisonal.,4.8
254,"April 07, 2010","My experience with the purchase of my 2010 Camaro was wonderful! Bryan Chaney and Chris Tes made the whole buying experience pleasurable and trouble free. Being the conscientious person I am and not being made of money, I immediately made it clear what I expected. I was very specific and just short of being the difficult customer in my opinion, but there was never a time that I was not treated with the utmost respect and honesty. I thought it would be having the car that would make me feel good, but it is the way I was treated that is making me feel great actually.  I will never do business with any other dealership except Friendly Chevrolet!! THANKS BRYAN AND CHRIS!! BY THE WAY - THE CAMARO IS AMAZING!!",5.0
255,"June 02, 2009","***WARNING*** DO NOT PURCHASE A CAR FROM CORVETTE WORLD OR FRIENDLY CHEVROLET!!!! I purchased a used Corvette from Terry Malone, the car has had nothing but problems from the beginning. The car has spent more time in the shop than it has been on the road. It has been in the shop for weeks at a time for various problems which still continue until this day. Terry Malone is a slick fast talking car salesman who only wants your money, he is as shady as they get, do not do business with him, buyer beware!!! I tried to speak to Terry Malone and Clint (Used Car Manager) about my problems with the car and they just turned their backs on me and ignored me, this shows their real concern for the customer. I don't want to see anyone go through the hassle, stress, and grief that I have had to go through. ***BUYER BEWARE***

257,"February 28, 2008","I just purchased a 2008 Silverado. It was a very satisfactury vehicle buying experience. I thought they would treat me poorly because I was shopping price very competetivly. To my suprise, I was treated with respect and after a little of the usual dealership price shuffle, I was offered  the lowest price out of several local Chevy dealers. After we made the deal, there were absolutly no games, finance gave me a competitive interest rate, didn't have any hidden add-ons, and the delivery process was handled effeciently. I wasn't buying the most expensive vehicle that they had, but they made me feel like I was. The professionalism that I observed made me proud to be purchasing an American product at an American dealership. I received a full tank of fuel, floor mats and the truck was spotless.

258,"August 18, 2006","I found a used vehicle by their internet listing, called the dealer 3 times over 5 day  period, last time 25 minutes before I got there to verify the unit was there (By VIN and stock number) and had the features I was looking for.  Was confirmed all three times.  When I asked for Rene she was in back office, they brought her out, and she acted like she was going to get the keys, brought back another salesman, passed me off to him, he wanted to fill out a lead sheet(credit app).  When I told him it was a cash deal, that  I just wanted to save time by looking at the vehicle first, he still tried to get sheet info.  I insisted him I wanted to see the vehicle, and then he told me it had been sold two weeks prior.  (CAN YOU SPELL BAIT AND SWITCH< WIRE FRAUD?) I left.  Got a followup call,from a sales rep, told him no way, then I got a ""customer experience survey"" and I spilled the beans on them, about 4 days later got a call from Rene trying to apologize, and telling me she had another vehicle I might be interested in.  Told her NO WAY! I called yesterday, she is still employed, as is Steve (ISM) so this is style of mgmt. and operation.  I am reporting to Better business Bureau and to GM Dealer Council.  This is dishonest, unscrupulous, and fraudulent practice. I would not recommend anyone even visit their store, much less buy from them.     
As a son of a GM retiree, and as a Chrysler Corp former employee, I was totally dissatisfied with their actions as a dealership.",1.0
