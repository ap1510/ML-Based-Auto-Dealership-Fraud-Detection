0,"May 12, 2020","the truck has been in their service department at least 10 times since October for the SAME issue. they turn the light off and say it's fixed and then same issue, all this while under warranty. Call Mike Lee in the service department who tells us to take it somewhere else. truck goes some where else and they are able to quickly find the issue. speak to Mr. Goff because why should we pay for something that they could have fixed months ago because it's been the same issue continuously? jump through hoops last week and today, no one is willing to pay for the problem that their mechanics could have fixed MONTHS ago. no more GMC products and def do NOT recommend this dealership or service department ",1.0
1,"September 15, 2019","I came to Richard Karr because they were recommended by trusted friends and I was not disappointed. The lovely professional at the front desk, my salesperson, Jennifer Twitty, the GM Richard Gough and their Service Department Director, Mike Lee all were friendly, knowledgeable and helpful in assisting me. I will recommend them to everyone that I know. I feel like I made new friends and purchased a vehicle from wonderful, honest people.",5.0
2,"August 01, 2019",Working with Todd made our purchase very easy. Did not feel pressured into buying. I had sought out on the Internet the car and what I wanted in it. Todd was quick to answer my questions prior to coming to the dealership. ,5.0

4,"May 11, 2018","Richard Karr Motors is the best in all areas from service to used cars to new cars.  Always friendly, professional and extremely fair. Having purchased numerous new and used cars, Richard Karr Motors is by far the best car buying experience you will ever have.  Additionally, their service department led by the master, Mike Lee is the best in the business.  I would recommend this dealership everyday, all day! Keep up the great work!",5.0
5,"April 07, 2018","Have had body work done at the collision center about a year ago, and recently purchased a used vehicle. Both experiences were outstanding and better than expected. They have some great employees. Car purchase was fair and relatively haggle free. Highly recommended!!",5.0
6,"November 02, 2017","Richard Karr is the only place I will go for any repairs for my Buick. The entire Sales and Service team is very friendly and professional. My tire and battery were replaced under warranty without any hassles, they take care of everything so that you donâ€™t have to worry about anything. ",5.0

8,"June 23, 2017","Recall notice on a 2006 LaCrosse for the headlights. Just received notice from GM a couple weeks ago and it had been acting up so took it in. The notice plainly stated that it would likely occur under 150K miles and prior to 12 years. It DIDN'T say that was all it would cover. Someone named Leonard advised my son, a college student, that it wasn't covered. He called me on the phone to explain that they were only authorized to replace them on recall up to 150K miles. OK, no biggie, I'll call the factory rep. Asked him for the number and he said he didn't have it. That kinda did it for me. My son said he was kinda rude with him but I thought he was just being a little sensitive. When he demonstrated he couldn't care enough to get me a number I was convinced he couldn't give a crap about our issue. Can't believe they stay in business with that kind of attitude.",1.0
9,"December 23, 2016","I came in at 7am (6:59 on my phone) and pulled the door, it was locked. It was also 35 degrees outside and the men inside looked up, and went back to their work leaving me outside in the dark. A minute or so later one came over and unlocked the door but didn't open it or acknowledge me at all. I walked in and was immediately greeted with them telling me there were other customers that had already been waiting and I was 3rd or 4th in line. That's fine, but I hadn't even opened my mouth and they were ready to curtly inform me I wasn't first. It was bizarre. Several other instances happened that just reflected poor training and listless employees. The manager then came over and when I addressed these issues with him he told me that I must also have mornings where I snap at people. I told him not at my JOB I don't. He said ""Oh id like to hire you then, I like hiring ""perfect people"""" and walked off. Ridiculous. The manners of this staff were atrocious, and after they repair my car today I will not be returning. There is another dealership in Temple and I'd rather drive the 30 minutes to receive better service than this. It seems like the training they had was either ineffective or did not resonate with the staff in their day to day interactions because I felt like I was an inconvenience and a trouble instead of a customer. Just awful. ",1.8
10,"November 04, 2016","I bought my first vehicle in 2003 from Richard Karr.  I went back in 2008 thinking I would buy another and the salesman made me so mad that I just got up and walked out.  I ended up getting a better deal at another dealership.  This time I went to see them and they were all ready to put me in a new vehicle and I drove it over the weekend and when it came to my trade-in allowance, they tried to give the lowest amount possible.  What is bad about it, two other dealerships had offered me about $5000 more.  When I went to return the vehicle, one of the managers made some very rude and inappropriate remarks to me after I told him that I was sorry that we could not come to an agreement on my trade-in.  I went to Garlyn Shelton in Temple and got a better deal on my new Yukon and a xxxx of a deal on my trade-in.  Very grateful to Adam and Matt!  Great experience over in Temple!    ",1.0
11,"July 09, 2016","I've been dealing with Richard Karr Motors since 2011, just rolled 50,000 miles today. The service department has always been professional and polite. I've had to use the body shop, oops, and received excellent service. I would definitely recommend Richard Karr Motors. ",4.8

13,"January 29, 2016","Richard Karr Motors may be a good place to purchase a car or truck but do not take your vehicle there for body shop or service work.   You're better off making that drive to Temple Texas.  My Cadillac Escalade went into the body shop at the beginning of this month and when I picked it up the oil sensor light came on and said to turn the truck off.  Took it back, the manager at the body shop said that they would get it over to service and that they would take care of it.  So they call back the next day and say that they're not taking care of it.  I had to fight with them to get them to at least cover the test part of it.  They said that they would cover the test part and that it was probably a oil screen (should have been a red light for me).  So they run the test and we're in a rental car that they was suppose to be taken care of.  I had a feeling that there was going to be issues with the rental so we returned it early.   They call back on Monday and say it's the oil screen (should have known something then).  I say ok go ahead and fix it.  Get the truck back today 1-29 and it did the same thing and the Service Manager Mike Lee tried to talk to me like I was a dummy and then he insulted me and tried to come back with I'm not trying to insult you but her clearly was and he knew it and that's why he said that he didn't mean to insult me.  At this point I was even more pissed.  I said xxxx 1 time after being insulted and he wanted to end the conversation.  He really wanted to end the conversation because he know that they didn't do a test on my truck,  THINK TWICE BEFORE HAVING THEM TO DO WORK ON YOUR CARS AND TRUCKS.  I'M STILL WAITING ON A CALL FROM THE OWNER WHICH I PROBABLY WILL NOT GET.   SO I'M PRETTY MUCH STUCK WITH THE CAR RENTAL BILL AND THEY SCREWED ME OUT OF $256.00 BY NOT DOING A TEST TO GET THE REAL PROBLEM FIXED.  TEMPLE CADILLAC WILL GET MY BUSINESS FROM NOW ON.  ",1.0
14,"September 04, 2015","I had an excellent experience at Richard Karr GMC. Below are my top 3 favorite qualities about your establishment: -Very professional atmosphere, both inside the dealership and with your sales reps. -You set yourself apart from other brands, including Chevrolet. Your dealership feels luxurious, and as a customer, I felt that I was purchasing a much better product compared to the competition. -Your team works hard to make the customer happy. In my case, you worked to give me my asking price on my trade-in in order to make a sale - I appreciated that, and as a result, you won my business.",5.0
15,"December 30, 2014","Richard Karr Motors continues to be the place for car care and new cars in Waco. It is the gem in the area that is beginning to take hold. The service folks are ALWAYS top notch and seek the best experience for the customer. If it does not need maintenance, they do not force anything on you. On the other hand, if they determine that there may be problems in the future they will suggest the proper action. Steve was the customer service person this time and treated me like the most important customer of the day even though it was only a minor issue. The treatment of all Richard Karr team members is outstanding from sales, finance to service is always cordial and polite. If Mr. Karr sees you, he makes a point to acknowledge you. A tremendous team effort at Richard Karr Motors in Waco, TX. Highly recommended.",5.0
