0,"June 02, 2020","My husband was looking for a Ram truck for himself. We decided on a Ram Rebel 2019. The salesman Jimmy, who was very nice, told my husband of a $1900 extra fee placed on all vehicles that were on their lot. My husband and I thought that was ridiculous and stupid. So, basically the red tag sales on their lot do not save you anything because they recoup the money with this required fee! We were uncomfortable with that but we liked the truck so much that we were going to agree to it. The kicker that made us leave was when we had to meet the sales manager requested by  our salesman. The sales manager would not even consider us financing through anyone but them even though we had a better interest rate through our bank. He lost a sale and he could have cared less with his arrogant stance.  I guess he didn’t need to sell a truck that bad! I have never seen that in my life and we have bought many vehicles over the years!",1.8
1,"May 22, 2020","Today I had the worst experience in all of my car purchasing history. My husband and I were shopping for a particular truck and heard that Grapevine Dodge would be the place to find it. And we actually found the truck that we were shopping for however the treatment we received was extremely humiliating. Our salesman Leo sat with us to talk about the purchase and we explained to him that we would like to work on the pricing before any further actions could take place. He then handed my husband his IPAD and asked that he complete all of the boxes in red. Listed on the IPAD was a box that required his social security number. We asked Leo, if we provide the number would there be any type of credit pulled and he said no this information would be placed in the dealership files for future transactions. After completing the fields, we again stated that we absolutely did not want the credit pulled and he said they would not pull credit. Trusting what he stated was the truth we then proceeded to complete the requested information. After completion he took the IPAD went into another office and came back with my husband’s credit score written on a sheet of paper. We were puzzled as to how he had obtained this information without pulling my husband’s credit, we looked at him and said we both stated to you several times that we did not want the credit pulled. He began to explain that it was a soft inquiry and not a hard one therefore it would not show up on the credit report. In efforts to verify what he stated was true we immediately looked at the credit report and there it was, a hard inquiry from Grapevine Dodge. We said to him again, we told you that we did not want this to happen. He then proceeded to talk about the sale as if he didn't hear what we said about the credit being pulled without our permission. While talking about the purchase, still bothered by the lie he told, we explained to him that we would be seeking outside financing and he stated the dealership did not allow outside financing. We asked if we could bring the full amount of the purchase basically in cashier's check or check and he said no to that as well. It was at that point that we realized this dealership did not want to transact business with us. In this case it was apparent that this dealership had a problem with us. Their actions and treatment towards us would suggest that the issue was racially motivated. I have never felt so humiliated, frustrated and just down right disgusted. This dealership has a salesman that will look right into your eyes lie and manipulate in efforts to try and deceive you to get your information only to turn you away. Once we confronted him about his actions he asked to wait while he went to get his manager, Richard, who initially supported his actions until we informed him that Leo purposely deceived us. He then decided he would try to somewhat smooth things over by saying the dealership would do business with us. By this time, we were furious and felt as if we could not trust anyone. I asked Richard for the name of the owner and he proceeded to tell us that he was the one in charge and there was no one higher than him. If he isn't the owner wouldn't there be someone over him? Perhaps another lie! DO NOT USE THIS DEALERSHIP!",1.0
2,"May 20, 2020","I am not sure they fix the vehicles. We brought our Jeep Wrangler in for an AC malfunction where over 75mph the fan would stop blowing and there was no AC. 5 times!! It is under a lifetime warranty, but each time the ""fix"" lasts pretty much until we drive it over 75mph again...therefore never really being fixed. Each time we pay a deductible and they get paid out for the warranty repair I'm sure. Never has it ever been fixed. Not being unreasonable at all, you try going in for the SAME ISSUE 5x over and over. I don't care if it is covered and we are not paying full price....FIX IT. We dropped off the Jeep again this week left the engine running to show them what the issue is...and 3 days later someone calls and goes...so yeah...can you tell me what the issue is? The Service manager then says ""Next time can you like...leave the engine running when you get here so we can see what the issue is?"" ARE YOU KIDDING ME OR ARE YOU JUST AN IDIOT? Then proceeded to say...look we don't need your business when we asked why after 5x the same issue was happening. 

I find their service super slow and unresponsive as well. It always takes a week for any fixes even small to happen, no one calls when it is done, there are no updates. You have to call directly and ask, to which they say...oh...so and so have gone home so...not sure. So if your advisor has gone home, too bad, you cannot really find out a thing. This is for anything...even an oil change. 

In the end, I find their practice sketchy. I would not buy from here, use their service center or go anywhere near this place. Their dishonesty, lack of service, and incompetence to fix the issue is enough, added onto the ""I don't care"" attitude just tops it off. May karma take care of people like this, especially at tough times like now. If you go here, good luck to you!",1.2
3,"May 15, 2020",I WORK FOR ANOTHER DEALERSHIP DOWN HERE IN SHERMAN AND HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH A TIRE TICKET FOR A MONTH AND DANIEL HAS HELPED ME GET IT WORKED OUT THE LAST TWO TIMES Y'ALL SHOULD GIVE HIM A RAISE,5.0
4,"February 20, 2020","I believe that a blind squirrel will eventually find a nut, and this is how I believe Grapevine CDJR has gotten their 2.8 star average review rating.  I have been searching for a RAM, and saw a couple that interested me, so I submitted an internet inquiry.  I reached out through email to initiate the process, and received an email stating they would have someone contact me.

Jimmie Merriweather was my salesman, and reached out to me with the current advertised price of the truck.  I was expecting a little more conversation on the vehicle and further advertised discounts, so I inquired about a few that were listed.  Jimmie stated that there were no additional discounts available.

Jimmie then inquired what my “out the door” price would be.  I had already gotten the sense that time was not of the essence, due to the fact that responses were extremely late.  I finally provided a low price, figuring it was now time to negotiate in earnest.  Jimmie provides me with a quote for the asking price, plus additional add-ons, raising the price significantly.  I politely thanked him for his time; this was the final contact by Jimmie.  (It's called work; if you want something you have to be willing to work for it.)

I then reached out to the E-Commerce Concierge explaining that I felt my time was wasted, and did not feel they wanted to work very hard for a sale.  She let me know she would pass along my concerns to her manager.  I heard nothing back, and sent her an email asking what her manager’s name was; it has been almost two weeks, and I haven’t received a response.

I work hard for my money, and I would expect those trying to earn my business work just as hard.  I take reviews very seriously, and realize that some people are never satisfied, but when a business receives mediocre reviews consistently across different review platforms, it may be time to heed the warnings.

Fortunately, there are many RAM dealers across the Dallas-Fort Worth area that appreciate the customer, and is willing to take the time and effort to provide a satisfying end result that is beneficial to both parties.

5,"January 10, 2020","Listen very carefully. I already did the work for you. There is no reason to come here. I already got treated poorly for everybody before me. Please do not make my terrible experience worth nothing. If you come here looking to buy a car, It means that everything I went through was for nothing. Buying a car should be really simple and goals should be met or get a customer as close to that goal as possible. This place wants to ream you and leave you paying the most they can possibly get you. I was at $42K on a 2019 scat pack (stars and stripes) 7.39% email was sent on that invoice that I need to be under $40K and we have a deal. With $20K cash down on the vehicle and there is no way im doing that apr as well. sales rep sent me an email stating. I was able to get the price to $41,750. I did not reply to that email for 2hrs and a second email was sent stating I also negotiated an additional $1K off of the price do we have a deal. The answer is yes please send the Invoice. The invoice was sent for $42,461.44 at 6% Called the sales manager Jay and he was a xxxxx who did not want to sell this car to me because he knew at that point he would not be able to xxxx me on the car. The car has been sitting at that lot for over a year. My offer was fair 5% 20K down 72 months $39,999 OTD. My business credit was pulled and I did not sign a Credit app for that and I will be moving forward with an investigation on that. The app for Business was forged.",1.0
6,"January 03, 2020","I took my JL Wrangler in to Grapevine Dodge, Chrysler, Jeep to get a steering recall fixed.  Supposedly, they fixed that.

I also mentioned when it is below 40 degrees, and at highway speed, the steering only gives 2-3"" of steering before it feels like it hits the post.  This feels very dangerous.  It felt like something was going to break if I forced it past that spot.  I looked online and found others who had experienced the same issue.  The dealership called back, and said they fixed the steering recall issue but were unable to reproduce the cold weather steering issue.  I picked it up the next morning, when it was 20 degrees, and it was doing it again.  There were very few people there at the time, so I went back the following morning when it was again in the 20’s.  I asked for someone to ride with me to see what it was doing.  The tech who fixed the steering recall issue was brought out.  Before we got on the highway, he told me to pull over to the side.  His response to the cold steering issue was to turn the steering wheel all the way to the left, then right 5 times.  (Not a solution).  He said it was because moisture was getting inside, and when it is cold, it freezes, and causes the blockage.  Turning the steering wheel post to post a few times clears that out.  Yes, it prevented the issue on that morning.  But I’m not going to do that every day before I drive my Jeep.  That’s just stupid.  

After driving it over 1000 miles on vacation (including 80+ mph on the highway, and some off-roading), I installed a bull bar.  As soon as I pulled the splash guard off to start the install, I noticed the sway bar link on the driver's side just hanging loose.  It had obviously been removed when it was being serviced for the recall, and never re-attached.

I set up an appointment for them to fix this, and was told my the service advisor that ""Yeah, looks like that came loose.""  Came loose?  No.  It was taken off, and never re-attached.  There would not be a loaner available for another week.  I asked if it would be quick to fix, and I could just wait.  ""No.  That's not a quick fix.""  I know I could do it, and will this afternoon.  I don't have the nice tools and setup they do.  I told them I would leave, and let them know if I could bring it in later.  

""Be careful, and don't make any quick or sharp turns."" 

Really?  It's a shame that they obviously don't care about their customers.  A brand new Jeep has work done by someone who tells a customer to ""turn the wheel all the way to the left and right"" to fix a dangerous issue.  He removes the sway bar link, and just doesn't re-attach it.  And the service advisor thinks it just ""came loose"".  

1. A dangerous steering issue is just ignored.  ""Just turn it all the way to the left.....""
2. A part is disconnected and left loose.  Potentially a huge safety issue.
3. ""Looks like that came loose."" Even though I told him it was done when it was in for service (at their dealership).
4. Be careful driving the vehicle.  It could be dangerous.  And we could fix it in a few minutes, but, no.  You have to leave it for days, and we don't have a loaner available.",2.0
7,"December 30, 2019","Aaron Cameron was very helpful with a 2020 Grand Cherokee. He did everything he could to match a quote I received elsewhere and was very upfront and honest opposed to the typical ""car salesman"" stereotype. I also appreciate him communicating with me via text to save me the drive out to Grapevine. I will keep his information and reach out should I need further help in the future.",5.0
8,"December 20, 2019","They list vehicles prices that are not real, after asking for the final price I was sent a quote including a ""Grapevine protection package"" which is window tint, door edge protectors, wheel locks and a gps tracker for $2.000.
They said this is added as soon as the vehicle is delivered to the store and can't be taken off. So if it is added as soon as they get the vehicle, they already know that the price will increase by $2.000 on every single vehicle. Why not just list the real price instead of luring the people with a false advertising? this is a total waste of time. After you add those 2k, the price won't be competitive compared to other dealers.
Jeep should watch how the dealers are advertising.

I would expect the usual reply with an email to contact them with any concern, they should be the ones concerned. I should have read all the 1-star reviews before.",1.0

11,"July 18, 2019","I almost bought vehicle from here. signed 4 papers and the decided to walk back. I was in market to buy a new Pacifica Hybrid Limited and there were handful of vehicle in TEXAS. ""Luckily"" we found the couple in Grapevine which we liked. Contacted them, got redirected to a sales person - Mohammed aka ""Mo"". 
First time I had chance to talk to Mo, I told him that I am going to use my bank for financing. And he said, they don’t accept third party financing – meaning all the loans has to be financed through the dealership. BTW is that even legal to force consumer to force financing through specific entity? Anyways, so I asked him about interest rates offered by dealership for 48 months term, he said – he needs to get that number from his finance manager. I waited for couple of hours to get the return call. No calls for 3 hours, so I called back, and got my question on interest rate answered – it turned out to be little higher( 4.05%) than what I was getting from my loan provider (2.99%). Tried negotiating, but not luck there. Later on when I was signing papers for financing – I found that I was being charged 5.89% interest. Somehow I told myself that I can always refinance this vehicle thru my bank (with $33 as title fees) and decided to move on.. 
I was not happy with the time it takes for someone to respond to questions. Was getting very delayed response. After week of exchanging numerous text, email and phone calls, we made a deal. So I got email from dealership on the menu - meaning the price and line items. Tried negotiating, but again no luck. After getting agreement on the price we decided to go ahead and buy the vehicle.
And after collecting the check, I texted ""Mo"" that we are on our way to get the vehicle. He responded back not to come because there is other customer who is coming to buy that vehicle. Little bit disappointed, however we still took our chance to go and give it a try in case that customer decides not buy that vehicle, and in case that vehicle is gone, they still had similar features vehicle in their lot that we wanted to look at and might buy, if everything works out well. So we started our drive. Reached to dealership - and asked for Mo. He was there. 
We asked him if that vehicle is sold or not. Response: That customer submitted deposit to buy that vehicle and will come tomorrow to pick that vehicle up. Little disappointed on out expectation, but the other vehicle was still in their lot. While working on the deal for other vehicle with Mo and Manager Jay Simpson introduced himself to help, and while talking to Jay, I mentioned that we actually came here to look at the other vehicle, and he for his curiosity asked ""what vehicle"". And after I told about the first vehicle, he said - they cant sell that vehicle to anyone because of ""blown transmission"". SO ALL THIS TIME I SPENT OVER TEXT/EMAIL/PHONE I WAS MAKING DEAL ON A VEHICLE THAT DEALERSHIP CANT SELL. AND I EVEN RECEIVED A QUOTE IN MY EMAIL FROM DEALERSHIP FOR THE VEHICLE THAT THEY CANT SELL??
My workplace has a tie up with Chrysler, where you get rewards with buying Chrysler vehicle – its called Affiliate Rewards Program. So I asked them to do the needful so that I get benefit of this program. He denied saying that this is max discount that you get is already on this paper. I insisted to talk to your manager to clarify – that the rewards I will be getting is independent of the dealer’s discount. “Mo” went to ask his manager. That’s when Jay came to picture. I was able to convince them. But when they got the paper for claiming Affiliate Rewards, Jay wanted me to sign a papers that has no numbers on it. Its like signing a blank check. I felt something is cooking behind the doors.
While making deal on the second vehicle, I found one specific item on the menu that I was not interested in, and asked to opt-out. Mo told that that item is free of charge, and taking that off will make no difference in the price of vehicle. Later, when I was signing the papers, I was asked to sign the document for subscribing to item which costs $999.00.",1.0

Returning in the rental you've had for over a week to return/ cancel a deal, and bring told you're a liar and you're stuck in the car (even though it isn't a safe vehicle) and better luck next time,  go see if you can trade it in. Absolutely horrendous treatment. ",1.0
13,"June 28, 2019","This is a dealership, go in prepared for a low ball offer on your trade-in. Know the value of your vehicle. Be prepared for the added $2k of dealer add ons to the sticker price of the vehicle if you found it online. Shouldn't be all that surprising, as that is typical for most dealerships, if you're that opposed to it, you can always do what a friend of mine does, write down the price you want for your trade in and the price your prepared to pay for the vehicle you want (but be reasonable people) and ask for a yes or no, if they give you anything else, just walk out. Anyway, Lewis was great to work with and after dealership hopping for a few days, I must have gone to over 15 dealerships was very impressed with his knowledge on the vehicle and appreciated him taking the time to go over the features that I may have overlooked. Very happy with my purchase.",4.8
14,"June 27, 2019",I had a bad experience at the service department waiting 9 hours for my vehicle to get an oil change and a recall done.spoke to the general manager about the situation he told me he'd make it a priority to get it done quickly. After he made that promise to me he made himself unavailable for the rest of the day to speak to me. Spoke with a few other managers but they were all so rude. So I sat patiently and waited my 9 hours. Couple days later I tried to reach out to the corporate office and because I did so they informed Chrysler that my business is no longer welcome at this dealership. Talk about retaliation this is how their ownership treats customers who have legitimate complaints. I'm a disabled combat veteran no longer welcomed at Grapevine Dodge. Please anybody who cares about combat veterans would boycott this dealership.,1.0
15,"May 25, 2019",I was reassured great financing and a great deal on a vehicle I was interested in before taking time.off from work to test drive.

17,"March 19, 2019",Worst experience.   My husband and I came into dealership to purchase a Dodge Durango RT after corresponding with Aaron thru email.  Aaron treated us like we were second grade customers and made several remarks that TRUMP is to blame for interest rates.  Even though I had told him that our credit was good.  He was very argumentative and even had a yelling match with my husband.   I have previously bought 3 vehicles from them with no problems.   I hate that one employee can change my view of this dealership but he was very unprofessional for an Internet salesman.,2.4

20,"January 03, 2019","New Car Sales personnel are very aggressive and will say ""anything"" regarding pricing and vehicle availability to get you to the dealership.  Once there you'll find that the pricing differs as they add addendum pricing in the form of a ""Protective Package"" that consists of a GPS service and window marking that's intended to mimic a Lo/jack device in the event the vehicle is stolen at a price of $1998.00  (supposedly it offers a significant Insurance discount, but the ""actual"" discount is very minimal as it only applies to your comprehensive policy).  This $2K package also includes window tinting and some plastic door guards which only account for about $300 of the actual value.  Good luck in trying to negotiate with their Sales Team in trying to reduce this Dealership Profit sticker item.  Vehicle trade values are notoriously below wholesale values as well.  Be prepared to spend much more than you would at a competing dealer.",1.4

After tinkering with my car for a month they informed me that I needed to pay them $20k for a new engine!  They say my warranty is void because even though I changed the oil every 4k miles or less, I went more than six months at one point.   It's there fault more than it is mine that it went that long.  I discovered that they changed the oil four months before I bought the car.

28,"July 17, 2018","I was currently in the process of purchasing a Dodge Charger but due to the high monthly car note amount, my trustee lawyer denied the motion of acquire debt. So I informed the financial individual ""AG"" at the (Grapevine, TX 76051) regarding the issue and requested my money and car back because it was void without approval. I have called him and he has not answered and refused my calls which therefore I had to go to the dealership on multiple occasions. I have continuously questioned him about my money and car and finall on my last visit to the dealership he slipped up and said,  ""My car went to the auction! He has to call the auction!"" I explained to him the dealer wasn't confirmed why would my car be at the auction and that's why he's not communicating back to me. Mean while I still have no choice but to drive the charge due to his negligence. In addition I had to keep requestion dealer license tags 3 times because he didnt have my Nissan. Now they are trying to keep my money for mileage absolutely absurd! He attended to change the paperwork amount and that is wrongful, indicates what I'm saying is false but I have documentation of this whole fiasco. I have been asking for my car and driving around in this charger due to no choice. Last week I sent AG another email about my Nissan and he was out of the office which his coworker Kelp received the email. So now that some one else knows about this situation he' is trying to cover up his misconduct. Now as I sent a email on July 12, 2018 when he was out of the office I received a call less than 5 minutes of sending the email that all of the sudden the dealership has my Nissan which I don't believe. So if someone else would not have received my email I would have still been driving around in this charger because I still don't as of today, have my money and Nissan which I'm kindly waiting on. He has threated me that the charger will be picked up but I have been missing work & school to fix his wrong doing, disrespectfulness and lack of communication. I call on 7/15/2018 and requested a supervisor after speaking when him and he hang up the phone on me. This is just utterly ridiculous! So today I have missed my class & work to handle this issue. The only two things I want from this disastrous situation is my money and Nissan car.",1.0

Needless to say we didn't agree on numbers so I left, and purchased a vehicle at another dealership. Two days later I am notified by my credit service that my credit was pulled by Grapevine DCJ.

34,"December 21, 2017","I regrettably purchased a certified pre-owned Dodge Durango from Grapevine Chrysler Dodge Jeep. This dealer uses intentionally deceptive sales practices. They don't even deserve 1 star. They force you to purchase APEX Theft, Paintless Dent Repair (PDR), and Paint & Interior Protection Plans.  Walk away and go to another dealership that doesn't require you to purchase the APEX plans, you will save yourself at least $1,200 and tons of aggravation.  The APEX warranty description they give you when they sell it, IS NOT what you get. When you take it into the dealership to utilize any of those services, the service group tells you that none of the items that need to be fixed are covered under those plans. Additionally, the finance office does not keep it's word.  They will tell you that all oil changes and tire rotations are covered under the Essential Care Gold plan, but then they enter it into the system as a limited number of oil changes and no tire rotations.  These guys are the ultimate shysters. Maybe a class-action lawsuit against this dealership will cause them to change their ways. And shame on the guy who sold me the car that stated I had to buy the APEX plan, which is not true - I thought because you were ex-military (or were you ever in the military) that you were a decent guy - not the case.

This is my response to the owner and an update on our experience with your dealership. We were told the APEX Plan was already included and hardware was installed in the vehicle so if we wanted the vehicle we needed to pay for the plan. If this isn't your policy as the owner then perhaps you should communicate this to your sales staff. We were able to cancel the APEX plan after the fact and received a full refund.  

Since then our airbag light went on and we brought the vehicle into Grapevine for service. Since it is a Certified Pre Owned vehicle it is covered under warranty. The issue was a shredded wire under the front passenger seat which your service department said wasn't covered under warranty. Your service records indicated that you had serviced the front passenger seat but your claim is you didn't shred the wire. We've done nothing to any of the seats except sit on them. We brought the vehicle to Huffines Lewisville who is excellent in comparison BTW and they told us not only were the wires shredded but the seat had been super glued together. Unfortunately they were not able to do anything about the poor workmanship that was obviously done under your watch. Your service department continues to decline rectification on this issue so I've escalated the issue to FCA which also provided excellent service. We've got a case number and they're taking care of it. 

Most recently our check engine light came on. I took the vehicle to Grapevine again and decided to give you one more chance to prove yourself. I was told they could do nothing about my airbag and front passenger seat issue and it would be tomorrow or Saturday before they could even diagnose my issue. So I went back to Huffines stepped out of the vehicle they plugged a diagnostic device in immediately and asked me to come to the service advisers desk. Within 5 minutes he told me I had a slight vacuum leak that wouldn't effect the operation of the vehicle but they would get it fixed under warranty for my trip tomorrow anyway. They also called me an Uber to get home. 

In short I stand by earlier comments with even further evidence your organization is unethical and provides poor service. I advise the public to avoid doing business with Grapevine. Consumers have choices and right now I'd rather drive the extra 10 minutes then set foot in your dealership again. 

I would like to add further we're a Dodge/Chrysler house and will continue to be. We own three FCA vehicles now. All with exception of our new Durango have proven to be great reliable vehicles over a long period of time. In fairness the issues we've experienced with our Durango seem to stem from dishonesty and poor workmanship from the Grapevine Dealership.

43,"November 30, 2017",I have worked with Mr Thomas H Whitehead before at another dealership to get my mother a car. This man is truly amazing when it comes to priorities and details. So this time my grandfather wanted a Jeep Wrangler Unlimited fully loaded. He picked out the most expensive one on the lot I tried to talk him out of it but that's just what he wanted. I spoke with Mr. Whitehead in private about talking him down. Most sales people would have taken advantage but Mr Whitehead understood our concerns and fully explain to my grandfather why that jeep was not the best fit for him but  one with exactly everything he wanted was on the lot with a little less lift and still had the big wheels that he liked. Mr. Whitehead explain to him that just because it looks good doesn't mean it's good for you. Long story short the lift was too high for our comfort zone with my grandfather and we were in fear of him hurting himself climbing in and out of it. Mr. Whitehead understood this from the beginning and already had keys to the other Jeep with a slight less lift but everything else that my grandfather was wanting. Thank you Mr Whitehead .

50,"August 16, 2017","This is a copy if the email sent to the General Manager on Friday, August 11th. I've still heard nothing. My former loan remains unpaid nearly a month after the transaction. 



Good evening, 


I am forwarding this information to you, because I feel that you should be made aware of the poor customer service, inefficiency, and overall lack of integrity displayed by your dealership during my experience. 


On July 25th, I traded in my Jeep Grand Cherokee in order to lease the 2017 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited. At that time, I did undergo a bit of nonsense haggling with Ryan Hale, per his finance manager, but after establishing the fact that I had done my homework, and would require a reasonable deal in order to gain my business, the overall transaction went smoothly. Trey had us return the following day to complete the paperwork needed. I informed him that my payment to Capital One was due on the Grand Cherokee and asked if I should pay it. He said the 10 day payoff should post within a few days and not to worry. 


I assumed everything was fine. However, my husband got a call yesterday, August 10th, requesting a copy of my drivers license to be emailed to Andrew Trakas for completion of paperwork, so that the loan could be paid. 


I became alarmed, as this should have been completed weeks ago. I immediately sent the information as well as a  request to be updated on the status. My husband called and left a message requesting as much that afternoon. 


We did not get a response. 


This morning I sent a second email requesting an update and explanation for why they were just now asking for information needed to do paperwork. No reply. 


I called three times today. My last message was to inform them that I was now pursuing action and explanation beyond the dealership, and would continue to file complaints until I had heard from someone with at least an update. 


I immediately called the Jeep Corporation. The customer service representative collected and verified my information. She filed a complaint against Grapevine Jeep and notified you of such, via phone call. I then filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau as well. 


After doing this, I called the dealership one last time to get your email address to notify you of the issue. Taurus intervened, finally. Unfortunately, he lacked the integrity necessary to be honest about the obvious oversight, and immediately justified their extended time line, placed responsibility on the finance company, and discussed issues with other salesmen while I was explaining the situation to him. He was not in any way equipped to deal with me, and it was painfully obvious. When asked why it took 16 days to request my drivers license, he simply said that Andrew Trakas must have just needed it to wrap things up. It seems to me, as well as a different dealership, and Jeep Corporation, that someone dropped the ball on this. The unwillingness to return phone calls and emails demonstrates poor customer service, while the initial attempt to be dishonest during the sale and willingness to place blame on others, shows a lack of integrity. 


At this point, I believe, and hope that the issue has been handled. Taurus explained that my finance company finally funded this yesterday and the payment would post to Capital One on Tuesday. 


In the meantime, know that the case number for the complaint with Jeep corporation, against your dealership is ######### while the BBC case number is ########.


All of this could have been avoided by:


1. Collecting all documents at the time of signing. 


2. Starting the process in a timely manner. 


3. Returning a call or email within a reasonable time frame. 


4. Accepting responsibility for mistakes.


5. Listening intently when addressing the issue. 


Needless to say, I will remain a Jeep customer, but not with your dealership. I will also be active in discouraging people I know from doing business with your dealership as well. 


I am sending this information to you as a courtesy as I believe it is something that you would want to know. I hope I am correct in this assumption, but at this point, I doubt the values of Grapevine Jeep. 


Sincerely, 


Becky Bragg

51,"August 09, 2017","I bought  a Dodge Challenger 2017. They called my son Wednesday evening saying that they had accepted our offer for 72 months , and a certain amount for the monthly payments ( they also said they would pay the rest of my current car) So i was like great, Ill stop by Thursday afternoon to finalize the deal. I signed and went on vacation . When I came back from vacation the finance was not even approved they falsified my bank statement I guess to get an approval. All my personal documents has been lost so i had to re-send them all. all document had been sent over 3 times  and they kept losing employees so my personal documents  ended up who knows were. So after 1 month of going back and fourth I said take the car back we do not want it.  this has been the worse experience on a new car for my son's graduation  present. Something that was suppose to be simple ended up as a headache on top of that during that month we started to have issues with a new car. So My son was like I do not want the car anymore so on returning the car. they convinced my son on the same car as well with more upgrades and a less of a car payment so he went with it. Still waiting on the paper work to still get financed we said we would sign if they added one more upgraded and  the finances guy agreed. So again we started to have issues with the car we took it in for service  4 week later and the service dept. could not work on it since it was not financed when we clearly had a contract in our hands  and we had just received the plates 1 days ago. Now the car has issues all the excuses they can not work on it. etc..............If  you like Dodge I would try another location this has been the most frustrating experience ever.

We have bought many cars over the last 30 years and have never been treated like this. Long story, but after lies and mistakes we were left with a deal we were ok with, but finance was closed. We didn't sign anything, but took their car and left ours and told them we would come back on Monday after work. We got there at 6, and the receptionist removed her ear buds long enough to acknowledge us. TWO HOURS later, we were told the lease guy had left for the day but they could give us a good purchase deal. We said we would listen, and it was like starting negotiations all over again.We left with the agreement that the lease guy would call us the next day. After 5, we called them. They couldn't talk but assured us they would call in 45 minutes. No call. My wife took the car back at opening next day and asked for our car back (which was already listed on the used car sight). It took 2 hours for them to find it and only after threatening to call the police did they produce it. When they did bring our car to her, THE TAGS HAD BEEN TAKEN OFF AND SHREDDED!

Tijuan was one of the people I spoke with on the phone. I explained that my credit wasn't in good shape. So I didn't want to shop for a new vehicle. He said don't worry about the details I'll take care of that. Went to the dealership Saturday. Met with two different sales people. Tijuan didn't show up until the middle of the deal. Right off the bat he says I need your wife to come in for the approval. I told him I didn't want to have my wife on this loan. Kept arguing that he only needed her income. That there is already an approval they just need to verify the income. I go and pick up my wife. They have her fill out an application. They said I would know Monday since the banks are closed. They said we'll call you at eleven o'clock? Monday. About 10:45 one of the customer service reps calls and asks why we couldn't strike a deal. I explained that I was still waiting for a call. She stated that she would have someone call me. Again they were suppose to call me. 12:30 rolls around. No call back. Texted one of the sales people I was dealing with. He said he would find out. 1:30 rolls around no call back. I decide to call the finance manager. He said he will find out what the hold up is. 2:30 rolls around still no call. Text the sales person again. He says it pending. Again I was told by Tijuan that the deal was approved. Now it's pending?? The sales person texts me back at 3:15 to tell me the deal wasn't approved. Again I was told everything was approved. So I wasted 2 hours for nothing. I bought one car from this dealership. Never again. Not recommend this place for anyone.  ,1.3
55,"May 17, 2017","** Useful information first **  If you plan on buying Mopar Lifetime warranty, google ""mopar lifetime warraty"".  There will be at least 3 legitimate website that will give you a quote online.  They will be roughly $1000 cheaper than what these guys offer.  Arm yourself with a knowledge before facing the battle.

Also, make sure your agreed terms are in the paperwork.  I cannot STRESS this enough.  They will try to cheat you if they smell you may be gullible.  If you want to know why I came to that conclusion, read on.

My wife bought a jeep wrangler while I was out of town, and since she was not good at negotiating, I dealt with them over the phone.  A guy named Andrew in Finance agreed to sell me $0 deductible lifetime warranty for $3500.  Upon arriving home, I noticed they did not give her a copy of the warranty contract, and that got me suspicious of a foul play.  I went online and retrieved her warranty on Mopar website, and sure enough, it stated her warranty was $100 deductible plan, which costs $1800 less than $0 deductible plan($2965 vs $4795).  I went to face them, and they had to cut me a check for $500 when I told them I am cancelling warranty (difference for what they were supposed to charge in the first place, not a penny more).  I demanded apology from Andrew for the deception, but the guy kept claiming it was a confusion or miscommunication, never really admit his wrongdoing.  The management got irritated and even hostile when I tried to clarify what really happened.  They don't seem to treat this fraudulent activity seriously, which suggests this may be a common practice for them.

One last thing, the trade-in they give you will be lower than the competition.  They tried to give my wife $10500 for her 2014 Murano.  They had to match the price when I told them the other dealer appraised it at $14000, a whopping $3500 difference.  Now they are selling it at $16991.  The starting price they appraise seems few thousand dollars less, so know your trade-in value at KBB, Edmunds, NADA before the negotiation.

Overall, this dealer was unpleasant, dishonest and highly risky.  I recommend driving few more miles to any of 4 other dealers in DFW area.",1.0

Called the same guy, he gave me a tow truck number that would've charged me instead of them. Called the manager and he gave me the right number and more info that I needed about everything. Also I have big tires so I have wheel locks on my car. The key for the lock were in my cup holder. Got the car back and no lock is in sight.

Explained that I needed an oil change, and a tire rotation. She stated she would get a service advisor to help. I saw one service advisor with a customer, and one talking with one of the mechanics, and laughing. I waited outside for ten minutes with no one helping. I see the advisor that was laughing with one of the mechanics got up, and left. I proceeded inside. I ask the service desk if I could get some help. The advisor that was cutting up with his buddy said he as the only advisor here, and was busy. I then stated fine I will go to AutoNation to get my service done. Which were friendly and took care of me. I did complain to the general manager. Which had the service manger contact me. He did say that this is not how they conduct business, and to speak with him when I need help. Now to present day. I'm having issues with my stereo, and speakers. I called the service center today to schedule and appointment. A lady picked up the phone, and I proceeded to explain the problem. I asked if they have a loaner car program. She said yes, but the technician would have to diagnose the problem then they could give me a loaner vehicle. But the vehicle would have to dropped off Monday, through Thursday 7am to 10am. Looked at then everything could go through. So I work a normal job. I have to take off of work to drop my car off for warranty work? That makes no sense to me.

64,"January 08, 2017","Grapevine Chrysler Jeep Dodge - Absolute crooks!  

I spent 3 hours negotiating a deal. After endless back and forth, we finally agreed on a deal which was $7,000 better than what they originally offered.  As we were going through that process, they tried to tell me I was saving $3,000 because I was only paying taxes on the difference between trade truck and new truck and not the full purchase price of the new one. Saving me money?  That is Texas state law. 

To put their stupidity into perspective, they understood that I was a 20 year banker (With experience in auto lending), I've purchased 4 $70,000 + vehicles in the last year and probably 30 over all. I'm not a novice. I mostly negotiate deals by phone and spend no more than 45 minutes at a dealer. 

Following that, it took more than an hour to get to finance and close the deal. The F/I manager was a decent guy, but initially tried to sell me a rate that was far more than a rate for which I qualify - almost 2% higher than what I'm currently paying. I had some back and forth with him and we got to the same rate I'm paying.  This had more to do with misinformation provided by the sales team than him. 

Next, we start reviewing the calculations. They apparently charge you $900 to walk from the showroom to the finance office.  The purchase price increased by $900 from what we agreed to which was also the price advertised on their website and cars.com. The additional charge was ""dealer adds"", one of which was a bed liner which the truck did not have. They could not tell me what ""adds"" were added and this wasn't disclosed to me until I was close to signing the note.  The Sales Manager came into the office to try to convince me that the dealer adds had value (again - adds that they couldn't itemize) and also to find discounts offered by the manufacturer  that they could apply to the inflated price to get me the price THEY ADVERTISED WITH NO DISCLAIMER!!!  

At this point, it was a matter of principle. I told him I wasn't paying 1 cent more than their advertised price and asked him to give me a yes or no answer if he was going to do the deal. He said no and I promptly left. 

These guys are incredibly dishonest and try to squeeze you for every dime. You must be a very shrewd negotiator, experienced buyer and disciplined to stand a chance of not getting screwed.

68,"November 04, 2016","23rd of August I purchased a pre-owned certified Dodge Durango at this dealership. The price advertised on their website was competitive and after some discussions and two visits at the dealership (test drive, etc), I agreed to pay the advertised price + it was agreed a tow bar would be installed at no additional cost. 

The sales person was friendly enough, but during the entire process the dealership applied those typical annoying techniques of trying to get some extra dollars. (At first they ""by mistake"" showed a price much higher than at the web site, etc.)

Anyways, I was under a time constraint and needed to complete the purchase. I had been at dealership for hours and was getting tired. 

At the final step, at the finance dept, I made a big mistake. I was not paying enough attention. I assumed I was in safe hands in an established dealership, but unfortunately that was not the case.

A total of $2689 was added to the bill last minute! I didn’t pay attention, I just paid the total amount (plus tax of course). $1197 was added to the price for some APEX GPS I didn’t ask for. $895 was added for “certification” and another 3*199 for some added warranties. 

Until this day I have received no information about what I paid these added $2689 for and what value it brings me. No documentation came with the car and none has been provided to me despite several requests. No money has been refunded. As a result, the value for me is zero.

I paid an added $2689 for absolutely nothing. I feel taken advantage of, ripped off and I am surprised how this could happen. 

Be very careful if you are going to make business with Grapevine Dodge.

69,"October 30, 2016","I went to this dealership with an advertisement that says they are willing to pay 120% of my NADA trade value. Knowing what they want for the vehicle on the lot, and how much my trade is worth, I go to the dealer. I drive the truck I wanted, and then they balusters my trade in. 

They offered me $4000 LESS than it's worth, instead of the 120% in the ad, and my truck is in immaculate condition. 

So, with that valuation being so low, it made about a $10k difference in the numbers making the deal undoable. 

Shady tactics to bring you in and get your hopes up based on that is why I'm giving them a bad review. Be warned going here.",1.6

71,"October 27, 2016","                 Had made an appointment about two weeks ahead by telephone.     Was told the service would take about two hours to accomplish and that they could provide me transportation to and from the dealership if I didn’t want to wait.          My 08:30 Arrival was ok, good signage to the service area, however the entry drive had two orange cones set up with no obvious purpose.   Confusing.   I thought, am I to park near the cones?   stay away from cones?  weird.    Entrance to the building was slightly more confusing as the drop area is lined with 1/2 dozen clear windowed doors for offices of service coordinators.    Since most were empty, I took what felt like a shortcut to an open area with a receptionist.   I introduced myself and told her why I was there.    She asked me which person was handling my appointment and I said, ""hmm, I just got here.  I made the appointment with Patty on the phone"".   She said ""oh, Patty is just a scheduler.  Let me find someone"".     I was then introduced to Christy who wrote up a ticket, took my keys, set me up with a ride and said she'd call when my service was finished.      The courtesy ride back to the office was great.    Courteous, knowledgeable and safe driver. 
About 4PM, I started to be concerned about not hearing from anyone.   I was stuck at the office and was counting on the courtesy ride back.      I pulled up  the Grapevine Dodge website and the service phone number was clearly visible.    While unlocking my phone I suddenly get a pop up on the screen asking if I wanted a live chat with a girl who wanted to help me.     I stared typing in my question only to have the screen disappear and the chat end abruptly.    I guess I was too slow.     I got a second request, this time from “Antonio” wanting to know if he could help.    This time I typed my information, including my vehicle info and name on a separate file and pasted it into to chat box.    No more timing out! 
Antonio said “thanks” and asked my name which clearly informed me that he didn’t read my message.   I gave him my name again.    He then provided the service department phone number (the same number staring at me on the middle of the web page).   More time wasted.    No way this could have been a live chat with a real person although it made it appear that way.         
I then phoned the number, and after 17 rings a guy picks up.  I explain my situation.   He puts me on hold.  Upon returning, he says that I must speak with Christy about the vehicle and that she is with another customer right now.    He said she will call me when she is finished. 
After about 50 minutes, still no word from anyone, I decided I better just go there.   Obviously things are not going smoothly. I don’t have a vehicle, so I Uber to the service department and make an inquiry with the original receptionist.    She doesn’t have my paperwork but says I need to wait for Christy.     Well, Christy’s office is right there and she’s with a customer.    She looks very busy and has about ½ dozen service tickets on her desk.  I assume one of them is mine.    I proceed to wait about 20 minutes for Christy.  All the time observing guys walking in and out of offices, gathering for conversations, a few grabbed some items and headed out the door.      Nobody asked why I was there, if I had been helped.   One gave me a quick courtesy “how ya doin” while striding past.    It was clear that one person was taking the bulk of the load that afternoon.     Yes, Christy.  My Christy.    
When Christy got to me she apologized.   After a quick check on her computer she said she’d have to go to the shop and would be right back.   When she returned she reported that they hadn’t started on my vehicle but that they could get on it right away and be finished in a ½ hour.     I was so happy that they hadn’t touched it.     Based on the organization I was seeing at top, no way I wanted added exposure to the shop floor.     I told Christy to have the vehicle brought up, I would be just fine with this ending.     
In the end, Christy was good.   She worked hard to apologize for the dealership and its faults.    There is clearly a management or culture problem effecting this organization.    At least, on the service side.    I am glad it only cost me $12 for the Uber ride to save myself from future exposure to Grapevine Dodge.

They pulled a bait and switch on me with paperwork.  Be very leery of the numbers typed in especially on final documents.  The only reason I went over to the dealership was because the car I wanted was advertised close to my budget. Every negotiation we did, they had me sign off on with the final paper saying ""I will buy if you can make these numbers happen"".  I thought it was a fair price for the vehicle and for my trade in.  They came back in with one more piece of paper and asked me to sign off on it.  The number was different and I asked the specific question ""is this all in and include tax, title, and license?"" as I had already calculated the numbers and it was about right for the additional amount.  Salesman (Adrian) replied ""yes"", so I signed off.  We walked over to the finance office and I looked at the numbers, but I should have pulled out my calculator and specifically went over every single number.  They changed the ""sale price"" to the number I had questioned above (which was above even the advertised price that I came in for), added on top of it $1197 for pdr, dent, and theft (which I was never told was an additional cost), and added the tax, title, and license on top of that. I did purchase an extended warranty and that was listed out separately, but I didn't receive the registration page for this.  I would have never noticed these changes until I pulled out my paperwork ONCE HOME and started crunching the numbers backwards.  The numbers listed on the contract are not straight forward.  I met with the finance guy (Scott) today, 3/17/16, and he acknowledged that there was a discrepancy, but he couldn't do anything about it until he discussed it with the sales manager (Lloyd) which he could not do until the next morning.  I'm wondering how many other people have fell prey to this as I don't think most people go home and work out the numbers.  I see others on here that have.  RIDICULOUS that a dealership can still do this. These guys live up to the car dealership stigma where I should have watched and taken a picture of every single number and piece of paper or recorded every conversation.

The sales person I worked with was excellent and tried to do everything possible to make the deal. The SALES MANAGER on the other hand made sure that I did not walk away with a truck. The experience was so awful!!

I was looking at a certain truck and was working on the price. From the beginning I gave them my payoff for my lease. They gave me a pretty good deal but after driving the truck around town for a couple hours, I realized the truck was a demo (it had 2500 miles on it).  We had already worked out a price prior to my extend test drive but after noticing the miles, I wanted more off the sticker. 

I came back with the truck, tried to make a better deal and the sales manager increased the price! How does that work!
-He didn't have the correct payoff entered which I gave them from the beginning. 
-He said since it was a lease I didn't get a certain rebate which I told them it was a lease from the beginning. 
-He increased my taxes paid due to it being a lease.

I walked out furious and left the dealership saying I wouldn't be back no reason to call. Sure enough about 5 min later the sales manger calls. I was still upset, told him why I was upset. He tried to over talk me while I was explaining the situation, got angry and hung up on me while yelling ""Good luck to you!!!""  Really?  You are the manager? The one that is suppose to be the professional boss?  Sure bud..  Well good luck to you and the dealership...

171,"July 07, 2015","My wife and I went to this dealership this past weekend (3rd of July) for a used vehicle. When it came to the price and everything, my wife told them she already had financing through a Credit Union at a really low rate, to which the salesman (Stewart) asked to give them a chance to match it/get close and they would be sure to get us a good deal. 

We told them where we wanted to be for monthly payments and the first ""deal"" didn't come even close (they lowballed our trade in). In addition they have a mandatory ""Dealer Accessories"" add-on for $1197 something called Apex that's some kind of GPS/Tracking/Recovery system he boasted is for Android and will soon be for iPhones too (we told him it's useless because my wife has a Windows phone). 

My wife asked what the interest rate was because it wasn't on the sheet they printed out and Stewart said he didn't know but he could find out. He had us sign a sheet to agree that we want to try and make a deal and left the office. When he came back, he gave us more for the trade in but the numbers still weren't good enough. Again my wife asked what the interest rate was and Stewart said he can find out and left the room to talk to his ""boss"". He came back with a ""deal"" that extended the payments from 60 months to 66 months. 

Again my wife asked what the interest rate was and he began questioning why we are worried about a few more payments because we are getting a great deal (they ""increased"" the trade in value). I finally stepped in and said she wants to know the interest rate why won't you just answer the question. He still wouldn't answer (a clear sign they don't want you to know) and asked she sign a paper indicating we would agree to $xxx/month for 66 months. She instead signed and wrote ""I want to know the interest rate thank you"".

While he was out of the office I googled a website on my phone on how to figure out the interest rate and came up with 18%. Stewart came back from talking to his ""boss"" and said he won't divulge that information unless we sign the paper; at this point everything broke down and we ended all negotiations. He started complaining we were hung up on the additional 6 months and we were being ridiculous. 

As we were leaving i took a picture of the price portion of the first ""deal"" and upon doing the math they charged the Accessory Fee of $1197 twice!!!! (that's $2494 extra)

The story doesn't end here. After we left, Stewart began texting my wife over the course of the weekend until I told him to stop on Monday and that their conduct was unprofessional and shady.

Avoid this place like the plague. If they don't want to divulge information you are entitled to, they are hiding something (he admitted in a text message that the interest rate was about quadruple what she was going to get through her credit union). No add-ons should be forced.",1.5
172,"May 22, 2015"," First it was my own fought for not walking out of the deal when the Jeep showed up with an aftermarket top and not reading the bill of sale and other documents closely. Reference the top I asked myself after seeing it if I would have gone ahead with the deal had the salesman been upfront and honest about it. The answer was yes but definitely felt slighted.  I am 56 years old and have bought allot of cars and numerous houses, years ago was nervous and double checked everything. Should have maintained that vigilance but lost it somewhere along the way, probably because most people are honest and have integrity. Unfortunately the finance person, Mr. Zimmerman I believe, reminded me there are still scam artist and unethical peope in the business. NO WHERE during the purchase did anyone mention ""Blue Steel"" or what ever you call it, nor did anyone mention any protection plan, other than the extended service plan and oil change program. Upon reviewing the documents the next day I found three charges of $399 added in. I called and spoke to Kirk W, after much ado he gave $600 of the $1197 back. Mr. Zimmerman is a very good shyster, with his story of heading to his sons baseball game as soon as we were done, quickly grabbing papers as soon as I signed, pointing to where I needed to sign while I tried  to look over docs. Yes, its my fought, just couldn't believe someone like that would work in a reputable dealership. According to the signs it was all recorded, take a look. At least it will not happen again.",1.8

177,"March 01, 2015","My wife and I visited the dealership this weekend looking for a used truck. We found two trucks that interested us online at this dealership and made the drive to see them. One of the trucks was exactly what we wanted and we were ready to make the deal. 

I was already on my iPhone completing a financing application with my bank when our sales person walked back into the office with the ""deal."" It seems the manager was nice enough to INCREASE the price of the truck by about $2,000. We were told it was some ""Blue Shield Protection"" that had been added to the truck. An extra clear coating on the truck to help protect it........

The truck was advertised at a certain price, but when the salesman presented us the numbers, that price had gone up. When I complained about that, I was told that the fine print on the website pricing states that dealer added options may increase the price. I went back to the website and read it thoroughly, nothing about dealer added options changing the price. It did say this ""We promise a no-hassle, no-haggle experience."" Yea - right!  

I needed to stay under $500 / month in payments and the ""new deal"" I was offered was $675 / month, and I had to include a downpayment to get that rate.  I got upset and we started to walk out. Our salesman returned to the managers office and came back with a ""deal"" that took it down closer to about $600 / month. We walked out of the sales office and headed for the car. 

Our sales guy followed us out to the parking lot and asked for us to give him another chance. I told him that he already knew what we needed to get the deal done with us. We sat in our car while he went back to the manager and then returned with another unacceptable deal. Seriously, if I paid the advertised (online, and actually posted on the car) price, paid cash for TTL, then I would have been at $500 / month already. 

When we arrived home, a good 30 miles later, there was a message on our voice mail from the salesman. He thanked us for coming in and then said he really wanted to make the sale. He asked if I could call him back and let him know what it would take for us to purchase that truck. I did call him back and apologized for our exit as I was getting pretty upset. I told him that he already knew the deal we needed, and he said ""let me talk to my manager and then call you right back.""

You are not gonna believe this ..... When he called me back the deal was at $515 / month with no money down. It seems that the truck actually hadn't had the ""Blue Shield Protection"" installed after all. Surprise, surprise. 

After we got home, I began checking out the reviews about this dealership's practices. So many people have had the exact same experience we did - the price changes all of a sudden from the advertised price. I really don't understand why Chrysler doesn't do something about this. ",1.4
178,"January 16, 2015","This was my second purchase from Grapevine Dodge.  I bought a 2014 Dodge Charger R/T and traded in a 2014 Dodge Challenger Redline.  I have to say thanks to Allen in the finance office who was the only finance manager that was able to get a deal financed.  The finance managers at Holt, Allen Samuels and Moritz were useless.  The interest rate was even better than I was expecting.  I have only had limited experience with the service department but it has always been positive.  

Here is where they fell a little short.  They offered me the lowest trade in value of any dealer I shopped including Chevy and I purchased the car from them less than a year ago.  They add a $1,300 plus protection package to every vehicle of dubious products and its mostly dealer markup, so be prepared for a hard negotiation.  

In the end they did get me the car I wanted at the monthly payment I wanted so I would recommend them especially if you have a low FICO score.  If they really want a five star rating from Chrysler they need to tweek their sales practices slightly.  Do yourself a favor and stay away from Holt!  pure slime",4.0

180,"December 31, 2014","My title is the tip of my iceberg of complaints about this dealership. 

I went in for one specific car they had listed and was never shown it. Instead the sales rep took it upon himself to decide what I wanted in a car - and made some piss poor choices in models at that. He never once took into consideration the details I told him I was looking for in a vehicle. So for wasting my time and insulting me I LET him show me the ins and outs of every single vehicle he brought out to show. When he ran out of vehicles I walked away. 

He asked why, and I simply stated ""Out of all the cars you showed me today- the one vehicle I requested was NOT in the line up."" He back tracked trying to save face by stating that the vehicle was no longer available so he wanted to show me his other inventory. (WHY DID HE NOT TELL ME THAT WHEN I ORIGINALLY ASKED??)

Infuriated I got in my car and drove away. Still wishing for the vehicle I had my eye on, I decided I would check online to see if the vehicle was still listed.- IT WAS! I used the online chat to inquire if it indeed was still available and on the lot. The online rep confirmed that IT WAS!

By now I'm ready to flip my desk over. I pose as my fiance and give them her contact info for a sales rep to contact us.

Lloyd Yancy the Pre-Owned Sales Manager contacted her asking her for the info on the vehicle she was interested in because he ""lost it."" She responded with the specifics. ... Its been 3 days and she has sent 3 follow up emails and has revieved NO CONTACT. No, ""Let me double check my inventory for that vehicle and I'll get back to you"" response or phone call. 

All in all the WORST experience and most unprofessional, unsympathetic staff I've run into.

P.S.- To elaborate on my title... When I arrived,  that is exactly what I heard the closing finance rep say to another employee as the door was closing as I entered the dealership. Like I said piss poor staff

I was told that I can pay $400 to fix the CV axles.  When it comes to  being stuck in park they want me to tow it up there on my own expense and charge for looking into and fix it. I talked to the Manager and explained the situation but him and the service center keeps passing me around and ml not trying to resolve this issue.  I rate them a zero if I could! ,1.0
182,"September 16, 2014","I received a mailer from Grapevine DCJ with several offers, among them was 0% for 72 months as well as $4000 down payment assistance (the 0% offer required a max LTV of 90% and a minimum credit score of 720, but both offers were good to be used together. If I used the $4k down payment voucher, I couldn't take advantage of any other rebates). I was looking for a brand new Grand Cherokee V6 4x4 with a sunroof. They didn't have the car there and I was told it would be at the lot on Monday (I went out there on a Friday evening). When it came down to numbers, I was told I needed $7800 and change to be eligible for the 0% offer for 72 months. But since I was about $1k short of that mark, they offered me 3.9% which I refused due to my 790 + credit score. Then they offered me 3.5% which I refused as well. As I was leaving the dealership way past 11 PM, the finance director came out and told me that he'll work on the deal over the weekend. The salesman called on Monday and left me a voicemail saying ""boss says you win."" I called him back and the offer was 2.9% which I refused as well. I visited their website and noticed that they were offering $6100 off MSRP on 2014 Grand Cherokees. I informed the salesman about this and how the $6100 off MSRP will make me eligible for the 0% for 72 months, since that’ll put me at around $8200, an amount that includes my net trade. He told me he would talk to the manager and call me back but he never did. I decided to reach out to the internet manager who emailed me back and told me the car I was looking at had already sold. First of all, I was looking for a brand new car with rather standard features at a dealership that sells these cars. I asked her about that and she said they can't give the car away. I stated that the $6100 off MSRP and 0% offers were good together since there was nothing on the website or on the voucher that said I couldn't combine those two offers. I realize that if I use the $6100 off MSRP I wouldn't be able to use the $4000 down payment voucher, per the fine print. But the 0% and the $6100 were valid together due to the fine print not saying otherwise and due to the fact that the dealership was previously ok with using $4k and 0% together. The only reason I went to the dealership in the first place was because of the mailer. My frustration is that they won't give me the deal I qualify for but would rather give me a higher interest rate, which is completely wrong. One of the many ways dealerships make money is based on the interest rate a client accepts. Banks will offer a rate to the dealership along with a rate cap. This means a bank can offer 1% with a 3 point max, which means the dealership can turn around and charge up to 4% and guess who gets to keep that 3%. This dealership gave me a printout that listed $995 – destination charge – as part of the price of the vehicle. However, the bill of sale had a $500 fee on it with no explanation. When I asked about that $500, I was told it’s a fee the dealership charges “to locate a vehicle.” Even though I got them to waive that unnecessary fee, I ended up not buying from them since they will not offer the deal I qualify for 150%. Please be careful when doing business with these guys as they’re guilty of fee packing, rate hiking and many other shady practices.",1.8
183,"September 01, 2014"," unless you like being held hostage for two hours as they attempt to trick you into horrible finances. Most UNETHICAL UNPROFESSIONAL experience I have ever was had with Used Sales ""Manager"" (If he even really is one. Website says differently.) Adrian Garcia.
 I was helped initially by a salesman named Nick. I was interested in trading in my Chevy Malibu for a 2013 Dodge Charger R/T. We did the test drive, I loved it, and it was in my price range. He took my keys to have my Malibu appraised and came back with an initial finance offer of 6.9% over 72 months. I told him what I was paying on my Malibu and that based on my credit score I should qualify for a lower APR. He said he would ""Go fight for me."" He returned with his ""manager"" Adrian who promptly offers me a lower payment. ""Great"", I thought. However, when I asked him what APR that it was based on, he told me 5.9% for 84 months. Yes, you read that right, EIGHTY FOUR MONTHS. I told him the price was great but I knew my bank would offer me a much lower APR so I would go see my banker and comeback on Tuesday with the financing in place.
Adrian kept leaving to ""see what he could do.""  Each time he would give me an offer with a lower APR it had a higher down payment or vice versa and immediately asked for my signature promising to buy the car. This went on for near an hour. Each time, I requested my keys and was IGNORED, as if they had some sort of legal right to keep my property from me. I'm a grown man and I was with my fiance! It was the most degrading experience of my life. I put the numbers into an Amortization on my phone and kept making the point that my total cost of vehicle wasn't changing (It ranged between $45K and $50K, on a $29K car, as if I were some kind of idiot!!! Simply INSULTING)  Adrian several times demanded my debit card or a blank check and wanting me to initial or sign, promising to buy the car. 
Adrian became increasingly frustrated and began speaking very disrespectfully to me in front of my fiance. Finally he comes back with the offer sheet covered in all caps writing in sharpie marker that said ""OK U WIN 60 MOS @ 2.49%"", as if it were I being the jerk to him and not the other way around. As he does I see Nick, my original salesman slip my keys into his pocket. I finally had the correct offer but holding my keys hostage right in front of me was the last straw. I asked for my keys immediately and Adrian shouts at me ""Whatever dude, go see your banker. You win!"", and stormed off. Needless to say, we got the heck out of there.

Somehow throughout the negotiation process, my trade-in value went from $10,000 to $12,500 and the ""Best rate they could get me"" went from 84 mos. at 6.9% to 60 mos. at 2.49%. Ridiculous way to lose a sale, Adrian.

In the meantime they took all our info for financing took the keys to our car that we wanted to trade in and when they finally pulled ""the"" jeep around they were like this is it right? It wasn't even close. It was completely different model. Told me the Jeep we wanted was sold. Again I will say they contacted me. I even emailed them the photo of the Jeep we wanted before we drove all that way. They said yep its available. No it wasn't. They bait people with better looking vehicles then switch it out.

195,"March 29, 2014","Bait Car Tactic
Beware of shady  practice at this dealership. They operate with poor bunsiess practices

My Experience,
Bait car - They posted pre-owned an ad on multiple website at competitive price. When I called to check availability, they confirmed invited. I told em I will be coming from North Dallas, an hour commute. When I got there car was apparently already sold couple day ago. Salesman tried to hustle to sell other car that I wasn’t interested in.

Why Avoid them?
After the incident, I emailed them to share my experience, their director responded, claiming it was actually while I was on my way, a different narrative from what I was told when I was on lot.

It has been over a week since this incident and car ad (Stock# AF014889) is still live on all websites. I called again, just to check, I was pitched the same line.

My 2 cents... be aware of this dealership, poor business practice. I am taking time to share my experience so you can save yourself headaches... look for other dealer with better business practice.

Thank you.

Per our phone conversation on 01/10/2014:
Roy Davis here 2014 Dodge Ram Pick Up Truck

Date: Dec. 13th, 2013 Jeanne Davis called Grapevine Dodge because a pamphlet she received in the mail advertising 2013 vehicles/Pick Up Trucks for sale, with some kind of cash back or discount over $11.000.
On Dec 16, 2013 at 1:18pm Laramie Dunlap called Jeanne s phone and left a message stating
“This is Laramie from Grapevine Dodge acknowledging that this is the end of the year and we are going to be able to have more latitude with pricing and wanted to see what would be a good time for you to come by. My number is 940-597-1442”

On Dec 16, 2013  Laramie called again at 3:09 pm and left another message stating,
“Hi Miss Davis I was directed to call by my managers because Chrysler Fast Start just started and that's a program where we receive a little bit of extra cash from the guys up top and try to make some good deals at the end of the year since we're doing so well. So, if you can call me at any point today or tomorrow, you are going to get the best deal available for a while. Go ahead and give me a call back. My number again is 940-597-1442. Thank you very much, hope to hear from you, goodbye”  

With the advertisement that got my interest and Laramie's phone message stating that Chrysler had some good end of the year deals, I called Laramie back to come in.

December 18, 2013 we (Jeanne & Roy Davis) came in to see what 2013 truck deals they had.
We asked for any trucks for 2013 and Laramie left the office and came back with a 2014 truck. I test drove it.
We asked for 2013 trucks and he said he didn't have anymore left, so he started to set up the paper work on the 2014 truck, but, we told him that we couldn't go any higher in payments of $300.00 since our payment on the Ford Ranger was $285.00 a month. He then kept going back and fourth to his manager  to try to get a reasonable monthly payment. He then came out with a payment/offer for $540.00 and we said “There is no way we can afford that. Maybe the most we could go up to would be $440.00 period”

The next thing we knew we are escorted into the accountant's office with Allen. At that point he started processing the paper work, without us realizing what our monthly payments were going to be or even the amount of the truck or any additional cost or what out trade in would be.
When we asked Allen  what he was doing, he stated “I'm trying to get the best interest rate and even at that time we still had no knowledge of the total cost of the truck or our trade in.
The next thing, we were signing all kinds of paper work and to our negligence we didn't stop to inquire to exactly what we were signing. We were just advised to sign all the documents.

On Dec 19th or 20th I (Roy) received a call from Grapevine Dodge asking how I liked my new truck. I stated I like the truck but, I wasn't impressed with how the deal went. The person who I spoke with said he would get with  a manager and have him call me back.
I never heard back from anyone so on Dec. 20th I called Grapevine Dodge and asked for Laramie and the girl said he was out of the office, can I take a message. I gave her my information but still didn't hear from him. I did get a call from a Chad, and I explained my delima to him and he said he would have someone call me.
I got a call from  Kirk Wilson. I explained my delima to him. He stated “that all transactions in the accountant's office is video recorded and I (Kirk) will view the video an call you back this afternoon.
I never heard back from Mr. Wilson or anyone else.
On Jan 9th 2014 I received a call from a lady at Grapevine Dodge telling me my plates and sticker is in, I told her I will pick them up tomorrow Friday  Jan. 10th.
When I arrived at Grapevine Dodge on Jan 10th I requested to speak to Laramie but he was out to lunch, so I spoke with Chad. He knew of my situation and told me he would get with Laramie. At this point my wife was feeling Ill and I told Chad that I need to run her back home and I will return to speak with Laramie. When I returned and spoke with Laramie, he stated that it was the first that he has heard of my disappointment. Laramie stated he would do everything in his power and speak with his managers to see if we could get an earlier year truck or car (in which I explained I'd rather have a truck) to bring down the cost.
Being my wife (Jeanne) wasn't there Laramie stated that Jeanne had to be here if we did any changes etc. so we made an appointment for Saturday Jan. 11th at 9am.  
Please acknowledge that you received this e-mail. Also I'm going to call you to see if we can get this taken care today as we have an appointment at noon in Dallas on Saturday. Jan 11th.
Thank you

198,"September 11, 2013","Everything about my experience with Grapevine Dodge was fine until I went into Scott Zech's office to complete the financing of my purchase. I was told that as a requirement by the lender I MUST purchase a 100,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty at a cost of $3,500.00 

Originally I wanted to put $0 down. They said that I had to pay $3,500 down or I would not get approved. I later found out from the warranty company that they only charge $900 for the exact same warranty. When I asked to cancel the warranty they said they had to change lenders and my interest rate would shoot up to 18% from 6% and My payment would go up to $800 a month from $600 so I had to keep the deal.

I found out from my lender afterward that it was not true. I again asked to cancel the warranty. After an hour long argument with the dealer they finally had me sign a blank document saying they were going to cancel but my lender would be sent a check not me and it would take 8 weeks. 

I was lied to and robbed by Scott Zech. When I brought it to the attention of the dealer the finance director, Rod Carlson, said that I must have misunderstood. How can you have the same conversation over 3 different days of an hour or so each and there be a misunderstanding?

Once she realized I had scheduled a service I was transferred over to the service department.  I made arrangements [again] for service; however, on arrival they did not have my basic information at hand and had to go through the whole process request again. Brian [the designated rep] was very bright and friendly.  I can not fault Brian for my [bad] experience as I could tell he was being helpful based on how he had been trained. Relative to his training I would rate him at 10.  This was my first experience at this dealership so naturally I would have preferred to have been shown around a little with basic explanations as to how things worked. I contributed that not happening to a general lack of training from the dealership. 

•	No coffee. [...and I really wanted coffee]  The machine looked as if you had to have a credit card to use it and representatives seemed illusive ... If coffee was available, there was no explanation as to how to make it. To me that area was awkward and uninviting. 

•	The 'Mopar' center was gloomy and again, uninviting.  I went in there to look around but did not feel welcome.  The staff basically ignored me and I felt like I wasn't supposed to be there.

•	I had to WAIT for a rental.  Again seemed a bit clumsy since I thought a rental was to be associated with the service.  Rental car rep [Chris?] was cordial but not welcoming.  He came across to me as somewhat stroppy and perhaps a little grumpy. 

•	I found the rental process to be basic and unimaginative.  My experience with previous dealership rentals (Lexus , for example) is turn-key.  I would immediately receive a like or more luxurious vehicle as a rental and certainly would not have to bother with gas.  When I returned the vehicle, the rental car manager, Monica Serrano did ask for my input so I was able to express my concerns to her which was a definite plus.

•	When I returned to pick up my vehicle, the check-out center was unmanned and I had to wait about 10 minutes before someone decided to saunter back.  Again, I was not greeted and felt as if I had been waiting only to be shown distain for having to be checked out at all.     


I see potential, but my overall experience was fair and unimpressive. [Not very good]  I will certainly avoid a return visit if I can and would prefer to find a more customer oriented service location.

I did not drive this jeep,it had 875 miles on it,I was never told about the mileage,did'nt find out until the next day when I found the oddometer the odometer is small on the jeep,I went back to the dealership and asked about the mileage,I was told by the sales person (Collins) that he had told the sales manager (Chad E. Ivie),But I was never told of the mileage,I was then told by the salesman that it was a demo.I asked to speak to the sales manager (Chad E. Ivie he told me they would give me a Grand Cherokee coffee mug to make up for the mileage on the Jeep. (Value of the mug about $6.00.I then talked to the director of excellence (Jude Ross)She told me another story about the milesge she said they bring in vehcles from different dealerships and have them driven to their dealership)She told me it was cheaper to have them driven then trailered) She asked what she could do to fix the problem I told her to that it was a used Jeep they sold me,and I told her that I thought a refund of $1,500.00 would be in order,She then told me that would never happen End of story.I have since wrote to Chryser about this experence,I am waiting for a reply.The Jeep Wrangler I trade in I had for eleven months and had 7,500 miles on it.I will not buy another vehicle from from Grapsvine Dodge. If you plan on buying from them be sure to check the mileage.

229,"January 09, 2013","This is the worst dealership I have ever dealt with. They are very, very dishonest from the salesman to the top management. They don't follow thru with anything at all they promise. I would not walk, but run from this dealership. From the very begining I  advised them I was looking for a better, safer, longer lasting vehicle,limited income
 for my daughter, single Mom(very limited income), grandsons 2&3 yrs(time of purchase),the van they were driving had appx. 175,000 miles, but pd for. Started to look, I had thought since this was a large dealership, had the Nissan Quest that I was looking for, low miles supposely apprx 50,000, found on their website. Went and looked, drove the van, inside not cleaned, but promised they wld clean, 50,000 miles ?????, dvd player working in the vehicle. It appeared & I was assured numerous times it would be a lot better, safer vehicle, was checked thoroughly by their mechanics. I almost walked away and wish I wld have. The salemans kept preassuring me, stating the van they were currently driving was not a good vehicle wld not last long & we really needed something  more reliable, safe & lower miles for my daughter & granchildren so they would not get stranded in the street. After 3-4 days, sev.long hrs at their office being hounded, I finally caved in, after being assured numerous times, this vehicle wld be so much more reliable, safer & better vehicle. We agreed on price from internet $12,000. approx.& discussed warranty in great detail including price, financing. Once in finance dept to sign docs price had jumped to $14,000.00 appx. when I had refused to sign, they dropped the price, to the orig  price agreed upon. Last minute was advised cld not finance warranty with van, cld not afford(with my limited budget, I wld be paying for this all myself). I was advised by finace dpt, I cld then mk monthly pymt for 24 months(directly to the maint co) this wld be manageble, dwn pymt was not, to keep the deal head of finance pd dwn pymt, signed the deal, then advised cld only do 12 mos, which was too much cld not keep addit monthly amt, Tripled $$$. I was told it was to late, I already signed docs. & I could not back out of the deal. I had asked them to clean vehicle, made 4 trips apprx 80 miles rnd trip, still never really cleaned inside, nasty. Within 2nd wk aft purchase dvd stopped working, wld be appx $1,000.00 or mr to fix(no $$ to fix, still not working)had cont upper management, was directed to manager of service dpt, which promised to look at and fix, upon initial contact, lft numerous messages to set up date & time & never returned calls. Interior lights all quite working apprx 8 weeks after purchasing(not a fuse, told electrical issue $$$$ to locate) After driving vehicle appx 10-12,000 miles, had to take to nissan dealership due to the timing chain went out, appx $1,700.00 to fix, was advised by mechanics very unlikely for this to go out on a vehicle if it had 60,000 original miles, drove another appx 15,000 miles computer chip went out,apprx $2,500.00 to fix, this issue again advised, very unlikely for these types of issues on a vehicle with  less than 80,000 ORIGINAL MILES. Over the course of time numerous sensors have gone out costing again $$$ to fix which I did. Trouble with lights, steering, brakes and numerous other items. This van has been very unreliable, unsafe, broke down  more than it has been running. We have only driven this vehicle less than approx 35,000 miles with all of these issues, not counting smaller issues I did not take the time to discuss. I wish I had trusted my instinct,ran & did not trusted these folks.  We went from a vehicle totally paid for($4,000) more miles ???, but had no major breakdwns I was trying to avoid due to high milage, to a newer vehicle, less miles, no major breakdowns for sometime, reliable and safe I went in debt for $12,000.00 initially, then costs $$$$ for major & minor repairs, for a vehicle driven less than apprx. 35,000. Vehicle now has apprx 83,000 miles has been broke dwn past year more than it worked. Tried numerous times to get assistance at dealership, but to no avail..This company appears to have no morals,or care who they take advantage of or ripoff. ",1.0
230,"December 31, 2012","Everyone seemed friendly in the beginning, but after being hassled from 8:45am-3pm and the salesperson ""trying to get the best deal for me"", my opinions changed. They try to act like they are working in your best interest and take much longer to ""lower your monthly payment"", when they are really just wasting time walking back and forth. Obie was becoming a bit too pushy for my taste, even when I told him I had a set budget. 

Tip: When going to a dealership, go in with a set price for what you are able to pay for the TOTAL cost of the vehicle, do not focus on the monthly payment like dealerships try to do. Ultimately, it is the total cost that matters most.

Look at another dealership. The service dept here seemed pretty friendly, as they were constantly making sure I was being helped. Reception did not look very friendly and some of the other salesmen looked sleezy.",2.2

Unlike most places, the 'ordeal' of buying a new car was not painful at all and we drove away in our new Jeep very, very happy!",5.0

233,"October 22, 2012","Worst experience I have everhad buying a vehicle.  The deal kept changing and these are not people of their word!

I would drive any additional miles to another dealer.  I will not be going back for service on my 2013 new purchase!",1.4
234,"September 03, 2012","Wow! Where do I start. My Fiance Sebring needs new brakes so she tells me she is going to take it to the Chrysler Dealership that she bought her car from. I told her that everyone that I know says that this Dealership Sucks from Service to Sales. And has since it Opened (Parra's-Lithia-Chrysler-Current Owners). 

She convices me that she has gotten her oil changed there...WooHoo! 3 days before she brings the sebring in her Drivers side window quits working. Nice-Not. 
I recomend she take it to another dealer again! 
She says she still is bringing it to the dealer. 

So I remove the door panel to determine the repair of the window. Is it the motor(easy unplug-3 bolts- plug new one in) or major problem Window regulator is jacked. Of course its the window regulator. Call for part $57 bucks labor to install $188. Brake job is on special $190.

She drops her car off to the dealer for repair.
They call the next day and state a plastic part is missing for the repair of the window. She tells them its just the screw top of the push lock. Never telling her anything Else. They ask her if its okay to assemble the door?? She say sure. It just screws on so you can. push to lock or pull to unlock door. 

We arrive the next day to pick up car on Saturday.
Door is assembled, and they hand us the lock rod that goes inside the door.
We refuse to take delivery, telling them they need to fix it.
Also to call us the next day.
You guessed it no call
And they did not repair the door.

ALSO ASKED WHY THERE WAS A $40+ CHARGE FOR SHOP SUPPLIES + BRAKE FLUID + CLEANER.
I'm okay with the Brake Fluid and Cleaner.
BUT $40+  FOR SHOPS SUPPLIES??
I QUESTIONED THEM - TO GIVE ME THE EXACT SUPPLIES USED.
THAT I AM PAYING FOR.

THEY COULD NOT GIVE ME AN ANSWER.
I ASKED WHY THAT WAS NOT DISCLOSED DURING THE ESTIMATE.
THERE RESPONSE WAS - &quot;OH ITS NORMAL PRACTICE - WE SAID JUST SHOP FEES&quot;
MY RESPONSE WAS WHY DID YOU NOT GIVE US AN EXACT FEE.
THERE RESPONSE WAS - &quot;SORRY IT'S USUALLY 10%&quot;
MY RESPONSE - GEE THE BILL IS $400 SO YOU COULD HAVE TOLD US 10% OR 40+ BUCKS.

GRAPEVINE CHRYSLER DODGE - TEXAS DOES HAVE A DECEPTIVE TRADE PRACTICE LAW.....P.S.

So back to the repair of the Lockrod. I show up the next day on my lunch break to talk to the service manager. I ask him if the door has been repaired his answer is No. And that if I wanted it fixed, that I would have to pay for a $3.00 clip missing and $125.00 in labor to remove door panel and reinstall, Because I had lost it during the removal of the door panel. 
MY RESPONSE WAS: The lockrod was never removed from the door. If it was miss placed or had come off it shurly was in the door or the Tech took it off.
I WAS THEN CALLED A LIAR and it gets better.
Why was I there and not my Fiance? The service manager tells me I have no right to be there because I did not own the car.

MY RESPONSE; LET ME GET THIS RIGHT!
YOU HAVE NO PROBLEM.....TAKING MY MONEY
AND THE REASON I'M HERE IS BECAUSE YOUR TRYING TO RIPP MY FIANCE OFF!

YOU JUST TOLD ME IT NEEDED A $3.00 CLIP TO FIX THE LOCKROD??
SO WHY DIDN'T YOU OFFER TO DO THAT WHEN THE DOOR WAS OFF??
WHAT A BUNCH OF IDIOTS.
AND NOW YOU WANT TO CHARGE ME $125.00 TO TAKE THE DOOR PANEL OFF AND REINSTALL.
WOW!

So I left with the Sebring unrepaired.

Called ALLEN SAMUEL DODGE - ALLIANCE.
Told them of my situation. Asked them how much to install lockrod.
The Service advisor said he would call me back with Estimate.
10 min later Jeff calls me.
He is confused, He states their is no clip for the lockrod.
His tech says that is slides in a hole on the lock panel, slides up and locks in place. Labor to install is $65 1/2 labor. So I bring the Sebring by on Thurs. They install the lock rod in 45 minutes while I wait.
BEST NEWS!
THEY DON'T CHARGE ME.
Jeff, says just keep coming back. And that he is Sorry about our BAD EXPERIENCE at the other DODGE store.

MORAL TO THE STORY.
GRAPEVINE CHRYSLER DODGE has the worst customer service and will/did RIPP YOU OFF!

238,"July 14, 2012","I wanted to wright and tell how happy I am with my new 2012 Power Wagon. The last truck I bought was a 2006 1500 Ram 4X4. After 6 years and 180,000 I knew it was time to upgrade. My wife and I Just bought her a new 2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee Last December with Jude Ross. Knowing how happy we were with that we knew we should return to Grapevine Dodge to see what they had. We were hoping to run into into Jude, but we were informed that she no longer worked in sales. I have never been one to enjoy talking to sales folks so I was a little reluctant to meet someone new. Once we were informed of this they introduced up to Sheila Bozeman (189769) to which I found it to be a very pleasant experience. As we walked the lot looking at trucks we found a very nice 2012 2500 4X4 that I fell in love with. As we looked it over, Sheila took us out for a test spin and I knew it was going to be my next truck. I didnt realize at first (it was late evening) that it was a Power wagon. Ive always loved Power Wagons since I was a young kid. I was quite excited to finally own my own. I would like to thank Sheila Bozeman for making it a great experience. I think Grapevine Dodge has a great team and I'd like to thank you for both of our recently new purchases. Keep up the good work.

240,"June 27, 2012","My 1st visit to dealership; after looking at Jeeps in the lot for 20 minutes I finally went inside to requests assistance. It was mid-April 2012, I, and all other customers were exposed to an extremely angry manager/ executive at the dealership that screamed and ranted at the top of his lungs for the 40 minutes I was there. It was very embarrassing, unprofessional, classless, and way beyond excusing under any circumstance. That was when I realized I would never buy a car from them, I was just happy my wife and kids were not exposed to that volatile scene! It appeared the 3 bad stories from friends who shopped there prior to my visit were spot on. I only stayed because my keys were with the manager evaluating my trade-in. I was most embraced for my sales person Jude Ross who was most pleasant and should rethink who she works for. On a separate note, the price quoted on a new wrangler was not competitive as I soon found out via cars.com, but, that has no bearing on my view of this dealership other than I thought it was humorous that the internet priced lost leader,was not exactly the final sales price as advertised (please add another $600-800). My second and final visit came 6/26/2012 when I set up a 2 PM appointment to get an oil change on my recently purchased (4/2012)Jeep Sahara from Greenville Chrysler (I highly recommend shopping them, great experience and the price quoted on the internet was the final price paid). Since I purchased the 100k 6 year extended warrantee and live in Grapevine, I reluctantly thought I would at least give the Service Department a try, how bad could it be?
Well the answer there is a very loud and firm Ditto! I was assured I could get in for the oil change at 2PM which I told the service rep on the telephone was very important since I was coming from Irving during my 1 hour lunch break. At 2PM I was met with a condescending and irritated serevice tech named TJ; who was more concerned with who would possibly tell me I was getting in any time before 3PM than trying to rectify the situation. TJ lacks the basic protocol and customer service assets to be dealing with customers and the awareness necessary to handle the situation as a customer service professional as opposed to unqualified amateur. As I look back at my 2nd and last visit to Grapevine CDJ I get the feeling that this basic lack of customer experience seems to be common there, maybe that manager screaming that day was the man in charge which would explain my experience and others I have heard from. I get a lot of questions on my Jeep everywhere I go, I now make it a point to share the respect I have for the product and make sure I steer them far away from Grapevine CDJ!

249,"April 13, 2012","My husband and I came in on a Friday to lease a new Jeep Grand Cherokee.  We found a Jeep that fit our needs, we worked out a price and financing was approved.  We filled out all the paper work and signed over a check for $5000 for the down payment and ttl.  The Jeep was supposed to be a dealer trade from Fort Worth so we called the following Monday to see if the Jeep was ready and could come pick it up.  They then informed me that the Jeep was sold (!?) at some point over the weekend and we would not be moving forward. First, why did we go through all the paperwork, financing and handing over a check for a vehicle that was not properly reserved or obtained?

At this point we were pretty frustrated by their inability to follow through on what was considered a done deal Friday.  Nevertheless, we continued to try and work with them to find another vehicle, even changing initial requests of preferred colors and packages to help facilitate the search. As of Tuesday nothing had been found. To our surprise, we found out that they had cashed our down payment check!! Why was our check cashed when (1) we were not given a vehicle and the one promised was lost and (2)they had not even been able to find a replacement? 

We called the dealership several times that day and the next. No one appeared to be there that could help me or interested in finding someone who could, our calls were dodged and avoided by all parties, even one of the female managers. 
I called again several times on Thursday finally got a hold of Adrian in Finance and he seemed to be aloof about the whole situation, as it must be common practice to cash checks before delivering goods.  He asked me to send proof that the check was removed from my account, he never got back to me.  

I finally tracked down the GM's email and he promptly returned my call, apologizing for the trouble and seemed sincere. He wanted to continue a deal and let them ""fix the mistake"", but we were done here. Needless to say, we went to another dealership down the street and found a better Jeep at a better price right away.

Although the dealer was 30 miles from my house, given the quick internet response, I felt obliged to give them an opportunity to win the business. Upon arrival, I was immediately met by a fairly knowledgeable, although a little in experienced salesman, who spent time personally walking me through the vehicle and showing me all the &quot;bells and whistles.&quot;  So far, so good! After a fairly thorough review of the vehicle, I asked to go on a test drive (which was my original intention for coming out to the dealer...at their request mind you). The response I received was it was the owner's policy to not allow test drives on this particular vehicle (Grand Cherokee SRT8) unless a deal on pricing has been agreed. My response was, while I am clearly interested in the vehicle, I was uncomfortable agreeing to a price until at least driving the vehicle. I also indicated I test drove a Range Rover Sport Supercharged the day before and a Cadillac Escalade earlier that morning, neither of which required me to agree to a price in advance of test driving. I am shocked to think a dealer would require a well qualified buyer, who made an appointment for a test drive, to agree to a deal prior to driving the vehicle. I should also mention, I have a master’s degree in business and am a partner in a big 4 accounting firm. I arrived to the dealer in a suit directly from my office. I suggest you find another dealer that isn't involved in unscrupulous business practices and doesn't pride itself on the &quot;bait and switch.&quot;",1.7

The past year has been a rough one with difficult transitions, disappointments and serious health problems.  This for a child who has already been dealt more than her share, suffered more than most of us could handle or deserves to.   Now 16, this year has brought a whole new set of challenges with a future that looks to be more of the same.  Through it all, she remains hopeful, loving and willing to smile.    If anyone deserved a “priceless” moment of happiness; a special, unexpected gift this holiday season, she did.    
I began searching the Dodge Calibur she liked even though credit and cash were going to be a challenge.  I had little confidence in being able to deliver this gift, but wanted to at least try.  I found a really nice car for the price on their website with financing offered to all.  
My husband and I met with Karl A. Schmitt, our new friend in the car business.  Karl and the finance staff were willing to work with us despite our challenges (when many others would not), treating us with the utmost respect and understanding of our less than perfect situation.   We were able to purchase the car she wanted at a good price, fulfilling our daughter’s wishes and ours.  In this day, it is a challenge to find businesses who offer little more than a callous transaction; our car buying experience with them was much, much more.  They not only sold a vehicle, they sold parents of a young girl the opportunity to provide some sunshine to brighten her world…big, bright car bow included.  
They will have our business from now on, and if you would like to have a quality car buying experience with people that provide more,  I suggest that you go and see them.

He was not a pushy salesman type which led us to inquire about the chrysler 300. After informing him what we wanted our payments and down payment to ""not to exceed"", he was upfront and honest that the deal would be tight as we had negative equity in our trade-in. 

The experience was the best I have ever had. Our positive experience continued with the finance department. We worked with Karim Jaffer on our financing. He was very friendly and made my wife and I very comfortable. He had a great sense of humor yet was the most professional when it was time.

275,"October 26, 2011","I went to my local dodge dealer looking for one car in mind. I told them when I walked up I was not buying that day, but if they had what I wanted I would be buying within the month. They did not have the car I wanted and demanded I could not get it. Even with entertaining the idea of another vehicle I was still adamant I would not be buying that day.

I was there for 3 hours while they tried selling me everything I did not want. I left very frustrated and did not really want to return. I contacted dodge customer support and they explained that what I wanted was in fact available it was simply on late dispatch and would be arriving at dealers closer to the end of this year.

I contacted this dealer again by chat and explained the situation. Told them again what I wanted and was willing to entertain the idea of special ordering. All I wanted was for them to let me know how much more it would cost to do that. They demanded I would have to come back to the dealership.

I contacted another dealership, told him what I wanted. He did not say no. He said I will look into it and get back with you. In an hour he had found 3 of the car I wanted.

I am a customer, I don't have access to all the dealers tools.  Google on the other hand apparently does. I also found 8 of the car I wanted.

I would not go back to that dealership ever again. I would not advise anyone else to go to that dealership as well.

281,"February 23, 2011","I brought in my 2006 Chrysler Crossfire because, for the very first time, the car had an issue and the ""Check Engine"" light was on. I worked with Harvis Grammer and dropped my car off at the shop on a Saturday and I was told that the car wouldn't be looked at until Monday. Fair enough. After diagnostics, there was a slew of issues found with the car and it would cost nearly $2000 to fix it. However, because of the extended warranty, the total came out to just over $900. I paid the money and they had my car fixed by that Wednesday. Now the fun begins. During that weekend, I got in my car to leave and, when I started it, the car started shaking violently. The shop was closed at this time, so I turned it off and just waited until Monday. I called Harvis on Monday and explained the situation and he asked me to bring it in which I did. They had one of their employees give me a ride home and I was told they would call me about my car shortly. That was on Monday. On Thursday afternoon, I had not heard anything (mind you I'm still without a vehicle) so I called Harvis. He told me that they did not find any problems and they wanted to have a tech drive the car home with a computer attached to find any issues. I gave them my consent and waited. On Friday, I called back and they said there was a problem with the airflow meter and that it would cost me over $800 for the part and labor. I asked how quickly they could get me my car back after repairs and I was told it would be on Saturday. I stressed to Harvis that I really needed to have a car because of the three-day weekend and he assured me that it wouldn't be a problem. After thinking about it for a bit, I called back and asked about my extended warranty and what that would cover on the $800 price tag. Well, that extended warranty that we worked with just a week ago had slipped Harvis' mind and wasn't applied. Turns out it FULLY covers the part and labor of this airflow meter business. He then tells me that all I'd have to pay is the $100 deductible. But wait! Didn't I just pay that deductible last week?!?!? When I brought that up, Harvis then remembered that it was already paid. So he was going to have me pay, basically, another $1000 for something that was completely covered under my extended warranty! I approve the repairs over the phone and, again, I wait. Saturday rolls around and, by 2pm, I haven't heard anything about my car being ready, so I call Harvis to get a status. Harvis tells me that the part didn't come in and that my car won't be ready until Monday!!!! I explain to him the situation with the three-day weekend and he offers to give me a rental so I tell him that I'll get someone to drop me off at the dealership so I can pick up the loaner. This is when things get really nuts. Harvis now tells me that the car rental service is closed on Saturday and that he can get me a loaner on Monday. THE VERY SAME DAY MY CAR IS SUPPOSED TO BE READY!!!! How does this make any sense? Now for the bombshell. Harvis tells me that the rental is completely covered by my extended warranty. This means that this entire week that I've been relying on friends to pick me up to go anywhere, I could have had a rental, but it was never offered to me! Monday comes and I still hear nothing, so I try to call Harvis and get no answer. I call the general line and ask to speak with Harvis' manager, Rusty Miller. Rusty takes my call, I explain the situation and he tells me that he will handle it from here and that my car will be ready for pick up in 30-45 minutes. I show up about an hour after that phone call and my car is finally ready and Harvis greets me and shows me some paperwork about how they ""waived"" the deductible. Waived? I already paid it!!!! You're not doing me any favors! Anyway, as soon as I got my car back, I drove it up to Five Star Ford and traded it in. I want nothing to do with this incredibly incompetent company anymore and I strongly urge others not to give them your business.",1.0

James Gordon made us feel as if we were purchasing a Aston Martin, and just a Jeep Liberty Jet! I personally am shocked that a salesperson and dealership would drive into the early morning hours to pick up the specific vehicle I wanted without question! It would have been easy, expected and understood that 'Sorry, we don't have it!', but that was never the case in my experience this past week. 

The Finance department was equally pleasant to work with, and Allen in the Service Department has spoiled me with his continuous superior customer service. I truly feel as if I've made a friend with both Allen and James.

The engine was overheating and we knew that there was something wrong. We called the dealer and said we never received the dealership warranty paperwork. They said we never received a warranty on the car. We went up there to talk to sales manager and he said to tow the vehicle in and he would take care of us. We used our one free two from the insurance company and brought it to the dealer. They said they would look at it and to come back tomorrow. We returned the next day and they never looked at the vehicle and wanted us to pay to have the vehicle checked out. We refused. Then sales said they would take care of the cost of looking at the vehicle. Service determined it was the water pump and it would cost $500 to repair.

When I called to bring it back in I was told it would be 2 weeks and we were 20th on the list.  After fussing with the service supervisor we were allowed to bring in the truck.  They scanned it.  At this time they told me it was the oxygen sensor harness and Dodge was redesigning the harness. Was told the newly designed oxygen sensor harness would not be out for a month or two but we would be put first on the list to have it installed when it was ready. When we again expressed concern as our trip was accross country pulling a 5th wheel camper both Allen and Rusty told me to put a piece of tape over the check engine light and to go on our way. They said it would not effect the exhaust regeneration, a critical system and that power or mileage would not be effected at all. About 250 miles into our trip mileage, and power began to drop. It went from getting 14 mpg to 9 mpg.  The mileage kept going down .1 every 20 - 30 miles.  Called Grapevine dodge but no one returned our calls.  At that time we called the main Dodge number and got the numbers of 2 Dodge dealers in Albaquerqie, NM.  After speaking to those dealer's service departments, both of them said that Grapevine must have been ""smoking something"", that there is no redesigning of the harness just the sensor was bad. H. L. Miller Dodge in Alb. took care of us at 5:45 pm, diagnosed the problem within the hour, and took us to an rv resort close by.  They told us to have a good dinner they would get us back on the road in the morning, which they did. Grapevine did not return my repeated phone calls for 3 days.

296,"May 04, 2010","I recently purchased a wrangler with 29,000 miles in feb. The sales guy knew nothing about jeeps. I would ask him questions and he would have to ask somebody else. The price was reasonable. When I bought the jeep the windshield needed to repaired or replaced. I had to argue and argue to get it fix. Even though I had a we owe note from them. They were friendly at first but once I bought it they were done with me. So now on to the service dept. After about a month I figured out there was a plastic part on my gear shifter was broken. So I took it in under warranty. They told me that warranty does cover plastic parts. So I was like whatever and bought the new part and fixed it myself. So at 35,000 miles my check engine light came on. So I took it in with other issues also. At this point I work nights in the oilfields. And yes my jeep goes in the mud but not really ""offroading"". And what had happen was a clip that held on a o2 sensor came loose it rubbed on the driveshaft.  Andrew proceeded to tell me that they were not going to cover it under warranty because I had mud on the undercarriage of my jeep. I tried explaining that I work In the oilfields and it has been raining a lot. But no success he said I probably hit something that broke the wire. When you look at the wire the casing is broken not the wire. And it's only messed up where the wire touches the driveshaft. I also had a another issues where my tire was rubbing the brake line that they didn't fix because they couldn't get a hold of me. But that was covered under warranty. I told Andrew i would be sleeping because I work nights and I already stayed up too late to bring my jeep in. So I ended up talking to the highest manager I could.  not the gm because he was never there or available. And he would not return my call. I let the manager know I was unhappy and told him I've never had so many problems with a dealership. He said he would talk to the service manager and call me back.
