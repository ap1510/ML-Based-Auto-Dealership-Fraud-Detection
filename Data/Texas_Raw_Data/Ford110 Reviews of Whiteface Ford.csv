5,"April 23, 2019","We took my Jeep in for to get worked on. My paperwork covered a loaner car, when we got there they did not have a loaner car available. The 1st week of having my vehicle they did not touch it due to seeing if warranty will cover all of it so we didn't have to pay. That first week on Friday we called and they said we did not have to pay anything that it was covered. 2 weeks later we called to check on progress, they had it tore apart and just needed to put new part on and put it together. Finally a month later we call on Monday they said we can pick it up that evening or the nextorning. Tuesday is here and drive from Amarillo to Hereford and they tell us we need $100.00 for the deductible after telling us we didn't have to pay anything. So we are out $100 plus renting a car for the month. They will find a way to screw you! DO NOT GO HERE!!!",2.4

I kept hearing yeah but this cheap it would be cash only. I seen Whiteface ford had a few and dialed the number to continue my search. I connected with Esmerelda and let her know my situation. Ok maybe I'm asking for the impossible and it even seemed so at Whiteface Ford. The first few days was positive she was checking with the bank, then It was like the busy signal all of a sudden, I figured Esmerelda was even like guy please. I took it like a man my school loan has really brought me down. So I hadn't heard from anyone ok no biggie, but I think it was the next morning Esmerelda called and said she finally found me a lender, I couldn't begin to describe how it felt for someone to go the extra mile for ""me"". I'm usually the one doing the extra miles. It didn't stop there they picked me up at the bus station in Amarillo, my Toyota Sequoyia was previously owned by a mechanic, it was in excellent condition inside and out. I spent less than an hour at the dealership and got to drive home in my new 4 by 4 Toyota, with a sunroof. Thanks for all your help. Esmirelda you are more than just a salesperson.",5.0
