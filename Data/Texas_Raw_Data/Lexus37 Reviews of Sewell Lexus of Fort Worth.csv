0,"April 04, 2020","I purchased an ES 350 at the Fort Worth Location.  I presented my auto insurance at the time of purchase and my salesman took the copy of my card and the full policy that I sent to him.  It was documented thoroughly,  My insurance was accepted by them as well as my bank, EECU.  Today I scheduled my service, that is required to maintain my warranty, and was told that I could not have a loaner car because ""they did not work with my insurance carrier"".  My carrier is Old America Casualty Mutual and is a fine and thorough plan.  My salesman had my policy and knew who the carrier was.  Today in conversation with him he was well acquainted with their policy.  I explained that he withheld information from me which truly would have stopped me from purchasing the car.  His knowledge of my carrier and their policy is proof positive that he withheld.  

After speaking to two people a higher person in the company called me, a Kurt something who is the Group Vice President.  He regurgitated the policy and said he wanted a solution,  Here are the inconveniences:  the customer waiting area t the dealership is closed due to CO-VID 9.  I could not get a loaner car. They offered an UBER.  They offered to drive me home and pick me up.  Here is the deal....my father and mother are 80 years old and they both have cancer, my father is one week out of the hospital after having a portion of his lung removed and I am their caregiver.  I cannot risk exposure to this hideous virus.  My parents who surely die if I gave this to them.  Riding in an uninitialized car with an unknown person is too great of a risk.  I was offered an opportunity to sit in a car outside of the service area for 3 hours to wait on my car....no keys though and it is 40* outside.  

So you tell me...is the Sewell pledge of amazing service real?  I know there are many wonderful aspects of this dealership and I appreciate them.  But, I am now faced with having a car for 3-4 years that is not accompanied with the one long term benefit of purchasing from Sewell Lexus.  My work schedule is always hectic and I drive from location to location...I cannot be stymied with pick up, deliver, waiting in parked cars, not going to work, etc.  I am furious and let down.  If my salesman had just tole me about their policy I would have not purchased.  The business manager who I sat with had the same opportunity yet he did not convey that information either.  I will not ever recommend this dealership and I will never buy there again nor from Lexus as they blamed Lexus for this policy.  

Now, my insurance company said that there is no validity to what Sewell claims is the issue.  I have a top level policy and the coverage does convey to rental cars and loaner cars, I verified this with the insurance carrier today and read my entire policy.  I contacted my loan officer at EECU and she said that this was the first they had heard. I asked that they make a complaint to the dealership as they are a preferred lender with Sewell.  She agreed, they cannot be a preferred loan vendor if their customers are not  given the service and allowances that they purchase based on the Sewell Customer Pledge.  

I have driven Mercedes for over 20 years and bought all of them at Park Place Mercedes.  Same insurance and always had extremely excellent service with loaner cars every time.  This is my first and last Lexus and I will go back to Park Place as soon as I am able to trade this car off.  If Sewell had a bone of integrity in them they would buy back this car so I can go elsewhere but that is absolutely not an option from them.

I read the other reviews on this page and up to today I would have agreed 100% with the positive reviews.  My experience was excellent up to the point that I needed and relied on what I was given.

2,"December 08, 2018","Today I was treated to the finest experience a customer could ask for. First I telephoned and was happy that a live operator took my call who then transferred me to Derek in parts. I was never placed on hold. Derek was polite, knowledgeable & courteous. Although my request was only for wiper refills, he acted as if I were the most important sale of the day. He had what I needed and set them aside for me. Upon arrival, Derek quickly took my money and even offered to assist me with installing the wiper refills I needed for my sister's 2001 Toyota Highlander. I declined at first saying I could manage, but Derek politely re-insisted on keeping me safe and dry on the service drive. It was bitterly cold and rainy today. I only spent a few dollars but was treated as though I were royalty. Thank you for that.

3,"November 19, 2018","My salesman was ANDREW FLYNN and he was very knowledgeable about the products, courteous, and is still helping me when I need to ask information.  He seems very concerned to get me to the right person  even after the sale.  I have never bought a car before where I felt treated so well.  You have a great person on your staff.  I will probably buy from your company when the need arises and also when some of my friends have a need I will let them know how I feel.  Thanks, Jim Floyd ",5.0
4,"May 29, 2018","I have lived from Chicago to Los Angeles and I have bought many cars during my career. Never have I received the royal treatment I received from Internet sales associate Trong Huynh at Sewell Lexus of Fort Worth. I am currently retired in Tucson, Arizona and found the car of our dreams, a Lexus RC350 F Sport, Infrared in color, at Sewell Lexus of Fort Worth on the internet. I immediately contacted Trong Huynh. Price negotiations were handled professionally and Trong started my pleasurable process toward purchasing the car. I asked him for many additional pictures of the interior & exterior of the car. His response was lightning fast and the pictures were sent via my phone in a matter of a few minutes. The certification summary and carfax for the vehicle were furnished promptly and the financials were secured without delay. Since I live in Tucson, I needed Trong to store the car at the dealership for 2 weeks until we could arrange to fly there and pick it up. Trong said ""No Problem"" and we finalized everything. When we arrived to take delivery, the process was smooth & simple. All aspects of the vehicle were exactly as Trong described. Trong had all of the papers in order and all we had to do was basically sign and drive away! This was the best buying experience I have had from any dealership and sales person since I bought my first new car in 1970! If you are in the market for a new or used Lexus, don't hesitate! Call Trong today! ",5.0
5,"December 27, 2017","This was our first Infiniti QX60 buying experience and we had a wonderful experience with Sewell Fort worth. The salesperson Adam was very helpful and was always quick in responding to our queries. The process was so smooth and straightforward, mostly done over phone/text and no pressure to visit the dealership. We visited only once when we felt like. Adam answered all our questions regarding the feature details of various packages. They did their best to make sure that we get the brand new car at a great price.I would definitely refer them to someone who is looking to buy Infiniti. I hope they do the same if I need their help in services and post sale issues, if any.",5.0
6,"February 12, 2017","The fact that they were willing to go out of their way to make the customer happy even after the purchase was completed made my new 2016 GS 200T purchase a 5-star experience. Special thanks to their New Car Director Corey Hawkins for this. This kind of behavior will make everyone in my family go back to Lexus, and Sewell Lexus at Fort Worth in particular, when they will look for their next car. It was also a pleasure dealing with Brad Coker, Shane Nelson and Courtney Jones during the car buying process. Lexus Customer Service was also very cooperative and willing to help in every way they could. Love my new car!",5.0
7,"February 02, 2017",My first experience at Sewell Lexus Dallas was so positive that I've continued to purchase all my vehicles there and have brought at least 17 friends and family who have also purchased there.  The vehicles are reliable and the service is superior.  I've dealt with Greg Ziemer in sales form more than 15 years now.  Buying a Lexus from Sewell is a positive and enjoyable experience.  ,5.0
8,"November 10, 2016","To be fair, I think that my experience could be the exception to the rule, as everyone I've known who has gone to Sewell (at least the one in Dallas, I cannot speak for Fort Worth) has had nothing but positive things to say.  However, I think my Lexus will be my first and my last vehicle to be purchased from Sewell based on my experience.  
I recently purchased a certified pre-owned lexus from Sewell in Dallas, and after a few weeks the maintenance light came on so I brought it in to the Sewell in Fort Worth since I was in the area for a tune up and car wash.  I dropped off my vehicle and we did a brief walk around, all looked well.  I had some bugs on the windshield, but all in all my new lexus was in good shape.  Part of the tune-up included having their tech drive my car, which is perfectly fine.  That afternoon I came back and picked up my vehicle and as they pulled in from about 40 feet away I saw a deep gash in the hood and my heart sunk.  I pointed it out to the young lady who brought my car around and at first she pretended not to see it, and then she tried to buff it out with a towel.  The gash is about an inch or so long and goes down to the metal.  I spoke to my service manager and he said he felt bad, but there was nothing they could do since it likely occurred when I was driving...which is a bold position to take considering we looked over the vehicle that morning.  He asked if I'd like to have the branch service manager call me in the morning and I said YES.
The next day I did not get a call, and that in and of itself really pissed me off.  It was just a total lack of decency and respect.  So, I called my Insurance and told them what happened to see what they could do for me.  They said they would call the dealership to see if they could come up with some sort of resolution.  My insurance carrier called me 4 times over the course of the next week to let me know that they had been attempting to reach the branch manager with no success.  I decided to call and had more or less the same results.
I ended up emailing my salesman who sold me the car to tell him what happened and see if he could help me out, which he could not.  I also submitted an email via their company website which did the trick.  The manager finally called me and claimed he did not know I wanted him to call me nor had he received any of my insurance company's nor my messages.    The least unkind adjective I could use to describe the manager would be smarmy.  The conversation was smug, condescending, and extraordinarily frustrating.  He did say sorry...but did not apologize, and by that I mean he just ended the conversation with a really insulting and unnecessary ""I'm sorry this didn't go your way"".  I might understand signing off like that if we had a heated argument or I cussed him up and down, but we had a conversation.  I wanted to know how they were going to make this right, and he informed me they had done nothing wrong.  
In my eyes, the onus is on the dealership to spot any damage that is on the vehicle when I drop off the car (which there was none), and then repair any damage which occurs while the vehicle is in their possession.  Then again, I'm just a simple cave man.
Interesting way to do business, considering I'm good for a new car every 2 years, but after this experience I'll do the only thing I can do, shop somewhere else and relay my experience.",1.0
9,"September 27, 2016",So I emailed the store looking for my second Lexus from this location. I get a call within minutes from the GSM by the name of Gina Collins. She not only made sure my second experience was better than the first she walked me and my wife through the entire process to make it extremely easy and seamless! Kudos to Kenny for a great job not only doing a Delivery with my wife but then arranging a follow up visit to answer her addition questions.,5.0
10,"March 16, 2016","Undisclosed major damages to vehicle, when I called they gave me a fake promise about fixing it. They also ran my credit several times after I instructed them not to. ",1.0
11,"March 12, 2016","I would think that a dealership with this sort of name recognition would at least attempt marginal customer service rather than such poor customer service I almost felt like I was on candid camera. Their business practices are shady at best, if not fraudulent. In fact, I may have to take legal action against them for their blatant price gouging, deceptive tactics and false and misleading information, failure to disclose as well as failure to cover their end of the deal as outlined in the contract. They also owe me money a check that was supposed to have been sent out in an ""effort"" to account for some of this once it was pointed out to them. Rather than send the check as they claimed (to appease me) they are now refusing to respond to me at all. I knew more about cars than the salesman and I think they actually assumed that me being a women meant I couldn't possibly unserstand the false information he was giving to me. ",1.4
12,"March 02, 2016","
What an awful experience we had when taking my RC 350 in for the 15,000 mile service.  I told the service employee that I had a slow leak in the drivers rear tire.  I was called later that day and was informed that I would need a new tire costing in the several hundreds of dollars because I had 2 nails that were too close together to patch.  I asked them to hold off on the replacement at the time.  I then later took my car to a reputable company to get a second opinion.  Very quickly they determined that there were indeed two nails, but only one penetrated and the other was simply removed and did not cause damage.  The repair was done free of charge and I did not need a new tire.  I have absolutely no faith that my car is in good hands or that I will be properly informed of any future work that might need to been done by this dealership to be fully in my best interest.  Not only did this happen, but I was told a 15,000 mile service was done, which included a tire rotation that I paid for and when I got my car back after service. The tire mentioned above was not rotated.  It was still in the drivers side rear as it was when it went in for service.  We have since contacted the Service Mgr at Sewell Lexus in Ft Worth and were pretty much told the mechanic that worked on the vehicle did nothing wrong and would have no reason to since he would not  have benefited whether or not we purchased a new tire or not.  REALLY....not very professional of him in my opinion and absolutely horrible customer service and work performed.  Will not be returning and will let anyone I know to be cautious before using that location as a service dealership.  I wasn't sure who to inform of my issues, but thought this forum would be a good place to start.  Thank you for listening and hopefully getting informed as to the fact this particular dealership is not putting in enough effort to ensure proper car of their owners vehicles, which is too bad because my sales experience was fine.",1.4
13,"October 31, 2015","I have been shopping for the perfect SUV for several weeks.  Trong Huynh met me and my husband at the door of Sewell Lexus and immediately I felt at ease as we began to discuss what we were looking for.  Trong showed us several choices in the RX350 and I found the car for me!  The buying experience was easy and stress free.  Thanks to all the Sewell professions...job well done.  I love my RX350.  It is perfect.

14,"April 10, 2015","On march 6th I arrived at Sewell of FW to look at a new RC 350 F Sport  which had been described to me by Steve. He had also sent me the specification's and picture via email after I had described what type car I was looking for. When I saw It in the new color (INFRARED), I knew I wanted to take it home That Day. After reaching what I consider a fair price, Steve went to working at warp speed to complete the process that day. (I live 110 miles away and would not be able to return for several days). Steve has also helped with several small problem's I have had since taking delivery. I am really enjoying my new ride and will give Sewell an opportunity to sell me my next car, (this is my third new car to buy from them), But I will be sure  to look up Steve Johnson (MY NEW FRIEND) when I do.

16,"February 27, 2015","My wife and I stopped by sewell fort worth on our way to another dealership that had already approved us for a good deal. Upon arriving at Sewell Fort Worth we were greated by a seemingly friendly young man who immediately started showing us the car we were looking at. The car is a 2008 Lexus ES350 with 96k miles. We asked if we needed to replace the timing belt and he answered that the timing belt has been replaced at 90k. Well i did my own research later on and found that this car doesn't have a timing belt but has a timing chain which should last the life of the car. Which tells me he really doesn't know the car he is selling too well. He worked with me for about 2 days trying to match the other dealership. Finally Yesterday i get a phone call from him and started his conversation with  "" I have good news for you!"" and he started listing over the phone what his financing department agreed to offer me. I wrote everything down and told him that i liked what he offered and will be there around 6pm that day. We got there at 6pm and he started pushing toward us paperwork to sign that were different from what he offered over the phone that day. The rate was higher, the loan term was shorter and the payment was higher. His excuse was that he was processing several deals and got confused and may have given me different information. Boloney. So i told him we were not interested and left them quickly. I thought that the old bait and switch scheme was a thing of the past but NO!!! It's alive and well at Sewell Fort Worth. Big disappointment! 
Of all the dealership i thought that Sewell would have higher standards than the average dealership since they represent such a prestigious brand but unfortunately it wasn't the case.  I should have researched them before setting foot in their building.",1.0
17,"July 23, 2013","I am a previous Sewell buyer, and I had no issues when I bought my CT in 2011. However, something has changed in this company.

Last month, my friend and I both purchased new Lexus vehicles from Park Place Lexus in Grapevine. We gave Sewell Lexus of Fort Worth ample opportunity to be our dealer of choice; however, Sewell failed miserably, if only because we never received phone calls in a timely manner.

Sewell asked me for my contact info at one point during the process, because the sales manager, Gina Collins, wanted to contact me. I didn’t hear from her until 6 days later, but it was too late. I had already purchased a new Lexus from Park Place.

I was ready to move on and forget what had happened, but my friend decided to buy a new Lexus as well. I gave Sewell another opportunity to try and win his business, in addition to winning my future business. I contacted Gina Collins and gave her the details regarding the RX purchase. My friend contacted her multiple times with no response back. This was after she asked for him to contact her. Again, she finally called him, but it was too late. I had initially told her that he was ready to move quickly on a purchase, and he did so with Park Place.

I’m not sure what is different at Sewell now, but I will no longer consider them as an option during any buying or service needs. Honestly, a phone call (or email) is not difficult and/or time-consuming. Gina Collins said on both occasions that she could not call us back because of long meetings. Well, then she shouldn’t have requested our contact info. Someone else should have handled it.

Basically, Sewell needs to know that they missed out on two buyers within 7 days simply because of no phone calls. These were two transactions that totaled well over $100K dollars (including extended warranties, dent protections, tire/wheel warranty, etc.), not to mention the thousands in future service-related revenue.

Word of mouth is important, and unfortunately, these negative experiences leave me with little positive to say about Sewell.

Bottom line: if you would like a hassle-free experience, stay away from Sewell Lexus of Fort Worth!!!

19,"October 12, 2012","If you are in the market for a Lexus, Sewell of Fort Worth is the place to go. It's worth asking for Ken Dawson in sales. He's friendly, helpful, organized, and will bend over backwards to make you happy and get you the car you want at a great price. Highly recommend him.

20,"June 28, 2012","Went to buy a CPO Lexus RX350. They didn't disclose that the vehicle had a massive paint job done (about $11k worth) until we were ready to sign the papers. That too it was mentioned grudgingly that they were doing so as a courtesy and were not required to disclose! 

Prior to going to the dealership, we asked the sales guy about any issues on the vehicle and were assured that there was nothing other than a minor scratch at the back. He assured that it was in excellent condition.

Drove from far with a drive out price and financing paper work done only to learn that it had a huge paint job done two weeks ago. The manager and the sales person had the gall to say that the price was lower because of it and somehow we should have known why it was low. Here we were thinking that it's end of month and we had a decent deal and it was definitely nothing out of range compared to other dealerships. 

We asked the sales guy to check if everything was ok and to inform us of anything that's wrong. I would not have gone and wasted our time if they had the courtesy to let us know of the paint job ahead of time.

But then that's their sales tactic. Great disappointment to us given our experience with other Lexus dealers in the area. 

Avoid buying a used car from this dealership unless due diligence is done.

1) ask for service records
2) don't rely on car fox. it only shows what was reported. 
3) have a mechanic or experienced person look at the vehicle. 

This experience has soured us on the Lexus CPO thing. It's no better than buying it from Joe down the road. We expected better from a Lexus dealership and Sewell. What a let down!",1.8

We got right down to business, but felt like we were truly forming a relationship with these folks.  The manager, Corey Hawkins, came in to discuss our car, gave us some comparisons among other brands, discussed numbers with us and, in a short time, we drove away with our car.  My husband and I were absolutely 100% satisfied and impressed with the way Sewell treated us and really listened to what we were looking for in a vehicle.  I would highly recommend looking at Sewell first when considering the purchase of a new or used car.  We know we receieved better than the best deal, we cannot say enough about this dealership.

35,"October 23, 2007","Sewell Lexus of  Ft. Worth, TX---Thumbs Down!

I bought my 2005 LS430 from Sewell Lexus of Ft. Worth, TX. less than 2 years ago.  It currently has 13,000 miles on it and has always been kept garaged.  I put it in the garage the other night, and when I woke up the next day to run some errands, there was a 10” vertical crack running down my windshield directly in front of the driver.  Upon inspection, the crack started at the uppermost part of the windshield under the chrome border and ran straight down the windshield.  I did not get hit by gravel, rocks or any other object.  Since the crack was directly in front of the driver, it would have been obvious if I had been hit by an object.  It appeared to be a stress crack, probably from improper installation or flexing of the car body.  I took the car into Sewell after being told that this would be covered under my warranty but  they would have to inspect it first.  The Service Writer took a full 10 minutes inspecting it, finding no evidence of a rock or gravel strike.  Then he took out his ballpoint pen and ran it up and down the crack, stopping at the top of the crack and moving it around.  I couldn’t figure out what he was doing.  Then he gets a magnifying glass with attached spotlight and shows me a miniscule impression, right where he was pressing his pen, and informed me that was where I was hit by a rock.  This miniscule mark could not be seen with the naked eye, but he insisted it was a rock strike.  There was absolutely no evidence of any rock strike or external damage to the naked eye.  After I disagreed with him, he called the Service Manager who just agreed with the Service Writer’s assessment.  When I disagreed with him, he said he would “call Lexus and see how they would handle it.”  He came back and said that out of the goodness of their heart, Lexus would pay ½ of the nearly $1900 charge for a new windshield.  When I told him I could get a new OEM windshield installed by Safelite Auto Glass for $197.90 he informed me that their glass was no good and that it would split and peel in time, unlike the superior Lexus glass.  Then the New Car Sales Manager came and said he would accept the opinion of his Service Manager and the claim would be denied.  He asked me if I would pay $475 for a replacement windshield and I told me it should be replaced under the New Car Warranty.   The General Manager was supposed to call me upon returning 3 days later to resolve the situation.  I never heard from him so I called him and he informed me they wouldn’t replace the glass under warranty.  He had not even looked at the windshield.  Needless to say I was very disappointed with the Service Department and Management of Sewell Lexus of Ft. Worth and will never buy another Lexus from them.  Fortunately there are several other dealers available in the DFW area.

Update:  I had the windshield replaced by Safelite Auto Glass 2 days later.  I asked the 2 technicians at Safelite to check the crack after they had removed the framing and tell me what caused the crack.  After their examination they told me there was NO evidence of a rock or gravel chip to the window, and that when the windshield was originally installed by Lexus, they had left a gap with no sealant at all under the area where the crack originated at the top, leaving that area unsupported, which caused the crack due to lack of support in that area and body flexing of the car.  Lexus has continued to deny the claim.

This is just my experience……To be Forewarned is to be Forearmed.

36,"October 14, 2004","Perhaps the easiest new car purchasing experience of my life!   The finance guy was typical and slick, but never pushed us away from what we originally wanted.  And after-sales service has been outstanding.  I have the car picked up at my home, a loaner car dropped off, and no hassles.   Our salesperson has followed up several times in the last 6 months, just to be sure we are still happy with the car.  Not many other dealers seem to care as much about happy customers.  Too bad Sewell doesn't own other brand dealerships in the area so that all car types could be bought so well.",5.0
