17,"December 31, 2019","Easiest purchase ever made. Exceptional service. Bruce Lee was our salesmen and he was straight forward, no nonsense! Loved our experience! Never thought we would drive to FTW for a vehicle but it was more than worth it. Found the truck we were looking for online. Drove to the dealership, that was open on Sunday for special holiday hours. The truck looked even better in person. Bruce had the truck pulled up and ready for us to test drive as soon as we arrived.

24,"November 11, 2019","I was looking for a Cadillac CTS Coupe, and had reached out to several dealerships at an ungodly hour late at night. Aaron Dias responded in a timely manner, and less than 12 hours after contact, I had an appointment scheduled. The dealership was clean, and everyone was highly professional. Aaron Dias was great to work with and was great on communication before and after the sale (I've never had good post-sale communication will a dealer). I accidentally left a sentimental item in my trade-in, and Aaron held on to it for weeks until I was able to make it back down to the dealership. 
The car was still being serviced when I bought it. Andrew Anderson was terrific at facilitating the service and making sure I was taken care of while my car was being touched up. Even though I bought a used vehicle from them, I definitely got 5-star treatment. Exactly what I'd want in a Cadillac/upper-end dealership. I want my next cars to come from Frank Kent Cadillac!",4.8
25,"November 07, 2019","Aaron and I had been communicating through email about the car I wanted before I showed up. I knew what I wanted and Aaron made it a breeze to go through the process. When I got there, it was sitting out front, all cleaned up for me. Aaron and all employees I encountered were extremely friendly and appreciative of my business. I got the full tour of the dealership, which is the coolest one I have seen. I will definitely be back and will refer anyone in the market to Aaron and the team at Frank Kent!",5.0

27,"September 30, 2019","Our family was in need of a larger vehicle to accommodate our growing family. My wife and I were weary about stepping into another dealership since our most recent visits were very unpleasant and a complete waste of our families time and travel. 

We chalked it up as our last dealership visit as we headed to your dealership after softball and soccer games on Saturday. With all four kids in tow and our banks approval for a loan we went to meet with Aaron Dias to see what we could work out.   

From the moment my wife and I met Aaron, we were made to feel extremely comfortable and that he had our complete attention. (I had mentioned to my wife we would only spend 1hour max if we were not meeting eye to eye with trade and purchase)

Needless to say we were treated with much respect and like family. We also were given a better loan going through your finance than our bank. 

Your dealership will definitely get our return business as well as high recommendations to our friends!!!

Again Thank you to your incredible staff for making our experience extremely pleasant!!

Keep up the fantastic work on building return customers, as we have found our Dealership for future needs.

29,"September 24, 2019","My husband and I worked with Aaron Dias, the internet sales manager, to help us purchase a used truck for our son's birthday.  He made the transaction so easy.  He was enjoyable to talk with, ask questions of and provided feedback without any hassle.  We had been to another dealership and were shocked by how pushy the salesman was and they wouldn't quit going back to the same thing over and over again.  Aaron made us feel like a friend and was always willing to accommodate our requests for information, details, etc.  He really seemed to know his business and he never had to run back and forth to ""someone"" to get information, like we had seen at another dealership.

Aaron was AWESOME! He was patient and very informative. He introduced us to the other members of his team and they were great. Aaron Dias has a forever customer with my family. The drive was definitely worth it. I would reccomend him to any and everyone who is looking to purchase a new or used car!

32,"September 11, 2019","My salesman’s name was Aaron, I made an appointment in advance because I saw online they had a 2019 Chevy Trax and I wanted to make sure it was still available. Well it turns out that the car I wanted was at a different frank Kent dealership. But at my request they transferred it to the closer Fort Worth location. Great snacks available while we waited for everything. Aaron could tell I was missing something on the car and wasn’t completely happy with it, so he asked on our test drive what it was that I wasn’t happy with on the car and I told him I wanted cruise control, so he called someone, found out how much it would be to add it in and was able to roll it into my payments so now the car is perfect for what I wanted. Great overall experience. I’ve been servicing there for years with Danny and will continue to maintain my chevys there. ",4.8

35,"August 28, 2019","The live chat was very helpful which led to having a meeting the next morning. Aaron was able to get information before the meeting to have everything ready in regards to what we were looking for. The deal ended up in Aaron having to drive to car to us at our house to sign papers because we had to leave the dealership before everything was finalized. Aaron was organized , time efficient and was genuine in trying to get what we wanted in a car and price.  Honesty and patience is always appreciated throughout the car buying process.  Finance was great in explaining over the phone . Management was able to call to help make the sell feasible regarding some minor prior setbacks. I’ve always used this dealership for service on my other vehicle and they are great. ",4.8

I absolutely love Frank Kent and Aaron gave me a reason to love them more he was diligent and determined to get me in the right car! Very personable and easy going and such a pleasure to work with. I cant wait to refer him to everyone that I know,5.0
39,"August 15, 2019","I honestly wouldn't purchase a car or service my anywhere else. The Service department staff, especially Randy and Danny ALWAYS provide me with VIP Service. Shawn Moffett has been my sales advisor for my last two CTS vehicles, he is very honest and fair, and goes out of his way to make sure you get the car you want. The only thing that could be a bit better is if the owners were a bit more attentive to their customers requests, but honestly along as Cadillacs makes the CTS Frank Kent will be where I buy and service them.

45,"May 17, 2019","I can not express how amazing my experience was with Frank Kent Cadillac. I had such an easy car buying experience that my husband and I went back and bought a second car from them. We purchased our 2018 Dodge Journey and 2018 Jeep Renegade from Nick Bieghler. The moment we entered the first time he greeted us immediately and showed us many different vehicles that we could purchase. We weren’t in the dealership for hours like we have experienced with many other dealerships. Nick worked with us with our credit scores and kept us around the payment we wanted. He didn’t just stick us in just any vehicle, with 5 kids we needed space but still wanted certain luxury benefits. We were able to stay in his office from start to finish and Nick made sure we were comfortable the entire time. We brought in our 4 month old and he was very welcoming and made sure we were in and out. When we purchased the Renegade we received the same high quality experience we did the first time. Scott helped us with our financing which we thought was going to be a pain but it turned out to be way better than we could have hoped for.  Scott and Nick treated us like family and we will be continued returning customers.",5.0
46,"May 16, 2019","If I could give this dealership zero stars I would. From the moment we started interacting with Nick, our salesman, he touted Frank Kent Cadillac as a dealership that stood by its customer service, its honesty and its cars. We found a vehicle being advertised by Frank Kent on Auto Trader. It was advertised as a certified, pre-owned, non-smoker 2018 GMC Yukon XL (we have multiple ads printed out). Throughout our conversations with Nick, over the phone and on text messages, he swore to us that this vehicle was a non-smoking vehicle. That ""Frank Kent Cadillac kicked smoker cars to the curb"" and they didn't waste time on them. My husband and I went out on a limb to trust Nick and the Frank Kent name and bought the vehicle (we live just outside of Austin). The dealership had it delivered to our house in Austin this morning. IT REEKS OF SMOKE. As the delivery truck was unloading it off the trailer, the delivery guy asked my husband if we are smokers because of how bad the smell was. 
The rest of the morning I have been on the phone with Nick multiple times where he will not admit he lied as our salesman and that the advertisement is fraudulent. He refuses to say that he lied about it being a smoker vehicle. He keeps referencing his professionalism and that ""to the best of his knowledge it was a nonsmoking car"". He said that he would ""go out of HIS way"" to get the car treated for the smoke smell. His way?? Like this isn't his or the dealerships fault. HA.  I then spoke with Kent Hollingsworth the manager of the used cars sales and he also promised to make this right by either paying to have the car ridded of smell or taking the car back and refunding us all of our money. But now, neither of the men will put any of that in writing. (That they would pay for the deodorizing or that they would come pick the vehicle up if the smell was not eliminated and refund us our money.) 
No one with ANY authority at Frank Kent will call us back. 
This dealership and salesmen live up to the used-car dealership reputation. Shady. Dishonest. Unethical.   
They took what was supposed to be a really sweet day for our family and boys and turned it into a nightmare.",1.0

Back in their shop where they told me more expensive repairs were needed . They either did not fix it right the first time or maybe not at all -makes me wonder . Maybe Cadillac is just a terrible product or theIr service dept does not know what is going on . Very unhappy with service , costs, and trust . ",1.6

Zach Jimenez took care of presenting the car for our test drive and answered any questions we had.  I fell in love with the dealership itself and their employees, falling in love with the car later.  They are all very customer oriented and it showed in everything from the time we walked in, through the purchase of filling out papers and given a loaner till our car would be delivered to us the next day after a detailed car wash and inspection.  Upon delivery, Zach asked if I had any questions and I didn't at the time but he has been very helpful with anything I needed to know since.  He found a second key for me and dropped it in the mail, was very happy to not have to purchase a second key for the car.

66,"August 03, 2017","I bought a 2014 Cadillac XTS from there last year. I haven't even had the vehicle over a year and the screen has went out . It has a stack in the Cadillac from the factory . I have called the warehouse , everywhere to speak with managers etc and nobody wants to own up to cadillacs mistakes. The cadillacs ranging from 2013-2015 the stack touch screen goes out where you can not control your Ac controls etc and the warranty does not cover it because the radio is included. That's not the customer fault that Cadillac made the vehicle like that from the factory. They should recall it and fix our car. We paid good money for a Cadillac and to get service and treated like crap is unacceptable . I went to frank Kent drove 3 hours for them to tell me to bring it and we will see if we will help fix it or fix it period under good will. So I drove 3 hours there  and dropped it off. They didn't offer to help me with the diagnostic test even though I have paid for it once in temple Texas Cadillac dealership , they basically said the manager said he doesn't want to deal with this situation sorry. So screw you pretty much your stuck. They charged me 140.00 for the test full service. I don't think that was fair to a customer who had paid 30,000 for a vehicle and haven't even had it a year. This a problem that Cadillac needs to correct because it is not fair to customers who has these problems and has paid good money to get treated this way. The frank Kent dealership gave me great customer service when they was getting my MONEY. Soon as a problem arises don't expect any help. I wouldn't go back now . I wouldn't recommend this dealership again. They didn't even offer to help give a discount or anything . Not good customer service to me when a customer has bought they vehicle from your dealership. Appreciation goes more than just the first meet and greet when your are getting my money. I am very disappointed. Cadillac needs to fix this problem. Recall the stack and be responsible for your vehicle that you put on the market to sell. We are paying customers and derserve to be treated fairly and have a dependable good car. Cadillac to me is luxury and the stack not working and electrical problems is not what I paid for especially when you have kids and family. You can't control your Ac controls etc and then the dealership or Cadillac don't even want to fix it. DISAPPOINTED! ",1.4

Overall, the dealership was honest about the condition of the car; Paul Griggs, our salesman was helpful and honest about the car; the selling price of the car was exceptionally good; everyone we came in contact with at the dealership whether in person or via phone were very professional and nice.  We did not have any negative feelings and hesitation through out the whole process with Frank Kent like we did when we called other car sales dealership.  We told Paul if we were in the market for another car.  We will be sure to call him. ",5.0

Took it directly to Frank kent Cadillac to have them look at it.

It was a great experience with Debbie in the service Depatment. They had the car up and running correctly in two days. Debbie went beyond the call of duty with me
(She has been with Frank Kent  for Prox. 32 or 37 years). She is a proven professional to her field and treated me with the utmost repect.

My car was ready in two days, I paid the Cashier, my car was ready in the delivery isle which was very clean, the car was running with the door open allready, and the
air was alleady going, in the Texas heat. I just got in it and put it in Drive and took off and Debbie also set my clock and all my electrical devices.
 It was great to deal with a professional like Debbie and her Crew at Frank Kent,  a little pricer, but what would you expect from Cadillac.

78,"September 23, 2015","Was knowingly sold a LEMON by this dealership STAY FAR AWAY!!!! Went in a couple months ago to buy my very first Cadillac and was very excited that I found a 2005 Cadillac SRX with 80k miles on it.  My family had outgrew our current car and needed something a little bigger with 3rd row seating.  The vehicle went through there service dept and was inspected, they fixed what they told me was a minor ""oil leak"" (I should of ran away then!)  and the motor in the 3rd row seat.  2 weeks later I had to replace the alternator ($119.99 plus install) I thought to myself ehh no big deal if that's all that is wrong I'm still blessed.  A couple months later my dash lights up like a Christmas tree with Check engine light the engine is bucking like a bronco and misfiring.  I take it to a reputable shop where they tried to flush the engine and do a couple synthetic oil changes but it didn't fix anything,  The SRX needs a whole new engine which will run me $4800.  I called the dealership and got nothing but ""buyer beware"" ""the car is 10 years old what do you expect""  ""we are not responsible for anything"". Now I have a car I'm making payments on that doesn't even run.  I'm a single DAD that cannot afford all these issues and problems I have no idea what I'm going to do.  Please pray for me.",1.0

87,"January 03, 2013","Worked with Brian from out of state based on the lack of competition in my state (only one dealer). Brian provided a competitive fixed price over the internet with all of the options I wanted and had the car in stock waiting for me to sign the paperwork. Once I arrived into town the total transaction time was about 3 hours including: test drive of the vehicle I was purchasing for my spouse and me, trade evaluation and negotiated trade in value and financing (they beat the rates from my credit union that I had already been pre-approved for). No pressure on the financing, maintenance contract, purchase price or other aspects of the transaction.  

Overall, one of the smoothest transactions ever. In addition, their new location is a beautiful dealership with a very friendly and wonderful facilities (waiting room, wine tasting, etc). I only wish they were closer to me so that all of my service was at their facility versus the local one near me.

I also had 491.00 for module the service manager said, 443.00 for springs and some other charge for 4,200.00 after labor. I told them, ""No"", that is not what you told me, I would pick it up, that is way to high. When I went in to pick it up the man gave me his card  and said leave it and he would make sure that it was done right.  He said all the the things that needed to be fixed except the pump, that the service manager said was recommended.  He told me 4200.00 was to get it fixed, not recommended. Then the exit paper  said the air shocks also needed to be fixed., I said I just replaced the air shocks 6 months ago.  He could not figure out what was going on.  He was very nice.  I left the car and then came back 2 hours later paranoid at how far off the prices and stories were.  I picked up my Hummer, it looked fixed.  He told me he would call me Monday, I got no call.  What is real weird is when I picked it up it looked fixed.  He told me they must have blown air in the line and it would go down by tomorrow.  It has been 10 days and the service light is off and it is still working, I saved 4,200.00 and didn't get anything done.

109,"March 19, 2012"," For most, the vehicle purchasing experience typically lends itself to an unwanted chore that usually ends up wasting time and energy. Most of our buying experiences have been descent, but most result in the typical run around, disappointment.  
My wife and I decided it was time to get into another vehicle. After searching local dealerships and even requesting a dealer locate for the vehicle that met our needs, we were still empty handed. We began an out of town search and came upon a Cadillac SRX which was being offered at Frank Kent Cadillac Fort Worth. The vehicle had all the options and amenities we were searching for. Hesitating, because we never bought a vehicle out of town, we mustered up enough courage to contact the dealership. We emailed Frank Kent Cadillac and within minutes we were greeted by Bill Englehardt who was their internet sales consultant. He graciously forwarded all the information we requested and walked us through all the details of purchasing the vehicle. Negotiations was painless and pleasant. Knowing we were trading up, surely there would be some bumpy roads ahead. Not so with these guys. We were pleased with the numbers agreed to. After all the business was completed, Bill stuck with us and spent time insuring we were comfortable with the features our new vehicle. Overall, this was one of the most pleasant experiences we have experienced. I am convinced out of town buying is not the hassle, I had always thought it would be. Frank Kent Cadillac proved customer value is a priority and made a special point to insure we were satisfied. Thanks to the hard work of Bill Englehardt and the staff at Frank Kent Cadillac, we are now proud owners of a Cadillac SRX.

He was very patient and listened to my wants and needs, and despite my skepticism assured me that he could make it happen for me.  Of course I’m thinking where I have heard this before.  To my surprise the following day MJ called me and asked me when I could come to pick up my new car.  I am now the proud owner a 2006 Cadillac CTS, not only that but I’m well on my way to building my credit. Thanks a Million MJ.",5.0
141,"September 21, 2011","I was in Frank Kent a few weeks ago having my 2005 Cadillac serviced, when I walked into the showroom. Debbie immediately came over to help me. I told her I really liked the SRX, and she gave me details about this model and informed me that the 2012 model would have a larger engine. When I stopped by on 9/19/11 ""just looking"" I asked for Debbie and left with my 2012 SRX. She was very professional and did not seem to mind taking as much time as I needed to make the purchase. She went over information about the car, and repeated again when necessary. I give her an A+ for her professionalism and service!!   ",4.8
142,"September 10, 2011","My husband and I were most pleased with the whole experience of buying our SRX.  Bill Englehart was most professional, friendly, and got down to business.  The whole purchase only took a few hours, and we drove our car home that day. I have already recommended this dealership and Bill personally to several friends and coworkers, I hope they experience the good fortune we did. We were most pleased with the handling of our trade-in and those negotiations. Bill explained the process and the factors involved in their price for our car, and made us realized why it was not worth quite as much as we had anticipated, but felt they gave us a fair price. We had planned to shop around the metroplex for the best deal, but did not go anywhere else we were so pleased with the negotiations, service and proximity to our home. We hope to keep this car a long time, but I bet when we are ready for a new one, Frank Kent and Bill Englehart will be our first  ( and only)stop. ",5.0
143,"August 16, 2011","Let me start by saying that it takes a lot to get a 5-star review from me.  It takes even more to get a 5-star review when there has been a bump in the road.  I'm pleased that, based upon my recent purchase experience, I'm able to write a 5-star review for Frank Kent Cadillac.
 
I was placed in contact with Frank Kent through the Costco Auto program.  I made my original Costco Auto request on a Friday and heard back from Brian, the Internet Manager, within a matter of hours.  I let Brian know the car I was looking for (CTS Wagon) and what I would be trading in.  Brian got back to me very quickly with a price for the new car, an estimate of what they would give me for my trade in and what my monthly payments would be.  I was a bit dubious about the amount they were offering on my trade, so figured I would end up a little higher (maybe $750-$1K) than what we were discussing.
 
I wasn't able to make it in that day or the next and they were closed on Sunday.  On Monday I left work early and drove from Dallas to Fort Worth in order to test drive the vehicle and, if I liked it, make a purchase.  I drove the car and it was great.  I'm past falling in love with cars, but, I did thoroughly enjoy the drive.  Their folks looked at my car and put pen to paper and, unfortunately, what they presented to me in person was about $2,500 more than what we had agreed to by e-mail the previous week.  I reminded Brian of our agreement and he left and came back, this time $2,000 more than what we had agreed to previously.  The third attempt left us about $1,000 apart on price.  As an internet buyer, I don't negotiate, haggle or bicker on pricing, so I left.
 
I got an almost immediate e-mail from Brian asking me some questions so he could try to find better pricing for me.  I responded and reminded him of our e-mails the prior week and he responded that he would get back with me the following day.  The following morning, I received an apologetic e-mail from Brian and an offer to sell me the car at the amount that we agreed upon the prior Friday. Since I wasn't able to make it to the dealership that day, Brian delivered the car to me and had me sign all of the paperwork at my house.  
 
When Brian arrived, he pointed out a small scratch on the rear bumper and let me know that he would come pick up the car the following week, bring me a loaner and get the bumper taken care of and he did exactly that.  It required no effort on my part.
 
People make mistakes and businesses make mistakes.  We're all human, so it happens.  The difference between a successful business (one that gets 5-star reviews) and an unsuccessful business is what they do after they make a mistake.  In my case, even though the process wasn't perfect, they worked hard to make things right, to make me happy and to ensure my satisfaction and they succeeded on all three counts.
 
I would have no problems recommending Frank Kent Cadillac or Brian to any of my friends.  They have shown that they care about making their customers happy and about their reputation.

144,"August 05, 2011","In searching for a new vehicle, we had test driven MANY different makes/models. Finally had decided between Honda Crosstour & Cadillac CTS. Oliver Rose was so helpful at FK Honda with their vehicles, especially the Crosstour and then I mentioned I wanted to drive the Cadillac; he offered to take us over. He walked with us, got a couple of keys, rode with us and explained as much as he could at that time. Bill Engelhart was our salesman at the Cadillac dealership, once we made our decision on the Cadillac CTS. He let us test drive and he explained the CTS in depth. We also met and talked with Debbie Wilson, a very nice lady and she voluntarily told very much about the CTS. By far, the Cadillac is the BEST decision. The car drives with ease, smooth, no road noise, easy in & out, easy to operate features and beautiful design. I was able to get the color of my choice. It was amazing that there was no high pressure sales pitch, we were given all the time needed to make our decision; that is a real plus. Each staff member we came in contact with was very pleasant and helpful. Will definetly deal with FK again and recommend to family & friends!",5.0

Outstanding job guys. Thank you FKC for all your help. It was all Quick and Painless. They bent over backwards to serve us.

Thank you ,

147,"July 22, 2010","Great service.  Great people.  Great price.

I shopped four dealerships and soliticed bids from each.  Frank Kent gave the best trade-in/new car price package.  No hassles.  The key is that they listened really hard to everything I said and tried their best to accomodate my requests.  For example, I said I don't want to spend more than an hour at the dealership signing papers and picking up my new car.  i spent about 45 minutes there

Also, the owner of the dealership took the time (about 15 minutes) to come out and meet my wife and I and chat.  When was the last time you met a car dealership owner ?

I highly recommend this dealership !

148,"May 23, 2010","Would only give me 18,000 for my SRX with 11.000 miles on it.  They claimed they could not resell it that they would have to auction it.  It was in excellent condition and even smelled brand new on the inside despite being 2 years old.  It was only driven on the weekends and even then not every weekend.  Blue book was 25,000.  Then would not budge on a new SRX except for dealer incentives which was about 2000. I went to Jerry's in Weatherford and they paid off my car which was 28,000 and came down more than 5500 on a new SRX.",2.3
