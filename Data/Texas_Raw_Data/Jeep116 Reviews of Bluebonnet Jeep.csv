12,"March 03, 2020","Drove 2 1/2 hours to purchase my second Jeep from BlueBonnet Jeep. I had checked all the jeep dealers in the local area, they either didn't have the vehicle I wanted or the price/trade-in was all wrong. Found what I wanted at BlueBonnet, on-line. Contacted them and Jeremiah Kimball, got back to me in just minutes, we worked out a fair trade-in, I told him the vehicle I was looking for. He found 2 with the options I wanted, I picked the color. We set a pickup date and time. When I arrived at dealership the car was prepped and ready to go. We did a orientation, walk around and test drive. The paperwork was all ready, signed it and was on my way home in under 2 hours. With no back in forth BS, painless. Jeremiah did a great job, even had the coffee and fresh donut ready, part of the deal. Jeremiah has followed up several times to make sure everything is ok. He is a great guy, friendly, professional and knowledgeable of the product he is selling. easy to work with.",5.0
13,"March 03, 2020","Was disappointed in the service at Bluebonnet Ford service department and quick lane. In talking to the guys at the service department, to the actual service was very disappointing to me.  Still don’t understand why you get “special service” only if you drive a Lincoln.  I guess equal customer service doesn’t exist anymore.
The cleaning of the inside and outside of my 2020 vehicle was not great.  It was back 6 months ago, but the service department isn’t as friendly and helpful and the service isn’t either.  And two of the caps that go on the tire valve stem we’re gone, interior and exterior not cleaned as well as before.  Waiting for oil change, tire rotation, and cleaning interior and exterior and all else that goes with it, to be told it would take 6 hours, and this is with an appointment, unless I ad a Lincoln, then it would be a much shorter time, that’s not really very customer service.  Does this mean if you have money to buy a more expensive vehicle, you get treated better?  Sounds like very bad customer service if people get preferential treatment depending on what high dollar car they drive.  If a customer is spending money at your dealership, I thought a buying customer is still a customer. SMH",2.0

20,"June 11, 2019","Disappointed only a few months later...

1.  I was sold an additional Maintenance Plan and later came to find out that it didn't in fact cover anything close to what was discussed.  In fact, the plan application wasn't even completed.  The servicing dealer (Not BlueBonnet) had to pull the contract info manually from the plan administrator to realize it wasn't completed properly.

2.  As part of my purchase of a used 2016 Tundra, I requested that the clear plastic ""Chip Guard"" material which is applied to the edges of the doors, hood, fenders, and other locations on the truck get removed.  This material degrades over the years and looks terrible on white vehicles.  Well, the dealer agreed and seemingly melted the material off the vehicle, leaving a very ugly and very sticky mess all along the truck.  Several washes (and hand waxes) later and it's still not completely removed.

I'm not angry - I'm just irritated.  I'm irritated that I can't get anyone on the phone to discuss these concerns.  I'm irritated that this is just one of those dealerships that is only concerned with moving product, and not building a working relationship with their customers.  

I wonder how many return customers they have?  I certainly won't be one of them.",2.0
21,"May 21, 2019",I went in this evening after work to talk to Jose Soria who was recommended to me through my mother when I told her I was interested in purchasing a new to me vehicle. She had purchased the family's last couple of vehicles through him and assured me the was no better man to go to. She was absolutely rite!!! It was a long day already but I went to speak to him anyway to see what we could work out. When I got there I was greeted immediately by Jose who sat me down to get some info to get things rolling. He offered me a bottled water before taking me to the other lot to pick up the car that I was interested in and let me drive it back to the main office. It's was everything I wanted. Shortly after arriving we talked numbers and went to talk to Jannelle in financing who was extremely helpful and extremely nice as well... she walked me through the process and was able to help me get things situated with a payment I was comfortable with and then back to Jose who was able to help me finish up the process and help me go home with the car of my dreams... it may not be brand new but it's new to me and I definitely feel confident in my purchase of the white 2014 Dodge Challenger r/t  that Jose and the sales staff at bluebonnet helped me get into. I would highly recommend Jose Soria to anyone looking to purchase their dream car from a man who genuinely cares about his customers and helping you achieve the car of your dreams!!! ,5.0
22,"April 03, 2019","I would like to thank everyone at Bluebonnet for the Superior job they did! Scott Bittick our sales associate, Janelle in financing they were above and beyond most dealerships we worked with on our journey on our new Jeep. The dealership also does not add the 1,500 to 2,000 dealer package like others do. I would highly recommend this dealership to anyone that would like to have a enjoyable car purchasing experience. Thanks again we will be back on our next purchase!!! ",5.0
23,"March 25, 2019","I dont typically leave reviews but felt it necessary in this case. Jose treated me with the utmost respect. He found the perfect Jeep for me and made the process of trading in my previous Jeep seamless. I will recommend him and this dealership over and over again. I was in and out of the dealership within an hour or two and treated with honesty, trust and respect (unlike any other car buying experience I've ever had). Jose goes above and beyond for his customers and is indispensable an asset to this company. Thank you to Jose and Bluebonnet Jeep!!

30,"May 23, 2018"," This was the first time I bought a car on my own and only my second car, it was just a really pleasant experience. I went in on a Saturday to see what their used car inventory looked like and right away Jose Soria was super helpful. They had the exact car I was looking for, but I wasn't sure if I wanted to get it just yet and did not feel like he was trying to push me into it. I went back in on Tuesday to get it and same experience. Everything was just really smooth and easy. 10 out of 10 would recommend Bluebonnet and Jose. I never once felt like I was being taken advantage of.   ",5.0

32,"April 04, 2018",This was one of the smoothest purchases I've ever made. No sitting for hours on end. No signing paperwork for hours on end. No hassles or selling of what I didn't want or need. From the sale (Jose Soria) to financing this was a great deal. Do I recommend them - Absolutely! Will I go back - Absolutely. My mother was so impressed she is ready to turn her vehicle in (purchased in another state) just to get the deals I have and her car isn't even two years old.,5.0

34,"January 09, 2018","I recently purchased a vehicle from Bluebonnet Jeep and ask for a print out of the codes. I did not recive a copy of the codes, but was told it was just the tire air pressure. I was not offered any warranty for the vehicle. After purchase I took it to my mechanic... Who said there were NO CODES. For a used vehicle this is only possible if the codes are cleared.... intentionally! Very shortly after (a week or two) I started having transmission issues. In the end I ended up having to completely replace the transmission... This was 1/2 again the cost of the entire vehicle!
Do not purchase from this chain!.... I thought I would get honest dealings from a larger Ford Jeep dealer... Nope! When we tried to reach out to the dealership, they just gave US the run around! I have recently been in contact with the dealership and they informed me they have no clue how to deal with a Toyota, and that they never have been asked to print out a code history, also sent over the paperwork from our mechanic and the bill from our mechanic that shows the code history that was pulled from the truck before we replaced our transmission our selves! I have still not heard back from them in response to this and they always claim they have tried calling I also left a phone number on the email for them to contact me and still nothing.",1.2
35,"September 04, 2017","Just purchased a pre own car for my wife.  This was the most pleasant, no hassle, no pressure purchase I have made at a auto dealership in my lifetime (and I'm pretty old).  I owe it all to Ms. Nancy Galyon, the sales person who sold us the car.  She understood where we were coming from and met our needs to the T.  Her associates were also very good.  There was the obligatory sales pitch for other adds like extended warranty and car service however after we listened politely and then declined that was the end of it.  Really appreciate that!  Thanks Nancy and Blue Bonnet Motors! ",5.0

38,"August 12, 2017","My husband and I have bought many cars over the years! We lived in Texas previously and had purchased at BlueBonnet twice before b/c we found pricing to be the most competitive on Jeeps. We are back in Texas now - Lytle - and while it is a drive to New Braunfels, we decided to try it again since the inventory of New Grand Cherokee Jeeps was impressive. My husband contacted the dealership initially online and was fortunate to reach Russ Schriewer! He was the first sales POC to respond and was very responsive over the next couple of days answering all of our questions completely and very quickly. He even identified to my husband which vehicles he would recommend and discussed the value, etc of our trade in vehicle. We made the trip to New Braunfels and he was very knowledgeable and his manner of interaction with us was exactly what we would have wanted. No stress, no pressure, just friendly discussion and informed input - which is very unusual in a typical car buying experience! He negotiated a fair price for us on the Jeep we selected and since the finance managers were all tied up on the Jeep side - he went above and beyond and got us lined up with a financial manager over at the Ford building! This expedited our car buying experience and saved us a lot of time. As a side note, he selected Cody Hooper for us and we were also very pleased with this part of the car buying experience. Thank you so much for the professionalism and the beautiful new Jeep! We will be back and will definitely be recommending Russ to anyone who is interested in a Jeep! Larry & Sally Pennington",5.0

JAKE  JOHNSON IN FINANCE WAS ALSO VERY HONEST, QUICK AND PLEASANT.  ",5.0
40,"August 03, 2017","Worked with Jose Soria, and can't explain how great the experience/sale went from beginning to end. Went to the dealership and Jose was very honest in what we could do within our budget. Took his advice and saw him again a couple months after that visit. With Joses great advice, honesty, and our budget in mind we left extremely satisfied with our new grand Cherokee! Above that his patience was greatly appreciated as we had our 1 year old twins and 6 yr old with us :)

Cannot remember the gentlemans name who helped us with final paper work In the finance department but he too had great patience with us and worked hard to get interest numbers from different lenders as low as possible.",5.0
41,"July 18, 2017","One of the better car buying experiences I've had!  From the first phone call to Jeff to signing the purchase order, Jeff was friendly and professional.  He is extremely knowledgeable of the product he sells, he and his wife drive Jeeps themselves!   He was very patient with us and took the time to help us find the right vehicle for my daughter.  If you're looking for a Jeep, he's your man and BB Jeep is your stand alone Jeep dealership.  Life is good in a Jeep!

They were helpful, extremely patient, and truly a please to talk to during the entire process. I wasn't pushed into buying anything and they let me judge the vehicle for myself.

59,"February 09, 2017","I traded in a 2015 for a 2017 75th Anniversary Wrangler and got a great deal, but the best part of the deal was the service. My salesman was Ty Houser and he bent over backwards for me. I knew what I wanted and was not hard to please, but Ty made the entire process totally painless. If Ty did not know the answer, he found out. Most sales reps are a little on the pushy side trying to make a sale, but Ty was more concerned with making sure that I got what I wanted. Now I'm working on getting my wife a new car there also. It's not the closest dealership, but it is the one that I will go back to for any of my automotive needs. Annie Esman set me up with a vehicle protection package like I have never seen. She did a great job also. I cannot recommend Ty highly enough. He made this experience the best I have ever been through and I will be a Jeep owner for life!!",5.0

Mr. Soria wasn't overbearing at all, and gave us room to breath and make decisions. He also answered all our questions patiently.

63,"January 31, 2017","My wife and I visited a local dealership in San Antonio. Salesman there told us Jeep just did not offer incentives. He was nice, but did not make me feel comfortable. I did a Google search for Jeep dealerships and saw that Bluebonnet in New Braunfels had a 4.5 out of 5 star rating. The first one had a 2 something. Decided it was worth a trip out to New Braunfels and met Jose Soria. We test drove 2 vehicles, a V6 and V8, and got  a $25 dollar Amazon gift card. Did some more research and went back about a week later. Jose worked with us and we got the car we wanted. This was best car buying experience I've had. Jose even helped get the new SUV ready when his crew was busy. Great service and I think a great price. Bottom line, if you are looking for a Jeep you owe it to yourself to go to Bluebonnet and ask for Jose. ",4.8
64,"January 20, 2017",I showed up to look at a used Outback expecting to be given the typical hard sale pressure from a used car salesman but the exact opposite is what I received from Jose.

I have not expierenced great customer service until coming to him at this dealer. The finance was helpful explaining everything to me, I got a great deal.

67,"January 06, 2017","I shopped around at three different dealerships before going to Bluebonnet Jeep in New Braunfels. All the other dealerships used the same old tactics when trying to sell you a new car, but Bluebonnet Jeep was different. Before I drove out there I was in contact with Ty Houser to make sure the vehicle I was looking for was available. He made sure it was and even kept the keys in his pocket for me. The negotiation process was great. When we were talking about price and I didn't like the first numbers offered for my trade in he said: ""This is the part of my job where I ask what we can do to make the deal.""  I liked how he kept it honest with me and had a no-nonsense way of helping me purchase a new vehicle. We were able to come to an agreement on a  new Jeep Grand Cherokee Trailhawk very easily, and Mr. Houser was kind enough to give my wife and I some privacy in his office while we talked it over. Everyone else I had to pleasure of dealing with was very friendly and made me feel like they valued my business.

His financing team was also extremely helpful and got me a great rate....  nothing but thumbs up here!!!!,5.0

His customer service speaks for itself. You won't be disappointed if you buy your next car from him :) ,5.0
82,"May 05, 2016","First of all, I am a very hard customer to deal with. Since I got that out of the way, Jose always shot me straight and told me everything up front. This buying experience was by far the easiest I have ever had. I will be back to BlueBonnet for another vehicle later and will make sure to request Jose again. ",5.0

93,"January 02, 2016","We went to bluebonnet jeep looking for one jeep in particular. Almost immediately some one was by our side to assist us. They knew their inventory and took us right to the jeep. Personally I was allowed to crawl under the vehicle, pop the hood, and take it for a test drive. It was easy to negotiate price and there were plenty of finance options presented to us. All the staff was cordial and we were treated with respect. For a car buying experience it was as satisfactory as they get. It's the type of place that values its customers. ",4.8
94,"December 12, 2015","Worked with Jeff Wegman to purchase a 2016 Wrangler Rubicon.  Very low pressure process, which is unusual for car buying.  Other dealers want to push their financing on you and all the after market options but they were not like that.  I went to a couple other Jeep dealers during this process and by far this was the best experience of the bunch.",4.8
95,"December 06, 2015","I had inquired about a jeep several months ago and befriended jose. At the time i wasn't exactly ready to buy, but last night after calling me back, Jose and i had agreed on everything over the phone. due to the fact that he was busy, he called me back pretty late, but himself,  Steve Fekkos, Aubrey Platt Fonda, and sales manager stayed an hour after close to make sure i was taken care of. Everything he promised me  over the phone was exactly how it turned out and more. Literally the easiest car buying experience i have ever had.. i personally have bought several vehicles from bluebonnet and hands down they have the best people in the dealership industry. Mr Kahlig has really put together a dream team of family and god fearing men and women. So again thanks for all the help to everybody at bluebonnet jeep, and a special thanks to my friend, Jose Soria.  ",5.0
96,"December 01, 2015","I am now a two-time owner of a Bluebonnet Jeep. I came to the dealership intending to buy, and experienced a great buying experience with Jeff Wegman. He listened when I told him what I was looking for, and he helped me find it. I never felt rushed or pressured. Bluebonnet advertises ""no hassles"" and that was the case. I was given a very fair trade, and Jerry Valdez also provided a very positive experience with the financing. I knew I didn't want to purchase from a San Antonio dealership, and I made the right choice with Bluebonnet (again). Thank you!",5.0
97,"November 13, 2015","I have bought many, many vehicles, and this was by far the easiest and most hassle-free encounter I have ever had at any Dealership. I shopped San Marcos Jeep first, and when they didn't have what I was looking for on the lot, they tried to talk me into something they did have. I dealt with Lauren Guess and I highly recommend you seek her out, but don't be afraid to deal with anyone at this dealership. They all act very professionally, so I am sure they won't tolerate anyone who is not. I knew I was going to have to order one, and once I said that, all I heard was ""OK"". This is how you earn repeat business.",5.0
98,"November 12, 2015","Jose was extremely helpful and knowledgeable in the process of the sale of my Jeep, He was quick and made sure I was finished with my entire purchase within  a few hours,  He was on top of things and even though he had other customers, he didn't put me aside once the deal was made, He was very thorough and followed the sale to the very end, I have told several friends and relatives about how satisfied my buying experience was and have highly recommended they come see Jose for their buying needs.

99,"November 09, 2015",Cheyne Carnahan is a young man that did a great job assisting me. I ordered a vehicle in transit and it became overdue as no fault of the dealer.

I was only inquiring but everything fell in place and after 2 1/2 hours I was an ower of a 2015 Jeep Wrangler.  No hassle or pressure.  Jose, my salesman, was nothing short of awesome!  I will go back to him when I am in the market for my next vehicle.",5.0
104,"July 08, 2015","Although I ultimately didn't purchase from Bluebonnet like I had hoped :/ I had the best experience when I went in for a test drive. Nancy and I had been in contact through email and phone, and when I finally met her she was just THE BEST. I was looking for a very specific Renegade and she even checked ahead to see if they had any in transit that would fit my needs and wants. She was very kind and willing to go out of her way to help me determine what I was wanting. I would definitely go back in the future!",5.0
105,"June 11, 2015",My husband purchased his jeep from this dealership 3 years ago and we have had nothing short of excellent service. Two weeks ago I went into Bluebonnet Jeep to trade in my car and received excellent service as well. I left with my new Jeep Cherokee Trail Hawk and absolutely love it. Jeff Wegman is a first class salesperson and has answered several questions I have had about my Jeep since my purchase. I would highly recommend both Bluebonnet Jeep and Jeff Wegman for your next purchase.,5.0
106,"March 27, 2015","This time, I decided to look into buying a used car...my search started online, where I encountered Jose Soria.  He immediately asked significant questions which I hadn't even thought of.  He quickly found me what I was looking for and asked me to consider my options and discuss it with the family.  What a great guy!!!  When we met Jose at the dealership he greeted us with a smile and helped us feel at ease.  He was never pushy, very professional, knowledgeable and super honest (believe me, I did my research)!!! Oh, one last thing...he's great with kids, my daughter (toddler) fell in love with him!!!",5.0
107,"March 13, 2015","I recently visited Bluebonnet to check out their selection of 14 Cherokees.

108,"February 27, 2015","Great car purchase from a top notch salesman, Jeff Wegman! Jeff took me through the sales process rapidly in the depth of detail essential for an informed decision. The decision part was easy with the car showing the excellence asserted by the dealership and a price that could not be ignored. If trust, confidence and a market beater deal are important to you in the car purchase experience, see Jeff Wegman!   Texas Cavalry.",5.0

110,"January 15, 2015",Service dept is a joke as far as professional customer service is concerned.  Their management cares only about the bottom line apparently and has no idea how to provide professional customer service. I would stay away from this area - you might be able to buy a vehicle there with no problem but the clowns in the service dept are clueless,1.0
111,"December 24, 2014","I was referred by a friend. .. The sales person I was recommended to met me with kindness and directed to Jeff Wegman since she was with a customer.   Jeff was patient,  helpful, honest and kind.  I highly recommend BB Jeep and Jeff as your Salesman.  My whole experience on Saturday was awesome,  from walking on the lot threw finance and finally getting the keys to my new truck.",4.8
112,"December 05, 2014","I did some research online, went in, and Jeff and the staff took care of the rest for me. There was a place for my kids to hang out, fresh coffee, and clean restrooms. My wife and I were amazed at how easy and quickly we went from test-drive to drive-off. I couldn't be happier about my puchase, especially because of the deal I received-thought it had to be an ""accidental"" online price like i had heard about at other dealerships. They did me right, and it's the only place I can recommend.",5.0
113,"September 26, 2013","Ok, so I absolutely HATE everything the car buying process. So it was with much trepidation that I that I walked onto the Bluebonnet Jeep Lot in New Braunfels looking at a nice lil Beemer they had on their lot. This polished, professional looking young guy, maybe 30 ish, in a dress shirt, tie and slacks comes out to greet me and I’m thinking… ok, “here it comes”. And I say “here it comes” because I don’t like nor need to “be sold” a car, I’m here to buy one, just treat me professionally, respectfully, and don’t BS me and we’ll get along just fine. Problem is most of these slick sales guys haven’t figured that out yet. Ray, as I learned was his name was different, he was personable, without being full of you know what, and shot straight with me from the get go. The car on their lot was a little more than I wanted to pay and not really what I wanted. So he asked me what I was looking for and I told him, “preferably a late model BMW”… yeah I know at the Jeep dealer?? So he says, “let’s see what we have”… what I didn’t know at the time was they have a HUGE inventory of used cars on almost a dozen lots to choose from. He shows me a bad xxx lil 09 335i 2 door that’s priced right on another lot that I really like. Makes the call, we go down and check it out and I’m like, ok here’s what I’m willing to pay. He talks to his sales mgr., I show them the money for the down payment of about 20%, I fill out a credit app knowing I have less than sterling credit, and “boom”… done deal! In and out in about an hour or so! NO BS, NO Haggling, and NO up sell buy the finance guy. I later found out Ray told him “just hook him up, and he doesn’t want any bells and whistles”. My new car is freakin awesome!! The folks at Blue Bonnet Motors, were very cool and Ray is my new “go to” guy to buy a car. Thanks Ray!!",5.0
114,"September 09, 2013","I have always had trouble with car salespeople, and car dealerships in general, but after my experience with Bluebonnet and Raymond Pownall, I was pleasantly surprised. Raymond was so courteous, professional, and knowledgeable. He listened to what I wanted, and really seemed to get down to business and not waste my time. I recommend checking out Bluebonnet, and definitely requesting to work with Raymond.",4.8
115,"March 27, 2013","This dealership ""sold out from under me"" the Jeep I agreed to buy and had driven 75 miles to purchase.
The prior weekend, I had gone to the dealer and negotiated a deal on a new Grand Cherokee. We could not come to agreement, but when I left, they had a signed written offer from me for a new GC. Later that week, they called me and stated they will take my offer after all. We set up an appointment for Saturday morning for me to pick up the vehicle. When I arrived that Saturday morning, they told me they couldn't find the vehicle. When I pressed, they admitted thay had sold it earlier that morning to another customer (I assume for more money).
I consider this a dishonest dealership due to this. I was out the 150 mile roundtrip, and 4 hours of my time.",1.5
