Very professional.  Nice.  He brought us special coffee and filled the car up with gas for us and was so nice to our daughter.  He offered to let us take cars home a couple of times to try them out.  Always professional and nice in all correspondence and not pushy like some salesman.  Thanks Kevin!

9,"November 06, 2018","I had recently purchased new tires on an short schedule basis. I knew I needed to have a wheel alignment done. I normally schedule the service for my vehicle on-line ahead of time, but since we were in Lubbock for my wife's medical appointments, I thought I would stop by Gene Messer Hyundai service department and inquire about scheduling a wheel alignment and oil change and the charges for the service. Knowing that we live an hour and a half away, they told me they could take care of my needs right then. In less than an hour and a half, they had the alignment and oil change done, the car washed and we were on our way. The service staff and management at this dealership is excellent!!! I own two Kia vehicles that have never been serviced anywhere else.",5.0

I wasn't interested in a new car but, my salesman, Michael Covington, found me a new car with all the features I wanted for that same price as  the used cars I had been looking at!  He wasn't pushy and spent considerable time looking for the right car.  He found it in Oklahoma and had it brought to the dealership. I live several hours from Lubbock.

24,"July 12, 2018","I researched choices for a vehicle and found the Hyundai Kona was something sporty and practical I just graduated college and it was at a price that I could afford. It drives and looks like a higher priced vehicle. I wanted a particular color that was not in stock at the Lubbock dealership.

117,"August 01, 2016","It's hard to describe in words exactly how much it meant to me when Alex Woolsey spent all week with me on working out a deal. Not only just spending all week and never saying quit, but to also do it mostly through text and emails. Alex is a top notch salesman and will go above and beyond to help you out. 

I know he was not the only person involved in making the deal happen as I have to thank the management team. They upped my trade-in $1250 over initial value to help me out with the down payment portion that was needed by the lender. Sorry to admit it, but even my own dealer that I work at was not willing to remotely go as far as Gene Messer Hyundai did for me.

What's the crazy part? Alex got up on his own time and opened up the doors on a Sunday to have me finish up paperwork and drive off in my new 2016 Veloster Turbo! He wasn't quick about it either. He wanted to make sure that I had information and that everything was great before leaving. I did not feel rushed or pressured by him or at anytime during the process all week.

All I can say is if you're looking for a great vehicle with a lot of gadgets that are almost not standard in most vehicles these days. Then look at Hyundai and if you are looking for not only just a great price but one of the best car buying experiences that you can ever have then visit Alex Woolsey.",5.0
118,"July 17, 2016","My husband and I both work in a Customer Service based job. He delivers Customer Service everyday and I mange a team that delivers Customer Service, so we both understand the importance of both positive and negative feedback. That being said we both also know the difference between a poor, fair, good, and excellent service. Your team delivered excellent service from the moment we walked in the door.  Our Mazda 6 will be paid off soon so we knew we wanted to buy new within the next 4 months. We had been doing research for a couple of months and wanted to start looking and test driving about a month before we knew we were ready to buy. This would allow us to continue to look if we did not like the two we had chosen, I had narrowed it down to a Mazda Miata and the Genesis Coupe 3.8. Since I was going to be the primary driver of the vehicle I already had my heart set on a Mazda Miata. I had always wanted one. We test drove it first to see if it would live up to my expectations, it delivered. I was sold. While talking to the Salesman, I was telling him what other vehicle we were looking at and giving him all the pros to the Miata, I think he thought it was a done deal. My husband convinced me to stop and go look at the Genesis Coupe, truth be told, I think the Genesis Coupe was the one he really wanted.   I am pretty particular about the interior of the vehicle. I knew we wanted a standard transmission and I wanted cloth seats, we have had issues with the leather seats in our current car. I knew going in that this may not be an option, the standard transmission was only advertised with the leather seats on line (one of the cons to the Genesis, or so I had told myself). I knew what color car I did not want so this was going to limit our options as well. I think secretly I was trying to make this as difficult as I could, I still wanted the Miata.  As soon as we got out of the car Dakota M. was there and greeted us with a smile. He asked if we knew what we were looking for and how he could help, so we told him we wanted to drive the Genesis Coupe. I also told him upfront that I was there to humor my husband, I was sold on the Miata. He asked us to come inside so we could discuss what we wanted, so he could help find the best fit. We drove both the Standard and Automatic cars to feel the difference. We went back inside and I had a lot of questions and requests. It was at this time we learned it was Dakota's first day, I felt a little bad that I was being so particular. He was great, he smiled the whole time, and if he did not know the answer to a question he did not pretend to know or make something up. He just apologized and said he could find the right answer, this is where Jeff comes in. He was also fantastic and extremely helpful. They both continued to get answers and when it came down to the specifics of what I wanted, it was determined there was not a vehicle that met all may wants on the lot. Jeff did a great job looking outside of Lubbock and found one in Odessa. Then we had to discuss when we could afford to buy and why we may need to wait. Jeff and Dakota presented a couple of different options and found one that fit our budget and fit it now, not 2 months from now. At this point, your teams customer service had made such an impression on me, I was sold on the Genesis. It was the Customer Service we received that at Gene Messer Hyundai that truly sold this car.  Fast forward a week. We had an issue with the Driver side tint. It was coming up at the corner. When we went to get our plates, I was a little nervous to bring it up. Based on previous experiences with other dealerships, I was afraid it would be a fight, or would cost me to get this looked at, after all they had already sold the car, there was no need to go above and beyond. I mentioned it to both Dakota and Jeff. They said that should not be happening and it was not problem to bring it in so their tint guy could fix it. I scheduled to come in. When I arrived both Dakota and Jeff were out, I was afraid I would have to come back. This is where Casey stepped in. He made sure I got a car to drive for the day and made sure my tint was taken care of. This is just another example of how your entire team took ownership and helped out.  I realize this is long and apologize for the length. I felt it was important for you to know that I was not the easiest customer to deal with. Looking for a new car is on the top of my list for things I don't enjoy based of passed experiences. This experience has changed that. I have told all my friends, rated you 5 stars on Google, and have praised your team on Facebook. What a great group you have....",5.0

They didn't seem at all interested in making us happy as customers, nor did they attempt to work with us when we discovered they had misled us, nor even attempt to be fair, kind people in this process.

I have had experiences working with dealers before when my girlfriend was buying a car and honestly was dreading the prospect of talking with dealers for my own car. Out of all of the dealers I contacted, Gene Messer Hyundai was the only dealership who were upfront with me in regards to every question I had. My salesperson (Jeremy Safran) was very helpful and made the process incredibly easy, and more importantly, he actually made it fun. I spent weeks searching for the best deal I could find, and found one in Houston that was a few thousand dollars cheaper. I asked if they would be able to match this price since it was a much closer drive to Lubbock, and they not only agreed to match it, but they actually beat it! The next challenge was actually getting to the dealership because of my work schedule, so they offered to bring the car to me (roughly 120 miles away) at no charge! The finance team was great as well! Never once did they pressure me to buy any extra packages or warranties. They informed me of what they offered, and when I declined they left it at that. Overall I was very impressed with my experience at this dealership. I got a great deal on my 3.8L R-Spec Genesis Coupe, they brought it to me at not extra charge, and at no point throughout this entire process did I feel pressured or rushed. They were honest, straightforward, and actually made what I was expecting to be a miserable experience into a very enjoyable one!
