0,"June 22, 2017","Our sales person G'Anna King was outstanding!!! First she listened to what we wanted and then kept in touch weekly until she had just the right vehicle for us. We drove 4 hrs, one way, to get our truck. It was worth every mile. G'Anna was friendly, informative, honest and most of cared about getting us into the vehicle that was right for our family that we could afford. Be sure and ask for G'anna King when you go in because we are very happy and will buy our next vehicle at WestStar!!!

3,"April 23, 2010","Since I lived in Monahans, I really wanted to shop locally for my next vehicle.  However, from the time I stepped in the door at Weststar the experience was unfriendly.  The lady at the front desk did not greet me and kept me waiting while she finished a personal phone call.  My plan was to trade in a Mustang GT on a used Avalanche.  Cain wanted give me half of the Blue Book trade in value because he said, ""Mustangs are very hard to sell.  You have to have perfect credit to get them.""  Cain also used my cell phone to explain the situation to my husband then he threw my phone down on his desk.  I ended up going to the Sewell dealer in Crane who gave me full Blue Book value on my ""hard to sell"" Mustang and $4,000 in incentives plus, I got a new Chevy Avalanche cheaper then the used one at Weststar.  It is worth the drive to shop somewhere else.  Weststar is unprofessional and unwilling to do what it take to make the customer happy.
