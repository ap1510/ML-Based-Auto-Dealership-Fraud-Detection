He was down to earth, honest, and very professional. From sales, service and finance, I would highly recommend Gillman.",5.0
1,"May 09, 2017","I have never been lied to or treated with such disrespect, it’s disgusting.

I wasn’t looking to purchase a new car until the end of the year because I still have to pay off my current car which I am giving to my mother as a gift. A salesperson that I met off the lot couldn’t wait and was trying to make something happen. 

The saleswoman was trying to run my credit way to soon before we even agreed on final numbers. After agreeing to the final numbers in writing and double checking, I finally agreed to give her my credit my info. She told to me to come pick up the car after work and to sign some more paperwork. When I arrived, they ADDED another $5,000.00 to the PRICE. When I told her that this was wrong, she tried to tell me that I didn’t understand or I was confused about the deal. After calling her out on that BS, she admitted that she misunderstood her GM Bob and that this was the new deal. She apologized but kept trying to close the deal with no hesitation. I was upset because I would have never given my credit information or pursue the vehicle for that price. It was a HARD inquiry on my credit, lowering my score 15-17 points and it was all for nothing.

The worst part was her Manager ROBERT BORDIERI tried to tell me I misunderstood and that running my credit would not affect my score at all. He told me that it’s only a soft inquiry that only stays on your credit for 2 and a half months... WOW! So either he lies so much with great ease or he’s an idiot who’s somehow became a manager at a car dealership. 

I called their corporate office and Debbie the assistant to the executives was very short with me and quick to put the blame on me on the 1st phone call. She didn’t even remember me on the 2nd phone call. I asked to speak or get the contact info for one of the executives and she would not give me anything. All she said is that they will call me in a day or two. It’s been two weeks since the last call... All I got was call from the GM Bob apologizing for the Manager’s incorrect comments about credit and how we could close a deal. 

All in all, this company and dealership have shown NO PROFESSIONALISM, NO CUSTOMER SERVICE, NO RESPONSIBILITY, NO INTEGRITY AND NO HONOR. What is sad is that they probably take advantage of so many folks who don’t know any better so they will just keep on going treating good people like nothing. So whether if you’re a 1st time buyer or it’s your 5th car, don’t go to GILLMAN. I shared my nightmare experience with a couple of friends and not to my surprise, they also had a bad experience at GILLMAN. 

I once worked in the car industry but now work in a different industry which also consist of sales and customer service so I know how people should be treated. With that being said, this place is HORRIFIC. ",1.0
2,"October 25, 2016","So my experience started out by finding a 2006 WRX on autotrader.com for basically 10k. So I went to their website to make sure then had it. Found it there so I gave them a call and set up an appointment to see it at 7pm that evening. Talked to they salesman Jim to set it up and then when I left Austin, just to let him know I would be 10 min late. So after my 1hr and a half to get there me and my wife wait around for 20 min to see him. And that's fine. But when he takes me to see the car he didn't bring the keys... so I asked if he could get them because I wanted to test drive it and look at the engine. So he told me he would grab them and be back in just a min. So I inspect the outside of the car which had some damage and missing trim that they didn't tell me about. The inside of the car HAD NOT been cleaned. Had half filled coke bottles and Wendy's just all over the car. Which at point my wife was out. But I was still sold and nothing I couldn't fix as long as it ran. BUT 30 MINUTES after he said he would get they keys he wasn't back. So we wenthought and trod to find him. No one would help us locate him. So got I'm my car to leave and finally found him.... giving a test drive to another customer. So I asked him why he left us there for 30 min. And he said they didn't know where the keys were so he sent someone to tell me... BS no he did not. That car was sold but I honestly wouldn't take it for free from this dealership now. And that salesman should be fired. No way to run a business or treat your customers. ",1.0
3,"October 11, 2016","I had a verbal agreement with the salesman and finance manager to purchase a vehicle from Gilman Mitsubishi in Selma.  I provided the information to complete the paperwork and the salesman said that they would take the car off the lot to have it detailed and fill the gas tank for when I pick it up later that day.  I asked when the paperwork would be ready and the salesman said the finance guy was slammed and it would be a few hours.  I contacted them in a few hours with no response.  Later I get a message saying that the General Manager sold my vehicle to one of his personal friends  that night.  When I asked about them doing my paperwork for me to sign they said they were too busy to do it (but I guess they weren't busy enough to complete the paperwork for the GM's friend).  They then offered to sell me a hail damaged vehicle the same year, model, and mileage car for over $2,500 more than what I originally agreed on.  After selling my car they said they would make it up to me with a different deal, but they didn't make any real effort to match my previous deal.  My recommendation is to stay away from Gilman Motors and go to a dealership that doesn't do bait and switch.",1.2
4,"October 10, 2016","I did a walk in purchase with a trade in after searching on the internet thru USAA website.  The vehicle was still pending final advertisement and I was able to walking in to view and inspect the vehicle.  I had my car inspected for trade in value and in less than 3 hrs I drove off in my new used vehicle.  It was a hassle and stress free deal, & by far the best I have had.  If you know what you want and know what to expect to pay for it, then it all down hill from there.  Everything was great.",5.0
5,"January 13, 2016","We purchased a 2014 Mercedes SUV last weekend,. A great vehicle but even a greater buying experience.! The process went well from the intial call about the vehicle we saw on line to the final purchase process was extremely smooth. The salesman  Robert Henderson did an outstanding job in his presentation of the vehicle ,extremely professional,helpful and friendly. He introduced us to Sales Manger Steve Suiter and Finance Manager Nick Suiter .They were both very helpful, friendly 
and totally available to insure the process went smoothly.  In addition: we meet the new General Sales Manager Sergio Guerra, who to our Delight, was the salesmen we bought a Honda from at Gillman over 12 years ago, we were his first customer and he amazingly remembered. The dealership has gone through a lot of changes thru the years and it's good to know that these professionals are there and they set the standard for Customer Care, service and follw-up. THANKS to these GENTLEMAN, WE HAD A GREAT EXPERIENCE AT GILLMAN MITSUBISHI.

6,"December 27, 2015",I have purchase 4 vehicles over a period of 10 years or so. Each experience has been smooth and minimal stress. The sales staff works within your budget and does what they can to help negotiate a purchase that you can afford! ,5.0
7,"May 04, 2015","I found a 2015 Lancer Evolution through autotrader and I figured to contact the dealership to confirm if the car is still on the lot.  I was also assured that I would be compensated with a tank of gas even if the deal doesn't happen since I had to drive 45 minutes to 1 hour just to get to the dealership.  I had them appraised my Nissan Z and what they came up with is a value of my car lower than NADA and lower than their online tool appraisal.  The Used Car manager had the odacity to tell me and I quote ""i'm not here to lowball you"" and yet he did.  My car is not perfect and has minor imperfections on the spoiler and front bumper which is a reflection of the car's age since it's 6 years old.  Instead of adjusting the trade or the price of the new car to make a deal, I get a figure higher than I had mentioned I got approved for.  Just like the other reviews about this place, they are there to take your money and rip you off.  Now i realized why there is hardly any customers on this dealership.  If you need to trade in your car of buy a car, avoid this place at all cost. If you are traveling far, do not waste your time and gas.  ",1.0
8,"January 06, 2015","Storm found us exactly what 
we needed. As someone who has worked in sales , I felt that I could trust him to give me a fair price . He didn't waste any of my time trying to push things I didnt want, he seemed to really have my interests at heart. We left other dealers because they kept trying to push things we really didn't want but we stayed with Storm because he wasn't like them  at all. Ask for Storm!",5.0
9,"April 18, 2014","The experience started off well, however, the salesman (Mike) talks so fast you have to literally butt in to ask a question. The numbers he gave were not right in his office as far as discounts and then were way off ($1200 higher) by the we got the finance office. Conveniently the trade in was left off and the amount of guaranteed American Express discount was not as much as it should be. Even though we had bought five other Mitsubishi cars over the past two years we could not get them to give us the loyalty discount. We also had to fight to get the $500.00 Military discount they advertise. The finance guy was condescending and pressed hard to get us to go a longer loan than I wanted. The contract was written when he got a call (I assume from the Sales Manager Josh) telling him to tear up that contract because he decided he was only going to give us $495 for the trade in instead of the $499 as agreed. It was one of the worst overall car purchasing experiences I have had in my 61 years of age. I feel sorry for those people who do not check their numbers well before signing the contract. I will not purchase any vehicle from any Gillman dealer in the future.  ",2.0
10,"February 14, 2014",I was very pleased with the Customer Service I received from Michael Rauch and Storm. They went over the car from top to bottom explaining all functions. When I had questions they were able to break it down so I would fully understand. While going over the cars you could tell both of them enjoyed their jobs and were proud to stand behind Mitsubishi. My husband and I were considering another car. Gillman is very lucky to have these 2. I was leaning more towards the Toyota Rav4 but felt more confident buying from these two men. We ended up buying an Outlander Sport. Received a good deal. There whole staff was wonderful. Nick Sutter the Finance Manager made it very pleasant at the end of the sale. I would Highly recommend Gillman Mitsubishi,5.0
11,"January 11, 2014","I purchased a vehicle from Gillman several years ago with my now ex-husband. I recently received a phone call from Phil saying noticed I had bought a car there and he told me he thought he could help me get in a new car. I told him I was upside down on my car and didn't think they could help me but he insisted that he could and told me if I were to come in they would give me a tank of gas for my troubles even if they couldn't help. I decided there was nothing to lose so I went in on Saturday, Jaunuary 11, 2014. After getting my car assessed they told me that I was in fact too far upside down to help me (that's what happens when you buy a Mitsubishi in the first place) and then they told me that the free tank of gas was only if you bought a car, which is not what I was told over the phone. When confronted about this Phil said ""I read from a script and that is not what it is says."" Which was a bald face lie. I asked him if he was calling me a liar and he said ""I didn't say that"". So I asked if that was his M.O. to lure young women into the dealership to try and get them to buy a car and he walked out. So the manager, Nick Suitor, said he would speak to the general sales manager. He came back and told me there was nothing they could do. I said, ""You'd be willing to lose a customer for life over a tank of gas?"" and he replied ""Yup"" and slammed the door as I left. 

I would highly recommend using any dealer other than Gillman to purchase your vehicles. There are too many choices in the San Antonio area to purchase a vehicle to risk this kind of customer service, especially when they have shown no loyalty to a returning customer.",1.0
12,"January 02, 2014","I was looking for deals on line for a car, was not actually looking for one but decided to go ahead and submitt an application at Gillman Mitsubishi. Hours later I got a call back from Mike Rauch he was very polite and nice, he mention some specials and asked me if I was intererested in a test drive of the new Mitsubishi Mirage which was actually the one I was looking for. I told him I was going out of town but I would get back with him soon. He email me and game me all the information I need it. I stopped by on the 31st of Dec. and as soon as I walked in everybody was so helpful and nice, I asked for Mike and they went to look for him, he is such a helpful and sweet guy, very fast took less then 2 hrs to get everything done for me and I didn't have to trade in my truck. I can honestly say I had an awesome experince there, everybody was so helpful and nice, I highly recommend Gillman Mitsubishi and Mike Rauch. ",4.8
13,"December 07, 2013","Horrible and waste of time. Went to look at a used car for under 10,000. They ended up trying to push me into a new car with a payment of $550 a month!!! They are horrible DO NOT GO HERE",1.6
14,"April 30, 2013","I live 90 miles from the dealership and headed in after work at 4 yesterday 4/29/2013 to have my first oil change on my new Mitsubishi Outlander.   I arrived a few minutes after 6 and all of the techs had already gone home except sweet Roger M.  Bill Daggett found Roger and Roger said sure I will take care of it for you!!!  I apologized for not calling and they said no worries we will take care of it for you!    They managed to get a filter (since parts was closed) and got all of it taken care of. Then they even went and washed my car since I had stated I am sorry it was dirty I had not had time to rinse it from my trip the night before.  

This is above and beyond and Brandon Robbin the service manager as well as all of the other other people in this service department need to be recognized for Customer service because this was way more than I ever could have asked for in a dealership and they have won my business and referrals for a life time!!!! 

Roger even stayed later to explain things on my car that I had questions on!  Super nice group of employees!!! you have a great bunch that are an asset to Gillman!!! Thank you for taking good care of me!!! I promise to come on Saturdays!  Even though you said I could call and someone would stay late ...

15,"April 09, 2013","Gillman Mitsubishi did an incredible job working with me.  I was contact by Michael Rauch about buying my used Mitsubishi Outlander.  I called him and told him I like my car andhad some negative equity and wasn't interested in trading in at this time.  he said he could work with me.  At the end of any easy, non stressful experience, i was able to get a new Outlander with a lower payment and interest rate.  This was due to the work of Mr Rauch and Mr. Guerrier.  Thank you for explaining everything to me and  working with my constraints.

Thanks,

16,"July 22, 2012","Took my wife's Mitsubishi Montero 2001; which we have been the single owners and for which I keep complete & tight mainatance records as any military perosn is trained to do, for an oil change and a service engine light. I promptly recieved a phone call from Hunter indicating me what was wrong with the vehicle, the cost of repairs and indicating theyculd perform the job. I had already had some of the issues already pointed out to me by a previuos dealership in the area but had hold back on having the repairs done until I had the money Paid $1700 dollars for all repairs.

After speaking and going over the repairs needed with the mechanic and Hunter I agreed to have my vehicle fixed with Gillman's. I picked up my vehicle on saturday morning just like they had promised it would be ready. unfortunatly only 20 miles away  from the dealership the transmission Tranfer light goes on and in addition to this my wife start to hear a noise while the air conditioning is running eveytime she hits the brakes. 

I called Hunter an explain the situation he promptly requested to have the vehicle returned to the dealership. My wife spent 4 more hours at the dealership before they told here they could not figure out what the noise was or why did the light go on. 

The light going on was a big issue since Mitsubishi owners manual indicated a procedure to follow to turn off the light but that if it came on again the vehicle should be taken to an authorized dealership

My wife left the dealership with the vehicle around 600pm on her way home the light came back on. Monday morning I called Hunter again and I explained to him the situation. Once again I brought the vehicle in but unfortunatly on the way in my wife feels the powerstering go out and driving the vehicle becomes very difficult. She feels  she is loosing control of the vehicle. Gladly enough she was only about a mile away and was able drive it safely into the dealership lot. My kids wee on board of the vehicle with my wife therefore it was a very scary experience. When we llok under thevehicele there was a pool of pink redish fluid under the vehicle.

I spoke with Jeane and explained to her what had happened. She  saw the pool of fluid and promptly took over the situation. She said she would get it fixed. She called me later in the day indicating it was the transfer light swith that it would be another $98.00 dollars, she also stated that the fluid was due to a broken powerstreing line and that the noise in the fan had been fixed as well at no charge for the line or the fan noise. I agreed to the repair and picked the vehicle up around 530pm. My wife was on her way home when the transfer light went on again. i nstructed my wife to take the vehicle back to the dealership. I spoke with Jeann and she apologized for the inconvinience.

She called me on Thrusday to indicate the vehicle needed some silones replaced at that that would be another $168 dollars. I agreed to the repair snce this is my wife's truck and I work shift work at SAMMC. In total I paid $1966.76 dollars for repairs. Nver once did they offered me a military discount or any other kind of discount for our inconvinience. All I got to say is that when you trust someone with your vehcile your expecte them to perform the job well the first time not at the 3rd time you take it in for the same reasons.  I understand it is a 11 year old vehicle but every mechanic that has dealt with my vehicle agrees it in the greates shape they have seen one of these models in. I just believe they could have done better with the customer service by having me pay only for the parts and not charging for the service since they made so many mistakes that could have cost my families life.

I truly believe this dealership placed my families life in jeopardy by not performing an adequate service the first time. God forbid they would have suffered any harm or this message would be taking place in court.

18,"May 16, 2012","Overall initial impressions were good. Met at car by salesman and showed cars that we wanted to see. Very friendly as is typical. Then, communication became poor, return visits would take 45 minutes before anyone would talk to us or hours before our calls were returned. We finally worked out a deal but it was tough going. Very little dealing or offers of any kind. The only reasoned we purchased the car from them was because because it was the only one of its kind around. I bought a second car the next day from another dealer and the process was so much nicer. Carlos is nice, but his dealership sucks.",2.8

20,"March 06, 2012","Hunter did everything possible to help me with my service. In fact, everyone in the dealership service department was very friendly and helpful. Hunter went above and beyond the call to make me a satisfied customer. The technician, Roger, did excellent and expedient work. I had to wait for the car and the service needed took 6 to 7 hours. They did everything they could to expedite the service and to make my visit a comfortable and pleasant one.",4.8
21,"February 19, 2012",The sales person did everything right he called told us he he had financing so we went in at 3:45 made a deal for 1000 down with a monthly payment gave him a check and then the trouble started the finance person came back three times saying he couldn't understand my wife's pay stubs then wanted to add me. I had to leave to pick up our son at daycare by 6:00 and my wife calls me and tells me the finance person is trying to sell her a different car 15 minutes later she calls and says she needs our w2's so I have to go back to the dealership with this to be told the bank had closed for the evening and they would have to resubmit our paper work again the next day. So we get a call at 11:30 the next day from the sales person telling us the finance person had sold the car to someone else. I don't do dishonest things and when I shake a persons hand on a deal it stays a deal this was the worst experience and the most dishonest dealings I have ever seen. I want to thank Gillman for making my wife's birthday present so memorable. ,2.0

25,"July 28, 2011",Tim received me and was very helpful he comunicated to james that i was waiting for my car to get diagnosed and had my baby with me. James took a look at my car because it had the check engine light on and told me the problem was the catalyst converter and it would be covered under waranty. The part should be coming in next week and i would received a phone call as soon as the part was in. I had a great expeerience did not have to wait long and great customer service.,5.0
26,"July 19, 2011","`This dealerships service department is lying, deceitful, and in-competent.  I originally brought my 08 Eclipse spyder in for warranty work back in Dec 2010.  I have had to deal with this in-competent company for over 7 months.  The reason for the visit was because the inliner to the convertible top was falling down and I was getting two holes in the outer top as well.

So the dealership put in for warranty work into Mitsubishi in Dec.  Finally in February I was informed that Mitsu approved my headliner.  The problem being, Gillman never put in for warranty work on the actual top.  So in Feb they had to &quot;re-submit&quot; my warranty work.  After a couple months go by again I just call up Mitsu myself to see what the problem was.  Mitsu tells me that Gillman never loaded the photos needed and it been waiting for that all this time.  

In April i take my car back up there so Gilman can take and upload the photos this time.  Within a week, Mitsu approves my top.  The top comes in and they take almost a week to change it out.  I get the call that my car is ready and proceed to go and pick it up.  They knowing did not install the rear seal for the top and there were large gaps where the top meets the car.  Ontop of this, they replace the rear window and don't bother tent it as the first window was tinted originally.  So they keep the car for another couple of days.

I go to get the car a couple of days later and the gaps are still there.  This is when their service tech begins to tell me that these gaps are normal and water is suppose to get into my car and drain through these two drain holes in the convertible compartment.  I knew this was BS.  I call Mitsu and they confirm to me that Gillman &quot;forgot&quot; to install the rear seal.  The rear seal then gets ordered and so does new side seals as when they replaced my top, their mechanic mangled up the side seals.

So Gillman again gets my car and has it for 7 days this time.  They didnt even contact for more than half those days.  After the 7 days I get my car back.  The side seals were replaced incorrectly.  This company re-placed something as simple and weather seals and couldnt even do that right.  On top of it, they didnt even bother to do a water test to make sure the seals didnt leak.  I had to take my car to a different dealership and had to have new seals ordered again and replaced.  I also had to have a new inliner ordered AGAIN and replaced.  This company is completely in-competent when it comes to warranty work.

Throughout this dealing I had to deal with their service manager Chris Mccoy.  This guy is a straight up liar.  He would say he called my phone and I would have no phone records of this.  He says he left messages but I would have none.  I even called Sprint and they verified that I had no missed calls by him.  I asked Gillman to show phone records proving that he called me and they did not.  I have had numerous emails go back and forth through David Kemp their general manager and he still allowed this disgrace to happen.  David asked me to give him a chance to handle the problem and that is when the dealership had my car for 7 days and replaced weather seals in properly causing me to have to get them replaced again.  

My complaints went up to Patrick York who also did nothing about these issues.  Stacey Gillman was also CC'd on the emails and never responded.  After I bought a new car from Gillman and had to go through 7 months of lies and in-competence, Stacey couldnt even tell me she was sorry??  It just goes to show that the lies, in-competence, and lack of caring really does start at the top.  I bet Stacey's Dad is rolling in his grave knowing what his daughter and her little in-competent lieing sorry excuse for employees has done to his company.

There is alot more to what took place with my dealings with Gillman but I dont want to make this review become a book.  I also filled a complaint with the BBB and it was apparently &quot;resolved&quot;.  This was by no means resolved on my part.  For whatever reason the BBB marked it as resolved and never updated my issue with Gillman's BBB rating.  Do not be fooled by Gilmans BBB rating as it is aparent even if people have issues, those issues never get posted for others to see.",1.0
27,"July 18, 2011",This was by far the best car buying experience I have ever had.  I have absolutely nothing bad to say about my experience with purchasing our Galant through Gillman and will recommend them to anybody who is looking to purchase a new Mitsubishi.  I've been on both sides of the auto sales table and wish that every car dealership was as ethical and customer-oriented as Gillman.,5.0
28,"July 16, 2011","The gents there at Gillman were of the best quality professional people I have dealt with in a very long time. They had the part and the knowledge to do the repair quickly and price wise very fair as compared to those other garages in the area that wanted much more money for the same repair. Because of them I was able to return home in a fair amount of time with out having an appointment. I would recommend them to any one wanting to purchase a vehicle there. Again many thanks to Hunter and James for outstanding work.

29,"June 30, 2011",took vehicle in for servicing due to a malfunction light. Tim Gantner immediately took my vehicle in for service and told me of my options warranty etc. I received a phone call from tim just as soon as my vehicle was ready with a full explanation of what the problem was.

30,"June 28, 2011","I had purchased a 1998 Mitsubishi Montero from a private party over this past weekend and because of the age it required some TLC by me. There was some corrosion of the battery terminals so I removed the cables to clean them and upon replacing them I discovered, much to my dismay, that I now needed a security code to get the radio operational again. I did not have the code so I called your dealership and was put in touch with Tim, who I explained my problem to. He was very professional and told me he would assist me however he could. I gave him the VIN and he said he would check to see if he could locate the code for it and get back with me. Tim called me back and informed he had checked on the code and discovered that I needed to get the serial number of the radio in order to get the code. I was able to attain the number and called him back with it. He stated he would get back with me shortly with the code. A very short time later he called back with the code and was able to get me back enjoying my tunes!
Tim's caring and determination to assist me in this matter was above and beyond what most people would do and is a very good reflection on the dealership.
Please pass on my sincere appreciation to him and I will be a customer for some time to come because of him!!",5.0
31,"June 22, 2011","Called at the last minute to set up for an oil change on a Saturday.  Even though everything was booked up, Tim said he could fit it in, just couldn't promise how long it would take.  No problem for me, I asked if I could drop it off on Friday and pick it up on Saturday whenever it was ready.  He said ""sure"".  Great!  I really needed to get it done.  Called me on Saturday and said it was ready whenever I wanted to pick it up, no hurry.  
Please note:  Tim was working with another customer when I got there on Friday which is what he is suppose to do.  The level of service I got from Tim would be a 5.  The 4 rating is because normally when I bring my vehicles in for service,the ""information sheet"" is filled out by the service rep, for the first time I was handed the clip board and told I needed to file it out myself (this was not Tim).  I mentioned that I had not ever done that before, that it had always been done for me and the response I received was ""that's how you know we are professionals"".  Really?  
At any rate, I have purchased 4 vehicles from Gillman and have always taken them to Gillman for servie.  I am and will continue to be a satisfied customer.",4.6

He was very helpful and informative and seems to know the product he is selling.  When we're ready to buy a vehicle, we will definitely be returning to Gillman and hope that Matt can take care of us.",5.0
33,"April 01, 2011","Though we live in the DFW area, while in SA we decided to look at Mitsubishi's Outlander Sport. Based on the internet website of the 3 dealers in the SA area, Gillman's was the quickest and most informative. The dealer discount was another reason in choosing Gilman. We purchased an Outlander SE with various options. Gilman did not have one on the lot, but quickly contacted dealers in DFW and made ""their"" deal. From start to finish the process was easy, with no SALES pressure. Albert Saenz was a delight, Hector De Jesus made sure that all of the details were taken care of. The Finance Director, Georges ""Josh"" Guerrier made signing the paperwork painless and made an offer on the extended warranty that was too good to pass up. We would definitely purchase another car from these 3 employees. (so what if the drive is 5 hours from home.)",5.0
34,"March 18, 2011","I lost my husband last year and was buying a new car for the first time in 45 years.  I was looking at another car dealer but stopped by Gillman's to check out the Mitsubishi Outlander Sport since the salesman had contacted me by email and sounded very helpful.  After test driving the Outlander I found it a very nice drive with comfortable seats, very important on my list.  Also Mike was very patient with my many questions and checking out the Honda, Subaru, and Outlander.  I went down to the other dealership, where I did not receive the patience or service and their car was not so great.  In the next few days, I returned and bought my red Outlander Sport.  I met the Service Manager and was briefed on their service programs, also he and Mike set up my  cell phone with the blue tooth in my new car. I left Gillman's feeling very secure in my choice.

35,"February 16, 2011","Josh, the finance director went above and beyond to help me get out my truck, and into the galant. From a consumer stand point this is rare, and all dealerships should follow this lead.  Josh worked to find a deal that would work for my needs.  The costomer service at this dealership is above anything I have ever experienced.  Thank Josh for that.",5.0
36,"February 08, 2011","Josh in the finance department went above and beyond his duty to help me get a great deal and a great interest rate. I've never had anyone do this for me, I was pleasantly surprised.  Not too many people go out of their way to help you nowadays, but Josh did and I will be forever grateful to him.",3.6
37,"February 07, 2011","We never expected the purchase of a new vehicle to be such a great experience. Went in owing a bunch on a Toyota P/U with less than favorable credit and drove off in a beautiful Galant. Georges Guerrier went far and beyond anything my wife & I ever experienced buying a new vehicle. We plan to be back in the near future to purchase another vehicle and have already advised my neice and mother in law to visit Gillman Mitsubishi first.

Thanks Georges & Monty!!!

38,"October 02, 2010","The overall experince at Gillman Mitsubishi was excellent. Michael Raunch was very helpful and a good salesperson. In the future, I would buy another car from him if it came down to it. My experince with him and the dealership was outstanding. Gillman Mitsubishi was very helpful in finding me good rates and low prices to my satisfaction. I'm a satisfied customer.",4.8
39,"September 27, 2010","I went in with a budget and they did everything possible to get my payments down. I needed my mom to cosign, but wouldn't do so unless I could get the payments low enough for her to feel comfortable. Mike and Tim accomplished this in only two visits. They were also very informative, friendly, and willing to help. ",5.0
40,"September 10, 2010","I have been a life long Mitsubishi customer. I have to admit, i went to Gillman Mitsubishi with doubts i would ever get out of my upside down note on my previous Lancer, Not to mention my credit problems on top of that, but they did it and got me financed right away and got me into a new 2010 Lancer. So i am very happy with their service. Walking into Gillman was a very relaxing experience, Mike met with me right away after i spoke with him on the phone, and worked hard to get me a good deal. George Guerrier In financing was absolutely great also getting the payments i wanted and He had a very good attitude without being pushy and aggressive trying to talk you into paying for something you could not afford. I'll definitely be back. My only regret, i wish i would have came here years ago when i purchased my Eclipse and previous Lancer instead of Westloop Mitsubishi, i vowed never to go back there again after one salesman with an attitude like i needed to bow down to him for getting me into a Lancer and once the sale was final became very rude. I wish i would have given Gillman all my business. What was i thinking!!! ",5.0
41,"September 02, 2010","I submitted an email through USAA, who certified Gillman Mitsubishi as having the vehicle specifications I wanted. I instantly got a phone call back from Mike Rauch within 10 minutes advising me that they had several 2010 Mitsubishi Lancers with the features I requested. Mike was able to keep constant contact with me while setting every detail in place. Mike worked with Ray in Finance to get us a lower rate than what USAA was offering us. Gillman Mitsubishi has an express checkout and delivery service if you don't live close to the dealership to come by, which was great for me since we are about 2.5 hours away from San Antonio. Once everything was cleared through the bank Mike was on his way to deliver my new Lancer in person. He went over all the paperwork and answered any questions. He was friendly, professional, and well versed in the features of the Lancer. If we needed yet another car we would contact Gillman Mitsubishi because they gave us great service through the whole process.",5.0

43,"July 22, 2010","I drove to San Antonio (from Uvalde) planning to purchase a Hyundai Santa Fe, but received a call from Mike on my way into town asking me to come in and look at the comparable Mitsubishi Outlander. During the presentation and test drive. Mike was courteous, knowledgable and truly interested in my needs for the car and making sure it was the right vehicle. He even suggested I test drive the 4 cylinder rather than the more expensive V6 and he was right, the 4 cylinder trim was great. I ended up purchasing the Outlander - a better car that fit my needs for about 7k less than the Santa Fe I had originally planned on.
Throughout the negotiation, Mike was up front and honest in negotiating a fair deal and it was easily the best experience I have ever had purchasing a new car. The dealership honored internet pricing discounts, Sam's Club pricing and found two major cash back rebates I was eligible for and I was able to purchase the car that best fit my needs for much much less money than anticipated.",4.8
44,"September 11, 2009","Gillman Mitsubishi of San Antonio charged my wife $550 for the 30k service on a 2008 Mitsubishi Outlander XLS.  She was in tears when she called me on her way home.  I called the dealership, spoke to Ashley the service writer, then Richie the service manager, who both stated the service was expensive because the vehicle has a CVT transmission and required ""special equipment and fluid"".  I kept explaining that the XLS had a 6-speed automatic, that I was positive of this. Richie kept telling me that as of a couple years ago, ""all Lancers and Outlanders have the CVT"".  After a few minutes of back and forth, he put me on hold.  By then I was on the Mitsubishi website, and could see that only 4-cylinders had the CVT.  When Richie came back, the story changed, the service was expensive because the dealer followed the ""severe
maintenance"" schedule because I lived in Texas. I answered that the vehicle didn't tow anything, wasn't driven on dusty roads, didn't do a lot of stop and go traffic, that it did not fit any of the parameters for ""severe maintenance"".  He replied that I could go to the other Mitsubishi dealer in San Antonio, that they did the same thing.  He also said my spouse agreed to the servicing, and I said all she asked for was the 30k service, nobody gave her an estimate of $550 for the ""severe"" schedule.  His last remark was that it seemed I thought they didn't know what they were doing, and my last answer was if you can't even tell me what transmission is in one of your vehicles, it certainly makes me wonder.  That terminated the conversation.  I can only hope that I don't have transmission problems, they will probably try to replace 
the 6-speed with a CVT.  That would be interesting.",1.0
