0,"June 26, 2019",The service center worked on a minor problem with my 2019 Kia Optima S. They were polite and helpful. RC took care of getting my wife to work when they need to keep the car for the morning. Would have been 5 stars but the online scheduling of appointments is less than smooth even for the tech savvy.,4.6
1,"January 09, 2019","Face to face on making appointments, they are great.  Polite.  Friendly. Helpful.  Did good work  on my Kia Soul and did it quickly!! 
My only complaint:  Tried calling for appointment x2 and was told they would call me.  Never did.
Otherwise, great service.!!",4.8
2,"October 18, 2018","zero stars if I could---I do not recommend going to Gene Messer Kia Lubbock. Absolute worst customer service from salesmen (Jaxon) to the business manager (Shawn)to the new cars sales manager (Steve). Let me explain- First we had a scratch on the car and we told the new car manager before we ever left the lot. ""yes ma'am we will call you and schedule that to be fixed no problem"", he never called (Steve). Also we were NOT told that Kia vehicles do not come with a spare tire, so on day three of having our car we had a blow out and went to change it and there is NO TIRE (thank God I made it home)!!!!  Kia says they will come to the house and tow the car and have the tire fixed. They did replace the tire and then Steve says oh yea that will be okay we will fix the scratch too (he only said that after I mentioned it again) and as soon as I left the parking lot and crossed a very busy access road the TRANSMISSION BLEW on my brand new 2018 Kia Optima (this car had less than 300 miles on it)!  I immediately called my husband because I was in shock, the gun shot like sound from the engine scared me to death, I also had my 14 year old son with me  and we were stuck in the middle of traffic. We coasted the car over to the side road. My husband is now on the phone with the Kia office and after yelling and screaming at them to come get me, they tell us to call road side assistance (what a joke) (p.s I can see the dealer from my rear view mirror) While I am waiting my husband calls my son because Kia tells him that they are on the phone with me, NO they sure weren't no one at Kia called me to check on me or to get my exact location at that time. Finally a Kia service man showed up 45 minutes later only after he decided to call me because no one in the office was competent enough to figure out my exact location, which again was across the street and directly in my rear view mirror (not safe for us to walk we had to wait for a ride). We talked to our sales rep Jaxon who assured us he would make this right and take care of everything! We called the following day to see what was exactly wrong with the car and low and behold it was still sitting on the side of the road where we broke down. No one at Kia called to tell us that we weren't a priority customer they just continuously showed us time and again. Finally close to 5 they decided to pick up the car after it sat all night and most of the following day. My husband had to call and then go up there yelling and screaming again to have anyone take us seriously and to get them to do anything about the car and the fact that we no longer had one that worked. So finally they get the car on the lift and confirm that the transmission is faulty and they will get us into another brand new car. The salesmen calls to tell us ""we have one on the lot"" only to turn around and tell us oh no we don't have it but we will have it soon"". We go the next day to pick up the new car, paperwork was not ready, car was not cleaned and of course we were very upset yet again!  We had multiple phone calls back and forth, my husband went up there multiple times, not because the car broke  we understand that that was out of their hands but because there was no since of urgency or care to make sure we were taken care of. So disappointed in how we were treated and how the entire situation was handled.",1.0
3,"July 02, 2018","Buy a Kia in Midland or San Angelo because the headache after purchase isn't worth it with these people. I'm not from Lubbock, so I made an appointment for a Saturday to go pick out a new vehicle. (My first one.) I kept in contact with the guy I made the appointment with up until the day of. My husband and I showed up and the gentleman neglected to tell me he had a wedding in the family he had to go to, so he left me with the internet salesman. It was quite obvious this kid was the internet salesman because he was awkward at best; ALWAYS shaking my hand and saying ""I'm sorry"". I'm here to buy a car, not attend a funeral. Needless to say, the guy let me leave the lot with NO inspection sticker on my vehicle. (How was I supposed to know that wasn't right, when it was my first new vehicle? Must've been his first sale too.) Needless to say I paid over $2500.00 for tax, title and license, but I couldn't get my real license plates until I paid for a state inspection on my car. Sound wrong? Well IT WAS. WAY long story short, I now have a ONE YEAR tag on my brand new 2018 Kia Sorento (which should've been for two years), and have been fighting tooth and nail for over a month to get reimbursed for the inspection I had to pay for and next year's inspection and tag. They offered me $72.00 for my troubles, yet one year of tags cost $74.00 alone. They still owe me $16.00, and I can't get a response from their General Manager unless I wait 24 hours and make sure to follow up. Customer service is a joke to them. They chalked my experience off as a learning tool, and wrote me off. Run fast and far away from there. I'm extremely sad I have to return to use their Service Department for my vehicle. I hope they're better than sales, but if they're anything like their General Manager, I'm scared. The reviews I've read about the Service Department don't look too promising... ",2.0
4,"May 10, 2017","My buying experience at at Gene Messer Kia  was a very pleasant one, my salesman Ryshawn Davis was very professional. He was courteous and patient, he took time to explain everything in detail. This is the third car that I have purchased with Gene Messer and each times I have been completely satisfied. Thanks to The Gene Messer Group!  ",4.8
5,"May 01, 2017","We had the worst experience with service department. My husband left his vehicle for the week with them while he was out of town on business for a steering noise. They could not verify. They did not keep him updated. They were annoyed when I called to check on status. Very quick to remind me that it was left for the week. I reminded the advisor, yes it was, but only professional to keep us updated? No? Then the conversation got very short. So they had the vehicle for a week. Didn't verify. Vehicle has less the 2000 miles on it. Pain in the neck to take it to the dealer that is 2 hours away. Picked up. They only put on paperwork that they could hear the aftermarket intake system. Cool? Complete waste of time. Next time we will listen to what everyone else says about this dealer. ",1.0
6,"March 15, 2017","Got a new starter put in last year. Jan 26th. It cost $479. I Called this morning, they couldn't give me information on a warranty. They took a message and promised to call back. Over 5 hours passed without a return call. Called again, left a message. Finally When we got a response it was sorry. The warranty ended the end of January. They did not try to help in any way. Everyone mechanically inclined said it should have gone out already. Other professionals told me to go to the local dealership, they would probably try to help. Gene Messer offered nothing to help. I would expect a product/service to hold up better than it did when it cost close to $500. Completely disappointed and after missing a days work, the starter is still not fixed.",1.0
7,"January 11, 2017",I have bought many cars over the years and it's always a 4-6 hour all day experience. This was a two hour experience. I got a great deal and my salesman Reshawn was awesome. Finance was great. The bumper to bumper warranty from Kia and gap insurance were very affordable. ,5.0

10,"April 07, 2016","Took my 2015 Kia Cadenza in for Warranty service yesterday. UVO system found TPMS fault and scheduled service for me. That part of the system works great. It's the dealership that's worse than awful. The service department will not answer the phone. After trying twice in a 15 minute period to get them on the phone, I asked to speak to the GM and he wouldn't answer the phone.
After I got the car back the service advisor told me that it was just low tire pressure on all four tires. But what he didn't tell me was that the tech just pulled a fuse and reset the system. I know because the fuse panel was sitting on the floor when I got back in the car at the dealership.
When I got home later, I turned the car off and went inside for about an hour. When I went back outside to start the car again the TPMS warning light came right back on. They didn't fix anything. What they did do was over inflate my $900.00 tires to 45 psi.
Do not take your prize possession to them for anything. They have a major problem with their service department. 
This is my 5th Kia, you would think that they would treat their most loyal customers better.",2.0
11,"February 27, 2016","We just want to Thank Tegan for selling us a car after 13yrs . We were so please with him , he  never push us to buy anything. We ask and he was so friendly and knew what he was talking about. We had our hearts set on another Camry . So we drove a Kia  one after another, especially a 2015 Kia Cadenza. We said ok.. but still wanted to drive a new Camry, so we did  and he save us the trouble of running around. So we did and omg terrible. The Kia Cadenza was the one... Tegan was so helpful and a knew what he was talking about. We were so please it was so easy to buy a car. After all the bad deals we had it the pass. Tegan did whatever we needed and got everything taken care of that  he promise. We love this young man. Thank you Tegan we love our car and havent seen one like it.. God bless! Sending everyone we know to Tegan!!",5.0
