0,"March 16, 2020",Brandon Buxton at Sewell BMW got me a great deal on a new BMW lease. The team at Sewell was very helpful and responsive throughout the entire sales process. I highly recommend everyone use this dealership when searching for a new or used BMW. Thanks Sewell!!,5.0
1,"November 23, 2019","I was looking at some CPO (Certified Pre-Owned) and new BMW's at different BMW dealerships and the CPO vehicle I was looking at just happened to be at Sewell. So, I scheduled a time and worked with Mrs. Cindy Schunk in the sales department to schedule a time to look at the vehicle. She went above and beyond to make sure we knew every feature of the vehicle. She was kind, relatable, and professional. If you ever want to get in a BMW at Sewell, ask for Mrs. Schunk!",5.0
2,"September 30, 2019","This year I purchased two BMWs here. I brought my best friend to them and he purchased a BMW from them. I sent my son in law in and he purchased a BMW from them. For all of us, they have exceeded our expectations! Conner Jones in Pre-owned is amazing! James in Finance is amazing! Sam in Service is amazing! They are the Dream Team! I have purchased 48 cars so far in my lifetime and I have done business with many dealerships. There is no dealership that comes close to delivering the excellence all the way around that Sewell BMW delivers! Sewell BMW is second to none! Sewell makes me Smile!",5.0
3,"April 27, 2019","The BMW portion of this dealer is terrible. My car has failed to start twice in the 5 weeks I have had it. It has had other electrical  problems I tried to explain, but they don’t seem to listen to me and tell me there is nothing wrong with the car. If nothing is wrong, why won’t it start? It is a certified pre-owned car with less than 20,000 miles and it should not be this unreliable. I have not had to pay for anything since the car is under warranty, but that is not very comforting when you are stranded in a parking garage. If you are a woman I would not recommend dealing with Sewell BMW of Grapevine. If you are in the market for a luxury car, I would recommend a Lexus or Infiniti. My Infiniti has 110,000 miles and has never left me stranded. ",1.8
