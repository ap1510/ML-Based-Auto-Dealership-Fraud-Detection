0,"November 14, 2018","I just wanted to take the time to let everyone know about how great our buying experience was at Victory Kia and with our salesman, T. J. Dekker.  My husband and I had just started the process of deciding what make and model of vehicle to buy and started at this dealership to look at a Kia Soul. My husband researches every detail of any purchase for months and months and months lol.  We met T. J.who was very knowledgeable and so not the stereotypical “salesman”. To my surprise we purchased the Kia Soul!  The whole process took less than an hour instead of the 2-3 hours at other dealerships we have done business at.  I absolutely love my Kia Soul + and will definitely buy from this dealership again!",5.0
