0,"April 13, 2020","Tyler A. and Soraya H. worked with us to get us the best price possible.  We went just to look and without being pushy Tyler helped find exactly what we were looking for, at the price we were looking for.  Once in finance we were greeted by Soraya and she treated us like we were family!  So happy with our purchase! We highly recommend Crawford Buick GMC!!  This is the second vehicle we have purchased and will gladly go back.",5.0

3,"July 26, 2019","About 20 miles east of Sierra Blanco my check engine light went on. Spoke with Danny Martinez on the phone and he was able to provide me with reassurance that my Buick would make it to El Paso. Once there he and the staff were able to determine the cause: bad gas and got me on the road home to Santa Barbara, California-Free of Charge!

Three words: Honest, Kind, Professional",5.0
4,"July 21, 2019",This company is not a dealership but a stealership! They promised to make a deal right and went back on their word. They kept our money and wonâ€™t return it!! Stay away!!! Dishonest company and employees!!!!,1.0

6,"May 29, 2017","My wife visited Crawford GMC to look at their stock of SUV's. My wife filled out an application for herself. Salesman asked her to provide my social as well, agreement was reached that specified that my credit would not be ran until I arrived. GMC Crawford ran my wife's credit and falsified her applications. The first credit inquiry indicated that my wife was a business owner which was false. The second credit inquiry indicated that my wife was a retiree which was also false. GMC Crawford also ran my credit without my consent,  signature,  or presence. GMC Crawford did not inform my wife that they ran my credit. 

GMC Crawford ran both of our credit with falsified information and without my consent. They ran our credit with multiple banks and/or credit unions. 

My wife called all of the banks and/or credit unions but they told her to call GMC Crawford. My wife called GMC Crawford management to complain but they did nothing to help. My wife called GMC Crawford HR department but they did nothing as well. My wife also spoke to GMC Crawford CFO but again, they did not help.

Please beware of Crawford GMC. 
Under FCRA, no one can pull your credit without your autorization.  Your situation could be an impremmissible credit pull under federal law-reg 1681-negligence.  There are penalties associated with this-cash for you.  May want to speak with an attorney who specializes in this law.  If you have real damages associated with this, the better the case.

14,"October 30, 2015",We just purchased a new GMC Sierra 1500 at Travis Crawford. From start to finish it was a nice experience. No hard sells push at all.  Alfonzo Porros was our salesman and was very knowledgeable about the vehicle. We gave him the price we were looking for and they worked hard to get us to that point. they helped get the OnStar system set up for us and walked us through the whole vehicle. We will definitely recommend them to anyone ready to purchase a new vehicle.,5.0

16,"October 01, 2015","Just purchased a beautiful Crystal Red Verano from Crawford Buick on Montana in El Paso Texas.
when we visited the dealership there were so many great looking vehicles to choose from. The Verano caught our eye right away. I was looking to purchase a vehicle that says' I am retired and deserve to cruse in a beautiful luxury car. Tells the everyone its time to relax and enjoy LIFE. We just couldn't decide on what color. We met Mr. Adrian Cardiel, he worked on getting us the right DEAL. Mr. Cardiel wasn't just thinking about his COMMISSION. Cardiel saw us as FAMILY. We didn't have the the correct credit status to get the payments we were looking for. Cardiel worked effortlessly for 4 months until he was able to find us the perfect car COLOR & payment plan.",5.0
17,"August 14, 2015",I purchased our new 2015 GMC Terrain nearly a year ago. The maintenance provided by the Crawford team is excellent; wouldn't expect anything less. What's impressive is the great attitude that the service team has. They actually care. There hasn't been a single question that hasn't had a positive response. I can send my spouse to the dealership without any fear. ,5.0
18,"August 04, 2015","We have purchased three vehicles from Crawford Buick.  With each one we always receive great care with our cars.  Our salesman Mr. M. Mannix is awesome! He always makes sure we are being treated right.  But also, the guys in service are wonderful.  (Danny and Wade). Anytime we pull into the service bay they come right out to help with our service usually a regular oil check, or if we have any problems that are covered under warranty.  Whenever we come in and tell them we are getting ready to take a long road trip they make sure our car is in tip top shape. Recently our 2012 LaCrosse had an issue with one of the tires, we took it in to them and we were treated great! They took excellent care of us, Thank you Micheal M, Wade, and Danny! The cashiers are always very friendly, and treat us like family.   Keep up the Good work!

20,"June 20, 2015",I just bought a 2015 LaCrosse and was very please in my overall experience. I will most definitely be a returning customer for years to come to Crawford Buick GMC. ,5.0
21,"May 18, 2015","Over the past 10 years I have received excellent service and highly recommend to anyone regardless of make or model. They listen to your issues and will not let you go, without correcting every problem. I have dealt with Danny and Wade and now Chris Guzman and all of them are respectful and caring and will go the extra mile to satisfy you.  The newly remodeled showroom ,lounge and office area as well as the service bay area is beautiful and a reflection of the professional atmosphere Buick ,GMC wants to convey going into the future. You can buy a vehicle anyplace ,but you won't get the same  level of service after the sale as Travis Crawford -Buick GMC. ",5.0
