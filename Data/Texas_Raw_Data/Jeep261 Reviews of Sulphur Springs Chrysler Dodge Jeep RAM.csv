I felt at ease and we are now Ram 1500 owners. I want to thank our awesome sales woman, Moriah, she was great. I also want to thank the financial manager, he was awesome. I would recommend this place for your auto needs. ",5.0

2,"May 19, 2020","We traveled across country to see our grandson who is in the military and became stranded in Sulpher Spring, Texas when our old 1999 Ford refused to run any longer.  After many attempts to revive the Ford failed, we were introduced by a very nice man to a salesman at Sulpher Springs Dodge.  We had high hopes as this salesman seemed honest and above board so we took the huge step on a fixed income and bought a used vehicle from them.  The vehicle was a 2008 GMC and was sold as is without any warranty and we understood that from the beginning.  We were told that they would help us out if there were any immediate problems.  Later we discovered that the service they supposedly completed on the vehicle was not completed!! (this was the documentation that they said prevented them from lowering the sale price because they had put a lot of money into servicing the vehicle).  It was not cleaned at all except rinsed with a water hose on outside, the hose and clamp they replaced was on halfway and leaked until we brought it back. no inside cleaning was done at all.  still had greasy handprints and stains which my husband cleaned off. We had to bring the truck back after driving 8 hours for check engine light, overheating and making a weird noise.  they ended up saying the turbo had to be replaced.  We negotiated price and timeline.  the timeline went 6 days late and we kept getting different stories..1st -  the turbo had to be ordered to come in on Monday they would not let us get a OEM turbo on Friday but had to order the aftermarket  turbo themselves in order for the manufacture warranty to apply.  they would not install one that we bought separately.  2nd - when the truck was supposed to be ready, they called and said there were gaskets missing and they had to overnight the parts in.  The next day at close of business we found out the parts were not overnighted but someone from the dealership went to pick them up and wouldnt get back in time to work on the truck that day.  So another 2 days go by and we find it is not ready because of damage to wires and fuel line when they pulled the bode to put the turbo in.   then it is supposed to be ready at noon and is not ready until they are walking out the shop for us to test drive.  We had numerous extra expenses for lodging, rental vehicle and even had to buy 5 days of 7 medications for my health issues.  Because our 11 day trip turned into 18 day trip and I only had 14 days of medication with me.  So finally we pay a Service repair bill of $3100.00  in addition to another $1400.00 for living expenses during the week delay (not counting food.), we leave to drive back across country.  we have to keep the rental all the way because the truck overheats, runs out of transmission fluid and has some weird noises again.  PRAY it is not the turbo~!  we have to stop frequently to baby the truck home.   Yes we like the color, style and towing ability of the truck but PRETTY IS AS PRETTY DOES>  Now we are looking at another $3000.00 repair because the truck also must have ball joints, shocks, engine particulate filter/work, etc etc etc.   I'm just saying - DONT BUY a USED vehicle from these folks!!!  I would not feel confident that they had serviced it properly OR that they would tell you the whole story behind the vehicle.  We met some very nice people and people who did help us navigate these trials --PRaise the Lord for them.  BUT  the salesman NOR the service manager/communicator were among those and did not have our back or try to give us the bottom line.  We felt that they were stringing us along and not prioritizing the service work in spite of the fact that we were 1300 miles from home and stranded.  I really think the plan was to unload the truck with minimum effort!!  as it is a very particular body style and would not be an easy one to sell.  So we bought a $22,000 truck from these folks, paid $4000 cash down and $3100 cash for the repair as well as the extra living expense cose during the delay.  I think they made out pretty good.  Don't be their next victim!",1.4

Nevertheless, I got a very good deal on Ram 2500 Cummins Turbo Diesel. These trucks are in high demand right now, so it's a seller's market for sure. I would buy from them again. Anvil Jones",4.5

12,"January 20, 2020","Although I had bought a brand new Jeep Cherokee from them in 2018 which was a very positive experience in all, that salesman is no longer with this dealership. I may now know why. Because he did his job and treated everyone as a person and no a sale! Wish I could say the same for Bob Boynton. I was given a voicemail to call back because my vehicle had come up asone they would be willing to buy back. Ok I gave him my info and was told he will call back. I never received a call back and had to call him. He asked for my credit info and would get back with me. This was Saturday, it is now Monday and no call. Needless to say I am making him no money, I am not important. This is horrible customer service practices and l be going to visit my good friend Lewis who actually treats people fairly. ",1.0

She never once pressured me into buying the car right away. She gave me excellent customer service and even followed up with me after the purchase. Karen was very kind to me in finance. She gave me all the details I needed to know about extended warranties and gap. I know that I can call on both of them and they would be eager to help me again. Go see Johnene..the best sales woman I have ever dealt with! Also, the fun atmosphere will for sure lift your spirits! I'm sending friends and family thier way!",5.0

17,"July 08, 2019",Went there to purchase a vehicle would not honor the price that was on the website low trade-in value and then completely got off of the vehicle that we was looking at and try to get us to purchase a different vehicle that we did not want to look at,1.8

19,"May 14, 2019",I saw a vehicle at this dealership on Car Gurus. I sent an email to get more information and the salesman was very helpful. It is about a two hour drive from where I live but it was well worth it. Everyone at this dealership was very friendly. I wanted to get some additions to the vehicle that would take a few days so I was given a loaner vehicle to drive and when my vehicle was ready they offered to make the two hour drive and bring it to me. My sales guy Bob and Gary the finance manager are awesome! I am glad I came to this dealership. ,5.0

21,"March 22, 2019","Josh was very helpful! We really enjoyed having him help us with finding the perfect car! I recommend him to any buyer! He worked with our budget and got to go home in a brand car.  He really loves what he does, and makes sure every customer leaves with a big smile! Thank you once again!
We also recommend Marcia Strickland, she is a helpful hand in the process of this new Jeep. She as well worked as hard as she could to fit our budget, and she made it happen. We would not be with what we got if we did not have the help of these two people that love making their customers happy.
Thank yall!!",4.8
22,"March 21, 2019","Really wasn't expecting to actually buy a new vehicle (just bought a new one in August 2017! Turns out after looking... they had exactly what I wanted (2019 Jeep Grand Cherokee)! Put in a request for more information on Saturday after closing & by Monday (3/18/19) morning JOSH was texting (unlike most salesmen... he actually remembered us)! Unexpectedly... they gave us payoff on my Jeep Cherokee & at that point... it was game on! By 3/20/19... we drove off w/our 2019 Grand Cherokee! I couldn't have asked for a smoother transaction... painless even, didn't think we could have asked for a better buying experience after buying the first one but, they showed us! There is a reason I went back to Josh... and will continue to go back! He is truly what a salesmen should be & gives salesmen a great name, I know a few that could learn a thing or 2 from him! Actually works for his people & and not so much about the bottom dollar! My husband can give even the best a run for their... and bless Josh's heart, he takes it w/a smile! Also, Marcia in Finance ... we basically told her my husband was the devil & I have never seen a more honest and upfront Finance person! All around GREAT SERVICE and GREAT Experience!!

25,"February 23, 2019","We couldn't be more happy with our experience with this dealership and the people we were blessed enough to have help us.  My dad researched for a couple of months to find my mom a new vehicle and he happened upon a very nice truck here.  He got in contact with Mr. Scott Clement and struck a deal over the phone.  My mother and I drove about 4 hours to see the truck and make sure it was a good fit for mom before we finished the deal.  Scott was amazing through the whole process.  He was so helpful and explained all of the features of the truck and never once pushed us to make a decision.  He was a genuine salesman who was there to make sure we got what we wanted, not just to get a check.  We then dealt with Mr. Gary Gilbert in the finance department and he was such a pleasure to work with.   He was quick and efficient and also another genuine human being. When looking for vehicles in the future, we will definitely be looking here first.  We would gladly drive 4 hours to do business here, especially with Mr. Clement and Mr. Gilbert again. ",5.0
26,"February 19, 2019","Went in because my seatbelts no longer work correctly on my existing car, that doesn't work with having a carseat. Found a good looking 2017 Jeep with some minor scuffing in the backseat and paint. Miles were way to high for that year model but no one could tell me why. The jeep was also priced to high for what it is worth. Went in to do some paperwork. Can't do the deal, they lowballed my trade in, wanted an extreme amount down on top of the trade. THEY PULLED MY CREDIT 5 TIMES DROPPING IT MASSIVE POINTS! Now NO other dealership is going to work with me it's so low! All this then they can't do it even if we wanted to because my husband is self employed. All this after seeing that we have paid my last car for the past 3 years with no missed payments. NEVER AGAIN!!!",1.0
27,"February 18, 2019","The sales representative,Josh Hernandez, went above and beyond in helping us purchase a new car. We gave him a price range and what we had in mind.When we got there he had a couple of cars picked out, which we loved both and went home with one. He explained the whole process in detail kept his word on the price range and made it a fun experience. He went over all the bells and whistles before driving the car home. EVERYONE there was so much fun. The vibes and atmosphere is so positive and laid back. EVERYONE greets you with a smile. Did I mention I drove an hour and a half to see these guys? Well worth the drive!! ",5.0
28,"February 17, 2019","Needing to replace our 2005 Dodge Ram 2500, I contacted my Son in-law Chris, a journeyman technician at Sulphur Springs Dodge, in Sulphur Springs Texas. Due to their very impressive inventory, sales person Josh Hernandez contacted me immediately with a recommendation perfect for our needs. Making the trip from Denton, we found the truck to be exactly as represented. Josh put the deal together for us in painless and professional fashion. Finance Manager Gary Gilbert arranged fantastic financing on the spot. If your looking to purchase a vehicle avoiding usual high pressure sales and normally painful financing processes this is the place to go!",5.0

30,"January 22, 2019","Last year I worked with the sales staff in purchasing my 2011 Camaro. The service I received from this dealership was outstanding. We had some time before we could close the deal. Once I received the funds I sent them the information, next day my Camero was in my driveway delivered to me here in Southern Louisiana. Gary Gilbert was my Sales rep (he is the Finance Guru now) and Miss Halee was my initial contact person.

35,"December 03, 2018",We went to a dealership before going to SS Dodge. We walked within 5 minutes cause didn’t get good vibe from other dealership. So we came to SS Dodge and Josh Hernandez was our salesman. Instantly got a good vibe from him. Not pushy just very good personality. Would recommend Josh Hernandez to be your salesman if you go to SS Dodge ,5.0
36,"November 29, 2018",I have been car shopping several weeks. I have been watching prices at several dealerships and when you go in to these dealer ships they try to give you the run around. I was very impressed with Sulphur springs dodge. Yes I knew what I wanted before I walked in but they didn't add any extra costs to my price I found listed on their one of their vehicles. I was in and out within 2 hours. I will be back to buy other vehicles when I need them.  if you are looking for a vehicle go see Zach. promise you wont be disappointed ,5.0
37,"November 28, 2018","Lewis was very good to work with. He was cooperative in the payment options and eager to make a deal while also being patient in the process. Overall, I would certainly deal with him again. Also, Marcia in financing was very helpful and understanding in the entire process. Very stern on their prices and not willing to come off of them. Wish I could have got a little off, but over all paid a good price for the vehicle purchased. Great dealership and great people. ",4.6

She transitioned me off to Josh in Sales, who then took the ball and ran with it. Josh went the extra mile to allow me to put the Jeep on a lift to inspect a concern I had regarding a weld issue some of the 2018 Wranglers had. After sharing my needs/wants with the management, we came to an agreement resulting in the purchase of the vehicle.

Josh was able to evaluate my trade with pictures and other vehicle information as well as getting a rebate that was not listed on the dealers website.   Within an hour we had set numbers and I headed out on a road trip.  Less that one hour at the dealership and my wife and I were headed back home.

I checked in for updates and initiated sending my documents and initiated the test drive. They never reached out to me for follow ups or updates. After sending my documents I reached out to them twice on separate days and all they told me is they were still waiting to hear back from the bank. I have never heard back from them since!!

Gary never got frustrated which was supprising to me b/c dealing with weak salesman in the past they usaully get a little salty towards me. This guy just keep going and pushing foward to help me find the perfect truck.

201,"October 04, 2017","I used Carmax.com to search for jeeps that meet my criteria.  Sulpher Springs was one of the dealers that had a jeep meeting my wants/needs.  I emailed on the morning of Monday, September 25th requesting further details of the vehicle.  Within a matter of a few hours I received the details I had requested along with a detailed video and a personal message from the General Manager, Jeff.  I also received a call from Bob answering further details.  I let them all know I was from Kansas City and that I'd prefer a delivery if possible.  They agreed to waive the delivery charges if purchased.  
It was mentioned that the online sale price was non-negotiable because that's their process - which I love btw.  Bob even volunteered to offer me a trade-in price for my existing 2014 Toyota Tundra.  I sent him some detailed pictures and answered some basic questions around the condition of the vehicle.  
That Wednesday he called to offer me a trade-in price which was right in line with what I was expecting and we agreed to the deal.  
The Finance Manager called me Friday night to outline the remaining details and we worked everything out over the phone.  Bob also did a great job of keeping me posted on the delivery specifics throughout - even checking in after the vehicle was delivered.  
James, the driver, was right on time that Saturday and couldn't have been more pleasant as well.  The whole experience was tremendous.  
Thanks to everyone involved.",5.0

203,"September 21, 2017","We would like to compliment your staff for the excellence experience that my wife and I had in purchasing a vehicle from your dealership.

We had been looking for a new truck for a couple of months.  In identifying the truck (2017 Ram 2500 diesel) and options that we were looking for on the Chrysler website, it identified a truck at your dealership that satisfied most of my requirements.   I asked for the dealership to contact me.

The next morning I received a call inviting me to come in and test drive the truck.  When we arrived, we were warmly greeted.  I announced that I had an appointment.  They said Bod Boynton was expecting me.  He had already pulled the truck up.  After going over some preliminary items, we took a test drive.  The turck sold itself.

We came back to the dealership to work out the details, rebates and additional options (tool box, spray in bedliner and hidden gooseneck hitch).  Bob and your team were nothing short of amazing in finding rebates that we qualified for.

In the 45 years that I have been buying vehicles, our experience with your dealership and Bob was one of the best if not the best I’ve had.  We look forward to our continued relationship.

Sincerely,
Randy J. Vest

Melissa was the first to greet us and within minutes she had the two trucks we were interested in pulled up outside the dealership so we could take a look.  Marcia (from Finance) is super knowledgeable and put us at ease from the minute we stepped in her office.  She got us a great rate and a very reasonably priced extended warranty which made a good experience even better.  I love my RAM 1500 and I can't say enough about how awesome this place is.

205,"September 19, 2017","I have been in the market for buying a newer car for 3-4 months. I knew what I was looking for, what I was willing spend, the specifics of  mileage range, etc. In other words - I do my homework. Locally, I found the advertised prices higher than I felt I wanted to spend and there was either the Ping-Pong game in negotiating the final price, trade-in value of my current car, my loan rate... yuck. I left 2 dealerships after 2 hours of frustration. I saw the car I liked for the price I was hoping to pay on E-bay of all places and it stated it was at the  Sulphur Springs CDJR, TX location. I spoke to one of the sales reps on the phone - confirming it was still there - yup - I didn't want a bait and switch - especially if I was driving 1 1/2 hours to get there. Let me tell you, the deal was DONE in 2 hours and I was driving away with my new car!!! They listened to my wants and needs, gave me a fair price on my trade-in, got me a great interest rate on my loan, and this was SERIOUSLY the EASIEST car purchase transaction I have ever experienced. Definitely worth the drive. My suggestion? Do your homework, get your trade-in ready, check their website for any other on-line specials and KNOW WHAT YOU WANT on all aspects of your purchase. Be an informed consumer and know your finances. I would definitely recommend this dealership to others who are in the market of a new or used car. Thank you.",5.0

During this process I decided to take advantage of returning my vehicle as I was under water with it even though I was current. Tons of offers came in from dealers saying they could finance me in a new vehicle while my BK was still open but my Husband wanted to search around to see if I had other options aside from the ones that we recieved in the mail. This is where we found Tammy Bain at the Sulphur Springs Dodge dealer. Not only was the vehicle gorgeous but Tanmy's dedication, patience, & just beyond friendly personality made the experience more enjoyable versus feeling like a  burden. Tammy & her team worked for hours to work the deal as being in an active BK can be complicated & they were successful. While the interest rate is terrible (not their fault) I am in a reliable vehicle, have a great warranty & can begin to rebuild credit while refinancing down the road. Leaving the dealer, definitely left me with a feeling that if for some reason down the road we needed another vehicle it's Tammy we'd be calling first.

243,"May 25, 2017","I don't care for car salesmen, lawyers or insurance peddlers. But something happened recently to change my mind. Not about lawyers or insurance people. They'really still xxxx. There'should hope for car salesmen, though. I bought my new truck from Bob Boynton at Sulphur Springs Dodge and I think he might have actually given a s***. We got the pricing out of the way early and they didn'the jerk me around on my trade. 
In all seriousness these folks have a system that works very well. Bob was with us the entire time and explained in detail what they were doing and what was going to happen next.
He made it so there were no surprises and we were never kept in the dark. Bob was completely transparent from the first time we talked on the phone until he called me the day after we bought.
I am not a fun guy to sell a car to but my wife was laughing at me on the way home because I kept talking about it. 
Anyway, these are good folks and Bob is a great guy. (For a car salesman, that is)
Update...my wife just punched me in the arm.",5.0

245,"May 03, 2017",I live about 2 hours away and saw the truck of my dreams posted on autotrader. I called the dealership and was amazed at how personable the employees are. Everyone I talked to was up beat and knew what they were talking about and I didn't get put on hold countless times and didn't have to deal with being transferred over and over again like I'm used to dealing with in my local areas dealerships . I called got all the information about the truck and started working out a deal. Most of my experience was over the phone and I was never kept out of the loop on what was going on. When I did finally go out to the dealership to sign for the truck my experience only got better. Arrived and was greeted as I pulled in and got down to business. The wait for all the titling was a little long but thats my fault for having to register out of state... however the guys there made the wait fun. I got to look around the lot and sit in some pretty cool vehicles on the lot! bwat car buying experience I've ever had!,5.0

248,"February 03, 2017","DO NOT BUY FROM SULPHUR SPRINGS DODGE! They do not honor defective cars. Service department is the worst I have seen. I bought three vehicles there in the past three years and our recent purchase of a brand new 2016 Jeep Compass on January 16th was great until they would not honor a design defect. Because of my car addiction I have bought 27 vehicles in my life so I'm a dealerships dream. I know cars better than most since I grew up in the Body Shop business. I can fix the problem myself but that is not the point. When you buy a 25,000.00 vehicle brand new with 100 miles on it and full warranty, you don't expect any problems much less working on the car yourself. I will muddy the name of Sulphur Springs Dodge on as many websites as I can.  I will post videos of defect on YouTube and Facebook as well as me making the repair since they will not honor the problem. I will be contacting Chrysler corporate office next.

254,"May 16, 2016","We are extremely disappointed with this  dealership.  We have been nothing but lied to.  From the advertisement of our used vehicle to tricking us into buying an insurance that is supposed to cover almost anything that could go wrong with the vehicle for a period of 2 years or 24000 miles.  When I asked to see the ad for the van that we purchased once more, so that I could see all of the things that were falsely advertised.  Everyone there shut down and acted dumb!!! This car lot is by far the crookedest that I have ever dealt with.  I will be posting this bad review to every possible site that  II can.  I am also considering getting a lawyer for a lawsuit!!!!!! DO NOT BY A CAR FROM THESE CROOKS!!!!!!!!!

255,"February 25, 2016","I have never been treated like I was at Sulphur Springs Chrysler Dodge Jeep when my current purchase.  The salesman, Gary Gilbert, is such a nice and pleasant man.  He worked hard to get the sale but was never pushy in anyway.  After I had signed the documents and was ready to leave, Gary went over every little detail about the car and all the features it had and how they worked.  No salesman has ever done this for me.  He made buying a new vehicle a little less painless.  I would recommend salesman, Gary Gilbert, to anyone, in fact, I already have. ",4.8

They were a pleasure to do business with as they were efficient and reasonable.  Jay was the salesman, Sheri handled finance and Jimmy checked me out on the vehicle and knew his stuff.  I met a number of people at the dealership, names escape me, but each person was welcoming and personable.  This now my new dealership for the future.",4.8

Bob was our salesman and Daryl is the only finance guy that I have ever liked.
Great experience and I will go ahead and drive the 70 miles again to do business with SS Dodge.",5.0
