0,"June 26, 2020","Warning - Be wary of Toyota of Boerne to do business with them. They have a very deceptive business practice the way they advertise the price of a car. I was attracted to the price of $15,999.00 for a 2019 Camry LE. But turns out, to buy the car, I have to pay additional $499.00 for installed security systems, and, $900.00 for safety check of the car. That makes the price NOT $15,999.00 plus tax and title, but, almost $17,500 plus tax and title. I say, they don't have a very clean and clear attitude. So, I left without a car from there.",1.0
1,"June 23, 2020","Okay, so we purchased a used and re-certified truck from toyota while we where there we saw the truck and it had four yellow circles marking paint damage, so the our car salesman edward ayala told us it would be taken care of. So we where there from 4pm to 1130 and like other customers I also did not recieve all my paper work and they gave us the truck washed. I asked and made sure they would take care of everything and at that time they didnt and there ate many other incidents that happend as well. When I brought the truck back to get the paint fixed they only fixed one of the problems and at the same time broke off the arena and stold my husbands jumper cables and straps. Edward had them fix the arena, but once again we had to wait forever.  And like some of the other comments I've read, I also mentioned that I did not want the security package, but they made me buy too. My dad told me that no one should make us buy anything we don't want, if it's going to be our car. Like what the heck, my dad is right and I still feel so upset.  So sometime in may we had to take the truck in for a nail in the tire and they told my husband that he needed to pay $100 for an alignment and something about the milage was off. I was like cmon really. So while we where waiting to pick up the truck from the tire being changed I called and spoke with a David Rojas, I explained everything that I mentioned on the last review,  plus this alignment they wanted my husband to pay for. He put me on hold for a while and then came back and took care of the alignment. But, David said we would talk again and set up a time for him to see the truck and the damages that where not taken care of. They dont even care someone stole my husbands jumper cables and straps. That's a huge reason we stay out of San Antonio, because we feel that we are safe a secure in boerne, but I guess every place is the same. They do not care about the consumer that is helping to pay their Bill's. Especially making us buy this horrible security feature. Oh and let me tell you what Edward told me, to call my insurance to get the rest of the truck fix, because it was to much money for Toyota to dish out. I would have bought a new truck then. Geez theres so much more to tell, but honestly make sure you stand your ground. Edward is just looking for fast sales, and the closing guy told me he was a manager too. No call back from anyone so disappointed. Mitsubishi treated us better, and I was thinking we where upgrading to the Toyota dealership.",1.0
2,"June 21, 2020","They did an obvious bait and switch on me. The car they said was unsellable is still for sale etc. I reported them to the DMV for deceptive practices. The salesmen's name was benitez. Do not go here they will try to scam you !

3,"June 18, 2020","Do not go there. They had us wait there for 3 hours. We wanted to buy a car and pay cash. They told us that they could pass more than 3k on the debit card and that we would have to finance the rest. I told them no bit because we didn't have any other way to pay we finally agreed. The salesman said it would be an in house credit and that it wouldn't affect our credit report. I really didn't like their tactics and after waiting there forever we left. Well we received a letter in the mail yesterday stating that they had ran our credit anyways. DO NOT GO THERE. The only thing they care about is money. They treated us like we were idiots. And by the way the next day we found the same car for 1000$ less,.less mileage and perfect customer service. ",1.0
4,"June 17, 2020","Called to ask if a specific car was available, a sales agent told me that yes it was, he “verified it himself.” Drove 30 minutes each way to get there. Shocker, they sold the car several hours before we called. If you look at any other reviews, you can see this is a common tactic they use. Deceitful and intentionally dishonest. Don’t come here.",1.0
5,"June 08, 2020","Extremely frustrating experience. They throw in so many outrageous hidden fees that they say are “required.” They gave me a really good price, which I then FLEW OUT FROM COLORADO FOR. Only to be told that wasn’t the price and there was nothing they could do about it because “it’s already priced so low we are losing money on it.” Typical salesman BS. They put in certifications and Apex system and claimed that they were 100% required if I wanted to purchase this vehicle. The finance manager is truly a xxxxxxx and snuck in a bunch of different warranties that he claimed were apart of the “required certification.” Do not buy from this dealer. ",1.0

7,"May 28, 2020","If you have not had the pleasure of getting your vehicle serviced at Toyota of Boerne, you are seriously missing out on a great experience! My Service Advisor is Daniel Reeves and he absolutely goes above and beyond every time when it comes to customer service and ensuring my vehicle leaves in better shape than it arrived. He is patient yet thorough and will not steer you wrong. I would not take my vehicle anywhere else and would HIGHLY recommend you see Daniel Reeves for all your service needs at Toyota of Boerne!",5.0
8,"May 27, 2020","On May 22, 2020, I went into Toyota Boerne to inquire about trading in my car.  My salesman's name was David Aguais, and he brought me back to his cubicle to take down my insurance so I could test drive the car. Once I came back from test driving, Mr. Aguais confirmed the payoff of my car, which was $14,271. He went to speak with finance, and came back and told me that Toyota was only going to give me $10,000 for my car. At that point, I told Mr. Aguais I was going to pass on the offer. Mr. Aguais then asked me, ""What do I need to do to get you to drive off the lot with this car today"". I told him that Toyota needed to pay off my car completely. Mr. Aguais told me he was unsure if they were going to give another $4,000, but he was going to see what he could do. He leaves again, and comes back with a new monthly payment and says, ""they're going to pay your car off."" At this point, I proceeded with the process. After about 2 hours of waiting, I finally make it into the finance office and meet PJ. PJ starts printing off the paperwork for me to sign. On the car I was going to buy, a part of the front grill was broken, and asked PJ if my warranty was going to cover it. He explained that it would not be covered because it wasn't a ""mechanical fix"". He called in Mr. Aguias, and asked him to confirm, and I was told I was going to have to pay out of pocket for the fix. At that point, I told them I was going to walk away from the car, because I simply did not want to pay out of pocket for a front grill, when the car I have now is in perfect condition. Both of their attitudes quickly changed. I went outside to look at the front grill again, and was very sure I was going to pass on it offer. After about 10 minutes, the used car manager, John Putman tells me that the fix will be put into the contract with no cost to me. After that, I'm back in the finance office ready to sign, until I see that there is a negative equity of $4,271. I asked PJ what that number was for and he said, ""Oh no, that is what you got us (Toyota) for. You're not paying that, Good job"", and laughed about it. I then signed the contract. That entire time I was in the car buying process nobody told me that the $4,271 was rolled over onto my loan, now making it over 22 thousand dollars. Once I realized this mistake, I went back to the dealership today, and was completely mistreated. I spoke with Mr. Aguais and explained to him what my issues were, and proceeded to tell me ""well negative equity is normal"", as if that was a good excuse to not tell me I even had any. He then brings the floor manager, Jerry, over to me, and says the same thing, and that I need to speak with finance. I'm then sitting with PJ, who ADMITS that he was wrong for not explaining, and he didn't mean what he said, and that it was basically ""his bad"", but the contract is ""sign, sealed, and delivered"" and there's nothing he could do. Then I'm told I need to wait for Mr. Putman to come in, but OF COURSE he was not in, and nobody knew when he was going to be. Finally, I speak to the only person that treated me like a decent human being, Gary Weems, who deals with the car contracts. He explains to me that I can't terminate the contract, but I do indeed need to sit down with Mr. Putman to try to resolve this. I made it very clear to every person I sat with today, that I feel extremely taken advantage of. I was alone when I came in that day, and they were aware that my husband is doing a tour in Korea. Throughout this entire process, my husband heard every word everyone said to me, as well as my father. Mr. Aguias, and PJ knew exactly what they were doing, and they completely went about this the wrong way. To pay 22 thousand dollars for a 2015,broken front grill, Mercades makes no sense. ALSO I put down a $5000 DOWN PAYMENT THAT DID NOTHING TO THE COST OF THE CAR THAT WAS MARKED $17,000. I told them if they were to do simple math, $17,000 plus taxes would bring the car to a little over $18,000. with a $5,000 down payment, that would make my loan a little over $13,000.

9,"April 24, 2020","They tout flexible distance purchasing options during COVID19, but that is not the truth. I live west of Austin, and agreed to purchase a vehicle with a salesperson at the asking price and was told that he would deliver the vehicle and paperwork to me at home; however, shortly thereafter he stopped fielding my calls. When I checked the website, I learned that the vehicle I had agreed to purchase had been removed. 
I called in to the dealership and asked to speak to a manager only to be connected to another salesman. He checked on the vehicle and said that they had sold it after I had agreed to purchase the vehicle. At this point I asked to speak to a manager and the salesman asked me what good I thought that would do. I asked again to speak to a manager and he refused my request, eventually telling me that I needed to come o the dealership if I wanted to be helped. 
I finally hung up and called back, this time getting connected to a manager. After speaking to the manager he stated they “dropped the balk” he would take action against the salesmen, but as far as the vehicle was concerned, I was out of luck because the one I had agreed to purchase was a “unicorn” and they likely wouldn’t have one like it for some time.
When pressed, he also admitted that it was their practice to sell to a person who was in the store over a person who agreed to purchase a vehicle over the phone. So much for their commitment to flexible distance buying options. 
Deal with these guys at your own risk. The are unprofessional and completely underhanded. I’m one breathe they will tell you that they have made many changes in the buying experience to ensure they accommodate buyers during this uncertain time in our country, and then in another breathe they will tell you that they were not prepared for conducting business during this time and that is the reason for their lack of transparency and professionalism (this came from a sales manager). I expected more from this dealership, but in the end, I guess there are reasons why you should never trust a used car dealership. ",1.0
10,"April 16, 2020","No return phone calls for a part  that was promised on a recent car sale AND six weeks with no registration.  We have to drive there on Saturday because the sales person, that won’t leave anyone alone when they are trying to make a sale, all of a sudden won’t answer a text. No one above the salesperson in the structure of this dealership will return a call.  Three weeks before the truck we bought can be legally impounded due to inefficiency and lack of communication.  A simple phone call would suffice.  I will be posting this review everywhere I can on the internet.",1.0
11,"March 18, 2020",I would not buy here.  I mentioned several times I wanted a used car and they kept showing me new.  I talked to at least 6 people and was given the hard sale.  Just leave.  I totally felt pressured.  6 against 1 were not good odds.  ,1.0

13,"March 13, 2020","If you are just going there to look for a car probably a decent place to look.  But if you are looking for a very specific make, model and trim beware.  They will tell you anything they have to in order to get you out there.  Two times in a row now they have stated they had what I was looking for but when I get there they didn't have it but would be happy to show me something 5k to 10k more expensive.  This place is out of the way as it and having them just lie to get me out there is a bad way to run a business.  When I asked to speak to the manager about this he was ""too busy"" and sent his assistant to speak with me.  Wouldn't recommend this place, and I had purchased a vehicle from them in the past, but won't be going back there again.  Nice place, bad business.   ",1.5
14,"January 06, 2020","Mark Sonnen and his team at Toyota of Boerne made my car experience a dream.  From the moment I walked in to the dealership I felt my needs were heard and valued.  After explaining what I was looking for and my financial needs, Victor Gutierrez set off with finding me the perfect vehicle for my family.  After seeing a 2nd vehicle I knew that I had the one that was right for my situation.  Victor and Mark then worked to make my deal so irresistible there was no way I could ever turn it down.  Mark got me top dollar for my trade-in while David Mickelson personally got my financing set up.

20,"June 22, 2019","My experience with the Toyota Boerne Service Department is that they have very poor communication with customers.  The department performed two very expensive repairs on my car, and the next day I examined the car and noticed that one of the parts that I had thought was being replaced was obviously still in its original worn condition.  This raised questions about whether the entire repair had been done and whether I had paid for something that had not been done.  So I emailed the service department and they followed up with a voice mail message.  However, they did not return my next three calls.  I sent a few more emails and these were ignored as well.  Finally, after 2.5 months, they agreed that a manager would call me to explain what had been repaired, and we set up a specific day and time for the call.  I sat for an hour waiting for that call, which never came, and they did not even apologize for missing the call.  This tells me that the Toyota Boerne Service Department has poor communication, poor customer relations, and poor accountability.  They have permanently lost my business and I recommend that others avoid them as well.",2.2
21,"June 21, 2019","I had a GREAT CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. The listing was accurate to my expectation. My sales person was Justin Thompson who was quick to respond to my inquiry. The sales Mgr Aman was very accomidating while crunching the numbers. Everyone was kind including the receptionists at the front entrance. They provided me with a no pressure fun experience during a stressful time. I was really searching for a GREAT customer experience and that's exactly what I got along with a vehicle I absolutely LOVE.  I will be reccomending this dealership to others in need of a vehicle. Thank you all,  DeLinda",5.0
22,"June 18, 2019","I took my Land-cruiser in for the airbag recall over 3 months ago.  As of now there is still no recall solution (Toyota issue, not the dealer).  They gave me a loaner car, which was appreciated, but while my car was on their lot, an employee backed into it, wrecking it.  I was assured that my car would be fixed, and it was, and I was also assured that this wreck/incident would not show up on my CarFax report... (How can they be sure of this?)  After going back and forth and Toyota of Boerne dealership sending me from person to person to speak with every employee that has a name-tag, they promised me that they would make this right and they would give us a deal that we could not pass up and buy a new Land-cruiser.  Needless to say the ""GREAT DEAL"" they wanted to give me was crap.  They offered to give me $9,000 less than what I owed on my car, which is in perfect condition, low miles, and I was less than a year into the ownership and offered me ""Dealer cost"" on a 2019 land-cruiser at $81,000.  
1.  I was not looking to trade up or get rid of my Land-cruiser.  I LOVE this car and was planning on keeping it for a long time because they hold their value and last forever.
2.  By the time I would have traded this car in, I would most certainly not have been upside down on it.
3.  They have a bad habit of backing/running into/wrecking cars that are on their lot, because when I was originally looking to buy my landcruiser a year ago, I wanted one on their lot that the previous owners had traded in because TOYOTA of BOERNE wrecked the car on their premises during an oil change. GUESS WHAT?!?  That was on the carfax so I didn't purchase that car... 
4.  Toyota has a RECALL that there is no FORESEEABLE SOLUTION to... & Toyota of BOERNE wrecked my car on their lot.... I don't think it is fair or right for me to have to be the one upside down or to get less for my car down the road when it shows its been wrecked and I'm not even the one who did it.  

I finally had a meeting with the GM. Chris Franklin and the Fixed Operations Director, Jason Briggs (the guy who assured us he would fix this and make everything right because that's what he does, fixes problems)... and they couldn't care less about me or the situation.  

Toyota of Boerne has been a joke and if I were the owners, I would be embarrassed at how the employees handle problems that they created.",1.0
23,"May 24, 2019","I would highly not recommend you go to the used car lot.  The manager David Padillia does not honor good business practices.  If you buy a vehicle from Toyota Boerne, and when you bought it at the time, you do not discover there was a mechanical problem with the vehicle.  Then Mr. Padillia will not do the moral or honorable business practice, and fix the existing issues that was with the car before you purchased it.  Even if they day the car was a certified inspected car.  So please be aware of Mr. Padillia and just know he is not a reputable business man.  He will find any and every way to pass on expenses to you as the car buyer.  Even if it was preexisting and a certified inspected vehicle bu their own mechanics.",1.8
24,"May 15, 2019","Michael Rodriguez worked with me for over 2 weeks to help me find the right vehicle. He seemed nice and caring. I ended up coming in after I was pre-approved, and picked out my car. I test drove my vehicle and signed the paperwork. By the time the make ready department and the paperwork was done it was after 11pm at night. Before I drove away, I pointed out the floor matts were missing and the Entune app was not working. My sales guy assured me he would take care of me. I was going to call in to schedule to have it all taken care of when they were actually open. They closed earlier in the night.
While on the way home I discovered a warped driver side mirror. All it was,  was most likely someone had taken a fish eye mirror off of it and one of the tabs had come undone on the back side of the mirror. Easy, just needed to be clicked back into place.
I returned to the dealership less than 12 hours later the next morning after speaking with the floor manager ""Will Hernandez"" before just showing up. I spoke with him since my sales guy was actually off the next day, and I decided I needed my floor mats ASAP since I wanted to show my boyfriend the car. The IT guy was not available but the side mirror and the carpets could be addressed if I came up to the dealership. Repairs done, A service guy brought me my vehicle, after the floor mats and the mirror was fixed. When I opened my vehicle I immediately see and pointed out the 2 holes that did not exist when I handed my car over to them. I immediately asked for the floor manager Will. He took a look at it, took a picture. We discussed that it was not present prior to the car being serviced. He went in the back spoke to some people and then came back out and assured me they would take care of it and that someone would be giving me a call to schedule to have it repaired. That his restoration department would Need to look at the pictures he took and order the materials needed. But then they would call me. 
I ended up speaking to the floor manager Will Hernandez again and my sales guy several times over this passed month, even discussing that parts were on order and that once they came in someone would call to achedule the repair. So I waited for a Call. Its now been a month, I call in several times. I speak with someone in the service department who tells me they have no parts on order nor a work order. I then speak to the floor manager Will, who calms me down and assures me that his restoration department would be handling it and not the service department and that that is why the service department didnt know what was going on. That he would give me a call back in 20 minutes. He didnt call me back after 20 minutes. I wait patiently, maybe he needs more time? So I go about my day. 
I call in the next day and ask for Will the floor manager again, and I find out he is no longer a floor manager. I ask for Michael Rodriguez, he is busy. I am sent to speak with Larry Horn. I have to explain everything again, manager seems kind and responsive, apologizes for everything that has happened. Informs me he isnt aware of my situation, but that he would look into things and then asks me to come in the following Monday for his guy to look at the seat.
As soon as I hang up, i realized I had a Dr. apt that I could not reschedule. i call in and I ask while for Michael Rodriguez if he isn't busy. I let him know whats going on, i let him know I will be coming in on Tuesday.
I bring my car in, that Tuesday as discussed. no one is working that has any experience or knowledge with the situation. I ended up speaking with David Padilla, seems like a nice guy. I feel bad for this being dumped on his lap. He assures me the Entune will be taken care of, that he sees notes for it. but that he will need to look into the seat cover issue.
He comes back and informs me that the tears existed before I purchased the vehicle, and shows me a picture of the tears, along with a techs note.
I am a person who is willing to own up to my mistakes. But after being jerked around over this passed month I am 100% sure I was lied to and mislead in order to prevent me from returning the vehicle and demanding repair. Its strange that no one came across this picture over this entire passed month. That all of the techs, managers and sales people didnt see these notes and picture? That I was told it would be taken care of, and not to worry. That I had parts on order. But no one this entire month ever entered anything into the account detailing any of the damages, conversations, parts or repair details? No this is fishy. 
I explain that if the manager ""Will"" had brought up the picture, the day I found the tears. That I would have apologized for accusing His service department of damaging my Vehicle, but I would have also insisted they fix it or take it back. Padilla offered a year of free car washes, but I refused it. I was also given the option to pay for the repair. But I have also opted to not give Toyota of Boerne another dime.",1.4

26,"April 25, 2019","So this is review is for the sales side of TOB.  No reflection on the Service side.
So my kids had been working with your salesperson Ben.  I showed up yesterday just to see how things were going.   The short of it was that Ben had knocked off 1000 from the internet price of the vehicle, making the sale price 26,994.  They were then offering the kids 9500 for the tundra.   I told the kids to go somewhere else as this was not a good deal and left.  But, my kids stuck around.  This is the part that is unforgivable.  So Ben goes and speaks to the sales manager and they present the kids with a “better” offer.  They increased the trade in to 10k.  What Ben did not tell the kids was that they had also put the sale price back to 27,994.  The kids thought they were getting a better deal when in fact they had just gotten screwed.  I told them repeatedly not to trust the TOB salespeople as they manipulate numbers.  I advised them to double check all the numbers.  As soon as I saw the worksheet they sent me I saw it. MSRP of 32994-5k discount = full sale price of the vehicle
I had been a loyal TOB customer for years.  I have purchased 3 vehicles from you.  Heck even as recent as a few months, we were looking for a vehicle for my son and we were on our way to TOB.  Thankfully, we saw a vehicle we liked at Cavender Chevrolet in Boerne and stopped there.  The buying experience was 1000 times better.  But my kids actually think you are a friend to them and are still loyal to TOB.  I hope this experience will teach them that there is no such thing as a friend at TOB.  Even after I showed them what Ben had done to them, they refused to confront him.
Sorry man, but you will never see me at your dealership again.  I can’t speak for my kids.  They are young and still trust people.  I'm posting this not for you to feel sorry for my kids.  This is a hard lesson about not going to a dealership unless you absolutely have to, walk away if the people are shady and finally, especially at TOB, triple check the numbers.  If you don't, they will absolutely take advantage of you.",1.0
27,"April 01, 2019","I arrived at dealership at 7pm. By 9pm paperwork and vehicle prep was completed. I was told I would have to wait for the ""finance"" person. I was paying cash for a new vehicle. I needed to sign a few forms and write a check. I was forced to wait over 2 hours! I walked laps around the showroom to kill time. When I finally met the ""finance"" person he teased me: ""Did you get your laps in? Ha Ha"". I arrived home at midnight.

I had a bid secured by Car Bargains with a guaranteed price. I refused to sign the purchase order as $1800 of unspecified accessories had been added to the price. After showing the bid to a manager, they adjusted the price. Perhaps the ""finance"" person was punishing me by being intentionally rude.

28,"March 09, 2019","Absolutely the worst car buying experience I have ever had in my life .
I bought a certified pre owned 2017 Tacoma after owning the care for 3 days notice a rubbing noise coming from the wheels well after inspecting I could see the tires were rubbing the front control arms on both sides as the tires weren’t making clearance (which was supposedly checked during the 160 point inspection) after taking my car I’m brandon the sales manager and Richard the make ready manager told me the problem was cosmetic and my problem. Then put in writing that my car was safe to drive as is . I then took my car to two separate Toyota dealerships and discount tire who disputed his claim and put in writing my car was in fact in unsafe to drive in the condition it was sold I then called the Toyota hotline and was supposed to be put in contact with Larissa the customer relations manager and it has now been a week that she has not contacted me I’m any way and I still don’t have the vehicle that I paid for . To add insult to injury Robert then acknowledges there is and issue and gives me two options put wheel spacers at my cost as they are unsafe or put factory wheels back on keep in mind my truck has a lift and would look ridiculous with factory wheels now the lot is unwilling to replace the wheels with the correct size and outsourced the work to put spacers on the vehicle after all without my consent .
I had put my faith in the fact that I was at a franchised Toyota dealership and was buying a certified vehicle that I would not only be treated with dignity and respect but that I would have a safe vehicle for me and my family .NONE of thee above were met and I would absolutely never recommend this lot to anyone",1.0

I had 2 flats within days of purchase, persistent alignment issues, a blown shock, a blow-out, multiple trips to the dealership trying to remedy issues that they didn't fix when it was just there in service, on top of having to spend another thousand dollars on repairs and tires that they refused to replace (even though they didn't pass certified inspection guidelines).

31,"September 06, 2018","I brought a car at the beginning of the month and drove it home everything was ok until 13 days later Toyota of Borne decide to run my credit check again with out my permission, for no reason. I have try to call them and ask why and no response, I try talk to the credit bureau what it and no luck. And I would not recommend buying from them.",3.2
32,"August 16, 2018","1st call was made 9/13/18. Spoke to Meredith who does car sales. Let her know that I was interested on making an offer for $15,000 cash out the door on the 2017 Kia Sedona LX which was priced at $17,493. Let her know that I was looking at this Kia Sedona and a Nissan Quest at another dealership which also was a great deal to pass. Asked her if she can contact her Finance Manager and if they would be willing to take that offer. She got back at me and said that the manager had said yes. I told her I would be able to go by but I also wanted to know what the extended warranty looked like for that vehicle. Said that the manager is supposed to contact me to let me know about the warranty. Second day, 9/14/18, called the dealership, spoke to Meredith and said she let her manager know about the warranty and they would call me back. Never heard back from anyone so I decided to leave a message on his machine. Manager called me back after a message was left on his voicemail after not hearing back for almost a day. Spoke to Aman and he said I would have to go in and talk about the warranty since they had many of them on hand. That was understandable. 9/15/18 I called in the morning asking to talk to Meredith. Got a hold of her and let her know that I wanted to purchase the vehicle but I couldn’t drive all the way over there because I had no one to take with me to bring the new vehicle back and drive my own vehicle as well. Asked if they could drop it off and she said that they could work it out. I also asked that since I was paying cash if she could drop it off and bring all the paperwork with her and I could sign all the paperwork here. She said that I would have to drive up there because she would have to scan, make copies and have me sign documents. Not sure why all this would be needed if I was paying cash. That seemed fishy! I specifically told her that all I had was the $15,000 cash only and that was my offer. She said yes that’s fine. I decided to drive the 3 hours to the dealership because I was so excited about the offer. Got to the dealership and everything went down hill from there. Met Meredith and test drove the vehicle around the dealership and let her know that I was ready to take it. She then said “I will have to talk to the manager to see if the $15,000 is okay.” At that point,  I really wasn’t sure if I had heard right. She then asked if I wanted to look at another vehicle. Let her known that I was only interested on the Kia. That was the whole reason I drove the 3 hours to the dealership. She then said again “let me talk to the manager to see if the $15,000 is okay.” At that point I already knew that nothing that was told to me at this point was true. Anything just to get me into the dealership and make me buy another vehicle that I didn’t want. Spoke to two different managers and told them the situation, and both of them said that they couldn’t work with those numbers. The last manager told me that one of the other managers by mistake gave her the wrong numbers and they couldn't honor the offer because they wouldn’t be able to make money on it. That was the excuse for the whole cover up. I know that was a lie!!  There is no excuse for dishonesty! My whole day was consumed for this transaction. Drove 7 hours including to the bank and traffic, spent a whole tank of gas, put extra miles on my car, no car was brought with me and called the other dealership about the Nissan Quest and they had just sold the vehicle that day. Seems like the only one that ended up losing in this whole deal was me!!! The managers didn’t even offer to refill my tank of gas for driving all that way. That was the least they could’ve done!! But again, wasn’t expected since they would probably lose out on money for gas too!! Never again am I going here!! I would love to have the owners email address to let him know the kind of people working there. Oh and having someone from the company posting a “sorry message” to this message still doesn’t make a difference to the horrible experience I had.",1.0

34,"August 03, 2018",Tried to buy a car had it for a week and they told me the intrest rate was going to go from 4.6% th 12.9% so I took the car back. Never trust car salesman or finance officers nothing scammer.,1.4
35,"June 09, 2018","The salesman with whom we were working was very good. As I apologized throughout the process for my apprehension, he repeatedly reminded me that I was embarking upon a big purchase and it was my money to spend. 

Having conceded a $1000.00 another gentleman came back to advise we must add $500.00. Reminding him we were already over our intended budget, we would think about it that night and return in the morning dependent upon our decision. The gentleman went back to an office only to return stating, per the GM, if we walked out tonight the deal would be ""off the table."" 

While such a purchase may be small change to many who walk through the doors of Toyota of Boerne, in an instant I realized that I was being pressured into making an immediate decision and that the GM and salesman had conflicting ideas about the size and commitment of such a purchase and how I should decide to spend my money. Had the GM simply stated the deal may not be available the following morning versus trying to strong arm me I would have taken the risk understanding nothing had been written in stone. 

The experience, in a flash, went from best to worst as the boss man demonstrated a failed attempt of force and failed to advise operational policy in a non-threatening manner.",1.8

45,"December 05, 2017","SERVICE DEPARTMENT 
I am very unsatisfied and disappointed with my recent experience with Toyota of Boerne. I drove a total of 132 miles to check out a 2016 Voltswagon Passat, 2 days of owning the car I have come to find out that the Rotors were grooved  in and my alignment was completely off. So the next day I drove another total of 132 miles to see if this issue could be resolved. The car was shaking so badly my hands would vibrate on the steering wheel and the gas paddle, also my stopping time was effected by this. The Sales manager told me he did not know how this was over looked and the Service Manger said the something. The Service manger told me it was their fault for over looking this issue and told me they would take care of it. They gave me a rental and I returned the next day traveling 66 miles, Missing Classes and MY MILITARY TRAINING to take care of the issue.
When I looked over the car I noticed the Rear Rotors weren't even touched. When I asked about this the Service manger told me it was not a safety issue and doesn't effect the cars driving. I argued with the sales manger for about an hour and no dice. They did half the job and told me it was ""NOT profitable"" for them to spend one more hour to fix what they missed in the first place and deemed not a safety issue!!  
I understand that your techs don't deem this a safety issue but it's now become a customer service, or lack thereof, issue. Your techs overlooked the issue from the beginning then half assed the repair doing only the bare minimum and not correcting the entire issue. I expected more from a large dealership with such a reputation. This was my first and definitely my last experience with this company. And as a lifetime local resident and Army Veteran, I can assure you that my friends, family, and social network will be warned about the shortcomings of your Service department.",1.8

Colin showed me what wad on the lot and when Erik finished with the other customer her came over and we ordered the Sports model. I called Erik last Saturday, told him I wanted the Blue Sequioa Limited, weren't in Tuesday and picked it up. I enjoyed working with Erik, he did not try to force a car on me.

On the way up our salesman called to advise TOB was not keeping the vehicle as it was not up to their standards but they had another one come in the day before I might be interested in.  It was above my price range but he assured me they would work with us.  We left with what we felt was a very good deal on a better vehicle.  Although the process was very long like all dealerships our car had not been detailed so they detailed it for us before we picked it up.  Weren't happy with the unseen parts of the detailing so the manager gave us complimentary detailing the next time we came in. We bought the extended warranty so our oil changes are free and we have to say we have NEVER been treated this well at a dealership.  They go above and beyond in courtesy and service. ,5.0

136,"January 06, 2017","We have dealt with this dealership since 2006. It used to be a great place to deal with, hometown feeling.  I bought 5 new , 1 used Toyota vehicles in 10 years from this place. The last few months we have had issues with wait time in service department, 3 hours for a tire rotation, 3 hours for an oil change, both times with an appointment on the 2015 4 Runner.  We decided to get a used Tacoma for our son for Christmas since Toyota is typically reliable, and used to love buying from here.  We went over there, I knew what we needed. This was a whole new staff, so we didn't recognize anybody but the finance gentleman.  I met with Emmanuel Sanders. At first he was very nice, but later starting getting pushy, was not listening to what our needs where, wanted to run credit first and stated it was policy.  I told him we need to negotiate trade and sales price first, then once numbers were agreed on we will run the credit, I told him my credit was excellent so it will not be an issue. While I was on the phone Emmanuel went and got the sales manager, he  came out and asked what the trouble was and we discussed the deal and situation at hand, we spoke, we did finally get prices worked out, then ran credit, went to finance and I signed my paperwork that day through Toyota financial, low rate, I even bought gap, and extended warranty. My wife was going to sign in the morning the next day once we brought our son over to test drive  and make sure he would be comfortable with it. (Toyota Tacoma does not have a seat lever to raise the seat, so we wanted to make sure on visibility issues seeing over the hood.) Saturday am we got there with our son, first no bow on truck like I asked, but I let it slide. Then, they would not let my son test drive even in the parking lot without a salesman in the seat, I explained that he is not going on the highway or access road, and my wife and I will be with him. They had our license, his license, our insurance, with his name on it. After heated discussion we were told to leave and they did not want to sell us a vehicle.  I told them off also getting really loud at that point, and we were not going to buy without him being confident about driving since he was used to driving a Corolla. I did apologize before we left because I hate leaving relationships like that, but they walked off,  to this day I never got a phone call. Toyota of Boerne went down hill really fast, what a shame.  We went across the street and bought a used 2015 GMC Canyon from Steven Webb at Nissan Boerne,  paid $4500 more since it had more options,  lower miles. Great experience,  and he even put a bow on it while we were in finance. 2 hours for whole transaction,  was even great on the trade.  Oh, and my son got to test drive with no grief, AND NO Salesman in the seat, LOL.",1.2
137,"January 04, 2017","Mat Casanova was our sales associate and worked diligently until he found the right car for our family. It took us 3 days and ""one that got away"", but he finally found a Highlander that pleased us.

141,"December 30, 2016","The minute we sat down the salesman asked us to sign a commitment that we would buy a car from them.  Apparently this is common for this lot.  What the xxxx is that about?  We told him no and it was downhill from there.  He pulled all the usual bull.  He would not give us straight answers on prices of any cars.  He made us get into a car and drove us around the lot doing 2 mph for 30 minutes.  Clearly trying to get us invested in this trip to the dealership.  After not giving any straight answers on price and wasting over thirty minutes driving around while he tried to ask probing questions to feel us out he went to talk to his manager which we all know is a lie.  We finally had enough and left while he was off ""talking to his manager"".  I called back just to see if they were willing to stop playing games and the salesman hung up on me.  I wasn't rude at all but he was furious that we left.  I called and left 2 messages for the general/floor manager and never got a call back.  These guys are typical car salesman trying to screw your for a buck.  We went to cavender Toyota next and we got clear answers with no bs and walked out with a car in an hour.

It didn't work, the system as installed would not alarm on any automobiles however it did alarm on PEOPLE walking on the sidewalks.  We turned the car in for a 2015 Highlander Limited - much better.  Our friends bought a new Avalon which we were to receive a $100 gift card.  After several months of asking about it we were finally told to come by on a Friday to pick it up (after 4 months).  When my wife arrived at TOB no one knew anything about it - I gave up.  Also I had DV plates on my 2013 Highlander trade-in that were never removed and place on the new 2015 cars.  I received several sets of new Texas plate in the mail which I had to turn in for refund to receive my DV plates.  It took me 10 days and 4 trips to San Antonio  to straighten in all out.

I had a problem with a creeping noise inside the car and that was the reason for my visit.  After speaking to a female service advisor on the phone, I informed her I was going over.  When I arrived, she was not to be found.  So another service advisor helped me and said that by the time the car was looked at she would return.  I waited for about an hour to an hour and a half.  I saw this female in her office, just talking to her teammates.  So I approached her asked her name.  She had returned but had not informed me of my vehicle status.  She said it was being worked on.  So I waited another hour and then approached the Cashier and she stated my vehicle was not there.  She couldn't find my name.  I assured her they had written up my order in my name.  She went to the female advisor and she said the lady stated she didn't know who I was!!!  After waiting there for 3 1/2 hours, I spoke to her again and she wanted to charge me $881.00 for a problem on the vehicle that Boerne had worked on just a year ago!!!  I then spoke to Joe, Service Mgr., who didn't seem to care about my concern and stated he would reduce the price by $200 after I kept asking for some relief.  He didn't even give me his card!!  Nor did the female service advisor!!  Well I left here with NOT a good feeling.  I just did not trust these people!!  A week later, I took the vehicle to Cavendar Toyota and they said there were no parts to be replaced at all!!  What a ripoff that Boerne was trying to get out of me!!!!!!!!

343,"May 27, 2015","I went into the dealership with my sister to do some advanced shopping for a used car.  My father sent us to look at cars and he planned to make the purchase when we found something that I liked.  

My experience was absolutely horrible, largely due to interaction with my ""salesman"" Matt Flom.  Never before have I met such a condescending, sexist, elitist and unprofessional salesperson.  Not only did he fail to listen to me, but he also insulted my sister in the process.  To add insult to injury, he played the classic ""T.O."" game with us, as he went to get his manager (who badgered us further) and to get a card (which ultimately was in his pocket the whole time - really didn't need to go into the showroom).

I will be getting a car within the next week.  More than likely it will be a Toyota.  It will not, however, be purchased at this dealership, or any dealership associated with this owner.  If this is the caliber of personnel that they hire, it is a sad testament, in my opinion, of the quality of the business.  Not an institution that I, nor my father, would pay to do business with.

Competition in the marketplace is far too keen to miss out on opportunities for a sale and a potential repeat customer.  At 22 years old, I could have been a repeat customer for decades to come.  The good news is that I will be . . . for another dealership - one that knows how to treat people.  So no repeat business and no referrals for Toyota of Boerne.  Management should be sure to recognize Mr. Flom for being such an insensitive schmuck and driving what was destined to be an easy sale right out of the door.  Bravo, Mr. Flom.  Bravo.",1.0

Completely ticked off with their service and game playing!! ",1.6
345,"March 16, 2015","This review is my opinion.  My honest review is written with no malicious intent.  Just to inform other consumers of my experience. 

I first went to your dealership on January 13th to look at a used Buick Lucerne after seeing it on Cargurus.com.  Bob Conine responded to my request for information.  Set up a test drive on the 13th with Bob.  He had told me on the phone the car had a navigation system, which it did not.  It was not a big deal to me.  I know he can not know the details about every car on the lot.  But after telling him that there was cigarette burns on the floor, he told me it was a non-smoker car.  I left after a little pressure from him and Mark to buy right then.  I told them I wanted to look at a couple of other cars before making a choice.  Out of respect, I told him I would let him know what I found out.  I emailed him and told him I was able to get a similar car, a year older for $2000 less in Seguin.  He calls me back a couple of hours later saying the dealership was lying.  They didn't even run my credit, which I found odd.  When I emailed him, I was holding in my hand the bank information.  Then I asked him, how he knew that.  He said he ran my credit again to check.  I don't know if that is even legal or common practice in your industry.  But it was shocking to me that he could and would do that.

My wife did not like the color of the one I had found in Seguin, so I decided I would go up to your dealership to get the Lucerne on your lot, but by pass Mr. Conine and try to get the price somewhere close to the other Lucerne.  I approached Jonathan Castillo to try to get things moving.  We test drove it again.  On the second test drive, I noticed a popping in the engine compartment on acceleration.  He had the used car service department look at it and said nothing could be found.  I had told him the price I wanted to pay was $9200 because of the front end damage and cigarette burns. That was also what my bank said they would give for it.  Being on disability, I couldn't afford more.  

Enter Brian Price. Finance Manager. He came and said that my bank required extra information and wouldn't go through for some reason. I think he said because I was on disability.  But he had found a better rate and deal.  This is after my bank approved my loan and told me to go shopping. He told me the price of the car would be $9500 and the bank required that I bought a $1400 warranty.  Putting the total price at $10500. There was also a price showing on the contract $11900. Brian told me that was from taxes and title etc.  So I was fine with that.

A week and a half later I had to call Brian to get the lender information as he had only given me the warranty information.  I called the lender to verify what Brian had said about the warranty.  The guy with the lender laughed at me and said ""buyer beware"".  It wasn't true.  Obviously I was upset about Brian lying to me.  Then going over the contract further, noticed he lied about the total sale price as well.  Then the same day, I receive a call from my bank checking to see if everything was going well with car shopping.  I told them what Brian had said.  They said Brian lied about that too.  I really don't know how that isn't illegal for him to do that.  It is no different than stealing from someone. Theft by deception.   

So I call Fry the Finance Director to try to get to the bottom of the situation. After calling Fry five times in three days, I decided to drive out to Boerne again since Fry didn't seem to want to answer any voicemail,  He actually did return my calls as I was heading out there.  I sat with him and told him the situation.  We cancelled the warranty  Brian lied about.  He also claimed he would ""talk"" to Brian about the situation.  At this point I really don't believe he did.  Feeling like this is probably common with dealerships to try to lie and steal from customers.  Realizing car salesmen have a bad reputation for a reason.  Also realizing finance guys are liars too.  It is 100% my fault for not making sure I understood the contract, instead of trusting what Brian said.  I do find it odd, your cameras do not pick up sound.  Maybe, because there would be recorded proof of lying.

While out there, Carolyn did opt to have the popping situation fixed.  Which was a motor mount.  I had told Jonathan I wouldn't buy the car until it was fixed.  But was misled on that too.  I later found out from David, they never fully checked it for my concern.  They just checked for safety issues.  Had it been diagnosed or known I was paying $10500 plus a $1400 garbage warranty, I would have never signed the contract.  Especially when I could've purchased the same car $2000 cheaper in Seguin. But that just may be how the car sales industry operates.  Zero integrity. Smoke and Mirrors.

Trying to get this whole thing resolved, I went out to speak the GM (owners son) and was deflected. I was introduced to Chris Franklin (owners son-in law).  He has to be one of the most smug, arrogant, condescending people I have met.  Couldn't hardly stand a five minute conversation with him.  He did tell me I could trade in or sell the car back to your dealership at around $8000.  Why should I have to lose $2500 because Brian lied?  I didn't do anything wrong except trust Brian.  I know in your industry these sort of tactics are commended in the name of profit.  But every trip out is more informative of the amount of integrity located in their facility.  Zero. 

I was lied to several times by Brian and Bob in this transaction.  I have given your dealership several chances to correct the wrong, only to be approached with arrogance, zero integrity, zero accountability.  When confronted with the news they would receive a bad review, I was offered $500 to sign a hold harmless agreement.  When I refused, Shawn Vaughan, the owners son, had their lawyer threaten to sue me if I wrote a bad review.  Honestly, and integrity are worth far more.  I couldn't stand myself not warning other consumers about my experience with your dealership. I really couldn't believe in the great state of Texas, I could be sued for speaking the truth.   

I realized on this transaction, family owned business doesn't mean they will treat you like family.  GM is the owners son.  General Sales Manager I think is the son-in-law(Chris Franklin).  This family owned business seems to be operated on nepotism, affluenza, arrogance, lies, and greed.  I guess not much different than other dealerships. Your customer service responses seem copied and pasted.  Your ""good"" reviews are seemingly fabricated and disingenuous.  Any other consumer, proceed with caution.  It's your choice on where you shop.",1.0

Salesman was courteous but had a difficult time pricing out the vehicle due to management interfering with ridiculous bait and switch back and forth pricing.

359,"December 30, 2014","Here is a letter I sent to the owner. It speaks for itself. I would like to take a moment to thank you and your staff at Toyota of Boerne for working with Holly and I today. If you remember, we had a brief conversation in Chris’ office where you also introduced us to one of your sons. Holly and I recently moved to Bandera from Houston. I have owned Toyota’s for a long time and dealt with many dealerships over the years. The process of purchasing a new 1794 Tundra at your dealership was actually pleasurable. Why? It seemed: 1. Everyone (including Chris Franklin and Dani in finance whose email addresses I do not have so please forward this to them) were exceptionally genuine 2. Everyone seemed interested in customer service and not just selling us a car 3. The dealership is clean and orderly with a touch of class in the lots, sales floor, offices/cubicles, service department and bathrooms 4. Everyone had/has excellent interpersonal skills - which you cannot teach a person. They seem to have these skills by nature. After completing all the paper work Holly and I were headed out the door around 6:00 PM to go home. Holly went to drive the new Tundra and headed to my car. To my surprise, I had a flat tire on my old Camry! “No problem” said Mike Wells. ""Let me see what we can do about that"". Gene Kirts, in Service, and his staff came to the rescue and had the flat fixed in record time. Thanks, Gene. Much appreciated. Again, thank you and we look forward to using and recommending your dealership for many years into the future. ",5.0
360,"December 24, 2014","I am a Toyota convert now. I was not a fan, until I came to this dealership. The customer service and after care are stellar. I bought my 2014 4-runner and my salesman made sure I had the exact car to meet my needs. They were respectful of my financial situation, and made sure I had a payment and price that stayed within my budget. My service rep, Tina Webb, contacts me regularly when I need service, and they are prepared when I arrive, whether it is just for an hour, or if I need a rental. I never thought I would be a Toyota fan, but now I tell everybody that this is the only place to buy a car. ",5.0

367,"November 25, 2014","I had a great experience with the sales man negotiating the price for a new 4x4 Tacoma double cab but was promised that the rims and tires could be changes out for a more appropriate size tire for a 4x4.  The vehicle I wanted to purchase had inappropriate tires and rims for off road use.  The communication between the salesman and the service department was a complete disaster.  I had to go down personally after several days to attempt to straighten out the service department as to what was needed to be done.  They gave me a great trade-in price on the existing rims and tires on the vehicle I purchased.  However, they failed to understand that the spare needed to be replaced to match the new tires and rims.  This required another lengthy conversation between the customer service rep and myself.  It's been almost a week since I purchased the vehicle and they had not completed the work on the tires and rims.  I have owned 2 other Tacoma's and my past experience with the service department has been great.  I'm not sure why I'm having this problem.  For some reason the factory is sending out 4x4 Tacoma's with out the appropriate rims and tires for off road use.  Thy just received another one on the lot after I purchased mine.  I do not suggest buying one of these vehicle if you intend use your vehicle off road.  The truck rides lower and the side walls of the tires are easily punctured.  I only bought this one because my wife wanted this particular color to match our Motorhome.",3.6

369,"April 14, 2014","I saw a Chrysler Aspen on the Toyotaofboerne website. It was real nice. It was a little high on the miles but I was willing to take a look at it. I made contact via email with one of the sales persons there, A mike. I told him that I would like to drive down there to take a look at this Chryser Aspen but that I wanted to apply for credit first. I wanted to make sure I was approved before heading down there since I had to miss a day of work and rent a car. I explained that my main vehicle, my motor went out on it and I had spent a lot of money trying to fix it and that I also had an older truck that needed too much repair. I mentioned to him that I didn't have a lot of money for a down payment. I told him exactly how much I had available for a down payment. He suggested I fill out the application online so he could look at numbers and see where I was at. He was going to run my credit app and he was going to get back to me. I contacted him the following day to see what he found out. He said he would be able to help me out. I told him again that I didn't want to travel down to Boerne unless I knew for sure I was going to be able to get into this vehicle or something like it. But I wanted to look at this one first. That this is the only reason I would drive down there. He assured me that he was going to be able to help me. That he had several different options for me. So I told him that if he was sure I would drive down there. So I took the day off, rented a car, and drove down to Boerne. When I got there I went to the front desk and spoke to one of the receptionist and told her that I was there to meet a Mike. A few minutes later she told me that he was was another customer and would be out there shortly. So, I walked outside and waited for him. About 5 minutes later, a different sales person came out. He just stood there by the door and kept glancing at me. So I walked over to him and I asked him if Mike was almost out. He said yes. He introduced himself. Then he said that he was told to show me a some vehicles. I'm like ok then. As we walked away, Mike comes out and walks over to me. He introduced himself and said that he was going to be part of the process but that he had a customer he needed to finish up with. He then left. So  my wife and I and the other salesman walked to the used cars side. He had us follow him around. He really didn't seem to know what he was looking for. I asked him about the aspen and he said he didn't know where it was at. I looked around and I spotted the aspen. I walked over there to it. He walked behind him. It was real nice. I got excited when I saw it. I asked him about it and he said that that vehicle had too many miles and that the bank was not going to work with it. I'm like what. This was the only reason I came down to Boerne, I told him. He proceeded to show me a different vehicle. He showed me a Kia suv. It was actually really nice. My wife was ok with it so I decided to go ahead and take a look at it. The sales guy ran off to get the keys. While he left I walked around the Kia. I got underneath the vehicle and there was a huge puddle of transmission fluid. The underneath where the transmission sat was all covered in transmission fluid and thick gunk. The guy comes back and he wanted me to take a look at the inside of the kia. I told him that I wasn't going to bother since the think was leaking fluids. I asked him to look if he wanted to but he said that he had hurt his knee. So, I got under there again and show him the fluid all over the palm of my hands that came off the undercarriage. He then ask if I wanted to look at this tahoe setting across the parking lot from us. He explained that the tahoe was way over our price range but he would see what he could do. So I said to him, my wife and I took a day off and got a rental and drove all the way over Boerne and all you showed me was a Kia that had transmission issues and a Tahoe that was way out of my price range but not the car I had made arrangements with Mike to see; infact, I didn't even speak to Mike, the sales guy who I had been emailing and speaking to on the phone. I feel that this dealership just strung me along. Never got to have a set down with Mike, the original salesperson I had been speaking to and never got to see the vehicle we had planned on working with. I did call Mike. He did apologize. He said that he was going to speak to his manager and would call me right back to see if there was something he could do. I hung around for a while but never heard from him. From there I drove down I10 to san antonio to see if I could find something. I was just driving in circles. We got home tired that day and stressed out, no car, work day lost, money spent on gas and rental.

370,"January 26, 2014","Went to Toyota of Boerne about a month ago to look at Tundra's. Was told repeatedly by phone before arriving that we 
would meet with Spencer, a salesman I had conversed with on the WEB before. As soon as we entered the place we were immediately passed off to Tim, a ""Tundra Expert"". I mentioned a particular vehicle to Tim that we had seen on the 
WEB. He got on his computer and told us it had been sold. He then searched for another in the same price range. He 
found one that was $219 more than the 1st. Tim continually got up and went somewhere for what seemed like a long 
time. We were then told that we'd need to pay $400 for a shipping fee because the truck was in Austin. We said no. 
He said OK. I found it odd there was no resistance. We eventually agreed to a price. The truck would be acquired by 
doing what he called a dealer trade. Toyota of Boerne would need to find it and bring it to their lot. We were asked 
for a deposit. Check book was at home, so we left to go get it. On the way out to our car, we're flagged down and 
told we do not need to pay the deposit? Fine with me, but like our refusal to pay a $400 shipping fee without 
incident, why did they just suddenly no longer require a deposit?  

Home we go. I was curious about the truck he had found for $219 more. You can locate any available Toyota vehicle in 
a region on the WEB, so I searched for this truck and found it. There was only one in the SA, Boerne, San Marcos; 
Austin area(Region) for the MSRP of the truck we had been told about at Toyota of Boerne. The truck was 20 mi. away 
on a Red McCombs lot; not in Austin! In our original negotiation, we agreed to pay $199 for dealer tinting once the 
truck arrived at Toyota of Boerne. On the WEB I could see this McCombs truck already had a dealer-provided 3M tint 
job! This info was right in front of Tim on his screen when he found this truck!  

So had we agreed to a shipping fee earlier, we would have paid $400 for delivery of a truck 20 mi. away and $199 for 
tint that had already been applied. I confronted them about this over the WEB and was given the usual dealer 
malarkey that $400 and $199 would have been subtracted from the price once the truck arrived. Would anyone who's 
ever done business with any car dealership believe this? They were trying to pick up a quick $600. Tue I got an 
email from Tim stating that the McCombs truck had been sold and that the person responsible for dealer trades would 
have a guaranteed answer on a truck by the close of business Wed. Wed. came and went along with Thur., Fri., etc. 

Been about a month now and no reply back from Toyota of Boerne. In my opinion, I was told the truck had been sold 
because Toyota of Boerne wanted to walk on the deal. The $600 fleece they tried to impose wasn't going to happen. 
They were losing money on the deal. This situation is similar in some respects to one listed above or below my post. 
Someone had been waiting many wks. for a vehicle that was supposedly in Houston.  

So if you decide to visit Toyota of Boerne......beware!",2.5
371,"January 18, 2013","We were told the car we ordered was being prepped in Houston and would be available later in the month. We have waited 7 weeks now and the car is still not here. We keep getting the runaround. Obviously, they lied to us about the status of the car in the first place. They are going back 40+ years in terms of how a car dealer treats their customers. Lie and cheat!",2.2
372,"September 03, 2012","I tried shopping at a different dealer every night after work for the last week and had little success. By Saturday morning I was very frustrated in my search, and tired of feeling like profit waiting to happen. I found a used SUV listed online at Toyota of Boerne and called to see if it was still available. I had a GREAT salesman who offered to walk out to the vehicle to make absolute certain it was still there. When he said it was, I let him know I was about an hour drive away and that I would really appreciate if there was any way he could get me a quote on my trade in value before driving out to the dealership (knowing it was just a quote and that they would still need to see my vehicle in person before giving me an exact value). I sent him a text with the VIN and some pictures of my trade, and within about 10 minutes I had a phone call back with a quote I felt was fair. So, I got in the car and drove the hour long drive to see the used SUV they had listed for sale. My salesman, Sam, was professional and courteous. After I test drove the SUV, I asked him to take a look at my trade to see if it was going to be worth the quote I had received on the phone. I was pleased to find out that it was! I decided to make the deal and purchase their vehicle with the trade of mine. They offered me additional products such as mechanical warranty, tire warranty, car washes, and pre-paid maintenance, but never once pressured me into purchasing any of them or make me feel like an idiot for not buying them. From the time I walked in their door to the time I was driving home in my new (but pre-owned) vehicle, I spent a little less than 2 hours. GREAT timing! The other dealers I had tried working with earlier in the week had me there nearly that long and we hadn't even come to an agreed price, let alone try to start any paperwork. All in all, my car buying experience at Toyota of Boerne was a pleasure. I will definitely recommend friends, family, and anyone who wants to listen, to see what a difference it is shopping at Toyota of Boerne. Thank you for making me feel valued!",5.0
373,"May 08, 2012","My story begins with a relative of mine recommending I go to this dealership to purchase a new vehicle stating, “I told them your situation and they seem to genuinely want to help you.”  Out of my entire family, we had purchased approximately five vehicles at this establishment total over the past few years.  My own story with Toyota of Boerne is a little different.  I showed up about 10 am and walked straight up to the salesman whom I was recommended to see.  He was a well-dressed gentleman of foreign descent.  I told him who I was and he began to walk me out to the lot to look at vehicles.  On the way, I told him I was in the process of repairing my credit and that it may be difficult to get me into a vehicle and asked about pre-approval.  After all, I didn’t want to waste the gentleman’s time.  He said he could first get me pre-approved to see what the bank would be willing to lend me and then that would give us a better idea of what vehicle I could hope to get into that day.  He had me fill out a credit application and then walked off with it.  After about a half hour, he walks up with another gentleman and introduces me.  He basically pawned for off on a new guy after realizing just how low my credit score was.  We’ll call this new gentleman Newbie, since he was obviously not well-experienced in the job.  At this point, I’m still waiting for the pre-approval amount, but the well-dressed salesman had other more prosperous rows to sow, and I never saw him again.  I apprised Newbie of the situation with the other salesman, but for some reason he seemed to want to show me cars instead of follow up on the pre-approval efforts.  So, I blindly I chose a vehicle I knew I could afford.  Unfortunately, the bank didn’t feel the same way, as is usually the case with me.  During the course of trying to get approved for this vehicle, my keys were taken to do an appraisal on my trade.  I sat at Newbie’s desk.  I walked around.  I looked at every square inch of that facility just out of sheer boredom.  Did you know they have a giftshop....I was like...really?!  Because I know that's what I think of when I buy a car, a souvenier to remember my wasted day by-hahaha.  After about an hour, enter a new player in this comedy of fools.  We’ll call this one Slick.  He was a fast-talking salesman who introduced himself as some sort of manager.  HE DECIDED THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION WOULD BE TO GET ME PRE-APPROVED WITH THE BANK.  Damn, what a concept…wish I’d thought of it…hahaha!!!  So, we started the pre-approval process AGAIN!  At this point, I’m rather agitated and my keys have been missing for at least a couple of hours.  I finally asked for my keys back.  When I did, Newbie walked over to the finance office and then came back with news that it would only be a few more minutes.  No keys!  That little pattern repeated itself three times before I finally got up to march into the finance office myself to get my damn keys!  I was cut off at the pass before I could get to the door of the finance office by Newbie telling me it’d be just a few more minutes.  NOPE!  I was done at this point.  I asked for my keys back.  He said it’d be just a few more minutes.  I said, “Well, hey, how about you get me my keys back and that way we can get that part out of the way for when we get an answer from the bank.”  He begrudgingly got my keys for me.  With keys in hand, I was ready to blow that place, but Newbie blocked the door while Slick came out of the finance office to tell me some more lies.  I finally told them I had an appointment and needed to leave, which I actually did.  I had an appointment with another car dealer to test drive a Mazda3.  I told Newbie and Slick that when the news comes in from the bank to please give me a call and I’ll stop back by on my way home to see what cars they have in my pre-determined price range.  I never got a call!  Then, to add insult to injury, a few days later the well-dressed foreign gentleman sends my relative an e-mail basically stating I had wasted their time looking at the vehicle I did with too low a credit score to purchase it.  Now…being the turn-the-other-cheek kind of person I am, I was just going to let it go and forget about it, but after the snotty email my relative received, I feel the need to warn others of this place.  So, consider yourself warned.  If you want to waste an entire day running around in circles, by all means, go shop for a car at Toyota of Boerne.  If you want to actually get somewhere, go somewhere else. At this point, I, nor the rest of my family, will EVER step foot in that place again.  It is a three-ring circus at best.",1.3
