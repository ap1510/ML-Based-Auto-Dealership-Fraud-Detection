Although we didn't purchase due to other circumstances, they were very easy and accommodating to work with.  They even had a vehicle brought to us to look at from one of their other facilities!  No pressure sure made it an enjoyable atmosphere to shop for a potential ""new"" vehicle.  WE WILL BE BACK!",5.0

12,"August 21, 2018",came in at 8:00 am for and oil change. I was told one hour. after 2 hrs. I went to the service writer. she was on her phone texting. I waited for 15 min standing in front of her. after she finished her texting. she just went on with her work. then a personal phone call. I had to interrupt her to ask when my truck would be ready. she said I forgot to put customer waiting it will be going in soon. not and apology or anything. they made me feel like they were the customer. while waiting an extra hour I decided to look at a new truck. the salesman was just as rude. I went to another dealer and bought a new truck from them.,1.0
13,"July 17, 2018","I didn't think I would qualify for anything there, but with the help of James devalle. I was matched up with the right truck for the right price. He didn't let me go home empty handed and broken hearted. He went through his inventory and found me a truck with my credit and I drove  away happy. ",5.0
14,"May 10, 2018",Salesman was good at first. After the sale everything went down hill fast. Service department is the worst!! No communication between people what so ever. ,1.6
15,"April 27, 2018","This company is the worst.  

In December, I needed a new battery, so go into the dealership to have it replaced.  They convince me to buy a ""Lifetime Warranty"" battery (which I get to pay about $40.00 more for the battery than the normal one, PLUS a $15 Administration Fee).  Less than 2 months later, the battery is dead.  I drove the vehicle less than 20 miles (19,140 when I left, it is at 19,152.  I call to claim my LIFETIME warranty, and am told that I have to pay a $180 ""Diagnostic Fee"" to have them verify that the battery is bad.  I ask if that is refunded if the battery IS bad, since I paid for the LIFETIME warranty, and am told No.  That fee stays.  

These are the snake oil salesmen of our day, folks.  

AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE.  These are scam artists and crooks.  Do not trust anything they tell you they lie about everything.  ",1.0
16,"April 22, 2018","This is after several interactions with AutoNation on this transaction...

I had an ok expereince with the Sales staff.  Mr Chatman was great.  The finance people were typical upsale """"car salesmen""... aka sleeze.  Then 2 week after I buy the car for my daughter I get a txt message that I need to return the car due to some bs need of a SSN for my daughter.  First, outside the credit check there is no need for an SSN, and second they had the number.  The person, Will Clunn, was a complete jerk on the phone.  I will pay for this car on the 1st bill just to be rid of these troglodites. 

So the auto responder that replies to negative reviews responded.  I called the number the ""GM"" askjed to call, and went to voice mail.  I have left 3 voice mails over the course of the last 21 days and have recieved NO CALL BACK.  

This place is a joke.  Shop here at your own risk.",1.6
17,"March 31, 2018","Just recently scheduled an appointment for Friday, I arrived early to my appointment, and was notified that I did not have an appointment that day.  Apparently when I made the appointment the woman on the phone made the appointment for Saturday.  I took me over one hour to drive to the dealer.  When I made the appointment she also told me that it would take about one hour and I could wait.  So when I arrived for the Actual scheduled appointment on Friday, I was told I did not have an appointment, and that I would have to wait over one hour just to find out how long I would have to wait, and that it was possible it would take all day.  just for a recall replacement switch, which they had on hand. So i asked what they could do fro me and their response was “nothing but wait”.  they did not even offer me a rental car or anything.  They did nothing to remedy the situation, I basically was just out of luck.  
will never use this dealer again.",1.0
18,"January 03, 2018", Service after sell is horrible. Both services I've had there took forever and both times the service was done improperly. Fixed myself the first time but decided to take it back the second time. Had issues with a piece of trim since I bought the truck. Purchased the truck new with platinum extended warranty but they won't warranty it. Spoke with service manager both times and the service is definitely a reflection of him. I've been contacted after voicing my displeasure in a survey about my first visit. Was assured I would be contacted by management but I wasn't. ,1.8
19,"November 06, 2017",I have never been to a dealer where the salesman have been liars and cheats I dealt with 4 different salesman here and none of them could give me 100% of their att. I was being juggled around made me wait hours to make the purchase and treated me lousy. And there sales managers where very unprofessional will never go back to deal with anybody at the spring location.

21,"October 20, 2017","Received ""URGENT AIRBAG RECALL"" from US Depot Transportation for my Dodge Sprinter.  Called 800 number, they connected with this dealer and confirmed THEY HAVE PARTS.

Made appointment week ago, got 2 confirming emails. Traveled over 25 miles each way with my wife following me as they advised repair of recall would take all day. Left vehicle.

Called to check status after 7 hours and Service Advisor, Daisy, said ""sorry"" they did not have parts for driver's side.  Asked to talk with Service Manager. She said they did not have parts and could not locate them in Houston.  

Called James Hagen, General Manager, and left word.  No Call Back.

I am a 78 year old senior.  About to pick up uncompleted repair vehicle. Total 100 miles traveled due to with ""URGENT, LIFE THREATENING RECALL"" without repair.

I will report to NHTSA US Dept of Transportation.  

They never should have accepted reservation for service without verifying they have parts in stock and misrepresented they did to the US government and to me.

Traveling over 500 miles next week.  If, God Forbid, there is a crash and I am injured or killed by defective airbag, my estate will be holding them liable.

I advised them of this and they lied and said they did then said that factory oil filters have ""factory installed"" stamped on them. This also is a lie.

24,"July 18, 2017","First I have documented proof! This dealer nearly caused my death and possibly death or injury to others by a proven faulty warranty repair issue that cost me my truck, injured me permanently and caused the loss of my business. It has cost my family greatly and with that said I have documented proof by forensic investigators furnished by Chrysler that this dealer did in fact commit a criminal act and did in fact ruin my income source as well as nearly costing me my life and then left me injured for life while simply dropping me in the grease. AGAIN ALL THIS HAS BEEN PROVEN AND THIS SPRING CHRYSLER AUTONATION DEALER has proven they do not care, it is simply about money no matter what they have to do and will destroy you if necessary for the dollar. I wish I could upload the proof but the fact is please,please stay away from these people!!!!! CRIMINAL DEALER in our book that to this day has told us to get screwed! With all the choices do you really want to risk dealing with these crooks?",1.0
25,"June 14, 2017","Parts department sells me one ignition key transmitter for $375 and then turns me over to Service department to get it programmed.  When I go to Service however, I'm told they can't program the key today.  I'm told to drive my car to a Mercedes dealership which has the equipment to do the programming.  They try but can only make one key work at a time.  This Mercedes service department decides to stop trying to get both keys working and sends me back with my old key transmitter de-activated.  When I show up back at Spring Chrysler all I hear is how the parts department can't help me because their new key transmitter is working.  I'm told that the service department is in meetings and that I should go home and be called later.  My voice mails and emails are ignored for days.  The manager eventually does call but doesn't consider it his problem since his service department wasn't involved!    A few more returned calls later eventually explain how it's actually my car's problem and I should get it fixed and start over with a set of new keys!  ",1.8
26,"April 08, 2017","This is the third car purchased at the Autonation dealership in my family in the last 3 months. Toby, the car dealership employee was helpful in obtaining the cars. I and the other members of my family were very pleased with the service provided by our car salesman, he always kept us up to date as we waited for paperwork as to what was going on with every step. I would definitely recommend him to any of my family and friends that were in the market for a new or used car. The whole process from walking in until driving out with my car was the best experience I have had in buying a car. I also would like to say how many times many employees there asked if I was being helped or if I needed anything. The finance personal for my car as well as my daughter's car were extremely pleasant and efficient with the paperwork, which we all know can be tedious at times, was done quickly and with a smile.",5.0

30,"January 28, 2017",I will not recommend anyone.  I had a very bad experience.  The manager frankie freeze was basically calling me a liar.  The reason is because the past two times i been there they have left my oil filter loose and my truck has been leaking oil and i brought it up to their attention twice and they denied it.  I personally got under my truck and saw the oil leak and my driveway is all stained from it.  Bad service and asshole manager.  ,1.0

33,"December 03, 2016","“Buyer be Aware”, “Bait and Switch”, “Scam”, “Fraudulent Behavior”…  …not sure what to call my experience?
Stopped by this dealer when I saw a vehicle on their lot I liked.  After the normal “negotiations”, we agreed on a dollar amount down and monthly payments.  Minutes before signing the paperwork, I was told “sorry we made a mistake and the vehicle you want will run X amount more per month?!?!  Although the amount was only $30+/- more, it became a principal issue as this is not what I had been told.  Their logic was “The quote was for a 2017 and the one we have is a 2016”!  “We can get you a 2017 for the deal we agreed on”…at the time I said NO and left.  A few days later the salesmen contacted me and I said, locate a 2017 and I’ll take the deal we originally discussed (msrp +/- $42,800). He said, ok let me find one.  He found one but it was $1,000 more (msrp $43,865) and he said the payment would be another $27 p/month…so, $528!  I replied to his text “I’ll take it”!  An hour later I get a reply and NOW the payment is $568???  I obviously declined!  Hence the first line of this paragraph, what do you call this??
To put this in perspective, yesterday I bought a vehicle…a 2017, same brand, make and color.  The msrp was $44,205 and the payment finalized at $514!

I p[an on following this up with a letter to the Texas Attorney Generals and then I will file a formal complaint with the BBB. A whole lot of lying stealing and passing the buck, mine. I waited a month spent almost $700 dollars, was assured the vehicle was AOK drove it less than 12 hours and right back to the shop I went. They then claim what really needs to be repaired is not covered under my Lifetime Power and Drive Train Warranty. They neglected to mention any of that when they were taking my $. I can tell by looking at the names below that the turn over must be huge and the majority of the ones that manage to stay opt to have their picture associated with ones complaint.",1.0

My husband and I both work and we have a son so not having a vehicle was NOT an option. Fortunately, Jorge was our saving grace. Not only was he able to get me in my dream vehicle, he was able to do it FAST. We walked in and walked out with Jeep in a matter of hours. He took care of us and even came in on his day off to help us out! We're highly considering coming back to get a second vehicle from Jorge for my husband (if I can convince him to also get a Jeep!).

46,"September 10, 2015","This review is more about after the sale. My purchasing experience was one of the best I’ve had. My salesman was great he addressed all my issues and helped me in every way possible. He even made sure I got the floor mats and trailer hitch off my trade in, as they were recently purchased. The follow up to the sale is the issue. I really enjoy my new Dodge truck, but there are some things that need to be fixed under warranty. Every time I call to set up an appointment to get these items fixed all I get is the phone shuffle or they are out 4 to 6 weeks. They are kind enough to tell me I can drop it off and leave it, but then I am without transportation. The sad thing is I can call back in 20 minutes and schedule an oil change or tire rotation and balance, you know something they make money on, and they can get to me usually the next day. I’m sure if the items that needed to be fixed weren’t warranty items they would be happy to take care of me since they would be charging me. Where is the real customer service, what happened to standing behind what you sell. The salesman that was taking care of me is no longer there so I don’t even have someone to discuss this with and get any help. So now I have a brand new truck with an A/C that is acting up, a headliner that is falling out, an LED light that isn’t working, and a transmission that is shifting rough and slipping.  I guess my only saving grace is the 5 year bumper to bumper I paid extra for.",2.4
47,"August 22, 2015","I received a recall notice regarding my Driver Air Bag Inflator.  I made an appointment more that a week ago to have the defect repaired.  The notice stated the repair work would take up to 1 hour, or possibly more.  My appointment was scheduled for September 8, 2015 at 7:30 am.  Today, August 22, 2015 AutoNation called and cancelled my appointment (18 days from now) because they state they do not have the parts in stock and do not know when they'll get them.  I asked if they were going to notify me when the parts were received and they answer was ""no, you have to call back to see if we have the parts"".  Sorry , sorry service.  The vehicle I bought has always received terrible service and I quit buying from AutoNation, I've bought 3 new vehicles since then, 1 Ford and 2 Nissan's.  I suggest other people do the same.

49,"February 24, 2015","So, I bought a Used truck from this dealership. When I originally inspected the vehicle there was an issue with the door not unlocking to which I said before I buy this, I'd like that fixed.  They fixed it and 3 weeks after I had driven off the lot, I miss an entire day of work because I am locked out of this keyless entry truck, and the people at the dealership literally put me on hold, and forwarded me to this person and to that person for 2.5 hours.  I was hung up on 2 times and when I would call back, the forwarding and holding game would continue.  I was not amused and extremely disappointed with their customer service and just outright angry.  After a total of 4 hours they offered to tow my truck in and get it fixed free of charge but it would be a few days before they could get it fixed.  I ended up having to pay this tow truck service that they use $40 to unlock my door because he couldnt hook up to it unless he was certain the wheels were not locked.  He, said that was a seperate service and the dealership would not cover it.  So, that upset me further.  Once he unlocked it, I just drove up there since nothing was wrong with the trucks ability to drive, receipt in hand.  They refused to reimburse me for the $40.  I honestly am so infuriated and disgusted by their lack of professionalism that I am getting the truck fixed at another location...  I have been debating on filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau",1.4
50,"February 10, 2015","Doesn't care about the consumer after the sale.  I purchased a brand new 2015 Dodge Ram 1500 Laramie less than a month ago - during the sales cycle things went fairly well.

Fast forward to 3 weeks later (keep in mind the first payment has not been made on the new vehicle yet) - driving around the 8.4"" screen which controls the Radio, AC / Heat, Navigation, Bluetooth, and more went completely out.  I took the vehicle up on a Saturday to see what the issue was and had it verified that the radio was 100% dead.  I was promised a call back first thing on Monday when a radio could be ordered with an ETA.  By around noon on Monday nobody had called back so I left a message with the Service Advisor to return my call and waited again for 3 or more hours for a call back.  By 3 or so in the afternoon I called back and again asked to speak with someone and was told they would call me back.  By end of business I finally got my Service Advisor back on the phone who told me ""the radio has been ordered and will give you an update tomorrow"".  This is interesting as if it was already ordered why the need to wait another day for an update?  The next day by mid / late afternoon I received a call back saying that it would be up to 3 weeks for the replacement to come in and that they won't be able to take another radio out a car because of navigation - whatever that means.  

So here I am with a $46k sticker truck - that I'm expected to wait for longer than I have had the vehicle for working Radio, AC/Heat, Backup Cam, Navigation, Bluetooth, etc and little to no remorse from Autonation.  Its almost impossible to even get someone on the phone to talk about the situation much less give you a resolution that would make any customer satisfied.",1.8

54,"June 21, 2014","This is my second car I have brought first one being a VW and now a Ram for my husband. I never experienced conniving finance personal. If I knew what I would go through with them I would not have brought from this dealership. We purchased extra stuff for the veh. (Warranties) however when we finance with our credit union they offered the extras for less. So we returned to the dealership 3 times to cancel then. It wasn't until the 3rd time that finance finally told us they could not be canceled. We were NEVER told that and I have a strict rule of never buying from somewhere that won't take their product back. Honesty and forth coming is what the dealership should have been. However, they gained 500 dollars but loss thousands in referrals from me.

55,"April 27, 2014","Since 2001 when Rocky was the owner and it was Goodson Dodge my family and friends had purchased over 44 vehicles from this dealership and each experience was great from start to finish. In July 2013 I was in the market for a used Durango so went to Autonation Dodge since my friend is a sales guy there and has been since it was good ol Spring Dodge that everyone used to love so I was expecting the same service and respect I had been given for the past 12 years but I was very very wrong. Picking out the right vehicle was a pleasurable experience after looking at new Jeeps and Durango's I decided on a 2012 Durango RT on their used lot. The nightmare began when I tried to finance and I have great credit. I was told that they could only get me financed at 17.99% since it would be a second vehicle which was an outright lie but I trusted them so let them do the deal with the added pressure of just paying off in a year to make up for them xxxxxx me on the interest rate. I couldn't sleep for a week and had a hard time eating from all the stress and anguish I was put through just so they could screw me out of a few bucks. They put me through the wringer in every way possible and it wasn't needed to get the deal done, I think it was just out of pure meanness. I was asked for tons of paperwork and bank statements etc that I had never been asked for before when buying a vehicle, it was more painful that getting a half mil mortgage. I even voiced my concerns with the sales manager Bill Belk and the GM Tom Broadway but there was no accountability. I told both of them I was losing around 8k but they just fast talked me out the door then said they would see me again when I was buying my Laramie in few months. I own my own business and if someone felt one of my employees had done them wrong I would fix issue right away. If they had any integrity or business sense to keep a customer happy they would have at least made the deal right or ripped cash from their pocket to cover at least half the damages but these guys did neither....Keep in mind that I have generated millions of dollars for these guys over the years.

The next month I ended up going to Texan Dodge in Humble to buy my brand new Laramie and in December I took delivery of my brand new Durango RT also from Texan and traded in the nightmare Autonation sold me, using the exact same credit report they financed me on both vehicles for 2.9% 4 months apart. The Texan Dodge finance manager said he couldn't see how they came up with 17.99% and happily financed me at normal rates even though it was second vehicle in 4 months. No paper run around asking me for a million documents or any of that nonsense on either deal. Both deals with Texan I was in and out, Laramie took 2 hours because I bought off their lot so had to shop around for right truck but Durango was special order for me so was done deal in 20 minutes since I just had to go through finance. Autonation Dodge ended up costing me about 10K that I am just out once it was all done and Texan gave me every dollar they could on trade. I live 3 miles from Autonation but drive to Humble for all my Chrysler Dodge Ram Jeep needs. My family has purchased two jeeps
(Rubicon and Grand Cherokee), Ram 2500 Limited, Ram 1500 Laramie 4x4, Chrysler 300 and a Challenger SRT since August and we couldn't be happier to be away from this horrible dealership. They are just a cold heartless conglomerate now that doesn't care about building and maintaining long term relationships. They will squeeze you for every nickel then send you down the road miserable with a hatred towards your new vehicle. If you decide to waste your time and shop with them may god bless you because your gonna need it to deal with these heartless xxxxxxxx. ",1.2
56,"December 30, 2013","I live close to this dealership and have used them in the past when they were a 5 star independent dealer ( when they cared about customers) this time after an initial service quote I picked up my vehicle and when I tried to call back a week later for additional work I could not get anyone in the service dept to answer the phone. I tried for 2 days at various times, I finally drive there on my Saturday to schedule an appt. once I dropped my vehicle off my service rep was never available or even at work when I would call, finally they turned me over to another rep that actually was helpful and I finally got my car. While nothing tragic happened I expect more from a dealership especially with what they charge. I will not bring my vehicle back here",1.8

58,"November 22, 2013","My experience with this dealer is in trying to purchase a car, but I expect that the service can't be better than it's poor management.  I recently tried to purchase a car that I found on the Internet.  I called first, found the vehicle was still available.  As I live a couple of hours away, I was told that I had to put $500.00 down and fill out a credit application to hold the car.  I did this, and made arrangements to take off work to go to the dealer and finalize the deal the next day.  A number of hours later, I get an email that someone had come in and put $2000.00 down on the car so they sold it to someone else.  This isn't a good practice but sometimes mistakes happen.  Life goes on.  As it turns out, the car still showed up on the Internet.  I called and was told that the person that bought it to come in from out of town to finalize the deal and pick it up.  I got an email from the general manager, Tom Broadway saying that he would be happy to help me find a car.  I responded right away giving my phone number and asking for a response....  I guess Tom wasn't very interested in me because the response to my email never came, so I called and left voice-mail which also went unanswered. The next week the salesman called me saying the original deal on the car fell through.  Again I asked him if we could hold it to make arrangements to leave work and purchase the car.  He took a credit card number and assured me that the car would be there for me to look at.  Ten minutes later I get a call saying that this time management says they can't hold it.  Rule change?  Who knows!  No problem, I tell him that I'll just purchase the car and told him to put $2000.00 on my credit card and I'd get out of work and get the car.  Three hours later, they call me and again say that someone just bought the car that i had put a down-payment on.  I had put the same amount of money as the last customer did when they sold it to her. I was willing to pay the asking price, and there was no haggling on this car.  I purposely went to dealers and avoided private sellers and small car lots thinking that I would escape this unprofessional behaviour.  After spending all this time and countless emails and phone calls trying to make sure we did this right, it really made no difference.  At the end, I sent one more email to the General Manager, Tom Broadway explaining how horrible my experience was, not believing that this was how he or AutoNation expected their dealerships  to treat their customers.  Again. no response.  I could have gotten better customer service on ebay.  They obviously have no customer satisfaction culture and make or break rules at will.  If you go there and your experience is better than mine, consider yourself extremely lucky.  I would avoid them as there are plenty of other dealerships that really do value prospective customers.

63,"July 30, 2013","I have been shopping mainly by internet for a new 2013 Ram truck for the last month, when I came across AutoNation Spring and Hubert Steen.  Hubert was very in tune to the vehicle I was looking for, he did not try to up sell or sell me something I didn't want or need. He was honest and up front in the exchange of numbers and was very easy to work with. He worked extra hard to ensure I left with the vehicle I wanted at a fair price.  Hubert never once acted like I wasn't the only customer in the room. Through the entire process he kept me updated on the search of my 2013 Ram truck through email, text, or phone calls. I didn't have to keep hunting him down or calling him. He was always available to keep me updated and answer my questions.  If Hubert doesn't know the answer, he will find the answer and not give you the run around. I'd like to think of Hubert as a personal friend outside of business because he's dependable, straightforward, and fair.  

Will Clunn is by far the best finance manger that I have worked with in my 35 years of buying cars. He listened to me as I discussed some concerns and made suggestions without being pushy or putting undue pressure on my transaction. Will taught me that I could trust a finance representative and it was actually a pleasure working with him. In my past experiences with other dealers I can not remember having even a fair experience with the finance representative. There have been times the experience with the dealership was great but a poor closing left a bad experience to be remembered due to the finance representative. The overall experience at AutoNation Spring has left me very satisfied and I would highly recommend this dealership to friends, family, and work associates.

Hubert and Will went out of there way to make sure I was well taken care of and all my needs were met. Once again by far the best 100% new truck buying experience I have ever had. I will be doing all my new truck shopping here from now own. Great team at AutoNation Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram Spring!!!

65,"May 19, 2013","I received a call from a used car salesman at this dealership because of an online form I had filled out expressing interest in a GMC Yukon. The salesman set up an appointment for my wife and I to come look at the vehicle. We found a babysitter for our two kids in the middle of the day (not an easy task) and drove 30 minutes to the dealership at our scheduled time to find that not only was that salesperson not there, but no one could find the keys for the car we were scheduled to look at. The salesperson we did encounter was rude and uninterested, I tried to give him the parameters we were trying to work within, hoping that he could help us find what we were looking for. He acted like he could have cared less. Business must be BOOMING at your used car lot to treat customers this way when you work off of commission. We went two minutes down the road to Gillman (where we got incredible guest service) and drove home in an SUV that day, similar to the one that we were planning on purchasing from Spring Dodge. 

The service department and the new car side are great, awesome guest service every time I go in. We have had two experiences looking for used vehicles at various dealerships, and Spring Dodge has been BY FAR the worst both times. 

The next day I got a call from the salesman saying ""Hey, I heard you came in yesterday."" Yeah buddy, that's how appointments work. Thankfully we were able to purchase a vehicle from a dealership that cares about their customers. I will definitely recommend staying away from The Used car side of Spring Dodge to anyone I know looking for a used car.

67,"April 24, 2013","The dealership has changed ownership so this review may not apply to AutoNation.  My husband and I decided to purchase a car back in January. We did our research and Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram Spring (name before AutoNation) had a great deal on the Dodge Avengers.  I sent a list of the cars we wanted to see, with VIN# and Model ID, etc to the Frank Smario.  I even confirmed 1 hr before arriving that we were on our way.  In addition to providing a list of cars, I also gave him all the information he needed on my trade-in, including mileage, amount owed and two quotes for trade-in that I had received from other dealers.  I told him very specifically that I had been pre-approved for financing and was bascially coming in with a ""blank check"" from my bank - but that the loan could not exceed a certain percentage of the total value of the car.  This is to avoid too much negative equity.  I also made it clear that my husband and I were bringing our 3-1/2 year old son with us and spending hours in a dealership with toddler in tow does not scream good time.  This is why I thought all of the information I was giving up front would be so helpful!  When we got there, Frank was already with another customer, so he sent Storm to us. Storm was nice enough - but not prepared at all.  He had no idea what car we were there to see, so therefore he did not have any ready for us to look at or test drive.  I then gave him a list of cars that I had previously supplied to Frank.  So here begins the downfall.  The first 3 cars Storm tried to show us, did not work - I guess the battery died. Then another car we wanted to test drive, could not be found.  Finally we found a car - and thought this was the car we were financing.  I was very clear about the terms of my pre-approved financing from Capital One Auto.  It stated very clear that the value of the car could not contain any negative equity from my trade-in.  I thought we had a deal, worked everything out with Storm.  We arrived at 5pm, fully expecting to be in and out within a few hours.  After going around and around with Storm about financing and me reminding him every step of the way how the deal had to work, we finally had a deal!  However, this was not the case.  Storm had asked me if 'they' could beat my offer, would he allow me to let them try, so I said sure. Who is going to pass up better financing.  Well, I thought we had a deal with a particular car.  However, when I was brought into Billy Vincent's office, I immediately knew the numbers were wrong.  First of all, the car that I thought we had a deal on, was not the car that was presented to me for financing.  Also, I was presented with 'approval' from one of their banks at a 2% higher rate and the trade-in of my car would cause too much negative equity into my loan.  When I called Billy out on this, I guess Billy thought I was another ""dumb"" woman, because he stroked my arm, yes, he stroked my arm and said, ""don't worry, everything will be ok..just sign here.""  I said NO, and went on to explain to him how the terms worked and that he did not give me what I asked for. He then called Storm in and Storm tried to convince me, ""everything is going to be ok.""  I then said, ""if I sign this paperwork, my bank in a few weeks will reject the loan and then what will I do?""  Storm said, ""don't worry, if they reject it, we'll find another loan for you.""  I refused to sign the paperwork and started to walk out and told them we did not have a deal.  Storm asked me if I would consider coming back in the morning so they could try again and get me better financing. It was 9pm now..4 hours later and still no car!  Billy Vincent handed me the keys to the new car and suggested I go ahead and drive it home and they would work out a new deal.  Can you imagine - ""here, take this car, that you have not signed for."" - this is what he said!  Finally, another finance manager stepped in and confirmed exactly what I had been saying and I even got him to say out loud, ""she's right, you guys are wrong!""  The next morning the GM of the dealership called me and apologized and asked me for another chance.  Before we came back down, I was assured that financing was in place, we were approved and the car was ready.  When we got there, the car we were to purchase, had a very noticable ding on the driver side fender.  We were told, ""don't worry, we'll get that right out.""  Should have turned around there.  However, we perservered on.  We then worked with Tony Martinez who I would recommend to the world! Great guy, very honest - and we did end up with a better deal, better interest rate and payments where I wanted them.  This part - went right.  Now, back to the ding.  After we got home, we realized just how filthy the car was and it was never even washed (good point here, the silver billet actually holds dirt well - but not exactly the WOW experience when you buy a new car.  I washed it myself!).  We were given a ""We Owe you"" work order and were told the auto shop would call us when their ""ding"" guy was available - but they never called.  Fortunately my husband called the dealership after not hearing from anyone in 10 days.  It's a good thing we did too because the fine print said, ""if you do not come in within 30 days, we will not be held responsible...""  Needless to say, this was by far the WORST CAR BUYING experience ever.  After about 45-days, we decided to call because no one had called us to advise us our license plates were ready. Again, good thing we called because the receptionist said, ""well we called, but there was no answer"". When i got there, I saw on the envelope with our tags that showed they had only called once.  Imagine - only calling once.  Interestingly enough, we have voicemail with our phone and although they may have called and the VM did not come on, don't you think someone would have called again.  I can only  hope that AutoNation has turned things around.  I would not ever recommend the dealer again, and next time I will not be influenced by price!",2.0
68,"April 17, 2013","3 times in for the same problem. Doug seldom returns calls, he rarely answers phone, leaving a message is wasting you breath. I asked that all faulty parts be put in a box and returned with the car. I asked this of both Doug & Wayne and put the request in writing. I did not recieve the parts (I'm sorry). Makes me think they never replaced the rear evaparator core. I was told the car would be ready on Friday, I call several time and was finally told the car was apart and being worked on and wouldn't be ready until Monday. I stopped by the dealer Friday evening to get something from the car. If they were working on the rear evaparator core they hadn't moved or touched anything inside the car (except the steering wheel & ignition). I didn't look like anything had been touched on the car. The information sheet I asked Doug to get the technician to fill out (Doug said it would be no problem to get filled out) was burried underneath my papers on the front passenger seat. I put the form I wanted filled out under the windshied wiper so the tech would see it and fill it out. Do you think I got it NO (another ""I'm sorry"").
A coordinator (with Paul in his name and has worked there for years) tried to tell me that it was inexcusable that my calls were not returned. I tried to call him the next day and he did not return my call. ""I'm sorry"".
Comming to the dealership is an inconvience for me. I'm regret buying a warranty that requires me to use the a Dodge dealership. That's my mistake.
From the service I have recieved I am suspicious that parts were actually replaced but I was billed for them.

Having a dealership makes you rather bullet proof. People will still come to you no mather dismal your service is, they don't have much of a choice. It is a shame the way I was treated because, it's not necessary. The service advisors  get their orders from their boss's. Shame on them. 

On the other hand, I bought the car from a nice salesman who no longer works at the dealership.

This was addressed A.S.A.P. by their top notch extended warranty crew and now thanks to Spring CJD I will not be stranded on the side of the road when that goes out.

We have never dealt with a more friendly dealership or had someone honestly work to get us the best price avaliable without trying to convince us to buy something we didn't want or didn't need. The Colonel walked with us through all the 2500s and 3500s and helped us single out the one we really wanted. The next day, we worked with Mr. Vincent in financing. In the past, this was the one area we dreaded the most. He made it a wonderful experience. He was able to get us a much lower interest rate than we were pre-approved for. We ware pleased with the extended warranty and the lifetime warranty. 
We was also happy that the dealership was so pro-military. All the staff we met were veterans and we were happy that your company has decided to donate to military families at a time when so many deserving families have so little. As a veteran, I am proud to have served my country and am happy to help fellow military.

Thank you so much for making buying our new truck the happy occasion is should be. We have already told our friends and family about your dealership and staff and will be sure to send them your way when they get ready to purchase their next vehicle.

83,"November 27, 2012","We enjoyed our experience buying at Spring Chrysler.  We were helped by Duke Montross during our initial visit to look at minivans.  Duke was extremely helpful and took his time to make sure our questions were answered, but he never seemed pushy at all.  Neither my wife nor I like pushy sales people, and I'm happy to say that Duke never came across as such.  But he was very attentive and honest with us.

We returned a few weeks later ready to test drive and possibly buy.  We had 3 kids and 3 carseats with us, so it was not an easy undertaking to take us for a test drive.  Once again, Duke was able to find what we needed and answer our remaining questions about the Town & Country.  Once we started negotiating on the numbers, it was a fairly straightforward process.  We did not feel like we were getting a bad deal or suckered into anything we didn't want.  After we came to agreement on the bottom line, we waited to get the paper work completed and meet with the ""business"" folks to talk financing and complete the deal.

And that is the part where the overall experience dropped from a 5 to a 4.  We waited for over 2 hours during this last stage of the process.  Overall we had been there for 5 hours by the time we left (last customers out the door).  Apparently there were simply more deals closing than finance folks available, but it was not the best use of our time.  To his credit, Duke did warn us up front about some delays and wisely recommended that we grab dinner from somewhere nearby and come back.  We still waited over an hour after that.

Once we did get into the finance office with Will Clunn, we were pleased with his service.  He understood we had been waiting for a long time and gave us a break on the financing and warranty pricing as a result.  This helped restore our positive attitude about the transaction.

Overall the wait was a minor speed bump in an otherwise excellent experience.  I highly recommend Duke and will refer business to him and Spring Chrysler in the future.",4.6

Dear Duke,

I would like to take this time to thank you and Bill Belk  for the great experience we had buying the Hyundea Elantra from you.  Charlie was so impressed that Bill and you had 10 cars on your list for us to look at.  The 1st one was my favorite.  I loved the car.  I have never had good experiences with car dealers in the past. At 64 years old that must be saying something! You had all the paperwork ready and were eager to get the air conditioner serviced for it was not cooling (That is a must for me) .

Spring Chrysler have serviced my P T Cruiser in the past very efficient also. Kevin Lamphier has always been so professional and we feel he is our friend.

But Duke, I cannot get over the kindness and how easy everything went on this purchase. I want to thank you for this.  Everyone was so kind and friendly to us.  And I was really impressed to know the owners of the business are on the lot and we met them in person. It is unlike any dealership I have ever visited! I have never had a car delivered to my doorstep either!  I felt like Queen Mary for a day! It was so clean and shiny!

I enjoyed knowing you are a family man and enjoyed looking at your son's pictures too.

I am looking forward to having my new car serviced with Spring Chrysler Jeep Dodge.

And I will tell everyone I know about this dealership!


 Thank you again.  Mary and Charles Stewart

92,"November 01, 2012","Pretty easy dealership to work with.  Reece Broussard and Leroy Johnson were very nice and knowledgeable salesmen to work with, overall their performance was excellent.  I was not a fan of the little hidden charges and pushy finance guy.",4.6
93,"October 26, 2012",Very pleasant experience until finance. May want to try and make that better for customers. We did not want to purchase any extended products so the finance guy got rude and he also changed the finance rate. ,5.0
94,"October 26, 2012","So far this has been a nightmare because the day after I took the car home the check engine light came on.  I took it to the dealership closest to my home and it was a failed Cat converter.  I understand the mechanical defects of the car, but it was the service I received after that because the sales person didn't acknowledge the fact the car was certified and a free loaner car should be available.  It wasn't until he had to talk to a manager to find this out.  I'm upset and I probably won't ever buy a Dodge vehicle again much less go to Spring Dodge.",2.2
95,"October 24, 2012","I gotta hand it to this dealership. At first, I was dead set on buying a Hyundai Genesis; reading reviews and doing lots of research. The Genesis WAS my future car.

After reading a review of the ""best sedans of 2013"" on Kelly Blue Book. KBB put the Chrysler 300C at the #1 spot out of 65 other vehicles. I told my wife, ""Lets go test drive a 300. I'm not going to buy one but I should at least see what it's about."" So, I got online and asked for a sales rep via Spring Dodge's chat window.
Toby Driver was the person who answered my chat window and he answered my questions - if he didn't know, he went and got the answer. I set up an appointment and he met us with a smile and was very helpful in showing us a 300C.
I felt very relaxed with Toby. He's a very likeable guy and took his time to let us really learn this vehicle. He wasn't pushy, he wasn't what most people sterotype as a ""car salesman"" and he was just an all-around great person!
A day later, doing research on the 300C - I sent an inquiry back to Spring Dodge asking about the luxury edition and was met via e-mail/phone by Reece Broussard. 
Reece, just like Toby made me feel like I had a personal concierge helping me find the car that I wanted. He helped me get EXACTLY the car I was looking for through a dealer trade and within less than 2 days, I ended up owning a 300C Luxury Edition.
You guys are doing something right in the sales department. The whole experience from start to finish was CLASS A+++",5.0
96,"October 22, 2012","Reece was very helpful and informative. He did everything he possibly could to get me approved for the 2013 Dodge Avenger SE, but the bottom line is that I couldn't get financing through their banks.

102,"October 09, 2012","The reason I gave the score that I did is because the salesman I worked with, Eric Clark, was the worst salesman I've ever dealt with. I consulted with him about a certain vehicle numerous times over the phone and internet because i live 3 hrs away and didn't want to make that drive for no reason. Just by dealing with him initially I got a bad vibe like the &quot;you need me, I dont need you&quot; feeling. Just talking with him over the phone I felt as if he wasn't trying to make a sell, just there to make some kind of paycheck. I told him numerous times that I was in the market for a certain vehicle and only that vehicle. After my credit app he told me i was approved and all I had to do was bring my trade and agree on payments. I also asked if I could pay a deposit to hold the car and he told me no they didn't do that. Finally after the 3 hr trip, I met with Eric he still seemed like he was there because he had to be. He told me that the car I came for someone had put a deposit on it to hold it so it was no longer avalible[funny how he told me they didn't do that]. They had another car there that was the same model for $2000 more. While on our test drive he didn't explain one feature about the car. It was in fact the quietest test drive I had ever been on besides the time we spend arguing on the down payment that he say he told me to bring one amount which he didn't. When we got back from test drive he told me that I wasn't approved for that car, but I was approved for other vehicles that cost more and that I didn't want. I had explained to him over and over again before I even went there that if I traded my truck, it HAD to be for that certain  model car. I ended up telling him just forget everything and still he had a attitude, and when I was leaving instead of a handshake it was a slap on the hand and he walked off. I really wanted to give them my business because I had heard a lot of good about the dealership, but my experience was the worse. I even tried contacting the General Manager Al Heggs, but after a email and call with a voicemail msg left, I have still not heard anything back from him either. Even after my bad experience with Eric, I tried to give him the benefit of doubt and I actually gave his name and number to a potential customer but after it was all said and done I told them don't even worry about calling him. I had even told a relative but I've told her to  look elsewhere or with a different salesman. Everyone else in the dealership seemed really friendly though just don't work with Eric Clark if you want to be treated right.",2.0
103,"October 04, 2012","Why I went to Spring Chrysler Jeep is because of their people. Reece Broussard knows his products as well as the people that build them. There is no question about the vehicle that I asked that he couldn't answer. Reece takes his time to thoroughly explain and demonstrate each function of the vehicle. The reason why I've gone to Reece for 20 plus years and always recommend him to anyone looking for a vehicle can be said in two words, Trust and Integrity.

Why I recommend Will Clunn can also be said in the same two words. Will is also extremely knowledgeable in all aspects of financing, warranties, and all the other services he represents.

The reason why I purchased another Jeep is because over the last 23 years Jeep has proven they are the best built vehicle and most reliable vehicle on the market.

The reason why I will go to no other dealer than Spring Chrysler Jeep is because of three words and two people; Trust, Integrity, Value; Reece Broussard and Will Clunn -

Spring Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram,

In all sincerity, I would like to take a few moments to share with you my personal thoughts and feelings of how my wife and I were treated at Spring Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram concerning the purchase of our new 2012 Dodge Avenger.

I will be turning 50 years of age this week, and in all the years I have bought items, shopped around, etc., never have I been treated so courteous as my wife and I were treated by Lonnie Gipson.  He is a perfect gentleman, not pushy with his sales efforts in the least, and always eager to assist in every possible way.  Each time I have come into your dealership since making the car purchase, Lonnie has always somehow spotted me on the property and quickly came over to say hello.  In the first few weeks, I was a bit confused about how to use some of the newer style items on my new car....(re:  stereo, the fog lights, etc.).  With each question I called Lonnie, and each time he took the time help me feel at ease while he explained the steps.  Lonnie even invited me to the dealership for a sit-down stereo operation training seminar....all conducted in the A/C of my car with Lonnie going over every possible detail of how to operate my new stereo, the CD player, Sirius Radio, the works.  Sometimes I would have to have Lonnie repeat a few things more than once.  He didn't mind at all.....patient as can be, and polite as can be. 

Lonnie Gipson is a one-in-a-million car salesman.  He is a great representative of your dealership, and an all around great person.  I truly appreciate how he treated (and still treats) my wife and I.  His courteous and friendly manner will never be forgotten.  Lonnie made the entire process of purchasing a car a pleasant experience, and for that I will always be grateful.  -----  We sincerely thank you, Lonnie Gipson.  You're one heck of a guy.

An order was put in place, the car took two months to be delivered, but I got what i wanted :O) During this time, feedback was requested about the delivery status, and it was provided accordingly. - I have no complains at all, I'm very happy with the freedom my car provides me with, and I'm enjoying the experience of discovering all the features it has available.

I'm taking this opportunity to suggest the installation of one of those wall mirrors that allow us to see people coming in a different direction on the restrooms access corridor. During the few visits I did to the stand, i struck twice against people on this same corridor.

153,"April 10, 2012","I had taken my car in to get service done... my car was running a little weird and also my a/c wasn't working. They claimed to have put dye in the a/c and recharge the nitrogen, however, a few months later the a/c started to go out again. I called to see what they would charge to take a look at the repairs they did, they responded with ""what the cost of repairs would be"". Btw, the a/c cost over 150, so I took it to a different shop, they found no dye and no nitrogen. The new shop explained how they PROPERLY recharged the nitrogen and added dye and charged $75 dollars. As for the other repairs, my car still runs the same as I took it in before Spring Dodge. The total bill: over 600 bucks. When I mentioned that my car was still running weird and had a check engine light they said ""oh, well if you wanted us to fix that, you needed to be specific on what we were fixing!!"" That's why I brought the car to you guys... if I knew what was wrong... I'd have fixed it myself and saved a whole of money. So what did they fix... beats me!!

Our salesman was Duke Montross. He worked with me for about 8 hrs.  Never pushed me to change my mind or purchase a lesser vehicle. Ben Saxton also was very patient and helped in any way to make the deal go through.

I did ask for a 3.5 interest rate which was in line in my credit union rate.  Alley gave me 3.9.  Since it was so close I did finance the new truck with Ally.  At finance I asked the manager, who processes the paperwork if I could later refinance this auto loan and he stated No. That was not accurate,I contacted Ally and they stated that this loan could be refinanced.  I did refinance this loan with my credit union a couple of weeks later at 1.9% for 60 months, since they ran a special.

166,"March 01, 2012","After a deceiving ad on a used car, we bought what was supposed to be a well maintained car with all scheduled maintenance ""performed"" as well as an inspection of the vehicle and supposedly a lifetime warranty. No warranty with the car because it was over 100k miles yet it was on the ad for the particular car. We have this printed out, we have screen shots of the ad and it was still online for nearly two weeks after we purchased the car that it still shows this car has a free lifetime warranty. 
 2 days after purchasing the car the serpentine belt snapped leaving us stranded 100 miles from home and costing us $210 to get towed. Dealership had to replace belt on their dime since the paperwork had not been processed and extended warranty we purchased was ""not in effect"". then after several days we get the vehicle back the power steering was out and service basically said it was our problem. After speaking to the GM of the dealership this also got repaired on their dime but what decent dealer would give a car back to someone with no power steering???? We were told by john Dvorak that he could get $100 refunded for us for the inconvenice however we are still waiting to be reimbursed for the towing as promised by john Dvorak and it has been a month now and NOONE returns our phone calls.

With out Tim's patients I would have been lost in what was the differance between a one truck or another truck and what would best fit my needs and why. What struck a cord with me in all this is the honesty and profissionalism these men diplayed and along with a degree of intergerty that sometimes is hard to find among good people in the sales business. After Tim knew what I was looking for he introduced me to Lonnie Gibson. From there Lonnie put me at ease and went over what Tim and I had discussed to make sure that I was sure about my dession. Then Lonnie went one more step futher and explaned to me about the product and how it would performe to meet all my needs and how it was a better choice than a pick up truck. With out Lonnie's willingness to take the few exta minutes to tell me about the Aisin 6 speed transmission I would have never been comfortable about my purchase or my dession because I came in wanting a 6 speed manual transmission not knowing about the Aisin automatic.

203,"November 29, 2011","This is the 3rd vehicle my husband and I have purchased from Spring Chrysler Dodge Jeep. We are returning customers because we appreciate the professionalism and customer friendly buying experience. In July 2011, Adam Pace assisted my husband on purchasing his second vehicle which was a 2011 Dodge Charger R/T. My husband first called Adam to inquire if the vehicle was available and Adam immediately assured him it was on the lot and would have it ready for him to test drive. 2 hours later, my husband was home with the new vehicle (happy like kid in a candy store). Adam continued to contact my husband to ensure the satisfaction of the purchase and updated my husband on other vehicles that were for sale because he knew I was interested in purchasing one for myself. For 4 months, Adam consistently updated us on available rebates and other incentives we might be interested in. For 3 years, my heart was set on purchasing a Lexus. I even test drove 2 types of Lexus (an IS 250 and an IS 350). However, my mind was changed when I got behind my husband's Dodge Charger R/T. My husband went in to get the oil change on November 23, 2011 and informed me that there was the same exact vehicle on the lot. After work, I visited Adam to see about purchasing the car which he made very easy and painless knowing I had just gotten off of work and I was tired. That night, I drove home in my new vehicle. My husband and I have ""his"" and ""her"" 2011 Dodge Charger R/T's! LOL. My car is to be customized and I was apprehensive on when I could get my vehicle in, I worried about disrupting my work day; I didn't want to disrupt my routine. Because Adam is such an awesome guy, he drove to my place of business and picked up my car and dropped off a loaner car during my lunch hour. Constant communication was the key and Adam has been fantastic with keeping the lines open. My husband and I will continue to do business with Spring Chrysler Dodge Jeep for many more years to come!

204,"November 11, 2011","The overall experience was okay. Average I'd say. If the dealership wants better than that, they'll have to work a bit harder to keep up. 

The Pros: 

The customer relations between the salesman, (I should say sales'men' because one of them came up to talk with us for a while), was second-to-none. Either they are really good at faking it and experts at just telling you what you want to hear, or they were genuine in their kindness and generosity. Both Mike, and Reese, (another salesman), were extraordinary gentlemen. Both in the way they handled my family as well as myself, and in the way they managed their end of the business. I was a little surprised at the one who wrote up the papers. He seemed more as if he was interested in herding me through the process then he was at the personal side of things. Not rude, just... polite... and that's it. No ""real"" interaction with the customer I guess. No harm done. I wasn't offended. So, for that I gave the dealership a 5 for ""Friendliness"". They deserve it. But the fact of the matter is, the salesmen as individuals really deserve it, not necessarily the dealership itself as a collective whole. 

Now the Cons:

The whole process took most of the day which just drives me nuts. But at the same time and for some reason, ALL dealerships take all day to sell you a car, so nothing new there. Wish they could make that part of the experience a little better, but that goes for all of them.

The things I'm about to mention wouldn't necessarily bring me to a place as to not recommend someone this dealership, but I certainly will mention it to anyone I speak to concerning the circumstances surrounding the experience I had as a word of caution to them. While talking to the guy who was writing up the papers, he asked me politely if I wanted to purchase coverage on my tires and wheels. No surprise there. What made me pause was after I had already mentioned to him I wasn't interested, he suggested to me that he could lower the interest rate from 7% to 6.5% so that I could get the coverage at the same monthly payment. Why is this a problem? Because... I thought I was getting the very very best possible interest rate that I could get to begin with and I was led to believe that that was the case.. period. Now he tells me that it's not really the best interest rate I can get, and he does it at the end of the experience (right at the last minute), just so that I can get coverage for tires that almost do nothing other then wear out every 60,000 miles? Why the hell would I want to do that? I can think of a lot better things to spend my money on at 6.5% than coverage for my tires and wheels. If you are getting me the best rate I can possibly get and then tell me it's not really the best I can get after the papers are written up, and all for the purpose of coverage for my tires???; Well now...that sends up a red flag to me. You can count on the fact that from now on, I will make certain that anyone I speak with, (and I've been working with about 350 men at the same company for 9 years now), will know about it. I will remind them that it's possible that this dealership won't give you the best rate you can get. Something smells a bit fishy to me concerning that deal. The only reason I relented is because I didn't really have the luxury to think about the consequences of either accepting or declining the coverage. Guess that's what they're counting on. 

Now for the kicker; I'm on my way home from school now less than 24 hours later, and I notice a tiny crack in the windshield. Did I do that? Well, I guess it's possible. But normally you hear something like that strike the windshield... especially while driving a new vehicle that has virtually no sound coming from it... anywhere. I didn't even have the radio on. So I call my wife and told her about it. She came out to see it and asked where it was. Smart girl. I knew I married her for a reason. She said, ""The reason you didn't see the crack before is because it was covered up by the options and price tag that was taped to the windshield, that's why."" That didn't even dawn on me. Now, unless you're completely blind as a bat, you can't miss the crack. It was clear all the way on the passenger side of the vehicle from my viewpoint in the driver's seat. You have to look directly at it to cover it up. I don't like that. Not one little bit. Tell me the truth. Even if it hurts. I don't like dealing with dishonest people. That really bothers me and it should bother anyone else reading this review. So, would it have kept me from buying the car? Probably not. Would I have said something about it? Yes. ""Fix it."" Now they're going to have to fix it anyhow, AND they have to do it with me being skeptical concerning the dealership as a whole.  

Bottom line: If you want a nice vehicle at a fairly reasonable price, this is a fair place to look. Not the only place to look. But fair. I wouldn't say avoid it. But use caution. People, and dealerships alike (and in general) aren't always like the kind salesmen they hired to sell them cars to you on their behalf. If it was an honest mistake, fair enough. Like I said... work harder at not making mistakes like that.",5.0
205,"October 27, 2011","My wife and I recently bought a 2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland.  Our salesperson, Colonel Larry Chatman, could not have been better.  He is very easy to work with, friendly, and he is not pushy like many salespeople.  He just calmly showed us various vehicles that might work for us and answered our questions.  This is exactly what we wanted from our salesperson as we are both turned off by pushy salespeople.  Colonel Chatman is one of only a couple of car salespeople that I have been comfortable working with in my lifetime.  He definitely adds class to your organization and does a great job making customers relaxed, comfortable, and happy with their purchase.",5.0

He was very helpful and a friendly salesman to work with.  We had a problem with our AC not working the day after we brought our truck home.  When I called Tony Martinez, he said that there was nothing that they could do about it.  My husband then called Angel who told us to bring the truck back and he would have it taken care of.  HE DID exactly that!!!  We were VERY HAPPY.  The truck is doing fine now and we have cold air.  Angel is a man of his word and we sincerely appreciate him taking the time to help us out. We hope to continue our relationship with Spring Chrysler Jeep in the future and will certainly recommend them to our friends and family.     ",5.0
208,"October 24, 2011","I am pleased to give this review.  My experience with Spring Chrysler was superior from the word go.
I knew Bruce Glasscock and called him because he had invitated to come in and look around sometime.
He assigned Lonnie Gipson to show me around.
That was the beginning of a truly superior auto experience.  When I entered the dealership, I was immediately greeted warmly and taken to the receptionist to contact Lonnie.  He quickly responded and already had several vehicles lined up with the colors and options I had shown an interest in.  It was an extensive and nice selection.  Lonnie took me past each one and one ""jumped out"" at me above the others because of its color.  He then showed me the options and I was impressed as they were more than what I expected.  He asked me if I wanted to shop further and I did not so we took a test drive.  I was even further impressed.  Lonnie is a great listener.  He just let me ask the questions and had a quick and knowledgeable answer for each one.  He knows his business.
I told him that I was interested.  We went inside and discussed my budget and he suggested I take it home for a test and to make sure my wife liked it.  This gave me a chance to really drive the vehichle in everyday traffic and put it through its paces to see if it met my needs.  The vehicle was just what I was looking for.  I called Lonnie back and we set up an appointment convinient for me to come back in with the truck and start the process.  Lonnie had already listened to me the day before and knew what my budget was.  When I returned he had set the process in motion already.  I was already approved for financing.  We discussed the details and he went back to finance and got me the terms and discounts I requested and more.  I had already done my homework prior to contacting Bruce so I knew what would be a good deal.  The deal they were offering me was much better than that even.  Lonnie very effeciently got me in to the finance rep., Tony Martinez.  Tony was extremely efficient and friendly.  He is a great listener, also.  I was already interested in an extended wrap around warranty and gap insurance.  He showed me the EVTS option that Dodge has and I was very interested.  It was a little out of my budget however.  He left briefly and returned with the authorization to offer me a substancially lower loan interest rate ( I had already shopped around for interest rates and was pre approved for a low interest rate at my Credit Union) that allowed me to get the EVTS option.  In short I got a better interest rate than I could have gotten at the Credit Union ( already the best rate I could find anywhere else).  While I was signing the paper work, Bruce dropped in to check on me and how the process was progressing.  Happily, I got a new truck more options and my payments are less than the payments on my old truck!  Excellent to say the least!  Lonnie was close by and knew the deal was going to happen.  By the time I finished the paper work, Lonnie had already taken the truck in for detailing.  He already knew that I needed run boards because of a damaged hip condition I have that makes it difficult to get in or out of a truck without run boards. He had already worked those in for the final deal.  It was Saturday and the maintenance dept. wasn't sure they could get the run boards installed that day.  He kept encourageing them until they got those installed.  While we were waiting on that, Lonnie took me throuh the options and operating manual.  Shortly thereafter the vehicle was detailed out with the runboards installed.  Lonnie then helped me remove my belongings from my old Dodge truck and put them in my new one.  He then very patiently sat with me in the new truck and went over the new options (mostly involving the dash computers) and any other of the hundreds of questions I asked.  He knows his products well.  He went seamlessly from question to question with an immediate answer and demonstration.  I left with a thorough knowledge of my new trucks accesories and options.  He has followed up with calls to see if I need anything.  He has set me up with an appointment to come back in for the instillation of the EVTS system.  Lonnie (and everyone else at Spring Chry.) is very thorough.  He listens first, has quick knowledgeable answers, and is very patient.  He is extremely congenial.  He gave me his personal number and told me to call him anytime I need something.  In conclusion, my experience with Lonnie and Spring Chrysler has been absolutely superior!  I will not hesitate to recommend them to anyone who is looking for a new or used vehicle.   I don't believe anyone can find a better dealership anywhere nor a better salesman than Lonnie Gipson!
Thank You!

209,"October 24, 2011","Took vehicle in for an oil change. Did not mind the long wait, however, once my vehicle was ready for pick up, the service cashier was not very friendly. She seemed very abrupt and did not smile. When she told me how much I owed for the oil change, I informed her that I had given the service technician a coupon. She responded by telling me to come back in a few minutes so she could verify. When I came back (less than 5 minutes), she was ending a conversation with another employee - so what I heard was ""Hell no"".  This just seemed unacceptable to me. She did manage a ""thank you"" upon giving me my reciept - but other than that, I was really ready to leave and not go back. Not with that kind of service. ",5.0

Mr. Larry Chatman has totally changed my mind. He walked me through the whole process and made me so comfortable with my decision. No pressure at all. I was so happy with the final outcome that I was in tears later on. I was in tears because I had finally done something on my own for the first time and it was a big step for me.   I am currently going through a nasty divorce and I didn't want to go through anymore stress. Mr. Chatman has got to be your number one salesman. If he is not, you should make him number one! The experience I had with your dealership started giving me more confidence to make my own decisions.

235,"September 22, 2011","I am extremely unhappy today; the day after purchasing my new van.  I feel the salesperson should know exactly what options are on the vehicle you are purchasing and not find out after you have already signed the papers that what you were told were on the vehicle are not.  For instance, we are sitting in parking lot ready to leave and find out that the bluetooth program to sync cell phones is not loaded on our van.  We were told &quot;oh sorry.  you can  buy the part, though, for around 250.00 and get it installed. Excuse me, you told me it had it when we signed the papers. We let that slide.  Then we were instructed to come back today to have the key fob programmed so that we didn't have to use the actual key to drive and that as long as we had the key it would automatically unlock when we get close to the vehicle.  I was even given the little part to take home and bring back with us so the service department wouldn't have to locate one. So my husband goes back to dealership today and guess what, that wasn't an option on our van and no it can't even be installed.  &quot;Oh,Sorry.&quot;  Also we were going to take our trade in van home and take the trailer hitch off.  &quot;No just leave it with me and I'll have our guys take it off for you tomorrow.  You can pick it up when you come get your key programmed.&quot;  Did they take it off?  No.  Turns out they want to charge $100.00 now to take it off.  After talking to the service department guy, he stated the blue tooth, key fob deal is all part of the navigation package which we knew we didn't have that.  When you spend over 30,000.00 on a vehicle, you expect it to have the options your salesperson told you it had.  This is whole situation to me is totally unnaceptable and very poor customer service.  Was I happy when I left the dealership last night?  Yes.  I felt they worked with us to get in to our van for the payment we needed.  Am I happy now?  Not so much.",5.0

We didn't understand why the other salesman would tell us it was there but not check personally himself. My mom was furious and so was I.

Paul Mays our salesman was also very persistant and dedicated in making sure we left there satisfied with our new purchase. He even took us out for lunch at a local buffet next door.

It took several hours to find a financing option that worked, but we were patient and so were they. They didnt stop until everything worked out exactly how it needed to. He loves his truck!

Not expecting to need a vehicle for ourselves this soon, we found ourselves in an upside down nighmare with our car that we didnt think we could get out of. Only because we had such a great experience with our son, we decided to give them a try. We walked in on Saturday, layed everything out on the table, and again, Chris and the team went to work for us well after banker's hours. They told us that they would call us the next day, which they did. They kept in touch over the next 2 days and then let us know that they were able to put us in the truck we wanted, the payments we could afford, and pay off our trade-in.

With having two small children (under the age of two) and my husband with me, Ken was quick to suggest that we ALL go for a ride in the vehicles (to double check size and room) and helped us load the car seats in and out of every vehicle we test drove.
He made our car buying experience pleasant and was able to answer all of our questions regarding the Durango we bought as well as the dealerships services. We feel he will be available to us even though the sale is complete to answer any concerns or problems we may encounter. We look forward to doing business with him again in the future.

He was very accommodating and went out of his way to get us the best deal possible; and he got me into the car I wanted at a price that was within our budget.

269,"August 26, 2011","Went to this dealer to look at a specific truck, which they did not have anymore.  Was willing to look at some other vehicles and found a silver 2002 Dodge Ram 1500 with 117,000 miles, but really did not like the price. I had just gotten out of the military and they said that they always hook up veterans.  Well they really really really hooked me up.  They hooked me up for 7100 bucks after all the hidden fees like a 400 dollar window etching fee. All in all about 2500 more than the vehicle was worth, but I did not mind because they talked a great game and had me believing that I was driving away with a great product that was going to last another 60,000 miles.  

Here we are a few months and less than 3000 miles later and I am looking at 4000-7000 dollar bill to replace the engine.  I should have taken the check engine light coming on during the test drive as a sign and walked away, but instead I let them turn it off and drove away.  Perhaps they did think it was a good product, but as I replay everything back over and over again, I get the feeling that the truck was just barely hanging on to begin with.    ",4.8

273,"August 25, 2011","OUTSTANDING!  The customer service I received from the start of my search with Spring Chrysler Dodge Jeep was excellent.  I was very specific in what I was looking for – a black on black 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee with Basic Overland package, which was no easy feat to locate.  We contacted numerous Chrysler Jeep & Dodge dealerships in the State of Texas that showed possible availability of the specific Jeep I was looking for and was given the runaround by salesmen at multiple dealerships, that is until we met Reece Broussard.

From the start Reece was helpful, knowledgeable, friendly, upfront, and extremely patient.  When we had a question, he had an answer.  Never once were we pressured into buying or given the runaround!  Spring Chrysler Dodge Jeep is very fortunate to have Reece on their sales team; he is a great asset to your dealership and someone I will highly recommend to any friend or family member.

285,"August 16, 2011","I first walked in to get some information on a Ram 3500 diesel dually, and met Reece.  Reece was right on top of all my questions.  He was real friendly and courteous. The dealership was busy and Reece never made me feel that I was taking time away from his sales. I told him I was in the market and ready to buy but not that day.  He gave me all the information I needed along with his card and Wills card. He told me that he was off the next day and if I came back, see Will. We did come back the next day and met with Will. He was right up front with us on prices and what they could or could not do. We had a previous appointment at another dealership and left. Called Will about 2 hours later and told him we were heading back to buy our truck.  Will was waiting and we sat down and negotiated until we were satisfied and told Will we were ready to by. The truck we wanted was not at the dealership and had to be pulled from somewhere else. The management got right on it and had it transferred that day. We had to wait until Monday to pick up our truck because it needed a bed liner. Monday we picked up our new truck and were thrilled to death. It was washed and ready to hit the road. I went to several dealerships in the area and by far Spring Chrysler was the best. The organization, the people, the shops were far better than the others. Will and Reece are top notch sales people. I could tell they honestly had my best interest at heart. They never pressured us, they just gave us the facts. Will is the sales person that actually completed our purchase and gave us a exceptional deal. I recommend Spring Chrysler to anyone wanting to buy, at a place you can feel comfortable in without the accompanying run around that is a typical dealer experience.  Great people and great deals. Another plus for Spring Chrysler is they  offer a lifetime power train warranty that no one else has. See Will Clunn or Reece Broussard for exceptional service and complete honesty.

He knows how to handle his business very very well and I recommend him to all my friends and family when a service is needed at Spring Dodge Chrysler Jeep.

Donny Jones handled an issue with my vehicle very well upon purchase, nothing major just a very slight ding in the bed that occured during transit from factory. He had the ding repaired within 24 hours and then my brand new truck was 100% brand new again.

The Spring DCJ service Dept is hands down the best DCJ service dept in the Houston area, I have a close friend who drives from Baytown when he needs anything done and he lives 3 miles from the dealer closet to his house. Ironically he drives past 5-6 other dealerships for small services like oil changes or whatever else his 2010 2500 Diesel needs.",4.8

Bill Deringer, Richard Mitchell, Robert and a few others, created a dream come true that was a nice, clean low mileage pre-owned vehicle that I would be able to use everyday for my job. There was a wide selection of clean, well maintained vehicles. The loan process was handled behind the scenes, and I just received a phone call saying ""...come on in and pick up your car"". 

You cannot find a better or more efficient group of people, ready to help you find your auto/truck needs, than the folks at Spring DCJ.

The only things that made the purchase at Spring Dodge less than perfect was the pricing negotiation which was very tough by the dealership. Perhaps I expected to much discount on the Challenger. Also the vehicle had several minor problems that I detected after a few days of owning it, several dings and a scratched piece on the interior. Due to the fact that the car had only arrived the previous day, I think this is not too big an issue. And Spring Dodge has committed to fixing these issues.",5.0
318,"July 05, 2011","I bought a used 2005 Dodge from Jerry Kempenski at Spring Chrysler Dodge and 5 weeks later the battery died. I was due for service anyway so I brought it back in and even though I was just out of the 30 day grace period, Jerry went to bat for me through several managers and hooked me up with a new battery.  

I am a single mom with four kids and I would have had to go the route of keeping jumper cables on hand for a few weeks until I could buy another battery. Not fun, especially in this Houston heat!

I originally came here after going online and finding the car I wanted in my price range. Once I was here, not only did I get a good deal but I found that the car I wanted came with a FREE lifetime limited powertrain warranty. All I have to do is keep up with my regular maintenance.

I am so appreciative of Jerry K. and his managers for backing up their products. You are usually out of luck when you buy a used car...

One Happy Customer,

I started with a different dealer but I am very happy that I stopped the deal there and went with this dealer.  Reece did outstanding and I would buy another vehicle from him and this dealer.  They offered me many extras without a cost to the buyer.  I have done a lot of home work on the Dodge Journey.  I drove several other mid-size SUV's in the Houston area.  I read the pros and cons then I drove the Journey to see.  I find this SUV to have a great ride and the gas mileage it appears will be greater than the sticker.  I have only had this SUV for a couple of days but drove another one for 3 days before I bought this one.  I would suggest that people take a look at the Dodge Journey before they buy.

337,"June 07, 2011","After six weeks of searching for a new Jeep to replace my 2005 Wrangler, I was tired and frustrated with every cliche internet salesman I delt with. All the smoke and mirrors led me to try one final dealership, Spring CJD. I was very jaded upon contact with Devonte, and gave him six weeks worth of pent of frustration that he certainly didnt earn. He was paitient with me, and put me in touch in Duke. This was a breath of fresh air. Duke was to the point, clear, concise, and best of all, refused to waste a moment of my time. He told me what he could do, couldnt do, and work his hardest to secure me the best deal possible. He mentioned, ""buying a car should be fun"". I couldnt agree more, and this seems to be a lost aspect of car purchasing unless you have prime credit and a huge bank account. Duke took my credit issues in stride, and didnt loose momentum when hurdles presented themselves.

Billy Vincent did a fantastic job on showing me every detail the Durango had and made me feel comfortable about buying such an expensive vehicle.  I would highly recommend Billy to family and friends.  I did not enjoy the game of getting the right price accomplished.  I know that I could have received a better price but it was hard for me to handle the stress of that situation.  Once we agreed on a price and went to financing I had to play the game again.  I should have been offered the lower finance rate from the time I walked into the door and not play the back and forth game. I also was very unhappy about the milage on my durango coming from another dealership.  I assumed the brand new vehicle would be transported instead of driven to your location.  So once I received it my brand new durango already had 250 miles on it.  I had wanted the Inferno Red color and that was the closest dealership to get one from.  That was disappointing!

As we talked to Dawn, we were very impressed with her enthusiam and positive attitude - even on the coldest day of the year! As all of the vehicles were locked, she offered to let us look at the Jeep Grand Cherokee she was driving. We agreed to meet with Dawn again during business hours. This was the next great thing. I had dropped my husband off at a Doctors appointment and driven to the dealership. Dawn met me at the front door and we started to look at the vehicles.

402,"February 23, 2011","I bought my first car 41 years ago and have owned a lot of them since. Mostly GM, an occasional Ford, a couple of Toyotas and a Mercedes or two, but NEVER, EVER a Dodge. Wouldn't think of it. This year, ready to buy a ""hard loaded"" pickup, I looked at the new Ford ""King Ranch"" and ""Platinum"" pickups. They are very nice trucks.
 
After driving the new Fords, just for grins, I decided to stop at Spring Chrysler to look at the new Ram Laramie Longhorn Edition. Took a test drive and bought one on the spot. I really didn't want to like it, old habits die hard, but what's not to like. This aint Pawpaw's old Dodge truck. Style, power and luxury to spare. Bottom line: A truck just ain't supposed to feel this good.   

Whenever I used to hear someone say something nice about a Ram truck, I would reply, ""Yeah, but it's a Dodge.""  Now, after driving the Chevys & Fords, I can only say, ""They're nice, BUT they're not quite Dodges."" How things have changed.

Sincerly,

434,"December 29, 2010","Spring Chrysler Jeep Dodge is such a great dealership!  The care towards the customer is so refreshing and the professionalism is impressive.  When we needed a pre owned vehicle, we didn't consider any dealership other than Spring Chrysler Jeep Dodge.  ",5.0
435,"December 28, 2010","This was my first dealings with Spring Dodge.  I was given a contact name (Joe Salez)who put us in contact with Reese Broussard.  When we arrived we were greeted by Joe and he introduced us to Reese.  

Joe and Reese were just wonderful host to us and treated us with great kindness and respect.  I could not ask for a more ""pleasant experience"" while dealing with these two gentlemen who exhibted a very thorough knowledge of what Spring Dodge has to offer.  

Reese is an outstanding Salesman and very courteous and respectful to his customers and makes buying a vehicle a pleasant experience.

I plan on making many more purchases in the future from Spring Dodge and look forward to dealing with Reese Broussard and Joe Saliz.

Regards,

Gerald and Anna Harper

436,"December 28, 2010","This dealership was the best I have ever done business with. Dawn was great and very friendly. She answered all my questions and was very concerned with my feelings as well. Robert was very helpful and exceeded all my expectations. I feel he went beyond what he had to do to make me feel comfortable about my purchase. 
The only thing that I wish would have been done is to fill the gas tank up. They put some gas in it but not much. This is the only dealership that has not filled up the tank. ",5.0
437,"December 27, 2010","I have bought several vehicles from Spring Dodge both personal and for business over the last few years and no matter the reason I choose to visit the 
dealership, service or sales, they are always very courteous and helpful. I have never been diappointed when leaving this dealership and recommend them to all my freinds and family.

Other dealerships may promise you results but after the sale they won't deliver. Spring dodge is your complete one stop shop, they work with you during the sale to help put you in the vehicle you want and are also there afterwards for any services you may need minor or major.",5.0
438,"December 26, 2010","This is our second purchase from Spring since 2004. It is nice to know that when your sales person tells you, ""That is Just the beginning to our relationship"" He really means it!  We refer anyone looking for a new Dodge, Chrysler or Jeep to Brett. The service experience is just as good. We have been doing all of our oil changes and even purchased tires last year for our last Dodge truck. This is a Full Service dealer that you can trust. Do yourself a Favor and try Brett and his team of professionals TODAY!

439,"December 26, 2010","Our Family had a serious accident over a holiday weekend and narrowly escaped with our lives in our Ford Explorer.  After much research, we decided that a Dodge truck was going to be the safest replacement over an Explorer.  We met Al Heggs at Spring Dodge.  He was fantastic to deal with.  He knew we were serious about saftey and having the best vehicle for our family.  He made the deal go smoothly and he was sure to follow up a few weeks later to see how we were enjoing our new truck.  We hope that we never relive the events of that holiday weekend, but we know if something ever happens, we are going to be much safer in this truck than anything else we could have purchased.  ",5.0
440,"December 24, 2010","Reece made this a wonderful and exciting experience for our son, who purchased his first new car.  My husband and I both felt that Reece did everything in his power to make this as easy and painless as possible.  Reece has gained both our respect and our business for future purchases.",5.0
441,"December 24, 2010",Spring CJD always provides great and friendly customers service.  Each sales associate is always focused satisfying each and every customer.  From the moment you walk through the doors you can see the difference at Spring CJD.  Other dealers claim to be focuses on customer service but Spring CJD delivers and this time was no different! Todd walked us through the entire car buying process.,5.0
442,"December 24, 2010","I would highly recommend Spring Chrysler Jeep Dodge to anyone looking to buy a new car! From the moment I walked into the showroom floor, I was greeted professionally and without any high-pressure sales approach.  Brett, my sales guy, was honest, sincere and took the time to explain all the features of the vehicle I was interested in. The rest of the staff was also very friendly and made me feel welcomed. I closed on my new 2011 Grand Jeep Cherokee that same day! The whole process was seamless and the price, color and payments were exactly what I wanted.  Thank you for making my buying experience EXCELLENT!
