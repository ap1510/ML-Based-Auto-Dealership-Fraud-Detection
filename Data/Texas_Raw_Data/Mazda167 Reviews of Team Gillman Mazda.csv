0,"September 29, 2019","I was shopping for a specific car that was online in Gillman’s Inventory.  I called to verify the car was available and told the i was in Sugarland so would be a 45 minute drive to Spring.  They assured me they had the car.  As soon as I arrived they told me the car had just sold but I could look at other cars I had no interest in.
So instead of being honest, they had no respect for my time, energy gas etc.",2.3
1,"July 18, 2019","We were greeted right away, sat with sales rep at a desk and went over my desires in a new car and she left and found one, brought it around. We sat in it with her in back seat and I asked about some features. She did not have answers to most of my questions and handed me off to another sales person.  He knew even less than she did, could not answer very basic questions.  

We left, went to a couple of other dealerships for different makes and were highly impressed by their vehicles and knowledgeable sales people.     I still hope to test drive a Mazda, but it won't be at this dealership.  Not sure if price is good on their vehicles as could not even get good information on that.

My sales consultant, Chef Ndofor was extremely helpful and attentive.

11,"September 16, 2018","After seeing an ad on cars.com for a 2015 Mazda 3, I called Munday and spoke with Wolf. I told him I would be there this evening and if I like the car, I’d pay cash. I asked him what the bottom dollar would be and he told me it was already listed as low as they would go. So he confirmed I would pay the price on the ad + tt&l.  When I got there, he told me there was someone there looking at it and another person waiting as well which upset me since I had called to confirm that they still had it and that I was driving 2 hours to get there. I waited and finally drove the car. When I agreed to purchase it, the finance manager came over to give me his “bottom dollar” which included “fees”or a “package” for tint that was already on the car and nitrogen that was already in the tires. When I refused to pay the fees, he said he couldn’t sell it to me. I told him that was false advertising and not what Wolf told me on the phone. Needless to say, I walked out without the car. It is sad that they feel they have to resort to scamming their customers to make money. Simply tell me what your bottom dollar is +tt&l and if I believe it’s a fair price I’ll pay it! They also did not disclose that the backup camera was damaged in a wreck and not repaired. I asked if there was anything wrong with the car and was told no. And In the ad it states that there was a 100,000 mi warranty with the car. He asked me to sign a paper saying that I was buying the car “as is”   I really don’t know how they get away with it. It really should be illegal. I do plan to report it to the police department as fraud. Not sure it’ll do any good but someone needs to make a stand against these crooks!",1.0

30,"July 31, 2017","I'm new to Mazda, as an owner. So, I'm not familiar with reliability and build quality. Upon recommendation from a friend, I decided to give Mazda a shot.

Recently, while driving on the highway, with no obstacles, debris, etc., (nor collision with any other vehicle or obstacles), I heard the sound of something instantly separating from my car! Upon further inspection, I found that my rear passenger wheel well trim had come off! When I took it to Munday Mazda, they initially could not authorize warranty replacement. However, Rich helped me. He personally provided shuttle service to my job. After consulting with ""upper management "", they graciously provided warranty replacement for the part.

When I brought the vehicle in to be serviced, they had the work completed in an hour or less!

Overall, I'm satisfied with my experience. Especially, being a new customer to Mazda. 

Thank you Rich, and Munday Mazda!

They understood my circumstances when only being able to call back about a car query after work hours, understood our travel time during evening rush hour and catered to us at such a late hour up until closing.

We even had a follow up email regarding our concerns. Not bad.

34,"May 11, 2017","Car shopping/buying can be though, especially if you are aware it's most definitely time for a new vehicle, but just can't decide what vehicle to select next. Considering that I am highly an over thinker, I was expecting for my car buying experience to be sort of difficult. To my surprise it was all the opposite. I was fortunate enough to have Jhon Francois assist me and he really went above and beyond in every aspect. He really took the time to get to know what I liked and needed and was extremely patient and knowledgeable. He thoroughly explained all my options and helped me find the perfect vehicle that not only suits my personality, but my budget  as well. He worked long and hard to meet every single expectation and need I was looking for in a vehicle. He made my car buying experience not only easy but fun as well. If you are considering purchasing a vehicle, I highly encourage you to come to Munday Mazda and pay Jhon Francois a visit. You are guaranteed to walk out feeling accomplished and happy with your new vehicle and having received the best possible assistance with your car search. ",5.0
35,"April 20, 2017","I would highly recommend that everyone find a different location to do business, and to not go to any dealership owned by Group 1 Automotive either.  When we had a problem with unmet expectations at Munday Mazda, the service department refused to try to help us reach a solution and sent us to the sales department for help contacting the dealership owners, Group 1 Automotive.  It has been a month since we began seeking a solution, and the dealership will no longer return our calls, presumably because they have not heard from Group 1 Automotive on the matter.  We also reached out to Group 1 Automotive a month ago, and they have NEVER returned our calls or responded to our email.  It appears to us that Group 1 Automotive is not concerned about customer service, and if there is a problem with something at their dealerships, the dealership is completely unable to address the concern themselves.  I am shocked at the lack of support Group 1 Automotive seems to provide for their employees and the complete lack of effort to reach out AT ALL regarding our problem.  ",2.0

38,"December 30, 2016","James Jackson - General Sales Manager

I thought I would follow-up on my experience Wed evening.  We came by earlier in the day and test drove a Miata and the team was attentive and supportive without being over bearing.  After a few other stops we decided that we would look into making a deal so we used your trade-in tool on my dodge and even made the effort to go to the DMV and get a replacement title for my wife's Smart car since your salesman suggested bringing both cars as trade.  You probably remember us now.

We did our research and were prepared. Despite that and expressing my concern that I did not want to go through the sales dance, that is exactly what happened.  Multiple offers Sales Manager, coming by and then you joining us.  Taking my Challenger in the back and even coming back regarding over spray.  Finally the classic offer after we exit tactic.  To be honest in my opinion this was truly insulting and a very inefficient way to operate.  I have bought and sold many cars and this was my worst experience.

Finally, I went to another dealership and was treated up front and with respect.  I received very close to what I originally proposed to your team as trade in value for my vehicles as the FIRST offer in cash even without a purchase and I will be purchasing a vehicle, but definitely not from your team.  I hope you consider reassessing how, in the future, you approach different types of customers and your sales approach, but clearly that's your choice.

I met with Wolf Zion each time and he was always cordial and never pulled the hard sell.  I finally ended up buying a used Mazda 3 from Munday for my son.  The car was in excellent condition on the exterior and interior.  I had been looking for the right car for my son for months and Munday Mazda really came through for us.  We were given a great priced based on the Kelly Blue Book.  Additionally after the purchase they rounded up floor mats for us even though we didn't ask for them.  They also threw in a free first service call that we didn't request.  We drove off the lot with the understanding that we purchased a used car as is with no warranty.  A couple of days after the purchase the air bag light would not go off.  I took it back to them and also mentioned I thought the transmission was shifting a little rough and to please look it.  Both issues where repaired at no cost to me.  This dealer is the best I've ever had the pleasure dealing with.

62,"February 04, 2014","I’ve always had good experiences at car dealerships in the past, but my recent experience at Munday Mazda stands out so much that it prompted me to write this review.  My first contact with Munday Mazda was via their website when I made an inquiry about a car I was interested in.  I received a quick response from Wolf Zion.  After a few emails and phone exchanges, I went in to see Wolf.  As expected from my previous contact with him, he was professional, knowledgeable, patient, courteous and a straight shooter, all of which I greatly appreciated.  He never pressured me nor did he make me feel like I was just another potential sale to him.  It was clear to me from the beginning that Wolf’s objectives were to help me get into a car that I would be very pleased with at the lowest price possible, and to ensure that I had a pleasant experience in the process. Wolf (whom I now refer to as “Salesman Extraordinaire”) most definitely accomplished all of his objectives.  Besides treating me like family, he helped me find a fantastic Certified Pre-Owned Mazda that I am thrilled with, and along with John Hankins, the Sales Manager’s help (and very hard work), got me an incredible deal with an interest rate much lower than I had anticipated (in spite of some glitches on my credit report).  Thank you thank you, Wolf and John!  Herbert Brown, the Finance Manager (loved him), walked me through the paperwork, patiently answering all of my questions, and completing the sale.  From beginning to end, I couldn’t have asked for a better car buying experience.  I highly recommend Munday Mazda.  These folks are fantastic at their jobs and couldn’t be nicer to work with.  Doesn’t get much better than that!!  ",5.0
63,"July 01, 2013","I went in to Munday Mazda to ask if I qualified for a 2014 trade-in. I purchased a Mazda 3 in October 2012. I was assured that it was possible and I was assured that they could make it happen. During the process everyone was very helpful. Wolf helped me through all the details and explained with detail everything I asked about. I ended up buying a Mazda CX-5. Wolf was very professional and patient. He went back and forth asking me if I would go for certain deals the dealership presented me including monthly payment options, money down, etc. I asked what percentage I would be financed and he said he would inquire and came back with good news. My payment and my interest rate were reduced after only 7 months with the Mazda 3. Wolf presented all of this information to me before any of my money was drafted for the down payment and before going to financial specialist (who was also awesome like Wolf). Wolf offered to take all of my belongings from my Mazda 3 after I bought the CX-5. He filled my tank with gasoline, and because I had to go to work at 7:00 pm, he worked very hard and fast to get me out of the dealership. (I arrived at 4:30-ish and was out by 6:40 pm!!!) Wolf also put all of my paperwork and all other materials in my new car so as to not hinder me more. I was even given a Black Forest ham sandwich with Muenster cheese and chips while I waited. What more could I ask.
In essence, I will recommend my friends and family to try Munday Mazda when purchasing a new car. The service, atmosphere, facilities, and the personnel were all excellent. Mr. Zion was very courteous, professional, and caring and made my visit to Munday Mazda very warm, pleasant and satisfying. I will certainly return again when I'm ready for another new car!

He & Herbert & Dean were so so patient with me and went above and beyond more than I could have ever expected!!! At first it looked like I wasn't going to get my new car, and they all seemed so sad and that touched my heart. I have never heard anyone ever say that about a dealership!!!

Wolf was awesome and a straight shooter, we had been working with him for about a month over the phone before going to the dealer and told him after researching the web how much we would spend. He had the cars we wanted to look at and actually based on the figure we gave him he already had the cars proped for our review and price range interest, We drove the car home within a couple of hours. I highly recommend this dealer to anyone. I would like to comment about the Kingwood dealer! They are the worst place I have ever been. Do not waste your time at Kingwood Mazda.

67,"May 13, 2013","Initially went in looking for a Mazda CX-5 for my wife.  Was promptly greeted by Wolf Zion and had a nice test drive.  Also drove a Mazda 3 w/stick shift just for the heck of it. 

Returned later with wife so she could drive the CX-5 AWD version.  We were comparing it vs Toyota Rav4, Ford Escape, & Honda CRX.  We both liked it, but wife wanted to drive some other SUV's.

After thinking about it we decided to go with the car for me.  I really liked the Mazda 3, so I ended up trading my old work truck in and got a good deal w/0% financing on my new Zoom Zoom!

Could not have had a better salesman than Wolf.  Very patient, considering we were looking @ multiple types of vehicles.  Got a fair deal on my trade as well.   

Go see Wolf for a pleasant buying experience & tell him John sent you!",5.0
68,"May 13, 2013","From the moment I first inquired about a new vehicle, Wolf Zion showed great attention to exactly what I was looking for. He was sincere and honest about everything from pricing to the features of every model of what I was looking for (Mazda 3). He made sure to get me the best deal possible, but I have a feeling that even if I couldn't have come away with anything then he would not have been pushy about it like some other dealers are. Wolf, Hebert Brown (Finance), Jerrell Smart, and, even a gentleman (though I don't remember his name) from the Detailing Department were all very helpful and nice. I could keep going about how good my experience was here but we don't have all day. I highly recommend this place and again, Wolf in particular was very helpful.

69,"April 27, 2013","A couple months ago, I went to test drive a vehicle and did not settle on a vehicle. However, on April 23rd, I went in to buy a certified vehicle. The staff was very friendly and supportive. I needed the new vehicle for safety reasons since the vehicle I owned was not up to par with my standards anymore. Although I was skeptical about the change, I was very successful had it not been for the metal support given by Wolf Zion. 

He helped me focus on the reason I needed the new vehicle within my 2 month decision-making process. He would just check in with me from time to time just to see how my son and I were doing and that, I believe, made the difference of me coming back to buy at this particular dealership. He was never pushy or adamant but was just very supportive. He give dealership staff a very good name. 

Now my family and I are getting acquainted with our new Kia Sportage.
It was a very good decision and I am happy I finally made it.",4.8

79,"January 25, 2013","Let me start by saying that I am a repeat customer of Munday Mazda. They have the friendliest staff of any dealership I have ever been to bar none. As a matter of fact, I believe that Munday Chevrolet needs to send their staff to train with the Mazda staff. Jerrell Smart, Charles, James, Xavier, and Herbert the finance manager will do every thing in their power to get you the best trade in price, the best new car price, and the best finance percentage rate possible. They are honest car professionals which is very rare in the Houston and Spring area. If they can't do something they tell you why and will show you why on paper. I have made four new car purchase attempts with this dealer since 2010 with three successful purchases. I traded my 2010 CX9 in recently because I wanted to upgrade to one with sunroof and all the bells and whistles for my wife. The staff worked vigorously to get me what I owed on my trade and got me best possible price on my new CX9. Herbert was able to get my payment within budget with a unbelievable rate and I did not put a cent down. This was possible in part because I have outstanding credit but I felt Herbert, the finance officer, was on my side and did not try to just put me with a bank where the dealership wins. Herbert even found me a 2.14 percent rate on a 72 month term after I was quoted a 3.14 percent rate which I was actually happy with. That is going above and beyond in my opinion. I was so happy, I came in the next day to try and purchase a new 2014 Mazda A6 that I had fell in love with while buying my wife's car. To be honest, I did not think the A6 purchase would be successful due to my Corolla S trade was very upside down and I knew it. I was not happy with the Corolla S purchased just a 1.5 years ago due to its small size and my children being uncomfortable in the rear seat. I had to bend a little in negotiations and put a small amount of money down to get the deal done but honestly I still can't figure out how they got it within the criteria I had given them. The staff worked all day long (really all day) to get me a great price on the A6 and get the Corolla S trade price where we could get the deal done. I am so happy with my new A6. It is the absolute most fun car I have ever owned. I would compare it equally to any comparably equipped luxury brand. Finally, I want to say that the service department at Munday Mazda is extremely well managed. Cynthia, my personal favorite service advisor, and the service manager always listen to my concerns and get any of my regular service done in the time frame promised. The service staff also get any of a very few small problems I have with one of my cars repaired as quickly as possible. Look, I am very hard to please to be honest and Munday Mazda pleases me over and over again which surprises even myself.

I went to munday mazda and they said they could help me so of course I was skeptical and thought ok they will call me in a few days and tell me the same thing, I never expected to be able to get a vehicle let alone the same day! Within just an hour or so they had me approved on a wonderful fully loaded impala with payments even lower than I was expecting and a reasonable down payment that I could do right then. So not only were they able to get me approved but they were very friendly very professional and went well beyond what I expected and I can guarantee this I will be a life ling customer and Ive alredy sent a few friends and family there and will continue to do so.

86,"September 02, 2012","This website does not allow me to give the conditional recommendation that I think is most fitting to describe my experience at this dealership.  I did purchase a vehicle at this dealership for 2 reasons: the price was competitive and Melissa, my salesperson, was excellent.  However my recommendation cannot be absolute because of my experience upon returning with my new vehicle 10 days after my new auto purchase to have over $500 worth of accessories installed by the service shop.  I was given 1-1.5hr estimate of installation time and planned my day based on that estimate.  After waiting nearly 3 hours, I was told it would be another 45 minutes or so.  I am not upset about the wait; that I understand and can forgive.  However I had scheduled an out of town meeting several hours after my car was due to be ready and was at this point in danger of missing my meeting.  I spoke with my salesperson Melissa and she made a very strong effort to help me obtain a loaner vehicle from the dealership.  Given that I had just spent over $25K on a new vehicle just 10 days prior and was now installing over $500 of Mazda accessories in the dealership service dept, I assumed Melissa would not have any trouble getting her manager to approve a loaner for just a few hours that day.  Well I was WRONG, and hence my ultimate disappointment with this dealership .  The manager explained that he simply could not arrange a loaner for me due to insurance costs, nor could he let me borrow a new car.  Well I wasn't asking for a new car, just A car and only for a half day.  Despite all the positive experience I had working with Melissa and up to this point, I am overwhelmed with disappointment given how callously this manager denied my request for a loaner vehicle, especially after the large financial investment I had JUST made the week prior and in light of the fact that I was in this predicament because of an error on THEIR part.  In summary, visit Munday because their prices are competitive, but be sure to ask for Melissa.  She was consistently helpful and sympathetic to my situation.  I purchased from her because she took the time to explain things well and, unlike every other salesperson I met during my week long car search, was refreshingly patient and restrained in her sales approach.  Despite my favorable impression of Melissa and her attentiveness to customer satisfaction, I was ultimately disappointed with the management of the dealership for their failure to maintain customer satisfaction after handing them over $25,000 of my hard-earned money.  Shame on you Munday Mazda. ",4.2

Never felt pressured or unknowing. Mr. Zion answered every question I had and more. He showed me everything there was to know about the Mazda6. He took me outside to show me the car and showed me every feature that it had. He took me on a test drive and showed me the possibilities of what the Mazda6 was capable of. He gave me the manual and showed me how to look up certain things I might need in the future.I was amazed with the overall performance of the Mazda6 and everyone at the dealership was professional and kind. I was offered refreshments and was greeted in every room I walked into. Mr. Zion helped me fill out the paper work with a breeze.

We have been to many car lots over the years and purchased several different cars in our lifetime, but the experience at Munday Mazda with Wolf as our salesperson was very refreshing. Specifically because of this, and although I wasn't really in the market at the time, we returned to purchase my first new car in 12 years, a Mazda 2 from Mr Zion. Wolf put me immediately at ease, answered all my questions, gave me answers to questions I hadn't even thought of and made sure my needs were met and that I was happy with my overall experience. I have had some bad experiences with car sales persons in the past and am quite skeptical about dealing with them. My experience with Wolf has changed my opinion of car sales personnel. His professionalism, positive attitude, confident, relaxed manner and knowledge of his product made the experience enjoyable. Yes, I said enjoyable. For the first time in my 52 years of life, I actually had fun buying a car instead of the tense, nerve-wracking experiences I have previously had at other dealerships.

Wolf contacted me before I even navigated away from the page in which I submitted the request.  He scheduled me for a test drive the next day.  I didn't hear back from 2 of the the other dealerships until after I test drove.  It was a great experience.  He had a no pressure and very frank conversation with me to ensure this was the car that was right for me.  He let me drive the car anywhere and as long as I wanted to. I was ready to buy then with agreement from my wife but certain things happened and our financial outlook became uncertain for a few weeks. I had to call off the whole search.  Wolf just told me that when things look better give him a call.  There was no pressure at all. About a month later things settled down and it was time to buy again.  I gave him very little warning and showed up at the dealership.  He was called and cut off his lunch break to show my wife the car as well.

Best of all, he wasn't ""pushy.""  I did not feel pressured like you experience in many other dealerships.  And, something I've never seen in any dealership anywhere:  Wolf listened to me.  WOW!  He really did listen and was then able to better guide me in the direction that he thought would please me the most in my car purchase.  Plus, he was very respectful of me as a female--and this is very important to me:  too many dealerships I have visited but NOT purchased a car, treated me as if I knew nothing and wanted to know where my husband was!  I don't remember Dean's last name, but he took care of all the details of price and finance, and I felt valued as a potential customer.  I knew getting financing for me was going to be a challenge, but Dean came through for me too.  He and Wolf worked overtime two nights in a row to take care of me.  I was impressed with the dedication and work ethic at this dealership.

I definitely felt like he was in my corner the whole time (I know he was in his pocket's corner, but it's good he was able to make me feel I was not getting screwed at the same time). This dealer has won my loyalty completely because they worked so hard to get me in the exact car I wanted. I have been turned down for financing every other time and place I tried, but they did not give up until they got me approved at a rate I could live with for no money down. No other dealer I know would spend three and a half hours working with the banks on my behalf. While trying to get me financed they searched the entire area for the exact car I wanted. It took three days to locate and secure the vehicle for me, during which they gave me another brand new car as a loaner to take home for the weekend.

114,"September 27, 2011","I was pretty apprehensive going in. I knew I had a few issues on my credit and it wasn't the best but my old car wasn't in great shape anymore and I had to do something. I looked on the website and found a vehicle that I wanted at a reasonable price and did the ""online approval!"" thing, without thinking twice about it.

8:30 am that morning I had a call from Wolf Zion to set-up an appointment for the next day to see about getting that car. Impressive response time but I remained skeptical from previous dealership experiences.

We had the meeting and he told me flat out what the price would be per month, for how long and why it was in that range. (My previously mentioned credit.) It was a bit more than I was comfortable with and I told Wolf this. He went and talked with James Jackson and through the studious work of Mr. Jackson, they got the price down to the range I wanted.

This is when Austin Sumrall entered the picture. He explained to me what I was signing, what each step of the finance process was and answered my questions. Then, a about a week and a half later, I got a call from him. I was freaked out at first but when I called him back, he said that the bank had come down even more and I needed to come in and resign the papers with my new, lower monthly rate. I honestly didn't believe him until I saw it, printed on the paper for me to sign.

I can't thank these three men enough for their efforts at helping me get my car and dealing with Wolf was zero pressure and I never once felt that he was annoyed with me for questioning so much of the process and hesitating on the price until it was something I was comfortable with.",5.0

Prior to visiting Munday I attempted to buy a new car from Joe Myers Mazda- that was a TERRIBLE MISTAKE.  If you don't want to get jerked around and cheated, DO NOT GO TO JOE MYERS MAZDA!!!  Ugh- they are dishonest and incompetent.

Anyway- I went into Munday and worked with Herbert Brown, an excellent salesman who offered me a fair deal on my miata trade in(it took an hour of fighting and haggling to get a decent offer over at Joe Myers).  Herbert also made sure that I got not only the payment I wanted, but also helped with getting a great interest rate secured with the finance people.

He was wonderful, he was so knowledgeble and his personality made things very easy. Although when I originally got there I wasnt sure if I was really going to get a car, but after his help i felt like the time was right. We all kno finance plays a big part in a decision and you want to feel like you are making the decision and not the salesman. I didnt feel pressure and he worked so hard to get me in my mazda at the cost that was very reasonable. I recommend Ed to anyone that wants to purchase a car.

They took my deposit,but because they were unable to let me drive away that day, suggested to me to get a rental car until the paperwork was finalized, and they would reimbuse me my money on the rental since a I needed a car to go back and forth to work. Each day I called the saleman, it was always a different story, it was always tomorrow or later today we will have the paperwork completed. I waited a week and and half for them to complete the deal and still the same story. Talked to a supervisor of the salesman, He was very unprofessional and irriatated I had general questions about their companies sales process. Stated "" I've been on the phone 5 mins talking in circles"". That did it. I went the very next day requested my down payment and reinbusement of my rental. I was informed they would return my down payment, but would not reimbuse me my money on the rental. I took my down payment (in a personal check from the company),called a lawyer and drove down the street to Munday Mazda.

I was very happy with the people, the salesman and the quality of the store. I felt like they were glad I was their and wanted to make sure I had a car that same day. Jarrell worked with me on purchasing a 2011 Mazda 6. For any car needs in the future I will be go their and no where else.",5.0

We went for a test drive.  I joked around with him, introduced myself, my brother and then asked his name. ""Mike. Turn right here.""  After the test drive we honked at a manager and went inside.  WE sat down in his office and he said, ""There isn't much i can do to come down on the price, ma'am.  There's not many Mazda dealers that can.  There is high demand and not much supply."" I said, ""You aren't willing to do anything? Then I'll just wait for my brother to come back and we'll leave.""  Mike said, ""Well wait let me see if there is some customer cash available."" My brother returned while Mike was at the desk.  Another guy walked up and Mike came back to the office took something off his desk and handed it to the walk up. I told my brother about the conversation.  Mike came back and said, ""No there really isn't much out there.""  I whipped out my phone with my email from this dealership-- the REASON I went there and said, ""Well, I have an email from Wolf for $22,000.""  Mike said, ""Oh. Wolf?!

He asked if I was in the computer or not and I told him about the 15 minute test drive and 5 minutes in Mike's office.  He was obviously upset by how I was treated and apologized several times.  Wolf went back and forth for me as we negotiated my deal. He got me in the car I wanted, with the payments I wanted and with a LOWER apr than I'd anticipated all within in 3 hours!!  I knew what I wanted and what I wasn't going to need.

163,"May 24, 2011","This is my third vehicle that I have purchased from Jerrell.  I went to the dealership about a couple of years ago and was told that he no longer worked there.  Someone tried to help me but to no avail did I get approved. I just happened to look online at the employees at this dealership and noticed that he was back. I called him and scheduled an appointment.  I went and picked out the car that I wanted and test drove it. I filled out the application and he called me later to inform me of the documents that I needed.  I was having a difficult time initially getting financed but he assured me that everything would be fine.  I really appreciate that. I am now driving my 2011 Black Cherry Mazda 6.  Thanks to Jerrell and his team for all of their help.  He has always been friendly, considerate and kind.  I will definitely recommend Jerrell Smart and Munday Mazda to any of my family and colleagues.  Thanks again Jerrell for such an outstanding job and all of your help!!!!!!!!!",5.0
164,"May 24, 2011","I had the most amazing and stress free experience at Munday Mazda in the purchase of my new 2011 CX-9. I wanted a new car ON my birthday and Ed Walker went above and beyond to ensure my car was delivered ON my birthday. The entire experience started with me filling out an internet inquiry form the day before my birthday. I was amazed to get a call back from Ed Walker within 15 minutes of hitting submit. I informed Ed that I did not want to haggle over pricing or vehicle style, trim, color or amenities because I knew axactly what I wanted. Let me tell you, Ed went to work on my deal and within a matter of hours, the exact vehicle I wanted was set to be delivered. I informed Ed that I wanted to take delivery ON my birthday. Guess what? by mid day on my birthday Ed called to tell me my car would be serviced and delivered as I requested. Ed personally delivered my car to me - cleaned and absolutely perfect and ready to go. I was so elated to get it. He spent additional time going over the vehicle options, warranty, service (maintenance) roadside assistance information...you name it Ed covered it. I felt like a CX-9 expert when he left. He followed up with me the next day to ensure I was satisfied with my experience at Munday Mazda - I had nothing but praise for him. Ed Walker and Munday Mazda definitely ensured I had the best birthday ever! Thanks again, Ed Walker- you are simply the best!!!",5.0
