0,"April 17, 2020","We saw the listing for a BMW Z8 roadster online and placed an inquiry on the vehicle. Almost immediately we got responses to our questions. Max Malikov was the salesman we worked with and he was great. He accommodated our request for compliance with the COVID19 best practices during our initial inspection and during the second inspection and purchase. He made the process seamless. Max and his manager were straight forward during the whole process.

Thank you Max

1,"April 24, 2019",Mark the salesman was great.  They delivered the new car and the only glitch was that the clock on the dash is not working.  Mark has offered to pick it up but we are not that worried about it now ,4.4
2,"March 05, 2018",Mark Meyerson has been extremely thorough and competent throughout- friendly and helpful.  He's handled this deal with alacrity which should be emulated by all other car dealers.  We arranged that I purchased a slightly used RR Dawn until my 2018 model arrives in a few months.,4.8
3,"December 21, 2017","Mark and the entire staff made our visit and purchase one of the most relaxing and stress free sale I have ever experienced at a Dealership. I especially appreciated the strait talk, firm handshake and none of the BS I get at other places. Thanks again Mark. We will be back!",5.0
4,"November 21, 2017","Even though the dealership had a large inventory, they didn't have the color combo I wanted. 
Mark scoured the Country to find the exact Car I wanted. From there he made the whole transaction very pleasant.

16,"March 11, 2017","I gave this dealership 5 Stars because it was the best car buying experience I've ever had! 

Like Bentley, which I consider the best car in the world, Jim Fraser and Post Oak Motor Cars are excellent! He went the whole nine yards for me and the dealership was there behind him 1,000%! 

What a wonderful experience! Thank you for making my day, Jim , and Post Oak Motor Car/Bentley!!!!",5.0

18,"February 26, 2017","I bought a Bentley convertible off the showroom floor.  The sales manager was good at sales and bragged about how many cars he was moving.  I got a good deal on the sale and was happy until I encountered their ""service"" department.  I had a few broken seat controls and my gas tank took over 20 minutes to fill.  So first I dropped the car off thinking  a minor matter on a brand new Bentley would be fixed.  I was wrong!  I had car picked up and got an appointment a month later.  My car was not brought in with a flat but after a week they fixed the fuel filler, still had not gotten the minor parts that came with my new car, and turned it over with a ""slow leak.""  By the time I got home it was flat.  I left multiple messages for help and not one was returned.  In fact, the service manager was totally unfamiliar with the car because he came from the oil and gas business and was a friend of the general manager.  This is the sorriest service department I have ever encountered.  If you buy a car att Post Iak Motors I hope you can get it serviced elsewhere.",1.6

23,"December 09, 2016","I worked with both Jeff and Mark, and being from Wisconsin, I wasn't too sure about doing a transaction of this size with someone this far away. I purchased a 3 year old Bentley GTC, that was exactly as described. The communication, detail, was just as what I would expect from sales professionals. They did everything they said they would do and more. They handled the shipping and everything.No worries here. Thanks!",5.0

25,"November 08, 2016","My business partner has happily purchased many cars from POMC, so no question where to go for my first Bentley.  I have purchased many cars over the years and this was extremely easy and smooth thanks to Jeff Synder and Mark Meyerson.   No pressure, headaches or last minute surprises like most dealers, fair price and awesome service.   I would highly recommend this dealer and Jeff/Mark for people not wanting to deal with high pressure sales people or dealers.  Five Stars!",5.0
26,"November 04, 2016",I have purchased many cars in my life time.  Purchasing my first Bentley was extremely easy thanks to my salesman Mark Meyerson.    I have to admit looking at a Bentley was intimidating.  I had no idea what to expect.  Buying any car can be extremely stressful but Mark made it stress free.  No pressure like most dealers.   I would highly recommend this dealer and Mark for people not wanting to deal with high pressure sales people or dealers.   Five Stars!,5.0
27,"October 27, 2016","Bought a 2014 low mileage Bentley Continental gt from Post, over the phone, sight unseen.....With me located in Canada. My conversations with Mike Meyerson,  his manner,  concern for my interests as well as Post's, gave me sufficient confidence to complete the purchase. When the car arrived it was as per Mike's description. The purchase was as stress free as could be under the circumstances and ultimately my confidence in Mark was well placed. Thank you Mark and Post. ",4.8
28,"October 19, 2016","Mark was excellent in helping us pick out our new car.  We purchased a used car, which needed some minor work. Mark was keeping us up to date on what was going on and when it was going to be ready. Couldn't be happier with our experience. Thanks, Mark!",5.0
29,"October 19, 2016","We came to the dealership to trade in our older Bentley for a newer model. We met Mark who showed us several used Bentleys.  Mark was straight forward - honest and most importantly talked to my wife as well as to me.  Since the car was for my wife, it was a great selling point that Mark took the time to address her questions. Mark made the whole buying experience easy and took care of the minor issues that needed to be addressed on our Bentley.  Will definitely go back to Mark in the future.  ",5.0
30,"October 14, 2016","Met Mark Meyerson the first time on a Sat. morning in the dealership. We sat for almost 2 hours building ""on line"" a 2017 Flying Spur S.. The process was exciting and informative while we both learned  about this new model & its options. Mark was transparent when he didn't know the answer but was diligent to seek the answer. During the months that followed Mark communicated with me regarding the progress of my vehicle. The car arrived early, the paperwork was prepared and the tutorial session regarding the operations of the car was in-lighting. It did rain while I was about to drive out of the dealership but I can't say Mark is that good to have held back the rain. Run by and check out the beauties on the showroom floor, plus ask for Mark. Tell him New Adventure said hello.",5.0
31,"October 10, 2016","  Mark Meyerson of this dealership is a courteous, informative salesman who answers questions fully and reliably.

36,"September 27, 2016","Our salesman, Mark Meyerson, was as sincere a salesman with whom I  have had the pleasure of dealing.  The Post Oak Bentley dealership has the most variety and more Bentley automobiles than any other dealership in Texas.  They also offer the Rolls Royce.  We wanted a Bentley.  Although a small store the dealership is clean and friendly.  They have everything to offer a customer for a relaxing sales experience.  If you are considering a Bentley,  visit Mark Meyerson.  All of their sales staff are good.",4.8
37,"September 27, 2016",We dealt with Mark Meyerson who made buying our 2011 Bentley GTC a very easy experience. When we arrived to pick up our vehicle everything was ready for us to sign; it took no more than 20 minutes for us to trade in our 2007 Bentley and drive off with our 2011. Mr. Meyerson has followed up several times to ensure that we were completely satisfied with our beautiful new GTC.,5.0

39,"August 13, 2016","Please do your research before you buy a car or anything from this dealership , the service is horrendous, the salesman has bad breath and very rude , after they have your money you might as well drive to Austin or another city to get your service done",1.4
40,"July 20, 2016","They just don't come any better than Jeff Snyder at Post Oak Motor Cars. He has all the necessary knowledge, experience, and expertise about his products. But most importantly - it is abundantly clear that he truly does love what he's doing, and that he sincerely cares about his clients and is passionate in his desire to earn their confidence. 

Jeff did whatever it took to earn my business when I purchased my Rolls Royce Wraith. I trust him, I like him, and I highly recommend him.",5.0
41,"May 24, 2016","Jeff Snyder's past  experience in selling luxury vehicles was reflected in my experience with him at  this  dealership. Many car salesmen seem pushy and impersonal. Jeff exhibited a genuine interest in getting me into the Bentley that would best suit my particular interest. Initially I thought that a used Bentley would be suitable; however, after driving a new V8 S Convertible, I felt that this was my best option. He gave me the best deal up front, there was no need for further negotiating, and I drove off with my dream car. And what a car it is!",5.0
42,"May 19, 2016","Jeff Snyder is highly experienced in providing quality customer care, He went above and beyond to insure purchasing my Bentley was an outstanding experience... I have recommended Jeff to all of my Physician colleagues, and friends for purchasing their next Bentley or Rolls Royce or any high end vehicles. ",5.0
43,"May 19, 2016","Jeff is very professional and has priced the car reasonably or ""priced to sell,"" as he said. He also took care of a few minor issues in the form of ""We Owe"". Our experience with Jeff was excellent. Highly recommended to every future buyer!",5.0
