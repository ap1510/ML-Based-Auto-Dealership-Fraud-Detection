0,"April 07, 2019","Lisa and Rock.....ROCK!!!!
My wife wanted out of her truck and into a nice sedan.
I have never (35 years of car buying) had anyone put forth the effort to make this such a non stressful event!
We have bought the last 3 vehicles fro Benny Boyd (different location) and as long as Rock and Lisa are there we will never buy from anywhere else.
Everything was done over the phone and the transaction went smoothly and very quickly!
I will recommend these guys to everyone I know looking for a straight deal on a vehicle.
Thanks yâ€™all, you made my life a little easier.

1,"April 04, 2019",The customer service that Lisa and Rock provided was top-notch.  They worked quickly to find the truck we wanted at an affordable price.  They went above and beyond to ensure we were happy with our purchase.  Best car buying experience ever!!,5.0
2,"February 23, 2019","The salesperson at Benny Boyd worked with us to get the truck we wanted at the price that made sense. It was a relief to work with someone rather than some mult-tiered robotic sales process. I would definitely work with the Benny Boyd again on my next purchase.

3,"September 26, 2016","What a nice experience. Everything done online and maybe 2 phone calls. They had all the paperwork ready for the purchase all we needed to do was take the truck for a test drive. Out the door in less than 2 hours with the test drive. Which by the way I could have driven to Kansas, Kurtis just let us drive came back when we were ready. Very nice. No pressure. Very friendly and open. ",5.0
4,"May 27, 2016",This was truly the easiest car buying experience of my life!  I did my homework before and I knew what other Jeep Wranglers cost.  The first price quoted well below market value.  Jeremy Green made the negotiations smooth and easy.  I am so grateful and will be a customer for life!,5.0
5,"March 29, 2014",Worst service and overall experience.  False advertising.  Would never recommend to anyone ever.  Buy here pay here is a home.  Everyone approved is a joke.,1.0
