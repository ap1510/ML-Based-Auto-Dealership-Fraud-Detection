2,"March 01, 2020","Back in January, I went in here to get a full service done on my vehicle, including new brakes, a new battery, and repairs to the alternator. Aside from the fact that they had the resources to find an old invoice from 2019 but couldn't find it anyway (I had to provide it myself), there were no real issues.
Then, a month later, I got my vehicle inspected and found out that there was a problem with my dashboard, most likely caused by the fact that my battery had been recently replaced. I returned here and the agent told me that they could fix it as long as I left my car with them for a few hours. I left it there and when I returned, I got my car back and the agent quoted me the price. I was a little confused, and pointed out that this issue with the dashboard didn't exist before they replaced my battery a month prior, and asked where the ethical justification was for them to break my car, and then charge me to get it fixed. Do you know what the agent said? She said, ""We have to compensate our technicians."" I started getting annoyed by this and asked her the question again, and she just gave me the exact same answer and then tried to change the subject. Of course, I couldn't refuse to pay them at this point because the work was already done, so I just paid and left.

Yeah, these people are scammers.",1.6
3,"February 25, 2020","BUYER BEWARE!!!

We bought a used SUV from them in Feb 2019. We went back the next day for some paperwork and the thermostat went out. They are not knowledgeable about BMW’s and tried to say that it was the windshield wiper fluid. When we pointed out that it WAS the thermostat, they said they would fix it and had my vehicle about 3 weeks. It ran fine for a few weeks and then it went out again because it was put in wrong. We requested that they have it properly fixed by a certified technician. They (Beau) refused. 
Long story short, they have “fixed it” 7 times, (they have had it on their shop more in this past year than I have had it in my possession) I have had it towed to their dealership twice, once was after picking it up and driving it for 4 miles. The last time I had it towed in, they claim that they finally took it to a BMW certified mechanic. When they drove it after the repair to make sure it was working, the thermostat went out again and they blew the fan. They called us to let us know and demanded that we pay $1300 to fix what THEY broke. We told them that they need to fix it, not us.
They picked up the loaner from my home and have left me stranded. 
We have contacted our lawyer and they are refusing to respond.

I just want my money back and my belongings that were in the loaner that they took off my property without my consent.

BUYER BEWARE!!!!",1.0
4,"January 12, 2020","I wished I read other reviews before walking in here.

Why you dont want to buy from here?  They have a ""we dont need"" you attitude and dont care about pissing you off.

We knew the exact car we wanted and called around.  Driving to Houston or Dallas would have saved us $1500.  Called sales person here and forward other dealers invoice to see if they would match, they said ""YES"", told me to drive in.  We drove in 40 mins from our house.  

(""1st error"")
When we got there, he sales person told me the price $1500 more.  Apparently the does not understand ""we will match"" concept.  Left decided to go to Dallas, but next day wanted to see if they could meet us in the middle to save us time.  They agreed.  Come in 2nd time to pick up car, quick and easy right... NO!!!

(""2nd error"")
When we got the paperwork, the numbers did not look right.  They tried to sneak in an extra $2,600.  They spent over 2 hours trying to convince me the numbers were right, even brought in a 2nd finance person.  On the invoice, they did not itemize what we were charged with.  
After 2 hours, they were pushing our patience and we decided to leave.  They stopped us and went to the back, came back and said, sorry, we forgot to apply your 2K rebate.  Ok, whatever, sat back down, once again, numbers did not add up.  Again, pushed our patience.  

(""3rd error"")
This time the tried to sneak in a $600 RB-Mazda rewards club membership we NEVER asked for or was even told about.  Finally over right?  NO!  

4th ""error""
We purchased extended warantee, when we got the paperwork, it said $100 deductible.  We told them, you never told us about that, now I'm really pissed.  The corrected it, finance lady even initialized it and put $0.
When she printed a copy, (original on ledger paper) she left out the detail part stating $0.  We had to came back the next day to ask her for the top part.  I'm sure it was 'accidental'.  But I told my wife that night, I know they going to put in the system with $100.

5th ""error""
We finally got our warantee cards in the mail, it clearly shows $100 deductible.  I've email communicate with a Store GM and a finance person, both ignored me after initial replay saying they would look into it.

I've decided its not worth the hassle and have told all my family and friends to make the drive to San Marcos or surrounding cities if they must buy a Mazda.  I personally will not anymore.  

When we walked in after agreeing on the price, we were not treated well.  It was very mater of fact transaction with no customer courtesy.  If a business is unhappy about a transaction, they can simply say ""no deal"".  RB did not.  They wanted to make us miserable, the entire staff from finance to sales as you can see they were clumping together and talking about us, even our own sales person.  

They told us while we were there they were the first Mazda dealership in US.  I dont know if its true, but they have an arrogance about themselves because they own Austin and have a monopoly.  You WILL get better customer service and price in surrounding cities.  Dont waste your time here.  Our experience was miserable.

My family will stick with Honda and Toyota.  This was a big mistake we wont make again.  I do plan on sending my experience to HQ.  I am in disbelief in this day and age of internet reviews that they would do something like this.  Arrogance.  As stated, we will never buy Mazda again!

Also, they are still on 100% paper.  My experience with Honda, Toyota, Nissan and Dodge is they are all on mostly xxx software systems to make the transaction smoother and more TRANSPARENT to the customer, harder to sneak stuff in.  They would rather fight you instead of do the right thing.

13,"January 08, 2018","I wasn't planning on getting a new Mazda.  But, when I just didn't see the value in an Escape or a Santa Fe Sport for the cost of each, I turned my attention to the new CX-5.  From initial web form contact, Craig and Roger Beasley Central team made the whole process very easy.  He was available and responsive when I needed him.  He helped me find the right car, gave me all of the details I needed to make a decision, and didn't ask me to accommodate or compromise on anything.  No pushing, no pressure.  Just ready to assist when I asked.  The finance team got me the deal I wanted on my lease, and I didn't have to spend more than an hour at the dealership before we (and a weary toddler) were out the door and on our way home with our 2017 Soul Red Crystal CX-5.  It was the best buying experience I've had in a long time, and I recommend Roger Beasley Mazda Central for that alone.  I hope the ownership and service experience maintains that standard for the next 3 years, and I'll be a happy repeat customer as a result.",5.0

22,"February 04, 2017",I talked to Ann about checking out a Mazda 3 and she set me up with Edwin. I was blown away because he knew everything about all the vehicles on the lot. I didn't feel any sort of pressure. It was very nice to be taken seriously. First new car purchase I've ever made and it was a great one. They worked with me on financing and even got my new car by trading with another dealership.,5.0
23,"December 31, 2016","I took my 2014 Mazda 3 in for several recall notices. I was treated in a friendly and professional manner. They found 3 recall issues and fixed them (not happy that many issues potentially existed, glad they were addressed).

BUT.

I was also informed that my car had about $1000 in potential repairs and services, on top of the $1000 recall fixes (the latter covered by Mazda). How does a 2014 vehicle have $1000 repair needs? I felt like they were trying to milk me for anything they could since I was there. The most notable were as follows: 

1) they wanted to change my oil for $40-$50 when I had full synthetic with thousands of miles left before a change. Refused. 

2) they wanted to replace my battery on a 2 year old car, which I refused initially. I had to leave the car in the shop for the recall repairs, so when they called me  to let me know this was done, they told me they had to jump my car because it wouldn't start for them. I could really only go on that so I conceded to the battery replacement & expense, which still felt very bizarre to me. I went in, got my car, paid the battery expense, and left. Next morning, my car was still slow to respond to my key fob, unlocking my door and then starting. This said to me it was a fob-related issue, something the dealership didn't recognize (weirdly considering how it was like every other aspect of my car was in ""dire"" need of expensive services). That honestly pissed me off to realize I bought a new battery at the high dealership price, only to know it was a fob issue they encountered.

I honestly don't trust to go in to this dealership for services without them trying to swindle me. I believe there is an electrical issue related to my emergency brake light now, but I'm going to someone else to look at it because I absolutely don't trust the dealership nor appreciate the prices.",2.8

25,"October 01, 2016","I bought a 2016 CX 5 in December. Several weeks ago the horn quite working. Today I brought it in for the service department to figure this out. They tell me that a fuse was burnt out but then there were other electrical issues that would require more analysis and I would need to drop it off. Also the latch that releases one of the rear seats quite working as well. I will not buy another Mazda product! I had two Toyota Camrys and they both went over 200,000 and never had any such problems especially with such low mileage. At one point I asked the service representative to let speak to his manager. He never let me speak to a manager. Accused me of speaking to him in a disrespectful manner. The Mazda CX 5 is a product that needs to be disrespected!",1.0

28,"September 22, 2016","They took great care of me.  I found a Chevy Equinox that I liked online and came to see it.  Upon them pulling the car around the key jammed in the ignition.  They later realized it was tagged with the wrong VIN number.  Because the wrong VIN was listed, that is why the wrong key was matched to the car and it jammed when doing so.  We decided to move forward and get the numbers game worked up while they worked on fixing the ignition issue.  They were very honorable in price matching what was online, despite the car should've clearly been listed higher.

I have always had a head butting experience in buying vehicles and this was such a pleasure.  Al and Rusty met every hurdle and helped get my car ready.  Including some additional cosmetic touches and even detailing it.  Even when it couldn't be finished on the spot, they gave us a loaner vehicle.

60,"August 31, 2013","My wife and I just finished working a deal, and purchasing a Mazda 6 Grand Touring. I would rate the overall experience poor at best. What started out as an excellence experience ended with my wife feeling terrible. We dealt primarily with three people the at the Roger Beasley Mazda Killeen. The first was our sales consultant Max Garbacz; he was very personable and knowledgeable about the car.  He was very patient and listened to what we wanted.  We dealt with one of the managers second, but do not recall his name. He was professional, but was attentive about getting us a great financing rate,  however, he was to very attentive to the mileage on the car or the other details regarding the car.  We felt that he not honest at first about the pricing or how many mile were actually on the car.  Once we noted that fact with him, he straightened his approach.  Once the loan rate was achieved, we began to deal with the third and final associate and I believe his name was Brian Calderon and he introduced himself as the Finance Manager.  The experience we had with him was very poor and feel that he was a disservice to the Mazda team. He was attempting to rush my wife through the signing of the paperwork and got visibly impatient that she wanted to actually read what she was signing.  We both were asking questions about the ""extra"" warranty packages since they were a little confusing. We had concerns that not only with accepting one of these would bring our grand total up another $3000 plus the total financed that we had originally settled on. We were expressing our concern that it seemed we would be paying for the Beasley Loyalty package twice since it showed that it was included in the total cost of the package and we had already been shown that we were paying for  it in the total we had originally agreed on.  His tone got rude and even raised his voice towards us while trying to explain where we were concerned.  We had another question about when the mileage for the warranty began since we were actually purchasing a vehicle that is ""new""/2014, but already had close to 1000 miles.  He was not sure on the answer and got rude/loud with us again, he placed a call to ask. Once he received that answer, he again answered us in the rude tone and threw his phone back down on the desk which was very unprofessional.  The experience that we received in his office was very close to causing my wife and I to leave without purchasing from this dealership.  We would appreciate an apology in person when we come to pick up the car, since the intent was to gather information on our purchase choice in order to make an informed decision.  We came into the dealership with what we believed was plenty of time. We did not expect to be there over three hours in order to make a purchase. We came in with everything that we need or wanted and the only thing that was required as far as service was financing.  We did not have to purchase here, but chose to since we had a good experience with Max the day prior. Please feel free to contact me at the contact information you have on file.

65,"February 07, 2012",Used car manager was very rude having treated with the utmost disgusting way having blamed me and refusing to give me back $15 on gas on a used car I was gonna take to the mechanic to get checked having it only die on the road and havign me to spend 3 hours in rush hour traffic only to give back the key of the car and being blamed and disrespected by the used car manager especially threatening me he'd charge me for the towing guy to tow the car that broke down cause of bad defects.   DO NOT buy from this place cause they care nothing else but there money and could give a chit treating you with respect only to steal your money and threaten you with there cars dying cause of defects.  ,1.0
66,"September 23, 2011","I had a very positive experience in my quest to purchase a car from this store. I dealt with Bubba Bashaw. He was very patient and extremely straight forward to deal with. When it came time to making a decision, I told him what price I wanted (based on quotes I got from another dealer). He was able to match the best offer, but he did not have the model and specs I wanted. He did not waste time trying to up sell me another product and suggested it would be in my best interest to take the offer from the other dealer. What a refreshing breath of honesty!
I hope I will get the opportunity to use Bubba's services in the future.",5.0
67,"August 02, 2010","Get it in writing!

Got a good verbal quote, so was willing to drive several hours to this dealership, who had in stock what I wanted.  Specifically asked on the phone if this ""today only"" price was with the 0% financing Mazda offered, and was told ""yes.""  After arriving, the internet salesman told me the same price, but that it was ""cash only,"" and the price with 0% was $1,000 more.  When I protested, was told ""there must have been some mis-communication.""  Showed him the invoice numbers from edmunds.com, and was told they were wrong.  Walked out.

This is the only dealership I know that when you call, a message states that they record conversations for ""training purposes.""  Probably used in lawsuits.

Will not deal with these horse traders (camel traders?) again unless I have it iron clad from the beginning.  Don't know how they sleep at night with all the lying they probably have to do.",1.5
68,"March 01, 2010",GEORGETOWN LOCATION - Make sure these people show you your approval before wasting your time.  I personally believe they NEVER had an approval and all my personal info was given to this dealership.  I worked with these people for over a week and made a couple of trips to their dealership then all of a sudden a bank they had an approval for turned the deal down.  I've been buying cars for 10 yrs and I am not a new comer to this.  I will never do business with this dealership again.  Total waste of time!,2.0
69,"June 29, 2009","My daughter was in the market for a Mazda 3, and the model she wanted was available at Roger Beasley Central, so we went to take a look. The salesman assigned to us was Herb Griffith. He told us brusquely that there was another family ahead of us and that we should wait. After 10 minutes, he came by and told us to go outside and take a look at the car in the parking lot. Since the car was locked, we could only look at it from the outside, and after a few minutes, we went back into the showroom and waited. After another 10 minutes, Griffith came by again and asked if we wanted to test-drive the car. We said we did, so he said he would get the keys, and asked us to go wait by the car. We waited in the 90 degree heat for about 15 minutes next to the car. When Griffith did not show up, we went back inside the showroom and found him sitting at his desk, chatting with another customer. He looked up at us briefly, and then ignored us as he went back to whatever he was doing. We were sufficiently fed-up by that time that we just left. 

While I understand that salesmen can be busy, it is unprofessional for the salesman to make us wait in the heat for 15 minutes, and it was bad manners on his part to not even acknowledge our presence when we went back inside, let alone apologize for his poor service. 

I am very disappointed with the service at Roger Beasley. I will not buy a car there if I can help it, and I intend to warn all my friends and colleagues away from this place. ",1.0
70,"June 06, 2006","3 Months after I bought a used vehicle the title and registeration still wasn't transferred to the Lienholder and I, no explanation was given regarding the delay.  I was told that the paperwork will be there on a certain day, but when I arrived no one knew what I was talking about. I was then referred to the lot across the street where no one was there to assist me but a maintance worker. I waited for 15-20 minutes during my lunch hour with no one coming to assist me. I had the worker page my salesperson, who told me the paperwork, which was 3 months late, still wasn't there, he told me ""I came to early"". I voiced my displeasure about waiting for so long and then told me ""what can I say you came to early"" not one sorry or thanks for your patience or anything.  He calls me a hour later and left a voice message (I didn't answer on purpose) to tell me the paperwork arrived, with no ""sorry"" or ""thank you for your patience"".  Then he calls my wife and she voices her displeasure regarding the entire situation and all he tells her is ""the paperwork is here"" with an attitude.  You can easily tell that I WILL NOT buy a vehicle from Roger Beasley ever again.",2.0
71,"May 31, 2006","We went over the miles on our lease and was told my the salesman that they would add the overage to the price of the car (was told 3,500 actually turned out to be 2,600) and bought gap insurance to cover the difference in case the car was totalled.  Imagine my surprise when I get a bill from mitsubishi says that I owed 2,800.  I have gone to teh dealership and called several times to no avail.  I am now looking at getting a lawyer as I purchased the car over a month ago and they are charging me interest and its on my credit report, would I buy a  car from there ever again?  Nope",2.0
72,"November 21, 2004","At Roger Beasley Mazda South, a salesman tried to use some ridiculous sales technique to get us to sign unofficial paperwork agreeing to buy a car, before we had even agreed on a price! When my husband and I refused to sign, he got pushy about it, and finally went to talk to his manager, leaving us alone in his office for thirty minutes until we finally left. The sales staff, especially the manager, came off completely unprofessional. I work in car sales, and it disgusted me how little respect this dealership had for their customers.",1.3
73,"August 14, 2004","This is the first time I've ever purchased a car. I went to the dealership alone but just in case I parked my car far away and left my checkbook in it. Roger Beasley was a great experience but it was probably made easier by a few factors: I purchased a car that I could afford (Mazda3), I paid for the car in full from savings, and I was not obsessed with getting the rock bottom best deal. Capitalism is give and take, take and give.Josh Oberg did a superb job in every aspect and in each phase of the purchase experience. After the test drive, he did actually quote me for the full price of the car. D'oh. I told him what I was willing to pay ""out the door""  in order to buy the car TODAY and he did let me buy the car. The price I paid for the car was typical for this car and there's hardly any markup on a Mazda3 anyway.It's a solid car and everyone at the dealership was pretty sharp. If you go in being fanatical about getting the very best deal in the world, you may not have a good time. If you are fanatical like that, buy a car you can easily afford and/or buy an awesome car that's an awesome value: like a Mazda3. :-)",5.0
74,"June 14, 2004","This dealership has the WORST costumer service. They are nice but  they are so un-professional. They would put in hidden charges and did not tell you about it. They did not tell me the right payment procedure and I ended up paying $200 more than what was agrred. They owed me  $300 and kept saying that they would write me a check for it but it took them months to do so and when I finally went there to pick up the check, I was told that they had not made the check request and told me to come back a few days later.  I just went there today to pick up the check and they made me wait for 2 hours , only to tell me that the check was mailed to me.From the description above, I think it is clear on how bad their service is and soo  unprofessional. I would not recommend this dealership to anybody, The card is great but not the dealer.",1.8
