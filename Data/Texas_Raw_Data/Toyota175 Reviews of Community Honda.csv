0,"June 06, 2020","When I arrived at Community Honda for my car service, Carlos was the service man that assisted me. He even remembered me from when I had last come in for service.  He told me about how long it would take and sure enough he came and got me when car was ready within the two hours as he told me. Carlos is very helpful, knowledgeable, kind and courteous. That makes customers feel good when the serviceman remembers them. It makes you want to go back and it gives you a good feeling about the service. I would say Carlos is truly an asset to Community Honda.",5.0

9,"January 31, 2020","Please read this:
On September 28 2019 Gerald Bailey sold my wife (I was not there) a 2012 Cadillac SRX for 16000 cash. I thought this was high but the check was already signed and the deal was done. Fast forward to today I have a different dealer tell me they won‚Äôt buy it nor will any other dealership due to a damage report, we can only trade it in. We were, my wife was never told about a damage report nor given a carfax. Now I have a manger of Community Honda telling me they don‚Äôt have to disclose a carfax report, I thought that was bs, but unfortunately for us, he is right. We never knew this. We are now stuck with a vehicle that we paid 16k cash for that will get no where close to that, due to the damage report. Please, if you are reading this, ask for a carfax report. I never knew how important it was until now. That being said, do NOT purchase from this dealership. What has been done here is beyond me, and the manger Ever, I believe was his name was absolutely no help. Told me he did not have to disclose the information cause it could be ‚Äúfalse‚Äù and had a complete Is what it Is demeanor. I will never sure business with them again, I hope you don‚Äôt and hope someone is able to help me legally with this situation, cause this seems so wrong and illegal. Thanks for reading our issue with Community Honda.",1.0

16,"November 17, 2019","We had visited several other dealerships in the area,  but none of them were as friendly or accommodating as this dealership. At Community Honda we had, from the very beginning, an appointment with our salesman. From there, we got confirmations, phone calls, and messages checking to see if we needed anything. Our sales person personally called me to introduce himself. Kamerin was most informed about the car we were interested in. He walked us through the process of trading our car and purchasing our Honda CR-V. It was all worth the forty mile drive!",5.0

27,"July 31, 2019","I used to laugh at the Honda commercial slogan, ‚ÄúThe Car That Sells Itself‚Äù , however, last year I bought new a 2018 Honda Accord Hybrid Touring edition.

I took my car for routine maintenance over at Community Honda, the do a fabulous job and take well care of my car. I also want to acknowledge my service rep James Chesser, this guy deserves a raise and promotion, I‚Äôve never seen a harder working individual who takes personal interest in both myself and my car, he treats my car as if it was his own and he does a spectacular job, he won‚Äôt leave work until the job is done well, even if he has to stay late on a weekend. James makes my visit to the dealership most pleasant, I even look forward to going there. I can‚Äôt wait until the next revision of the Accord Hybrid comes out so I can trade up.

My car has been at my local dealer for 7 hours now trying to resolve this issue. At least a dozen phone calls have fallen on deaf ears at Community Honda.

My sales team of Nicole, Brandon, and Shane were patient and helpful while not being over bearing or pushy.  The finance guy Terry was very knowledgeable and willing to answer all of my questions while never making me feel rushed.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was due to the detailing of the car.  While it appeared clean at first glance, the inside of the doors jams still had some dust from the car sitting on the lot.  While not a deal breaker, and not the fault of the sales/finance teams, it still left me a little underwhelmed.  I would certainly recommend this dealership to others!  ",4.6

51,"July 05, 2019","Your sales staff is very busy so getting the return email from a different person asking what more you could do to sell the vehicle was critical to getting a deal with me, because Nissan was texting as well.  Having to wait 2 hours to meet with the financial analyst after making an appointment was a bit much.  I know that end-of-June/July is a very busy time. Maybe putting a down payment to hold the vehicle to kickoff cleaning/inspection with an actual financial appointment would be better. We left after closing time and the car did not have its final inspection nor cleaning, so had to return for both inspection and license plate.  Luckily, I live only 15 miles away!!!  Having a dealership near Teurling's High School was a big reason why we chose a Honda plus Elly who is only 16 said the safety features made her feel really safe and its easy/comfortable to drive, so after the test drive, she said to scratch all other vehicles off the list!!! Thank You for making my girl so happy.  Putting the RED bow on the vehicle with a picture and teaching her all the features prior to leaving was a very special moment for our family.",4.8

167,"July 30, 2014","When I had called, I was connected to Shana Childress, who had faked it like she was the sales representative that I would be meeting at the dealership. She had even sent an e-mail to me (which I still have a copy of), as a reminder of the appointment that I had set to meet her at the Community Honda dealership in Baytown (she had even typed in the e-mail that she had set aside some time to meet me, and make sure that my shopping experience was ""fast, fun, and friendly""). When I had got there for the appointment, I was informed by Joy/Manager that Shana did not work there, that she was at their ""central office"" and only took calls, and that another gentleman would be helping me. Travis/Salesman was friendly and helpful. However, he kept going back and forth between me (I was seated in one office), and Joy/Manager (at her office), till a final price was negotiated to (I had a printed quote from another dealership in the Houston area, that was lower than what they had quoted. I had every right to hold them to their initial ""promise"" of matching/beating another dealership's price.) After the price was agreed upon, when the person at the financing department brought the Sales deed to me, it had been increased by a whole $1000! I refused to proceed! The person at the financing department asked me to show him the price that was agreed upon, which Travis had written on the paper, that I still have. He looked at it, and stated that ""they have been doing this!"" and left the office. Joy/Manager came back and told me that she could not sell it to me at the price that was agreed upon, and that if I wanted, I could buy the car at the price that was on the Sales deed! How fraudulent! She thought that I would not pay attention to the numbers and would have blindly signed the deed! After 2-3 hours, and having agreed on a price, she had it changed, thinking that I would not notice, or not wanting to waste the time that I had spent, give-in and buy the car for the price that she had increased it to. I left! 
Stay away from this dealership! Do not even call them! They are deceptive and fraudulent! Like the previous reviewer has mentioned, it is clear that they will do anything to try to get you to their dealership, and if you are not cautious once you are there, they will try to defraud you.",1.2
168,"July 11, 2014","These guys are a big fraud and use cheap sales tactics to cheat customers.  I had the worst experience in my life at a car dealership!  I found a deal listed on their website on 7/10/14.  It was for a used Honda accord SE car (22K miles) for 16,000.  Not any extraordinary bargain deal but a reasonable one (I ended up finding a better deal any way for the same model and trim level).  I called the number listed on their website at around 4:30 PM on 7/10/2014.  A lady named Sherry from their internet sales department picked up.  I asked her if this car was in stock and gave her the stock #.  She looked for a few mins and then told me that the car is still in stock and asked me if I would like to come see it.  When I expressed that I would like to come see it today, she gave me an appointment for 6:00 PM and told me to go see Sergio or Kevin, her ‚ÄúInternet Sales Managers‚Äù.  I drove for 1 hr and 15 mins, all the way from Stafford, TX to their dealership in Baytown, TX.  I got there exactly at 6:00 PM.  When I entered the dealership, nobody came to greet me.  A couple of sales guys looked at me but nobody greeted me or asked me if I needed help (a common courtesy shown at most dealerships).  Since, I had left for the dealership right after coming home from work, I was dressed in business casual and did not look like a bum at all.  So I found no reason for them to behave in a rude manner like that towards a serious buyer.  Anyways, I looked around for a bit and spotted the front desk.  I walked up there and told the lady sitting up there that I am here to see Sergio or Kevin and that I had an appointment for 6:00 PM.   Instead of responding to me, she told me to hold on a second and went on to answer her phone.  When she was done with her phone call, she announced Sergio‚Äôs name on the intercom.  A few mins later, Sergio walked up to me and introduced himself.  I introduced myself and told him that I had talked to Sherry in the sales dept. and that I am here to see the 2011 Honda Accord SE.  He mentioned that he has gotten my file from Sherry and took me to his office.  Then he stepped out for a few min and then came back with a bunch of papers (supposedly my file).  Then he proceeded to tell me that they don‚Äôt have the car in stock and its been sold.  So I asked him when was it sold and he told me that it was sold on Monday night (7/7/2014). 4 freaking days ago!  I told him that I called about an hour and half before coming and I was told that this car was in stock and you are telling me that it was sold 4 days ago.  I told him that this xxxxxxxx and that they are using these cheap tactics to lure customers in and then rip them off.  He tried to make me look at other cars but I told him that I drove 1 hr and 15 mins to see this car and if they don‚Äôt have it in stock, I am not even talking about anything else.  He still said that he doesn‚Äôt have the car in stock so I stormed out of the dealership and went home.  Upon reaching home, I checked their website again and the car was still shown on their website with the same price tag.  Today (at the time of writing this review), I checked their website and the car is still there.  I also asked my friend to call them and ask them about the car and they told him as well that the car was in stock and he should come and test drive it.  These guys are fraud, untrustworthy, and dishonest people.  They will tell you lies to get you in their dealership and then try to rip you off by telling more lies.  A customer with not much experience will easily fall into their trap.  I would suggest to avoid buying from them altogether despite how enticing of a deal they present.  That is the only way they will learn to quit their fraud ways and do business honestly.",1.0

173,"July 06, 2011","The experience I had here was great. Eddie Bourgeois was an AWESOME salesman! He was friendly, funny, professional, knowledgeable and very helpful! Not to mention patient! When I came in from looking at the used cars on the lot, I said to him, ""I don't think you have anything in my price range"" and he said ""I bet I do!"".  And he did! He found the perfect car for me! And Sergio Gonzalez went above and beyond to get me a great interest rate on my financing.  It was a great experience and I would definitely recommend this dealer to everyone I know!",5.0
174,"February 02, 2011","When my husband & I stoppped Baytown Honda/Community Honda it was the end of a long weekend looking for a used van.  Everyone there was so friendly even though they did not have what we wanted on the lot.  However, there was a used van in the service department getting ready for the lot.  To my surprise they let us go back a view the van.  It was exactly what we wanted.  I went back a few days later to test drive the van & made an offer.  The sales team was great to work with and they handled all the paperwork; right down to put the tags on the vehicle.  I bought a used vehicle but they made me feel like I spent millions.  Thank You Community Honda !!!  Michele Crosson",5.0
