0,"March 31, 2018",I want to give a big thank you to Cody Jones and Land Rover Fort Worth. After 14 years of dreaming of having my own Range Rover Sport Cody helped make it happen. He made sure I got the features and options I wanted and I couldnâ€™t be happier with my new vehicle. I will definitely buy my next Range Rover from Cody at Land Rover Fort Worth. ,5.0
1,"November 05, 2016",The best customer service I have received in a very long time. We went in for another key to be made and have our newly purchased used Range Rover (that we just purchased at a cadillac dealership) looked at before the warranty runs out. Mel Valadez helped us and was awesome. Very very nice guy. Called and updated us and great customer service all the way around. (even though we had purchased somewhere else. We love our Range Rover and (by the way nothing was wrong with it) we highly recommend this service center. ,5.0
2,"January 18, 2016","Check engine light came on, one week later it was fixed then noticed front bumper damage from them towing it, so three days later its fixed and now when I went to pick it up the car was dirty and a scratch was on the passenger side from the back door to the front door! Horrible! All the manager could say was sorry for you inconvenience, really?! Im scared to pick it up to see what now????",1.4
3,"August 19, 2011","Best car buying experience ever.  Brought my family down and my wife was skeptical. No pressure!  Left and went to Lexus dealership on the westside and my wife was treated so bad at Lexus I thought she was going to punch the guy.  Went back to Cody and bought the LR4.  This is by far the friendliest best dealership and buying experience ever.  Have Cody take you on the climbing wall, you will see why Land Rover is the best 4x4 by far!   Have been to Florida and back in the LR4 and it Feels like the big truck just flattens bumps in the road.  I have to go buy another one soon because my wife wants this as her daily driver.  ",5.0
4,"July 11, 2011","PAINFUL experience on so many levels.  I will NEVER go back there.  I'd much prefer to go to Cowtown Land Rover or even drive to Dallas.  This Fort Worth dealership will never get my business or any of my friends' business.

Having been a Land Rover owner for the past 5 cars, its so disappointing to have such a great car and such a lousy service outlet here in FW.  Bummed.",1.2
