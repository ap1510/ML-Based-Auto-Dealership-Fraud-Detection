20,"September 13, 2018","I've had the pleasure of working at this dealership 2 times and I currently do not work for them. But it wasn't because of anything they did wrong. A 45 minute commute and a promotion available elsewhere is the only reason I'm still not a part of there team. What better way then to now how a business is run then to be an employee. They are truly great people, and a pleasure to work for. They do a great job of taking care of customers in every aspect. Sales, service, body shop and quick lane. ",5.0

28,"August 15, 2017","I had the engine light come on and Steve checked out.  It was no longer on when he checked it, but the error code was one he said he had only seen once before.  The car was operating fine, but if the engine light showed again when driving, I should get the car straight to him at the service center.  Several weeks later he called to check up on it, since I not called him.  I told him it was working great and that the engine light had not been on.  
Later one day the car was died when I tried to start it.  I called and very soon afterward Steve and another worker were here.  It was a very dead battery.  They jumped the car off, took it to the shop and checked it out, put in a new battery.  There was no charge, because it was under warranty. ",5.0
29,"August 07, 2017","I ordered a new truck with them & had a great experience. I don't drive it much but after a year & less than 2000 miles I responded to a service ad & scheduled THE WORKS. I drove 20 miles in a downpour & they seemed not to know I had a scheduled appointment. The service promo advertised a $40 package for the oil change/works. There were no relevant prices posted or available unless you asked. When I checked out the over $60 charge was unexpected. When challenged they said my truck takes more oil than the special. I get more locally for less & its a few miles from my place. If there are exceptions to their ""special promos"" they should be posted on there site with equal flare or at least posted at the dealership.",2.8
30,"July 24, 2017","I bought my 1st new Ford in 1962 and new For products since, all serviced by dealerships.  Sykora is above reproach in every aspect of their dealership.  This was my 1st through Sykora, however: in the future I will look nowhere else.
