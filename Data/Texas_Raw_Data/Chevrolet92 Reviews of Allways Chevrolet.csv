6,"November 20, 2019","Wide selection of vehicles, sales rep, GM and finance manager treated us with respect. They valued our time and didn’t force us to wait longer then we needed to to get our desired deal complete. 
This is the first purchase of a vehicle I actually enjoyed due to our sales rep John. He was honest and genuine something you don’t see often at car dealerships. No endless haggling back and forth, respected what our budget was without belittling us. 
When we did spend about a twenty min stretch alone the sales rep John came to keep us updated each step of the process. 
The finance manger didn’t pressure us to add any extras to our vehicle and quickly and thoroughly went through the paperwork answering our questions.
Got what I wanted on my trade in and was delivered a beautiful 2019 black trail boss with leather at a perfect price. Will come back for next vehicle and recommend to all family.

JohnMichael was my car guy and was very straight forward with me and understood my wants and needs in trading in my current car. Once that was figured out he waisted no time getting me approved and I was in and out in about and hour or less. Mr. Richie Garcia the Finance Manager explained everything to a T & I was never confused as to what I was signing.

32,"February 24, 2019","I was looking for a particular brand & model of truck. I happened to find one very close to what I was looking for on car guru. It was listed by Always Chevrolet. They showed me the truck and let me test drive it, then I decided to buy it.  I am very happy with the deal I got because they had a very good price on the truck, they worked hard to get me a low interest rate on financing, and they gave me the amount I needed for my trade-in.  All that contributed to a monthly payment that I can afford. 
  Many thanks to the following people at Always Chevrolet who helped make my truck purchase possible;  Andy, John Michael, Richie, Kim, and Sammy. 
My apologies if I forgot anyone or got any names wrong. ",4.8

The team kept in good communication with us during the process via email, calling us and the sales person also txted, which was convenient for me. They were understanding of my work schedule and worked with us later in the day.

39,"January 05, 2019",Took truck into shop for check engine light. After 2 days the mechanic found a bad air filter. This truck has had all maintenance done at allways.

48,"December 03, 2018","over the last several years I have always purchased my new vehicles from Always Chevrolet...and I have had lots of work done one some of my older vehicles (some are toys) also.
I took my Suzuki Samurai in for an inspection but needed the combination light switch changed out and asked for a cost estimate.  The estimate was for $787 dollars.  I decided to do the work myself which cost me 84 dollars in parts and 48 minutes to change out.  (and I am NOT a mechanic).

The Service Manager wanted to charge me over $90 dollars for telling me it would take 787 dollars to change out the light switch...I was upset and said I will pay the $90 dollars but would never buy from Always again or use their services.   The Service Manager then changed her mind and said she would not charge me anything.  The effort to charge me a ridiculous amount for less than one hour labor and less than one hundred in parts and a 90 plus charge for telling me the cost was very upsetting.",1.0

50,"November 17, 2018","I have had nothing but empty promises and lies. I was sold a ""new"" vehicle with almost 6000 miles on it. Fluids were empty, car took a full gallon of wiper fluid a week after I drove off the lot. The vehicle was not maintained. I was told they would buff out a scratch and after spending a total of 4 hours in to separate trips they still can't get it done. They can't even do a decent car wash. Paperwork was not filled out properly and now my perfect payment history had been ruined. I will be sure to let everyone know this is the last place they want to do business.",1.6

56,"September 28, 2018",I had a good experience. Me and my wife went for a third auto loan and usually that's very hard to do but these dealership made it happen. The only thing I am upset about is that when we started the process I was told the truck in question was going to have a hundred thousand mile warranty. And in reality it only got the 30000 mile warranty. Which I know they had to do things to make it happen with the bank. So all in all I'm very grateful to this dealership. Without them we wouldn't have this great work truck for my gooseneck trailer. Thanks again allways,4.6
57,"August 31, 2018","I have been taking my vehicle there for service (6 times) since I bought it new. After picking up the vehicle for its last service there I realized they had never asked me if I wanted the air filter changed nor had they ever charged me for an air filter on my bill. I was on a long road trip and felt it prudent to pull over at the nearest Auto Zone and check its condition and discovered it to be beyond in need of replacement as it was the original air filter- the filter box was full of leaves bugs and dirt and it was obvious that the filter box had never even been opened. 
The previous time I took it in for service the tech forgot to leave my tire lug key in the council as he usually does. I call the service department to inquire about the whereabouts of the key and the service manager said he would check and call me back. I never received that call back so I called again to inquire about the key and the service manager said the tech put it in the council (which he did not). I ended up purchasing a new key and when I took the vehicle in for its next service I commented to the tech about the missing key and he went to his tool box and came back with it smiling stating that he knew I would be back.I'm glad I didn't have a flat during the time I was without a key and I am sorry to say that I will not be back nor recommend this shop.",1.2

68,"June 22, 2018","I gave this rating because of the following factors that almost cost them a sale. When we set down to go over numbers the lead salesman said take it or leave it as we don't play games. I said I wanted to look around and check all my options. He said whatever and had a few choice words with my dad. Two weeks later I called the young salesman to see if they still had the truck which he said they did. My dad got on the phone with him and said if they wanted to sell the vehicle, they needed to come down a little more to fit into my budget. The lead salesman was sitting right beside him and starting saying all sorts of things to my dad. My dad told him to kindly send the purchase order to us so we could have our bank review it. The lead salesman had to get the last laugh and wrote on the purchase order, good for today only and signed his name. It was already 2 o'clock and I knew our bank would close at 4 and it wouldn't get done until maybe tomorrow. Might dad said he that guy calls back or says one more rude or smart comment then we need to walk away as we shouldn't be treated like that. Luckily the young salesman called my dad that evening and said he would give our bank the time to review the purchase order. The next day the bank called and said it was good to go. The last thing I will say is that my dad got upset again as the truck had not been vacuumed and was dirty on the inside. Luckily I got my vehicle which I am very happy with.",2.0

91,"September 09, 2016","My original reason for visiting Allways Chevorlet in Mathis, TX was to get my current vehicle diagnosed for an AC concern. When I found out that the compressor was the problem with my 2011 Acadia that only had 80k miles I felt defeated because I was paying too much for the vehicle and I couldn't justify paying more to have to fix the AC on a vehicle that had had numerous problems and had honestly been a huge headache for me for the past year. When Richard, the Service person I was working with suggested a trade I told him I would love to look into it but I had previously tried to trade it at another deAlership and they could not help me. The same day I got a call from Mr. John Callison called letting me know that he thought he could help me out with the trade. Within the next day John had me set up in a brand new 2016 Chevy Cruze with lower payments than I was making on my previous car even though I was upside down I my loan! Not only did John get me an amazing deal but I could tell he was genuinely concerned about helping me as he was about making a sale. In the day and age where consumerism is the cornerstone of success and in general the goal of the salesman is just to make the sale and generate profits, John highly exceeded my expectations, not just as a salesman, but as a personable and genuinely caring person. The deal took about 7 hours to complete and he was nothing but polite, chit chatting with me while we waited. It was honestly the best car shopping experience I have ever had and I would like to thank Allways Chevorlet, in particular John, for helping me with what I thought was an impossible goal! Thank you!!!
