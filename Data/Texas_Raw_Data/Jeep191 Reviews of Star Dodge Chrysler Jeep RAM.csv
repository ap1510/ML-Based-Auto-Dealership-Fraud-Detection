0,"May 28, 2020",I told my salesman many times that I was repairing credit for 4 years. Do not run my credit yet. They did x 2. They have you sign a paper and reword it as they put it in front of you. I called back the next day and was told a different story. Horrible business. ,1.0
1,"December 29, 2019",I went to Star Dodge to check out the $5k over blue book trade they were advertising. I found out that it wasn’t a truthful ad. What they offer is “up to 5k” over blue book. This was not what was advertised. Basically I got a really low ball offer on a clear title trade in. Then to make matters worse I was told that I would be financing more than the price on the truck I wanted.....wayyyyy more. They came at me with a payment more than twice what I said I was comfortable doing. I walked at that point. Three hours of my day off wasted. They let me leave without even trying to get anything to work in my favor. I guess they had already reached the monthly quota. I’m never going back.,1.0
2,"December 09, 2019","I am not happy with my experience at Star and with the Salesman Hector Montalvo. During the initial sale Hector did not do what was asked of him and was a little misleading as to what he could actually approve. I was only given one Key fob with my purchase. I was told in service that I was supposed to get two. I had to buy an extra key fob and called Hector to get it programmed. I was given the impression I would only have to pay 20 bucks to get the fob programmed key by the Salesman. When I was asked to pay full price I contacted this guy about the price. I went through service and had to pay full price. Basically it was my fault that I didn't know he was going to have one of the ""guys"" do it on the side. Like I should be able to read his mind. Whats worse is this is the third vehicle we have bought from him at Star. Wont be returning to Star. So much for the Star Difference. ",1.0

153,"July 31, 2017","Normally, I hate car shopping. I still do. But this time I hated it just a little less. Rusty at the used lot did his very best to get us into the ride we wanted. In this instance, we went in knowing exactly what we wanted and exactly how much we were going to pay. Unfortunately, the exact  car we were wanting to see was unavailable when we arrived but he continued to show us comparable vehicles and let us test drive a similar car to the one we were looking for. We were just about to give up when the car we were wanting became available. Other than that, and how excruciatingly long the process takes, this was by far the best experience. Rusty wasn't your typical smooth talking salesman who was trying to get as much money from us as possible. He was straight forward and to the point which was a nice change of pace. Dan in the finance department did everything he could to move quickly and the length of time it took was not terrible. Overall, a good experience! ",4.3

My husband & I went in for a promotional event--didn't know if we would buy or not. We new our price range & what we would like to include for our bottom line. 
We met Patrick first--great personality & smile! That set the tone for the afternoon. He asked lots of questions & listened to what we said. He did all the things he was supposed to do & found us a new vehicle. We talked numbers & wants -- he brought in his manager, Brad, to help.  Another sales consultant, Eric, stopped by & helped look up facts about our old car & the new one. We got the deal where we were comfortable but needed to talk to finance!
Hello, Jeremy. Finance is usually not fun but Jeremy made it that way. Lots of talking, laughing, & discussing items to make it all fit into a package that was close to our original plan. We were amazed they could do it but they did! 
Picked up our new vehicle & Eric was there to help navigate all the ""bells & whistles"" which really helped. Told me to call if I had any questions at all.
One thing that stuck throughout our experience--Patrick talked about Star Dodge as a family & really wanting to help each customer. All of these young men-Patrick, Brad, Eric, & Jeremy worked together to get us the car we wanted within our budget. Each one told us to call any time if we had questions or needed help. Great family working together--our hats are off to Star Dodge. Thank you, & we will be back!!",5.0
