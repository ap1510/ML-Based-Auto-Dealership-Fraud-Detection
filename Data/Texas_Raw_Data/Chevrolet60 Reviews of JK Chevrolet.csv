THERE WERE BLACK SCUFF MARKS ON MY RIM AND ON MY DRIVER SIDE REFLECTOR LIGHT THEY TOLD ME TO BRING IT BACK AND THEY WOULD TAKE CARE OF IT OR REPLACE THE TWO IF THE SCUFFS WOULDNT COME OUT. SO WHEN I BRING IT BACK MY SALESMAN TELL ME WELL WE CAN JUST TRY TO GET THE SCUFFS OUT OF MY RIM AND LIGHT AND THAT WAS ALL THE COULD DO. I DONT FEEL GOOD ABOUT MY PURCHASE AT ALL I FELT LIKE MY SALESMAN WAS JUST TRYING TO MAKE A SALE HIS NAME WAS JOSH. THEY WOULDNT EVEN TINT MY WINDOWS. SO NOW IM STUCK WITH SCUFF MARKS ON MY RIMS AND REFLECTOR LIGHT. DONT GO HERE IF YOUR LOOKING TO FELL GOOD ABOUT A PURCHASE.  ,1.8
1,"November 23, 2016",A few months back I was looking for my son's first vehicle. We had been to quite a few dealerships before we visited jk Chevrolet. Me and my son was looking at the used vehicles when  Natashia Salazar asked if we needed help. I am so glad she did! Not only did she help us find the vehicle we was looking for and for the right price.she worked with the bank to get my son approved without me even having to co-sign. She really went the extra mile for us. I can't speak for the rest of the salespeople. But would highly recommend Anastasia she is a true professional!  ,5.0
2,"July 13, 2016", I would recommend everybody to use John Wood as your sales guy at JK Chevrolet I told him my price range and color of the vehicle I preferred and he gave me multiple options. I told him I didn't want to spend more than a certain price and he gave me a great price on my 2016 Silverado he was super nice and didn't pressure me into spending more or getting something I didn't want...Thanks John Wood ,5.0

11,"June 28, 2016","Jk has the best staff EVER! From the moment that you walk into the show room floor to the time you are leaving (with the car of your choice) it is fantastic!  I have purchased three cars from John Wood and I think it only gets better each time. Seems that the company is striving for excellent service and satisfaction!

My salesman John was the best ! I told him what I wanted and what I did not want and he knew exactly what was for me! The whole process was smooth and I felt like I was heard if I had any questions or concerns.  After my purchase he still continued to contact me to make sure that I was 100% satisfied and if there was anything that he could help with and  that he was only a call away. That felt awesome  He made you feel more than a customer more like a friend that wanted what was best for you not just a person to make a quota. 

If all salesmen are as good as John Wood was you just cant go wrong at JK Chevrolet ! ",5.0

27,"June 21, 2016","Our salesman, John Wood, was very helpful. He helped us locate the exact vehicle my husband wanted. John was fair and easy to work with. The finance director, Jason Owens, was pushy and condescending. Even though we didn't have  good experience with Jason, John was great and we will be using him for future purchases.

39,"June 12, 2016","A few weeks ago I decided I wanted to look at a Tahoe.  My brother had recently purchased a truck from JK Chevrolet and told me he had a great experience with a salesman named John Wood.  I must admit I normally avoid purchasing a vehicle because it's such a long process and most salespeople become over aggressive and annoying.  I understand their desire to close a deal, but they become ""over the top"".  John Wood did not handle himself or his sales tactics in any of these ways.  He is truly a down to earth, warm and personable man.  He understood what I was looking to purchased and worked very hard to get me the vehicle I wanted at the price I was looking for.  I can't say a lot about JK overall, but in my opinion salespeople represent the forefront of the business.  I had a lot of things going on personally at the time, but John Wood made the purchase as simple and quickly as possible.  When I go to purchase my next vehicle, I will look for John Wood wherever he is selling. I have already recommended to friends and coworkers that if they are looking for a vehicle to go to JK and ask for John Wood.   Thanks John for assisting me at purchasing my Tahoe.  You are right, I absolutely love it!!! ",4.8

41,"June 11, 2016","I came to work in Texas and I arrived from abroad. I bought my first car in JK Chevrolet and I was assisted by Sharin Taylor.... She made everything smooth and not painful as it is most of the times when you didn't live in this country before.
Anyway, I came back this year to change for another model and of course I looked for Sharon Taylor!! Again, no regrets... She was fantastic again... Consistency, that is all we need! The overall experience was really great and I'm happy with my new car and discovering new roads here in US...",4.2

This being my third vehicle purchased from this company I just knew I was in good hands.

52,"April 16, 2016","I was traveling to San Antonio in a 2010 HHR when the front end started vibrating badly. Stopped at JK and spoke to the service rep. He didn't think that at 3pm he could do much as the mechanics were getting ready to clean up and go home  as it was about 4pm. He had the mechanic look to see if the car was safe to drive. The rotors in front were rusting, losing chunks of metal causing the car to vibrate. The mechanic agreed to stay late and fix the problem. When they found out the parts were not in stock, they drove me to an auto parts store and I bought the pads and rotors. They installed them and I was able to get to my destination that night. 
That's why I felt they went the extra mile to fix my car and I am grateful. ",5.0

54,"May 15, 2015","Dodge Truck Ram 1500 -  Originally, I was told this truck was being sold for $33k, then offered $27k walk out.  I told them I wanted to talk to my CU about it the following day, to see what she would advise.  This is after a huge production from your sales manager, that I was getting such a good deal.  So they offered to let me drive the truck home and to work the next day, after I signed some paperwork to release it.  As we are signing, they told me that I needed to go across the street to sign the remainder of paperwork to release the truck.  I asked what kind of paperwork, and they said the TTL paperwork.  I said, no, absolutely not.  It was then I realized they were having me sign buyer paperwork for the sale.  This is not ethical and I don't believe right in any sense of the word.  Then they stated ok, let me put dealer tags on it so you can just take it and return it tomorrow.  There wasn't anymore paperwork that needed to be signed, all of the sudden.  
The next day after I was able to do research on this truck with the VIN, the truck was listed on their website as $25k!  Again, this is after a huge production from your sales manager, that I was getting such a good deal.  It was then that I realized I was not getting a ""good"" deal, from not good people.  I felt rooked, and taken advantage of.  I dropped the truck off that day as soon as I got off of work.  No deal.  Done.
Then they call the next day and offer to help me, but in the end none of the numbers are a good deal for this truck.  The most this truck has to offer is the paint and the rims.  It is a base standard truck, yet you sent up specs to my CU that it had things that it does not.  If this truck had the packages, automation, and navigation as your paperwork stated, then I would have been getting a good deal.  But he lied intentionally to my CU and me, to make it look like I was getting a good deal.  My CU cannot and will not finance a truck with the incorrect specs, nor will I pay for something I don't have.  I know you can understand that.
All of the hassle and lies for a base standard truck.  We all know I will be able to find a truck, with many amenities, for the price we are negotiating. ",2.0
55,"April 05, 2015","I went in there to get a recall on my car taken care of. I had it initially scheduled online through the OnStar service in 4 days. 2 days before I need to take it in, they call and say they're booked so I schedule it for next week on a Wednesday. I go in on a Wednesday at 10AM, and the guy at the desk says that he doesn't have the part in stock and doesn't know if my car will need it. He told me that to look at my car it will be 20 minutes but will be about an hour before they can get to it. I thought that was resonable. Well, 12 runs around and no call, so I call them but with no answer so I leave a voicemail. I wait till 1:30 and call again to no avail and leave another voicemail. 2:30 rolled around and I called again, well you guessed it, no answer. By that point I just went to the dealer and picked up my car. Amazing how something so simple can become such a complication. I will never again go here nor will I recommend it. I'm now going to drive the extra 30 minutes to another dealer just so I won't have to go back here.",1.0
56,"October 17, 2013",this rating is entirely about the JK Chevrolet body shop. I have had nothing but good experiences with the car sales and service center so I expected good service from the body shop. The day I dropped my car off the manager said if they got the job and the full amount the estimate was written for they would knock $250 off of my $500 deductible for me.  The original estimate was just over 6k and was estimated at 16 days. They had my car for 38 days and when I went to pick it up finally it was missing a wheel cover which was covered under the estimate Classic Chevrolet wrote. They also asked for $300 and said they lowered my deductible because they couldn't find the after market wheel cover. Since the verbal agreement to get the job was that I only pay $250 this was somewhat upsetting and I got a I don't give a crap attitude from the body shop manager thru a second person. If this is how they do business at the body shop now I am hesitant about returning to the car sales and/or mechanic shops of JK,1.0
57,"November 30, 2012",Leased a 2012 Volt there and was satisfied with the price.  Luckly the Ally Bank Representative was on hand to make sure the deal went well. The only thing I can complain about is how long the transaction took because it was one of their first Volts to lease. Still happy and LOVE MY VOLT!  Will be sending more folks to see them!,4.0
