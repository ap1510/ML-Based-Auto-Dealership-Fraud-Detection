8,"January 14, 2020","Mark Johnson was my car salesman and he was great. Over the years I‚Äôve dreaded going to car lots due to the fast talking, BS conversation that usually transpires when trying to buy a car. But Mark was genuine and sincere and very very knowledgeable about the vehicle I ended up buying. I would definitely refer anyone looking to buy a car to Mark Johnson",5.0

15,"August 02, 2019","I purchased a 2016 Dodge Journey, when I took it home it was still dirty they said come back we‚Äôll have it done. I dropped it off at 8am and got there at 4 and it still wasn‚Äôt ready, finally at 510 it was done and not even done correctly. Sales associate Deena was great but after being cleaned there is a scratch above the back tire that can be seen and I‚Äôm waiting to see what will be done. Paint is missing and it looks rusted. White scratch on side was supposed to be buffed out but wasn‚Äôt. I feel as though they got my sale and now don‚Äôt care about their customer service. I have been calling and texting My salespeople and no response. No one should have to deal with bad customer service when purchasing anything. ",2.8

23,"May 18, 2019","I have had 5 different Toyota‚Äôs in the last 15 years and always had them service at Ram Country. 
Always in Saturday and always have recieved a shuttle home. 
Alex told me he was the only one working and couldn‚Äôt give me a ride. FYI...the service advisor never shuttles me home before. 
It was one of two thing, Austin didn‚Äôt want to take the time to find me a shuttle or Austin truly wasn‚Äôt provided the means to give me a ride home. 
I told him I was going to walk home, didn‚Äôt make no comments. 
Which I did, I thank you for the exercise. ",3.0
