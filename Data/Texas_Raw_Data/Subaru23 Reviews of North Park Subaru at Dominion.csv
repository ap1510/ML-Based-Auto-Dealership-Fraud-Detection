1,"February 20, 2020","This Service Dept. has been generally very good since we bought our Outback in early 2016.  Recently (January 2020) they found some bad wheel bearings when my wife went in for routine service and told them we had been ""hearing a noise"".  We pretty well knew what the problem was but were testing them BECAUSE ...

... There was one episode in 2017 where they did not listen to my wife about a rattle in the muffler AFTER the car warmed up, then the service advisor told her there was no problem.  (By the time they had gotten around to checking it, the muffler was cold.)

I went back for round two, ran the car until it warmed up enough for the problem to show up, and made the Service Manager listen to it.  He went back to his office, got on the computer, and, miraculously, found a tech bulletin about there being one batch of mufflers in the right time frame with a bad internal weld.  The lesson is two-fold: 1.  They sent the woman away with an easy, no-effort answer.  2.  The Service Manager did not bother to keep up with his tech bulletins on Subarus.

The other dealer in the north and west San Antonio areas (NOT the old North Park Subaru location) somewhat convenient to us is much worse about #1 above (see review elsewhere on this site), so we continue to use North Park Subaru at Dominion.  BUT, the old phrase ""Love 'em like a brother, watch 'em like a hawk"" definitely applies at all times with dealership service departments..",4.0
2,"January 21, 2020","We've been using NP Dominion since it opened, bought a few vehicles and is the only dealership we take our vehicles for servicing.  The Service Manager, Tim and his crew are fantastic, and so is Andrew in sales. 

Great people, better service than anywhere else we've been.  ",5.0
3,"November 04, 2019","After reviewing the 2019 Cross-Over cars we sought to evaluate the Subaru Dealers. North Park has a great reputation and we were not disappointed as the sales process was kind, friendly, and helpful devoid of pressure and circular salesman/sales-manager/finance pressure sales so common in buying a car. I greatly recommend North Park. Perry D.",5.0
4,"October 14, 2019","I purchased my vehicle from North Park Subaru Dominion earlier this year, I worked with Andrew in Sales.   It was a great experience.   I had service done on my vehicle at 6 months and everyone in service was very great as well. I worked with Savanah and Elizabeth for the most part. ",5.0
5,"September 23, 2019","As usual, outstanding customer service and quick turn around on our 2019 Subaru Crosstrek.  Very nice facility and they always keep you updated to what is going on.",5.0
6,"August 31, 2019","North Park Subaru at Dominion is definitely a service-oriented, professional dealership that delivers quality service.  While we have faced more issues than anticipated w/ our 2015 Forester XT, incl ac compressor, wheel bearings, catalytic converter, carbon build-up in engine affecting performance, etc., they have been outstanding in supporting timely & effective repairs.  Would recommend them to all for service.",4.2
7,"July 15, 2019",Subaru was able to provide routine service maintenance to my outback as walk-in appointment and complete by end of day(around 4pm). They were able to transport me back home and pick me up in order for me to pick up my vehicle in a timely manner.,5.0
8,"June 26, 2019","It is always a pleasant experience when I take my car in for service. The people there are friendly & helpful when I have questions or concerns. I think ALL of the North Park dealerships are a wonderful group of people. I have had experience with  their Lexus, VW & now Subaru dealerships & when I am shopping for a new car I only shop at those that are North Park dealerships because of their integrity & the way they deal with people.
Thank you,

9,"June 21, 2019",I would recommend North Park Subaru I purchased a 2019 forester touring  and its WAY BETTER THAN CR-V AND Rav 4 when we  got there it was rocky we were about to leave BUT!!! they made sure we were happy and they  went all out and EARNED OUR BUSINESS!!! Ps I drove all the way from  Austin!!!,4.2
10,"March 25, 2019","My service was fine. The first for the new car. I was , however uncomfortable with a young man that brought his dog into the lobby with him. As were several other guests.It was on a leash but the young man didn’t control it. It was naturally curious every time some one came into the area. I love dogs, but I’d expect anyone bring a pet to a public place be more respectful and responsible. Perhaps posting a few signs might  help.",5.0

13,"November 15, 2018","They tried to supply the goods ,however the countless factory radio issue alway came back to haunt us. Had to let it go on a trade for a Volkswagen Passat. Much happier now! The Subaru Impreza was a nice looking car, with all the whistles and bells however.",3.4
14,"November 11, 2018","It was my 60,000 mile service and they only added on what needed to be done extra after checking with me and did a great detail on the vehicle",5.0
15,"September 27, 2018",Raymond and Jasmine was such a big help! They made it so easy for us to lease a car for our daughter! They were on top of everything and we couldn't ask for a better experience! They are the best on what they do! North Park Subaru is lucky to have them around! More power to y'all!!! ,5.0
16,"September 13, 2018",Tony Espinoza our sales representative was great from the start to the end.  No pressure at all and was a great communicator and listener he only wanted to meet our needs which he did.  Everyone we meet was kind and caring.  The only glitch was the financial representative did not give us correct information so the contract was filled out wrong and needed to be redone a second time a few days later.  Also we were told we could charge our payments on a credit card which again was wrong and not acceptable by the financial institution.  This totally took the Wow out of the purchase.  However we love our Forrester!,4.5
17,"September 12, 2018",Work was done right and on time. Comfortable customer waiting areas. People were knowledgeable and helpful. Everyone seemed focused on providing a good customer experience.,5.0

19,"August 30, 2018",I am always happy & satisfied with Subaru services at the Dominion location!  I always trust them to take care of my car.  They tell me what’s wrong & I tell them to fix it even I just went for an oil change service.  I will always go to Subaru for all my services need.  Jeff & Sanderson always take care of me & my car!  I have been driving Subaru for a long long time!  I love my Subaru!,5.0
20,"August 22, 2018","We had a very good purchasing experience with the purchase of our new 2019 Subaru Ascent.  The salesman was knowledgeable of their product and the finance person was very helpful and made the buying experience pleasant.  This is my fifth purchase through North Park Subaru and I will do it again, should the need arise.",5.0
21,"August 20, 2018","They even checked my battery, found some problems with it and replaced it. They also vacuumed and washed my car thoroughly. I love driving home in a clean car.

Thanks service folks",5.0
22,"August 09, 2018","I started at another dealership with a really nice salesperson who showed me only what was in stock, all of them missing features I said were important to me. I went to North Park Dominion and received the attention I didn't realize I was missing. Instead of looking at what was in stock, I was asked for exactly what I wanted and my salesman found it a few hours away so that the next day I had my new car. Very courteous and eager to find what I wanted, not what he needed to sell from the lot.",5.0
