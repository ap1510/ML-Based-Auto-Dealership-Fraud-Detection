2,"October 15, 2015","My father purchased a new vehicle from this dealership about 6 months ago. He didn't think they would be able to give him a deal like he could get in the DFW Metroplex. They were able to get him the car he wanted at the price he wanted and gave him a satisfactory amount for his trade in.

I purchased a used vehicle from them and I have to say it was the experience and relationships that the finance manager had with the lenders that was able to secure a deal. I also tried Metroplex dealers and even some in Lubbock Texas and they either couldn't close a deal or even seemed to attempt it. My deal wasn't flawless due to some miscommunication from the salesman and his managers but the finance manger was the star of this transaction. They will be my first look next time im upgrading vehicles.",4.0
