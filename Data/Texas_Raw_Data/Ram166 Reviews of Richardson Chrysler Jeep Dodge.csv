1,"June 10, 2020","Highly disappointed in their service. I was promised several things, but after the sell went through, I couldn’t get a hold of my sells person Armando despite several attempts. Never got the promised part for my car or extra key. Would not recommend this dealership.",1.0
2,"April 22, 2020",I had an accident in my 2010 Jeep Wrangler in December 2019 just before the holidays.  Obviously a bad time to go through the ordeal regarding timing of repairs. I will tell you Christina Jaciuk in the service dept. is GREAT!  She made sure my mechanical repairs were done timely and correctly and navigated my body repairs after the mechanics were completed.  Dependable and trustworthy.  I recommend these guys and gals to everyone. ,4.8
3,"April 16, 2020","I live in San Antonio and reached out to Tony Miketinac at the dealership to see what kind of deal I could get for a new truck. He walked me through the inventory listing, literally showed me the available vehicles via Facetime and allowed me to choose the truck I was looking for in a matter of 30 minutes.  The process was the simplest purchase I've ever made.  The financing was handled within the same timeframe but I was worried about getting up there to pick up the truck.  No problem...Rob Richardson drove the truck from Richardson to SA (5 hour drive) the next day and spent an hour showing me the bells and whistles.  Then he drove my trade-in truck back to Richardson that night,  Quite simply, this was BY FAR the best experience I've ever had buying a truck...actually the best experience I've ever had buying anything. These guys are true professionals!",5.0
4,"March 12, 2020","I recently purchased a used vehicle from Richardson Chrysler Jeep Dodge Ram and the customer service was out standing. Salesman Chase was straight and to the point. This was my first time buyer from Richardson CJDR and it was easy fast less stressful. I was glad not to spent half my day at a dealership.   Manager Tony was a no nonsense type of guy he didn’t try and sell me something I didn’t want. I will tell everyone one about my experience in buying my Charger SRT 392.
I will tell you if you haven't shop Richardson Chrysler Jeep Dodge Ram Address: 1321 N Central Expy, Richardson, TX 75080 Phone: (214) 329-0862 you may have missed your best deal.

5,"March 11, 2020","Purchased a truck there Saturday and I might get to pick it up Wednesday. The truck just got traded in and was advertised right away with undisclosed things that needed to be fixed. Porters or salesmen park dealer cars in handicap spaces. Way to much haggling. I asked the salesman what the dealership fee was and he said it was for floor mats, cup holders and window tint. He refused to take the fee out even though the trupk came with those items from the previous owner.  We were never told we would not be able to take the truck home that day until we asked the finance guy.  The truck was shown to me dirty just as the previous owner left it; napkins in several places. Clump of hair in door pocket, 12 air fresheners scattered, cracked window, clumps of dirt and debris in the bed, and no antenna. I have had a better experience from craigslist 3 years ago when I purchased a used Mercedes. I tell my friends to use carmax or autonation just so they won’t feel like they are dealing with a dishonest haggler. They seem very reluctant to want to work with you.  The finance guy didn’t ask who’s name the title was going to be in so half way through we asked were my wifes name was. We had to wait even longer to get paper reprinted. 4 hours there and I still have to take time off from work to go back to get an advertised truck that was not ready to be shown. ",1.0

7,"January 31, 2020",Absolutely wonderful and seamless purchase of my new Jeep Grand Cherokee at Richardson CDJR. Murphy and Tristan were both extremely helpful and made the test drive experience enjoyable. I even left and went to another dealership to check out their grand Cherokee models and came back to Richardson the following day because I wanted to purchase from Murphy and his team- even though I live in Fort Worth. The sales guys do not pressure you in to any purchase; the respect they have for their customers speaks volumes. I've texted Murphy asking questions regarding my vehicle even after the sales agreement and he's been nothing but accommodating and helpful. Will definitely recommend this dealership to friends and family.,5.0
8,"January 21, 2020","Initially I spoke to Will by phone who set up an appointment for Saturday, Jan 18th.  Although he had to be out of the office for a personal emergency, he responded to my text messages on Saturday, which I appreciated.  My son and I worked with Sean Kilgore (Sales Mgr), Josh (Sales) and Alan (Finance).  I must say I was thoroughly impressed with the car buying process at Chrysler Jeep Dodge in Richardson.  I have not dealt with many dealerships having been a long term customer of Mitsubishi, but I am giving Dodge some thought on my next car purchase. 
From the beginning, Sean was a pleasure to work with.  He made the car buying process not seem like an endless chore that was stressful and time consuming.  He approached my son (and I) with options while being totally transparent and clear on the expectations.  He was not at all, a pushy sales person, out to close a fast deal - leaving out pertinent details.  Sean also extended an offer of lunch while we wait and although we declined - it was really thoughtful.  I appreciated Josh stepping in to assist and he has a great communicative style (Congratulations again....Josh knows..).  Alan in Finance was great as well, made the endless paperwork not seem so endless.  He approached our deal with professionalism and kindness.  Talked us through the entire process quickly, but accurately.
In this day and time, I think it is important to not just sell a car, but rather give a memorable experience that will keep a customer like me returning and/or telling others of my awesome experience.  Chrysler Jeep Dodge of Richardson, definitely did that for us on Saturday!  THANK YOU AGAIN!",4.8

10,"October 15, 2019","Took vehicle in due to electrical problem. They kept it one week. Never called me, I called for updates 6 different days.. I needed rental car service rep assured me they would pay the 248 for rental sine the vehicle had a recall notice. Enterprise was not called or paid they charged me. I spoke with service manager he also assured me this would be taken care of I gave him enterprise number and again no call back and I was stuck with payment. Problem with my vehicle was battery paid the 300.00. Total was 548.00 for retired on fixed income. ",1.4
11,"September 17, 2019","Thank you Autumn Washington, Daniel McGee and Sean Killgore for making my 1st JEEP buying experience the best one I have ever had. I first went to Jeep dealer in Rockwall and in no way did they treat me like a professional customer. The whole team at Richardson Jeep took there time with me even when it was past closing time. No one was trying to rush me into signing paperwork and gave me time to feel comfortable with my new Jeep. Autumn showed me all the features and I was confident with her ability to understand my situation and needs. Daniel listened to my needs as well and  exceeded my expectations in my deal. Sean was very thorough with explaining all the paperwork and helping me to understand what I have covered. Thank you Richardson Jeep. ",5.0
12,"August 29, 2019","Mr Mathis made the experience stress free. No pressure, presented options and found me even more Jeep than I was expecting. Not your typical salesman approach. It was like shopping with a friend. ",5.0
13,"July 11, 2019","I have multiple issues with this dealership.  They DO NOT return calls.  The DO NOT respond to mail.
1. its been a month since I traded for a 2019 RAM.  They have yet to pay off my trade-in balance so the bank shows me owing a payment plus a late fee.
2. They removed the window sticker and have not provided it to me, Federal Laws states that only the ultimate buyer can remove the window sticker.
3. They added $1,147 dealer add-on's. They either can not or will not tell me what these add-ons are.
4. An employee witnessed me opening and closing the tailgate.  When I closed it, it fell off scratching the bumper.  I've asked about repairing the scratch - no response.
5. No one offered to explain how ""Uconnect"" works, which is totally new to me.
6. The survey they sent me was returned with a poor rating.  You would think someone would contact me with a concern.  Apparently these surveys mean nothing.

This was my first ever Dodge product.  I like the truck but this dealership leaves a lot to be desired. ",1.6

20,"December 08, 2018","Initially, I went to this dealership on 12/5/2018 to test drive a new jeep wrangler but ended up falling in love with a 2017 dodge charger SE. Ryan, the used car salesman, worked diligently and persistently to get me into the car. He would not take no for an answer and exceeded above and beyond to meet my expectations. Jay, the sales manager, worked well with me on the monthly payments and overall price of the car. This is my first time purchasing a vehicle on my own and I must say the customer service and deal I received exceeded beyond my original expectations. I love my car so far. I just bought it on 12/6/2018 and I plan on doing another update after my first month experience. Thank you all. ",4.8
21,"October 30, 2018","This dealership is terrible.  They had us return three times to sign contracts, and the third time I noticed they included service agreements that I did not agree to at the time of purchase.  The finance guy we originally dealt with was unprofessional and down right rude.  He wouldnt take no for an answer.  They have hung up on me, refused to call me back and have been rude when Ive gone in personally.  Two and a half months after purchase of my vehicle, my licence plates are still not registered with the state.  DO NOT DEAL WITH THESE GUYS!  ",1.2
22,"August 20, 2018","The worst I've ever experienced.  I bought a new Jeep Grand Cherokee from Richardson Jeep.  It broke down 2 days later and spent 35 days in the shop while Chrysler Jeep technicians made repeated guess attempts to fix the problem.  Eventually, they replaced enough parts that the problem resolved, but were never able to pin point the cause.  I called Richardson Jeep repeatedly during this process and, while they offered absolutely no assistance at all, was at least assured that they would make it right in the end....they did nothing.  Then I wrote a negative review about my experience with them and someone from the dealership wrote back apologizing and requesting that I call them so they could ""address my situation.""  I didn't call at that time because I had already invested hours into trying to get them to lift a single finger while the vehicle was in the shop and I didn't feel like wasting more time with them.  However, the vehicle is now experiencing a similar safety problem and I want out of it before it causes an accident.

I called Richardson Jeep this past Thursday morning and asked them to make it right.  They seemed very energetic at first and I thought they were actually going to do something.  The sales manager me asked to give him a little bit of time to see what he could do to help.  I waited almost 2 full business days and still hadn't heard back, so I called again.  He apologized and told me he hadn't even looked at it yet, but would do so and call me back.  He called me about 30 minutes later and offered to take the vehicle back for $4,500 to $5,000 less than the average trade-in value I found online and to give me ""employee pricing"" on a new purchase....

This is what ""taking care"" of a customer means at Richardson Jeep...sell you a brand new vehicle with a major safety defect, do nothing to help you get it fixed and allow you to pay out of pocket for 35 days of rental car fees, and then give you an insultingly low offer to buy the vehicle back and offer a standard discount available to anyone on a new vehicle purchase from them...They are a gross business.  Their offer provided a great way for them to make money off me 3 times, but did absolutely nothing to help me overcome the fact that they sold me a dangerous vehicle that I'm afraid to put my family in.  

There are a lot of good dealerships out there.  Give your business to them.  If you like a price at Richardson Jeep, ask a better dealership to match it.  I sincerely regret ever stepping foot inside Richardson Jeep.",2.3

26,"April 16, 2018","I was called by CDJR Richardson after checking prices on a new Pacifica limited through Truecar.  The initial phone call was good and they sent a follow-up price email that matched what they told me over the phone that was good enough for us to drop everything and go see the car.  The salesman I spoke to on the phone (Matt?) was unavailable so after a short wait we wear shown the car by another salesman who was a little on the short/rude side.  He asked us the price that we were quoted and I had me forward him the email.  At this point I told him we would NOT be asking for any more discount than what was emailed.  We set-up an appointment on the following weekend to evaluate the trade-in vehicle.

We received two offers on the trade-in on the same say.  Richardson Chrysler offered more than $1,500 less on the trade-in than the next best offer.  WORSE, the price of the Pacifica has increased by more than $4,000 because there was a mistake where the discount offered was on the wrong MSRP.  They gave us a sticker price that did not match the sticker we were able to download on the VIN from Chrysler's website.  They showed us an invoice for the car that had duplicated charges on it.  In trying to close the deal they claimed to offer an additional discount but removed another discount for the exact same amount.  Finally, they tried to add $1,095 in destination fees on top of the MSRP sticker price and other dealer adds even though destination fees are included as a line item on the sticker.  They also withheld the rebates we already knew about and told us they would charge us MORE to use our Chrysler supplier discount (Employee Discount).  We did not purchase from them on that day.

Our previous lease provider has a relationship with this dealer and tried to convince to lease the same VIN through them and gave us the true invoice amount proving that the invoice and sticker we were shown were doctored.

We noticed that the quote we originally received was the same to the dollar as a competing dealer.  We called the other dealer and were offered an itemized sheet for the car greater than we could've imagined.  1% below their invoice (which was lower than Richardson Chrysler's for a car with more features) and then they gave us $2,000 in rebates AND 0% financing free Tint, and transfered the car 250 miles to get it from another city.  All this with no dealer adds, and no pressure on GAP or Service Contracts which I declined.  They also gave even more on our trade-in!

Do not do business with CDJR Richardson when Meador is in the same metroplex.  CDJR Richardson is still sending out the ""erroneous"" offer on this Pacifica.  ",1.4

45,"November 18, 2017","I traded a vehicle in when I got there they had my trade valued at 15 instead of the 19700 we had agreed to on the phone. Told them I three dealers offer the 19 in three weeks. just didn't have the color I wanted. That is why I drove the 9hr to your dealership.. Figured he was playing me for a fool. Told him I'd leave without the truck an he said, But you drove a long way. I told him I could drive the long way back without it. He got up an said let me ask if I can get you more. Came back and said he typed it in wrong, he had put Tradesman instead of Express. Likely excuse. Then gave me 19 instead if the 19700. Then the Finance Man, charged me taxes on it. said in Texas they had to, told him we pay taxes when we get our tags. That I had never paid taxes out of state. But wouldn't listen, called a buddy of mine who's been a dealer for 40 years. Called a buddy of his, a Cadillac dealer in Texas. And he said it was up to the dealer. Dealer said they were try'n to finance the taxes to make a little more off me, made sense to me. Told them I'd pay cash for it. Hor not.e said I still had to pay the taxes. He said I'd get an extra $750 off to finance it is the only reason I did. Probably didn't get it. Now I've got to wait an see what kind of mess this turns out to be. Cause I was getting a vanity plate for it. Can't do it now, got to wait a year. Then nobody offered to show me how to operate none of the equipment on the truck. It's a Longhorn an got a lot of stuff to learn. The salesman was nice but I've had better. Then added a couple things to it after giving me a total on truck before I came down. Like A $1300 bullcrap dealer accessory charge for nitrogen an pinstripe an wheel locks. What a joke. Then was there nearly 3 hours waiting to get the papers done. I like my truck, hope it's last a while. I've bought 5 new vehicles in the last 7 years. 3 from the same dealer.  But yours is the only dealership I honestly don't know if I'd come back to buy another one",3.3
46,"November 10, 2017","BUY ANYWHERE ELSE! 
I live in Houston, but drove to 3.5 hours to Richardson Jeep because they had the new Jeep Grand Cherokee color/package I was looking for.  I drove my new Jeep straight home and parked it in  my driveway.  1 day later, while driving down a residential street, the check engine light came on and the vehicle lost power.  I took it to the nearest Jeep dealership where it remained for 35 days while they tried to figure out what was wrong with it.  They told me they were in constant communication with Chrysler engineers to troubleshoot the problem, but got nowhere.  Eventually, they decided to disassemble the entire front end and replace anything they thought might be the cause.  After 35 days they gave the vehicle back and told me it was fixed.  The next day, the check engine light came on again.  I took it back to the same dealership where they kept it another 5 days.  

Immediately after the vehicle first broke (2 days after I bought it), I called Richardson Jeep.  They refused to take the vehicle back.  I continued calling them several times a week while the vehicle was being repaired asking for their help, but was offered none.  One of their managers did offer to pay for my rental car, but they never followed through with it.  

I ended up paying about $1200 for a rental car.  To date, I've received no reimbursement for the rental car, the 3 days I had to take off work to handle the repairs, or the ridiculous inconvenience of the entire incident.  This is the 4th Jeep that I've bought, but I will never buy another.  

Just as importantly, I will never buy any vehicle from a Richardson dealership ever again. I bought a brand new vehicle from them that broke a day later and they provided next to zero assistance.  They don't stand behind their vehicles and they will abandon you the second you pay them.  BUY ELSEWHERE!        ",1.0
47,"October 27, 2017","Great sales experience with Daniel but it quickly went south when I got turned over to the finance department.  Very shady business practice that is likely the norm for them.........miraculously added on a service I still don't fully understand what it even is, while my payment didn't change.  In other words, I was approved at a lower rate, of which they did not offer to me and lowered their overwrite to fit in an additional sale of a product that I didn't request.  Very disappointing, but again, likely standard.  Arrange your own financing prior to visiting a dealership...........lesson learned.  I hope the additional $450 sale of ""paint and seat sealing"" for them was worth it.",2.0
48,"October 26, 2017","This past Saturday I stopped by Richardson Chrysler Jeep Dodge to test drive a Jeep Wrangler. I currently drive a Ram 2500 and have for the past 12 years. While I was driving by the Jeep’s with my window down the nice lady says sir can I assist you? I stopped and and Colleen Clark introduced herself and I pointed to the Jeep that caught my eye and she said would you like to drive it. It was a beautiful day and I said why not. Colleen took down some info and got the key and we went for a fun enjoyable ride! 
Colleen took the time to just find out what my interest was about the Jeep she was zero pressure and was very informative. She made it a very pleasant experience. When we were done she followed up with the typical questions again zero pressure. I told her I would have to sleep on it.  
Later that evening Colleen followed up with an nice text message and a day or two later with a phone call / voice mail. 
I called back and said when I decide that I would come back and ask for her. If you are reading this review please give Colleen a chance to earn your business. Thank you Colleen. ",5.0

78,"March 27, 2017","his was an awesome Experience with RCJDR. The reason I came to this dealership was my past experience with you.  The customer service has always been great.  James Stewart was very sweet, he knew what I wanted. To me, that means he listened to me when we first spoke and did not try to steer me towards something I was not interested in.   On the day of my purchase, I was actually in the hospital.  James called me. Not to see when I would be in, but to see how I was doing and if there was anything that I needed.  That meant alot to me an my son.  So I will recommend my friends to come visit when they are in the market for a new car.  The awesomeness did not stop with James. When I went to finance to see Chris, I was sick as a dog and he was very patient, excused me when I needed to go to BR, and went over contract word for word so that there was not any questions of my terms payments, etc....

Thanks go out to all who helped. ",5.0
80,"February 06, 2017","We bought two cars from this dealership on the same day, both with extended warranties.  The warranties were sold as all inclusive, bumper to bumper coverage for 100k miles.  The warranties were also supposed to include a free rental car if the dealership was going to keep your car for more than 30 minutes.  Even an oil change at this dealership takes more than 30 minutes (in fact it averages about 4-6 hours for just an oil change).  
We have had no end of issues with these cars.  One is a Dart and the other a Journey.  The Dart has been especially troublesome.
The main issue that I have with the service team is that they are perpetually 2-3 days ""behind"" and can't get to even diagnosing your car until you've let it sit in their parking lot for a few days.  You can't schedule an appointment and come in to have your car diagnosed right then, no.  You have to drop it off and then they give you this sob story about being understaffed and behind.  This is a constant issue that I've had with them for YEARS and over the course of MANY service visits.  
They won't approve a rental until AFTER they've diagnosed your car.  That means that you have to front the cost of the rental until they can finally get around to looking at the car that you SCHEDULED to be serviced.  
They are also either shady or untrained and will try to send you without a rental even if it's a factory safety recall that requires NO diagnosis at all.  The fact is that it shouldn't be the customer that has to pay for the fact that they can't get their staffing problems straight and are constantly behind schedule.  
This dealership needs to resolve it's service issues and start honoring it's service appointment times with PROMPT service that embodies the spirit of the warranty agreements that they sell.  They seem to have found a loophole in the warranty that they are exploiting so that they don't have to pay for rental cars.  
The other issue is that the warranty that they sold is only honored through THEIR service department unless you want to pay the $200 deductible fee to take it somewhere else.  I actually had to do that once because they failed to diagnose and fix an issue 3 times in a row.  I took it to another dealership and had it fixed correctly in less than a day, but it cost me $200.  

Bottom line, they are shady and try to avoid all costs at the expense of the customer.  They struggle to properly diagnose issues.  They are constantly late, understaffed and behind schedule.  And they will ONLY work within the constraints of the warranty, so the warranty company dictates what they will and will not do to the car.  They won't even TRY to diagnose an issue using basic common sense if the warranty company hasn't told them what to do next.  ",1.0
81,"February 04, 2017","I had an awesome experience.  I was looking to purchase a new vehicle and I found one online that caught my eye.. I went to a dealership in the Arlington/ fort worth area that had a semi good deal and drove good but the trade in wasnt sufficient .. Then, I went to my second stop which was Richardson Dodge Jeep Chrysler.  As soon as i arrived on the lot i was greeted by a smiling Ms. Tera and she was a very hardworking young lady. She found the 392 hemi shaker scat pack on the lot that i wanted to see after much walking around and small talk. I, loved the car at first sight and knew it was the one i wanted. So, we went inside and met Mr. Roger which he's one of the sales managers. He was straight forward and had a let's get the deal done with no gimmicks or games. I've  bought many cars, so i did my research before traveling to the lots and purchasing a subpar deal. . Mr. Roger worked hard to come to the best price and make sure i was satisfied. Mr. Brian also assisted in the deal by making the numbers and trade-in reach max value. Mr. Brian got me rebates that i didnt even know were on the table and made sure i got the car showroom floor ready. The financial manager Mr. William was also a great person at this awesome dealership.  Mr. William made sure i understood even fine print on the contract and left no stones unturned. Normally when buying a car it's a tedious process and there are regrets after signing but i felt somewhat at ease. This dealership is truly a cut above the rest and I'll hopefully buy another from dodge jeep Chrysler Ram. ",5.0
82,"January 26, 2017","I would not recommend this dealership for service. Technician damaged my bumper and took it in 7 times for them to install the new one.

Now I'm dealing with a shortage in the headlights which has been in for the 5th time and no one can find the problem but they will charge you saying they found the problem but still doesn't work.. They will not refund for the charges saying it was working  but it isn't. Worst customer service I ever had. To top it off I had a salesman calling wanting to sell me another truck.

89,"October 06, 2016","I could not be further away from satisfied. Not only has this car driven poorly since I bought it, it has been into service already twice in four months. The car itself looks good, but that is where it ends. It drives very sluggish, I can feel the gears slip in the transmission, which shakes the whole car, acceleration is delayed and sub par. I have already brought it in once because it was manufactured with a twisted seated belt, and the fabric or seat cushion material started coming away from the corner on the driver's side seat. My experience with service during this time was poor at best. Not only did I have to wait an hour for someone to acknowledge and help me, I had to watch them assist others that arrived after me during this time, and yes, I had an appointment. 

Today, the car, 4 months old, 6600 miles, just decided it wasn't going to start. So after I jumped it, the check engine light came on, and I could not shift out of 1st gear on my way into the dealership. And you want to know what the best part of all this is? On both visits to the service department, I am told they will need to check to see if these issues are covered by warranty! REALLY?

The car is not even half a year old, has less than 10,000 miles on it, and this company needs to check if it is covered? REALLY? Then I am told that a rental may not be covered due to the nature of the issue? AGAIN? REALLY? They tell me Chrysler doesn't even cover car rentals! Every car at every dealer I have ever bought has covered this. That includes: Nissan, Volkswagen, Acura, Toyota, Mazda, Ford, Chevrolet, and GMC. This was never explained or mentioned to me during the car buying process or finance process. I would have never even considered buying a vehicle from this company or brand if that was the case. This is so far beyond ridiculous! It is no wonder I hardly ever see anything from this company on the street. 

I feel like an idiot who was taken advantage of and just cannot wait to get the xxxx out of this vehicle. So I am not completely satisfied. The only thing this has taught me is to never buy anything from this brand, company, or dealership again in my life, because if anything goes wrong, it may not be covered, and I probably won't get help at service, and probably wasn't even told about certain things that are and are not covered. I just wish I had my original vehicle back before I was stupid enough to do business and trade it in for this nightmare. 

I knew there was a reason I waited to fill out this survey. You all always try and rush buyers into this before the neglect and reality set in of how screwed they are from making this mistake. ",2.4

This is my 2nd purchase from Brian with RCJD which indeed, alone speaks volumes. And while this is it for the moment as I absolutely love my white Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo with tan interior and its hint of luxury, I truly remain loyal to the Jeep brand and definitely this location.",5.0

They even found me a better interest rate than my credit union was able to provide. My experience with Richardson Chrysler Jeep Dodge Ram was quick, painless and truly enjoyable.

137,"December 10, 2015","I was sold a vehicle by Steven Fields. He is one of the best car salesmen I have ever met. He is very sociable, knowledgeable, and generous. I got a great deal, and great interest rate. I was in and out within 2 hours, and I believe Steven is very honest and reliable. I can not recall the name of my finance associate, but I'm sure Steven would be able to retrieve the file. My finance associate was sociable and knowledgeable as well. Richardson Chrysler is an excelling company. The only thing that could have been better was if I was given the vehicle! ",5.0
138,"October 29, 2015","I wouldn't buy here again.  At first, I was happy with the sales process.  The salesman seemed to be informative; and I even wrote positive reviews on multiple sites based on my immediate experience. 

Unfortunately, the dealership deceived me into signing a deal under the pretense that my financing was approved (it wasn't).   Then they told me that it was conditiona (meaning that they had a contract from my side...but owned the car).  Apparently, I was on the hook to buy the car if they decided that they wanted to sell me the car in the next 30 days.  Essentially, they locked me into doing business with them without disclosing that the deal was not finalized.   After talking to Max (Internet manager), I got the distinct impression that I was about to become the victim of YoYo financing.  Max pretended not to know what Yoyo financing was and said that he would have the police out to pick up MY CAR that I signed the bill of sale upon!    When I showed up at the dealership to confront Max, he wasn't there (allegedly).  Shannon (The GM), did a good job of trying to smooth things over...and eventually the financing was complete.  However, this should not have been an issue.  If you sign a bill of sale --- you should own the car and any contingencies should be clearly spelled out to the buyer. 

To make matters worse, even after talking to Shannon; I was promised better communication from the dealership from that point forward.  However, the Finance people would not return friendly calls or emails that I sent to them (simply asking for confirmation that they got the documents that I sent).  It really makes you wonder what is going on when the head of the place tells a customer and the finance manager to keep good communication flowing and they can't spend ten seconds to say ""got the documents""... particularly after multiple requests to do so. 

I'm also upset that when I was happy with Richardson that I was told that I would be receiving a survey and was asked to give ""five stars""... however... when it became clear that I wasn't happy... no survey was sent to me.   

UPDATE:  I saw that Richardson Jeep responded to my review.  Here is what they did not respond to:  Why didn't the Finance person get back to me after repeated attempts and being told by the GM to do so?   Why wasn't Max Millender fired for trying to bully, intimidate and lie to a customer?   Why didn't they ensure that I would get the chance to submit a review of their dealership to Chrysler?   If someone at Richardson sees this, I'd like to have that survey.

I brought my truck in for my 10:30AM appointment and waited around until 3:30PM to get it back. What were they doing to my truck, you ask? Changing my oil and (supposedly) inspecting it. That's it. I asked multiple times what the status was and every time someone radioed into the garage and I got a ""they're checking on it"" OR ""it'll just be a few more (hours) minutes."" I finally found my service technician, Lester, who was sitting at his station browsing Facebook on his phone, and I asked where my truck was. He sent someone else to go get it (guess he was reading an interesting article) and I finally got my truck back, unwashed AND NOT INSPECTED, 20 minutes later.

147,"June 03, 2015","Called the day before to make an appointment for warranty work needed.  Talked to Lester and set the appointment. When dropping the car off I went over the issues with Lester and he advised me he would call me later on with an update, and if they needed to keep the car overnight for warranty work, they would provide a car for me to drive covered by warranty. He called me early afternoon and told me they got all the parts ordered to fix everything except for the headlight issue because they are aftermarket HID lights.  Then told me he would set up the rental and told me to go to enterprise at Arapaho and Custer and everything would be set up.  

I got to enterprise later on, and they wanted to charge $50 dollars on a credit card. Which I did not have, so it would have been $250 on my debit card.  I called Lester and asked him why he didn't tell me this when I dropped it off or when he called, and he said he doesn't control what they do but all he can say is they are taking care of the warranty work.  So I told him I would have to come pick up the car and bring it back next week. He advised me that it's probably all torn apart. I told him it either needs to get out back together or I need to speak to the service manager, to which he chuckled and said OK. 

I arrived about 15 minutes later, my vehicle was on the service drive. I stood and waited for someone to acknowledge my presencse standing in front of 2 other advisors and finally walked inside. Cashier did not have paperwork and had to call Lester. Then told me there was no paper work because the tech hadn't storied it out yet. I asked for something telling me what they did/found and was told it would be emailed to me.  Have not received it yet.  I got in my vehicle and noted the mileage seeing they had obviously not test driven the car because the mileage was .1 mile further than when I dropped it off.  So when he told me they did an update for the rough shifting concern,  they didn't verify that it existed nor verify that it was fixed.  

I then called in to speak to the service manager and the receptionist told me immediately that he was not available and offered to let me talk to someone else in service. I asked her how she knew so fast that he was unavailable, she told me that he's been in a meeting for a while.  Also a lie because I saw the service manager in his office no more  than 5 minutes prior.  Asked for a direct number to service and she advised me there isn't one I would have to call her back.  

Wasted a day without my car,  was lied to, laughed at,  and was told something's were done which I have no proof of.  
I understand it is dodge and I don't expect to be treated like a high dollar customer, but common courtesy and honesty is expected.

Update: 6-4-15
Spoke with the Service Manager Steve, and he apologized for all the troubles and miscommunication. Offered sympathy for the less than exceptional service I received and told me he would make it right. All the parts have been ordered. He has reserved me a loaner vehicle for next week when it is convenient for me to drop off. 

Update 6-11-15
Dropped vehicle off yesterday to have everything completed. Paper work is very vague on what was done with the ""update."" Does not mention what it was for. Did not even put on the RO my other two complaints: 1) the radio volume function. 2 ) Transmission hard shifting. Also if the update was for the transmission function, like they say, the vehicle again was not driven to duplicate or verify repair. Also A/C is still not functioning properly. A/C does not remain cold when coming to an idle. Again obviously this was not verified to be fixed. Very obvious issue. Completely dissatisfied. Would like a call from the GM to see how he plans on fixing my car. This will be the 3rd trip for the same issue and attempted repair.",1.0

152,"April 06, 2015","This was the worst experience in attempting to purchase a car that I have ever had.  Danny the individual who is over the used car inventory is dishonest (and that's putting it mildly).  Beware if you deal with this dealership because it is exactly like all the terrible experiences and stories that you have heard about regarding used cars.  They are truly ""Used Car Salesmen"" and try to sell you junk and then try to hike the price up when you catch them.  I found them to have no sense of being honest or square dealing.  The owner or GM  is no better as he thinks everyone is trying to get a deal and that they should be happy if they have their time and money wasted just to end up with said deal.  This dealership fails to realize that not everyone is trying to get over on them and that they should not try to take advantage of people.  Sometimes people just want to be fair and to be treated like a customer.  This establishment seems to think that they are the only game in town and that they are doing you a favor by taking your money.

I went in to purchase a car for my daughter and the car they had advertised as a automatic was...you guessed it...a manual.  I said that I didn't want that vehicle but before I could leave they said they had an automatic of the same make that came in on trade.  They tried to sell it to me for 4,000 dollars over the trade they gave the previous owner.  How do I know, you ask?  He was still there and I spoke to him.  He disclosed that the car was a buyback (lemon) in CA which the dealership did not disclose immediately (they did later).  He also told me that the check engine light was intermittently coming on and off.  I was still interested in the car and I made the dealership a fair offer of $2000 above the trade in value that they gave the previous owner (that they [Danny] accepted) with the caveat that I wanted to have the car checked out by a 3rd party.  I did and it cost me $119 just to find out that the car needed about $2000 of repairs.  When I took it back to Danny to have a conversation about the issues.  He didn't want to come off the price and simply wanted me to pay for parts and have them do the labor (which is nothing to them because the mechanics are employed by them).  When I said ""no"" I was basically stuck to eat the $119.  I then spoke with another manager who said that it was explicitly communicated that the car in question was not to be sold at all and he had no idea why the salesperson and Danny showed it to me.  He also told me flat out that he was not going to refund my money  (later he said he would).  The whole experience was a ""cluster"" and I wasted 4 hours.  I ultimately wanted to talk to the owner/GM Shannon Ashford and he seemed unconcerned about my experience and basically doubted that I was telling the truth about Danny's behavior, stating ""Danny was here when I got here...Thats hard to believe.. not him"".  He also said that having a $1000 dollars knocked off the car was worth my bad experience and that should have made it worth my time.  Then he asked me in a condescending manner did I understand like I was some idiot.  At that point I knew that he didn't care at all.  He thought I wanted something from him when all I wanted was for him to listen. I decided at that second that even though the price they were giving me was a good price after all the lies and deceit...I decided to walk away because I couldn't live with myself if had given those shady characters one red cent of my money (Never give your money to people who treat you poorly).  I am a firm believer in that besides I have kids and how could I raise them or teach them this valuable virtue if I caved in!!!!  Your dignity is more important than any amount of money!!!  I am telling you that this establishment will take advantage of you or they will strip you of your self worth and dignity by treating you like dirt while working under the guise that they are doing you a favor....unbelievable!!!!.  You should stay very very very far away from this dealership.

I hate writing reviews but this place is so bad I had to warn people.  Buy at your own risk and know whatever deal you think you're getting....you're NOT because they are ripping you off.  I get that they want their margins to be high and make as much money as they can but these are certified rip off artists and Danny is the worst and on top of that he's the one in charge of the inventory (so he says) and he sets the price.  Again, I can't be more clear when I say stay clear of this place.  Wolves in Sheep clothing.",1.0

156,"February 04, 2015","We stopped in Richardson dodge on the way to another dealership to look at a new 2015 challenger. We decided we liked the car and would work out a deal. Head over to the finance department (a pre fab trailer) to talk with the Manager Matt. He seemed on the shady side, but I'm not one to judge a book by it's cover. They run all of our numbers and come back with an interest rate that was too high. We politely said ""no"", and then they tried to get us to ""buy down our interest rate"". We declined and decided to go to Bonham Dodge. I'm so glad we did. We were in and out of Bonham with a done deal in less than 2 hours. We spent about 5 hours at Richardson and got no where. We got a 3 percent less interest rate at bonham from the SAME bank Matt at richardson said was higher. Come to find out Richardson was also given the lower interest rate, but they add a few more percent on to it to make more of a profit. So not only did we save $4,500 on the car, we got more for our trade, AND got the interest rate offered from the bank without the greedy dealership adding to it for more profit. I'm thankful we were smart enough to see through their crap. They lost a sale due to greedyness. I'd recommend Bonham Chrysler Dodge any day. Ask for Dennis Stewart. He's actually a FULLTIME minster, but it doesn't pay his bills so he sells cars on the side. A VERY HONEST man!!! Will do business with Dennis again in a heartbeat!  ",1.8

My daughter is 15 and we're looking for a used car for her. She found a used car online at Richardson CJDR that she liked, so she called RCJDR twice to make sure they had the car there for us to go test drive.  They said they did.  Because we live an hour away in Flower Mound, I also called and spoke with Chipper to make sure that the car was actually on the lot.  He said it was.  I clarified that we are driving an hour to get there, so I want to make sure that the car is there and available to test drive.  His exact words were ""I'll have it pulled up and waiting for you.""  When we arrived, of course the car was not there.  Chipper said it had been sent to auction this morning.  Nothing happened in the hour that passed since I had called - it had not been there when I called and Chipper had lied to me.  I guess he was hoping that we would be interested in looking at another car since we drove all that way, and that if he lied to us to get us there, maybe he'd still make some money.  He was definitely wrong.  Not only did I leave immediately, but I will never go back there again and will tell everyone I know about their dishonesty.  I wasted two hours of my time and $12 in gas that Chipper could have saved me by telling the truth.  People like him give used car salesmen a slimy reputation.  He should be ashamed.

165,"September 23, 2013","I'm highly disappointed in the service I have received here. I bought my jeep grand cherokee about a month ago. Love the car and the actual buying of it went fairly smooth.

The exact week that I got a call to come in and get my license plates put on, my tire pressure light came on saying that one of tires was low. I went up to the dealership and while they were putting on my plates I asked them to check out my tire. They acted very nice and I was in and out in no time. They said there was no problem and my tire only needed a little air (weird, that a brand new tire would already need air, but I believed them when they said there was no problem with the tire.)

A few days later my tire light came on again, but I was going out of town and my husband looked at it and put air in it again. After coming back into town and getting in my car at the airport, my tire light was again on. 

Frustrated, I decided to go to the Dallas Love Jeep dealer, because it was more convenient. After they looked at my tire, it was found to have a ""small slash"" in the sidewall. Something that can not be patched and therefore needs to be replaced completely. The Love dealership asked if I had a tire warranty and stated that I would need to call the Richardson location to find out. I called them several times and talked to the receptionist, but was never able to get through past several people's voicemails. By this time I was furious (I wasted approx 2 hours trying to get a hold of someone). I left my name and info for a return call and not one single person called me back. Richardson let me drive around for a week and a half with a ""slash"" in my tire, putting my life at risk, and probably did not even inspect it when I had asked. 

In the end, I had to pay for a brand new tire for a brand new car I have had a month. I was also disappointed that the folks at Love weren't more helpful in finding helping me figure out my warranty situation. 

Beyond upset, still.",2.4
