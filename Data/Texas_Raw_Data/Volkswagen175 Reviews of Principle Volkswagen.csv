1,"March 15, 2020","Principle (formerly Metro VW) did not stand behind their VW product or their Service Department.  I bought my car there and they were the only ones that worked on it (lots of oil leaks).  My Tiguan was worked on & less than a week later it needed a new engine.  They did nothing to help with cost or a break to help me get into another vehicle.  Left high and dry with $9,750 to come up with before I could even get another car.

3,"January 06, 2020",I have purchased the car vehicle around 4 months back and till now they didn't provided car title and number plates. No one is taking responsible and my auto loan got increased and my loan went to default. Very poor customer service,1.4
4,"August 29, 2019","So I had to have some things serviced on my vehicle, and I was blessed to have Huma as a service advisor. I've had a few things serviced before at that location, but I have never received the service from other advisors that I received from Huma. She checked in with me regularly on the status, sent me emails, sent me texts...3 different methods of communication. Parts had to be ordered for my vehicle, and she did everything to make sure I was not inconvenienced. Even after I picked up my vehicle, she called the next day to see how things were going. She is a keeper! ",5.0

6,"June 10, 2019",Great customer experience! Larry was very informative and professional. Definitely making him my go to service advisor. Kept me informed on anything relating to my vehicle and even though I didn't have an appointment it was taken care of in a time manner. I will definitely be a repeat customer. Also again I highly recommend Larry as an awesome service advisor to speak with for all your vehicle needs!,5.0
7,"May 09, 2019","My experience with Metro VW has been far from seamless and quite disappointing, to say the least. First, the title was not originally with the car, making the purchasing process much lengthier than it needed to be. Secondly, after negotiating with one of the salesmen on a 1200 Dollar reduction and complementary window tint, the sales manager barged in, visually displeased, and said he would have to charge me 150 dollars for the window tint. This was after we were sitting down and I and the salesman had shaken on the agreement. Keep in mind, they had already tried to tack on 750 dollars on the loan paperwork after I explicitly said I did not want said package.  Now, it's been over a month with countless calls and voicemails and I am still not scheduled for a window tint. They seem to just want to push me away and pretend it didn't happen. As a first time VW buyer, I was excited to join the club. My experience here has changed my mind. I would not recommend Metro VW to anyone and be sure to review your loan paperwork very carefully. ",1.2
8,"May 05, 2019","Before finalizing sale paperwork and payment I spoke with sales woman and sales manager about policy of potential issues of the car after driving it off the lot. They assured my that is any issue of any sort would arise that they would take care of it within 300 miles of driving away with the car. So I took their word and hoped they actually be a good properly ran trustworthy establishment. But boy was I wrong. I drove my “new” low mileage Jetta home and everything seemed to be working properly and had no issues. Next day on my way from work, the check engine light comes on so I contact sales lady Ashley and she tells me to bring it in and it’d be completely covered, under there 300 mile policy. Next day after attempting to contact her through out the day, no response, the service department contacts me and tells me the thermostat needs to be replaced at $700. Keep in mind this is literally only driving the car about 30 miles after purchasing after she and the sales manager told me I had no worries with in the first 300 miles. Absolutely the worst experience I’ve had purchasing a vehicle.",1.0
9,"November 09, 2018","Bought a 2018 Jetta and was satisfied with car buying experience.  They were willing to negotiate on my trade.  Terrell, my sales rep, was great and very responsive to my questions.  When I bought the car, I pointed out that there was a deep sratch in the metal.  Not only did they repaint the scratch, they loaned me a car for the 24 hours that they had it.  The car they loaned me for a day was a few trims fancier than the vehicle I purchased.  That wasn't necessary but was a nice touch.  Happy with my purchase and my experience so far.  Will be bringing the car back for service and would recommend this dealer to others.",5.0
10,"November 02, 2018",This just happened less than 10 minutes ago. We went there to the dealership in Metro Volkswagen pre-owned and I talked to Jane as well as with John about our interest in a 2015 Toyota Sienna SE. As we talked about it we had agreed on a price that meets our financing approval. However as we were about to purchase the van and get into the paperwork John changed his mind and said that this price that we had talked about was never agreed upon and that this was way below the sale price that they were selling the car. Because of this experience I don't think these guys can be trusted anymore. If Only They would have told us ahead of time before we went there it would have saved us a lot of trouble. But I advise everyone not to come to this place as they are not true to their word. And by the way the backlight of the Toyota Sienna fell off while my dad was test driving it and so I don't think it was even worth the price they are selling it there in the lot. Stay away from these guys.,1.0

12,"July 12, 2018","I purchased a pre-owned car last month. The initial trade-in offer amount was not the same number that appeared on the typed documents and on the loan documents. Please re-read your offer once it's typed. I asked for copies of everything I signed and was told I would receive them. I left the dealership with none of the paperwork that I signed at the pre-owned lot; only my loan docs. I did send an email, recently, requesting copies of all of the documents I had signed prior to signing my loan documents and while I did receive some, I did not receive all.  There are other discrepancies on my paperwork, but it was my mistake for not reading thoroughly. There are other ongoing issues, but the lack of evidence showing my initial trade-in offer is most deceiving. This was a horrible car buying experience.",1.0
13,"April 04, 2018","I bought a 2014 VW Tiguan from them few years ago. I traded it in for an Atlas. I canceled my extended warranty and everything was smooth. I was told the check would arrive in 6 weeks. Upon inquiry I was told the the check was sent but, I never received it. So I was told they would re issue the check and would let me know. It’s been almost 4 weeks since I had that conversation and I have not heard back. I tried to reach Cathy lady responsible for reissuance of check but she must be really busy. I always get the voice mail. After several voice mail I still haven’t heard back. I might just have to go to the repeat shop personally and speak to someone in charge. I don’t think you can any to treat your customer that bought a vehicle from you and potential future customer in this manner. ",2.8

I have never serviced either vehicle anywhere else, because the service center has always had good customer service. Even so, somehow the service seems to get better and better.

But the big issue was the deal with my car and this has happen twice after the said it wouldn't . They sent my information to banks to get me funding for my car. They were only suppose to through voxwagen financing. I have recv over 10 letters that my credit was checked and loans were denied. They just don't do what they say.

45,"April 11, 2017","My sons 2015 VW Jetta had a dead battery.  Called VW roadside assistance had them pick it up they said the Metro is closest to you.  Tow service dropped it off there.  Car is less than 3 years old under 30K miles and the battery goes out no problem they tell me it's not covered under the warranty.  OK no issues pay $160 for new battery.  My son picks up his car tells me someone took his ear buds out of his center console.  Called roadside and the store they're like oh well you shouldn't have left them in the car.  It's his car don't touch his crap.  And who wants to put someone else's headphones in their ears??!!  SO GROSS.  I've had another issue with metro on service as well just because we didn't buy the car from there.  We moved into the area.

All of the paperwork that we had signed to buy the car which we paid cash for was sent in overnight we never received any copies of any of the paperwork we signed we did not receive the paperwork we needed in order to title the car. Got a call from Dana that our  manufacturer's statement of origin was ready to be sent out. They said state law required them to wait 10 days after receiving payment to give us our statement of origin when checking with the State motor vehicle department I found out that I should have received it when I picked up the car.  still waiting for all my paperwork that I never received.

Carol Lunsford was the salesperson who took care of me and she was superb. I told her before coming that I had no intention of buying that night and just wanted to test drive and talk numbers --- but she and the manager offered a very fair deal that I couldn't turn down. They, along with the wonderful Moriah in finance, stayed very late so that I could drive my new car home that night. What wonderful people!!!!",5.0

Had gone to the service centre for the first time with an issue with the infotainment system of my new passat

The service consultant Laurie showed loads of attitude and didn’t paid attention to my problems. Later in that afternoon I got a call from her that that there was some issue with the volume while playing the radio but this was AS DESIGNED and they will not be able to fix it.
 
I was really frustrated with this illogical explanation and had to again go back to the service centre to meet the service Manager. The service Manager was a polite person and listened patiently to my issues. He assured me that my issue will be fixed and asked me to keep the car for a day or 2.

I got a call after 2 days that they were able to identify and fix the issue.",2.6
49,"October 02, 2016","Purchased a car from here 3 weeks ago. 
Sales Person Jason was polite but didn't have much knowledge on the vehicle . He was more interested in playing with his phone. I had to ask multiple questions to get more information about the vehicle.When I asked Jason about the safety features of the car .. he replied back stating that ""Are you looking forward to have an accident with the car"". I was really shocked with this type of unprofessional behaviour and callous attitude.

Sales Manager is a typical sales guy who will try to show that he is providing you the best deal but will hide multiple clauses which will eventually bump up the sales price . I was so much frustrated with this lack of transparency that I was almost on the verge of cancelling the deal.

Eventually I bought the car but had a very bitter experience. Will will not recommend this dealership to my family or friends.

A quick trip around the block and I was sold.  Reggie answered all of my questions, returned all of my subsequent phone calls, and made the whole buying process a pleasurable experience instead of the nightmare stories that some people tell.

Others heard him belittling us and did nothing to stop it.  Shame on you all!
And John also taught us a valuable lesson when it comes to buying late model Jettas: always buy the extended warranty because in the last couple of model years Jettas have been known to have their computers go out around 45k miles and cost about $6k to fix.

57,"September 15, 2015","BE AWARE and don't waste you time and money

all in all, they are un-professional, dis-honest and fibster...... They cannot spell ""customer care"" at all


if there was non star or minus star, I would definitely choose for this dealer.
I found a car in their website which I tought I maight buy it after actual test drive and in person inspection. but because of limited budget ($13,000 - 13,500) and long distance to get to their place, I have contacted them via phone and asked them if they are flexible on price. because of my limited budget. my maximum final price was less than $14K, so I clearly ask the sale person ( Reggie) that: ""I am not going to buy a car that costs  more than 14K in any circomestance. will you deal with me for this car for less than $14K?""  ( they list the car for $14,990....
I clearly asked and he replied yes, I will do. and also because I had to ask somebody to give me ride to there, Reggie told me he will fill the gas tank for my friend who will give me ride.

in short, as soon as we got there and begin to check the car, Reggie changes his words. he said he can not sell this car bellow the price they listed ($14,990).....No way and he begun to offer me to buy some WoleksWagon passat and ....  I didn't like them and I decided to don't buy from them. ( So he waste my time by false promise to give the car bellow $14K )

then when I asked them for gas tank for my friend, they start to play .... maximum gas we burnt to reach there was 2-3 gallons at most 4 gallons.... which is less than $10.... so the only reason I have asked him for gas tank, to find out if he was honest on the phone or not !!!! it turnned out he was NOT. even the manager said we will give gas tank only if you buy a car.... which was not what Reggie told me before ......

all in all, they are un-professional, dis-honest and fibster...... They cannot spell ""customer care"" at all.

58,"August 26, 2015","I purchased my 2012 Jetta TDI from Metro in September 2011. I have had all of the recommended maintenance performed on schedule. I have been very well pleased with the car. The fuel economy is excellent, the handling is great, the traction control and anti-locks work very well, and the TDI diesel and 6-speed auto provides smooth and prompt acceleration.  The object of this review...the A/C. The compressor went belly up at 65000 miles.  I live in Dallas so a well functioning A/C is required. 
Metro replaced the compressor ($$pricey$$) and when I requested some relief, Metro went to VW America and I received a very nice refund.

61,"July 07, 2015","I am dissatisfied with Metro VW of Irving, TX. 

The vehicle that I purchased from Moriah Johnson (General Sales Manager) was marked up numerous times during the purchasing process.  I traded in a vehicle that was totally paid off for $4,000, which meant nothing after Moriah added, RdHz protection for $2567 (Useless with my insurance CV), Security insurance $1,000(?), Gap protection $635(Useless /w my insurance), and the only added protection that I actually requested of Paintless Dint Protection $650 ($0 deductible) = $4852.   The MSRP of this vehicle on May 14, 2015 was $22,880 (not lowered) + $4852 + T&T + Out the Door at = $29,218.09 - my Trade-in $4000 = $25,218.09.  God Bless America.  Monthly payment $407/month 72 months 5.5% APR = $29,304 for a 4-banger 2.0 sedan. 

They badgered me for a review.  So here it is:

Buy a vehicle from another dealership, avoid Metro VW, if you checkout the online reviews from Google and Yelp, you’ll see a pattern of 5* and 1* cross patterns, Adam Moore the General Manager is new there, but he is participator of every sold vehicle at Metro VW in Irving, TX and cannot hold ground with the sloppy mess of…**.. seeping out from the front doors.

Long story short, enough time had past that the dealership had a right to deny my request to fix the tire on their dime; however, after explaining my story to one of the sales managers he agreed to replace the tire.  Technically, he could have denied my request immediately but he listened to my problem and agreed to help.  He'd rather have a customer for life than sell me one tire...

So this time (Friday) I bring it in and they tell me that I will need to leave it because I didn’t make an appointment? I explain to the guy helping me that I have always been told that I didn’t need to make an appointment just to bring it in. That’s when he started talking to me like I was the xxxx under his feet, then turned and started to walk away. I ask him where I needed to go to make an appointment and he told me down the hall to the right. 
When I walked up to the desk to schedule the appointment, the only person in the room was a woman who started the conversation with “what do you need” I explained that I needed to make an appointment to get my car serviced. She couldn’t even bother coming up to the front of the room to have the conversation with me, instead she sat where she was and took my information and told me the next appointment that was available was the following Thursday.
There is a part on the center console that was broken, so thinking that I could save myself some time, I stopped by the parts department and explained that I have an appointment next Thursday and would like to order the part that is needed so it could be all taken care of at the same time. The parts person said that he would be happy to order it but I would have to pay for it, I explained that the car only has 28000 miles on it and it is covered under the warrantee. He told me that I would have to bring it in so that a tech could evaluate it and I would have to have an appointment for that!!! I explained “again” that I have an appointment next Thursday and I’m trying to save us all some time, he responded that if I wanted to save time I would have to pay for the part.
After leaving the dealership, I called Autobahn VW in Fort Worth and ask them when their next available appointment was and they said I didn’t need an appointment and to come right in! I got there and found them very friendly and courteous; they even gave me a loner car! Keep in mind that I didn’t even buy my car from them! Then Joe the service advisor explained to me that they would have to order the parts and that I could either leave my car with them or keep the loner for the weekend or I could come back and get my car.  Bottom line is I got my car back on Monday and everything was fixed!  Four days before Metro’s appointment to just start the process! 
As you can imagine, Metro VW has lost yet another customer for life and Autobahn has gain one.

64,"November 14, 2014","I will never do business with this VW dealership again! I had leased a 2012 Jetta back in 2011 and things went smooth. Then about 6 months prior to turn in time, I started receiving emails telling me about a special where they would pay up to my last 4 months of payments to turn it in early. I debated on just purchasing my 2012 or turning it in for a new one since I was about 10,000 over on miles. I decided to go in and talk to a salesman. He was incredibly nice!! He told me that all of my mileage fees and last months payments would be taken care of through this special going on. After HOURS of discussion, my husband and I reached a decision to go ahead and trade in for a new lease. About 3-4 weeks later the dealership started calling us telling us we never turned in the right paperwork. But then all of sudden they realized that I had??! Something about it being filed under a wrong name....awesome. Then 4 MONTHS later I receive a bill from VW credit for over $2,000!!! Charges for last 2 payments, mileage and apparently a ONE FOOT DENT in the body?!? I called the dealership and was assured by the salesman that it was all a misunderstanding and would be taken care of. A week later, still nothing done. So I continued to call. I then began to get the run around. I left numerous voice-mails, no return. I called corporate to report a case and they called me daily letting me know that they had still NOT had a response from the dealership. It took 3 days for them to respond to the case. And they responded by saying that I was lying. They had strongly advised me to not turn in at that time due to the fees! Are you serious???? NEVER AGAIN will I do business with these sketchy people. I will warn everyone I can of this scam!",1.0
65,"October 09, 2014","I have never been happier with any dealership. I am 51 years old and have had many cars. My sales experience was top notch. Never pushed or hounded to death by a salesman (which is important to me).  My trade-in value was fair, my new 2011 Jetta TDI price was more than fair and my four years of service experiences have always been a dream !!!!

I like how I have been treated since day one, by everyone at Metro. But my service experiences have really blown my mind. I don't think I expect much but I do like to get work done right the first time, I want the service people to just be honest and I want my car back when they say it will be ready. I have had this type of service and more from day one and in these times.... it really seems like a miracle. I say more because every person I have ever spoken to or dealt with has been over the top polite and professional.

He is knowledgeable about all the vehicles, very professional and hardy working for us.
He does whatever it takes to get what you want, in fact we got much more than we had ask for and we love it. I just enjoy opening the garage and see it sitting there.

81,"October 22, 2012","Up front: I had a very pleasant experience at Metro VW, due to two reasons.

1) I knew exactly what I wanted.
2) I was paired up with a sales agent (Mrs. Gloria Hinojos) that was a perfect match.

MOST IMPORTANT PART FOR FUTURE BUYERS is toward bottom of review...

My particular car situation plays into why I was pleased with Metro (truthfully, Gloria) so much.
I had been living outside the States for a few years, and I was hurrying to get rid of the monetary sinkhole of a rental that I had been using.  After my Japan experience, I wanted a car……a really nice car, something that would not annoyingly give me problems every few weeks.  So I did the expected American thing and treated myself to the most serious car I could afford: new '12 Touareg Executive TDI (by the way I am still absolutely ecstatic that I got this car, a year later).

Skipping the details of why I chose to get the absolutely most awesomest VW model I could think of…

For those of you that are interested in knowing the WHY METRO reason, it boils down to this:
A) They had the exact car I wanted,
B) AND they offered it at an appreciably discounted price,
3) AND Gloria was the most friendly, patient, attentive, and considerate sales agent whom I came across in my Touareg-hunt (almost to a point where no decision was required on whether to go through her).

Gloria is essentially what tipped the scales in Metro's favor.  My back up plan was to go through a sales agent in PA that was well reviewed and highly recommend by members of Club Touareg (see www.clubtouareg.com and look up Chris at one of the East PA VW dealers, I think near Philadelphia).

I hit up every dealer online between Oklahoma City and San Antonio, along with Chris.  Since a new TDI can go for something like 60+, I was going to go with whatever dealer was most accommodating in price AND straightforward.

I spoke to Gloria on the phone.  She told me that Metro had the car I was looking for, but it had been used by the Metro manager's family so there were ~3300 miles on it as it stood.  I told her no problem, I wanted to checkout the car, anyways.
She offered to meet me whenever I wanted, which for me was ASAP (given my lack-of-auto situation), meaning the next day (ergo, Sunday).  She said Sundays were good for her (which was a really good move on her part) if I could give her a course estimate on the time window I would be in town.

Drove down to Irving, saw the car, liked the car, wanted the car.  I was open and honest about buying from Metro.  Told her that my other avenue was through a PA dealer, and I was going to secure a Touareg before the end of the month.  Coincidentally, I met Donald, Metro's finance director, who eventually walked the details of my purchase.  The so-what of that first day is that I didn't have any new faces that I needed to meet after the first trip to Metro - so my intuition was agreeing with the situation.

Spoke to Chris from PA, very straightforward agent, but his dealer couldn't get my particular VW until closer to Christmas.  
Spoke to Gloria, she quoted a competitive price for Metro's vehicle. 

Between the slightly-higher-than-Metro price quoted by the PA dealer (which was significantly tempting since it would have been a fresh-off-the-boat Touareg) and the distance that I would have to drive back to Oklahoma, Gloria was really the only compelling element that persuaded me to stay local.
Looking back on it, I was really choosing between Gloria's personable sales style and Chris's quoted price, since I still had the formal portion of purchasing the car to go through, and I was hedging my bets that going with Metro was likely to be a comfortable experience.

It was overall.

READ - MOST IMPORTANT PART FOR FUTURE BUYERS:
Now what every diligent consumer should want to hear: the improvements (or cons) of my experience.
1) I asked Gloria about the purchase details so that I could review available warranty upgrades or extended protections offered by Volkswagen (or VW of America) prior to driving in to buy the car.  She told me that she wasn't familiar with the purchase extras or upgrade offers, but that Donald would know.  I asked her if she could collect them from me ahead of time, but to make a long story short…I didn't hear about any of the purchase extra's until I went in to buy the car.  Not how I intended things to go.

I wasn't exactly turned off, but I wasn't totally pleased with that part of the experience.  You could say that was the low point.  Not that I'm anything close to a drama queen, but if there was a time to get bothered, it would have been the information ambush whilst sitting down with Donald, since I had asked for any and all available additional information that would be covered prior finalizing sale.  I felt that this was the low-point of Metro's transparency (referring back to my intuition which was the reason why I went with them instead of the PA dealer).  I wanted the extra details before I got there, so that the sale wouldn't take long (I am a deliberately slow reader and thinker when it comes to making significant financial commitments).  I was expecting to take up VW on a few of the offered extras in any event (builds into why I chose VW in the first place).

If I had wanted to act like an overly proud mouth-breather, I should have collected all the additional literature from the information ambush and taken it home.  Honestly, since most of what I would consider 'decision-required details' were withheld until the in-office part of the sale started, I should have walked away after driving a second time for three hours to Metro.  At that point, the only reason I stayed with Metro is because of the additional cost and wait it would have meant by opting out and going with the PA dealer.

As I was expecting, I opted in with additional tire/wheel rim coverage (fortuitous move on my part, I've had poor tire luck some 3-4 times in the past year), an extended warranty, LoJack addition (highly recommended), and some other extras...nothing too serious.

My assessment/suspicion: the final sit-down (turned information ambush) is how things are designed to flow for the dealer.
I specifically asked for all the available extras' information so that I wouldn't have to audible the sale-call while walking up to the endzone, but it still happened.  Nothing financially bothering, just tactically dissuasive.

Word of advise to future buyers: ask for the offered manufacturer extras, warranty extensions, vehicle protections, coverages, etc. that may be opted into before closing the sale.  There was a lot of information to take into account in that eventual 3+ hour sit-down with Donald.  I don't like long meetings.  Frequently, I have to live through long meetings in my profession.

2) When the car was cleaned up for delivery, they did a good job as far I noticed on that day.  However, amusingly, I've found several reminders, leftover from the manager's family.  I'm just a kid myself (26 when I bought my Touareg: callsign Tina), so I find it amusing.  Periodically, I'll still find something that still has managed to sneak by my unnecessarily detailed cleaning methods.  What can I say?  I really like the car.  Not a real complaint.  Just offering up thoughts to future consumers.

Bottom-line:  Would I go with Metro again. Yes, if Gloria is still there when I replace this car in 10+ years.  Hahaha.

Go see Gloria. She's good people.  You'll be happy you did.",4.8
82,"August 08, 2012","I was looking to buy a 2012 Volkswagen Jetta TDI. I called them up because on the internet they had reasonable prices.

83,"February 11, 2012","This was an email feedback that I gave to VW after my service in October. No response as of today 02/11

Hi,

I would like to give an honest and unbiased feedback and that is why I put off sending this email for a week.

First of all let me start by saying I did not get the service I expected or the one I am used to at you place.

I don't know anyway to explain what was wrong without telling you what happened.

On Friday (10/7) afternoon I called Metro VW to set up an appointment to replace my taillights. The reason is my old taillights were too dark to pass state inspection. The person who attended promptly set me up with an appointment for next day at 9.30, after getting information of my car model and year. However when I requested her on a quote for how much it will cost me, she was not able to answer it. So she put me on hold and transferred my call to another department. But I didn't get an answer there either, and after 5-6 transfers a gentleman attended the phone and asked for the information about my car and what needs to be replaced. When I mentioned taillights, he asked if it was body or trunk. I was not sure what needs to be changed to pass inspection. But I was sure when I came in the next day they will know as soon as they see my car, so to get an understanding of what it will cost I answered 'body'. A moment later he said its $140 each (left and right). I thanked him and ended the call.

So far so good, and next day I brought my car for inspection and I was helped by a gentleman called Gordon. People kept referring to him as Peter so I will go with the same name. I told him my issue and he took a look at my car taillights and agreed it has to be changed. Once back in, he made a call to parts and they gave a $250 quote for each side. This is where I made a mistake, instead of ensuring what $250 was for, I assumed it was for entire taillight (both body & trunk) and agreed to the change. I did however ask if there was any discount and Peter obliged saying he will throw in a 10% on the parts. I thanked him and we also agreed to do an oil change since it was due. Peter said he will do a free tire rotation and I was happy with his customer service.

I dropped the car and requested ETA which was estimated at 2 hours. So its 10.20 and I expected to get a call at half past noon and left with my friend. I was at my friends place and till 4 and I haven't received a call. I tried to call Metro and this was when my day started to turn worse. I waited in the call for 20 minutes and 5 people spoke to me without even asking what was I calling for kept putting me on hold. And the call ended automatically after too much delay and I tried again. This time after another 15 minutes wait I got Peter who said the car was ready for pick up.

When I came to take my car for pick up I told Peter that the service today was not up to the mark and I am not very happy. He was courteous and offered me a discount for the trouble I went through and promised to work on improving the service. I decided that was good enough and went to pay my bill. I got a check for $673 and change with $100 discount applied. However the 10% discount on taillights was not deducted and when asked they said it can be adjusted next time I bring my car for service. I was not happy but didn't want to delay it any further.

After paying my check I noticed my taillights have not been changed for the trunk. Only the body taillight have been changed and I was charged $220 (against the last day's quote of $140) extra for no reason. When I checked with Peter he said he cannot answer it as it was parts who decides the price and put me through parts. The guy who answered the call was very rude and said they never gave me a $140 quote and confronted me asking who answered my call. Granted I cannot prove I am speaking the truth to a third person, but to myself I knew I got a quote and I am not lying. But since I cannot prove I got a quote I hung up my call and decided not to visit metro VW again and completed my worst experience of the day.

I don't know what this feedback will help achieve but wanted to mention a few things you might want to do to your future customers
1. When you give a quote stick to it. I don't know how a TV on Amazon will cost different for different customers. We don't mind paying extra if that is offset by good experience. But what we hate is when we know we were exploited
2. When you give a quote for a part (example: taillight) tell exactly what you mean by taillight. When I get a quote for taillight, I will assume it for what it is, a taillight, not body taillight or trunk taillight. If it has some variations it is your responsibility to ensure the customer know that so he can understand what he gets into
3. When attending a call don't forward it to people who cannot answer the issue. Answering to just put on hold makes no difference to being on hold.
4. Don't expect customer to know name of every person he talks to, especially when he is forwarded to 8-10 people every call. It is just a mean tactic and poor customer service in any standard which will score a point in the argument but will definitely lose the customer for you.

I hope you appreciate this feedback for what it is and take some corrective measures so no other customer will have to go through the torrid time I went through.

Thanks for reading this patiently.",2.8

The first time i took it in February they were very nice and explained what the issue was and that my brake system was perfectly fine.  Unfortunately there was a horrible grinding sound that was due to rust/dirt particles but my brake pads were fine.  After speaking to VW and them telling me they haven't had any other complaints (which is not true according to the dealers) I took it in and decided to go ahead and have the rear brake pads replaced to see if that helped.  Peter was extremely helpful and listened to my complaints and told me it was an issue that they got complaints about daily.  They were having an awesome rear brake special for $118 and to top it off they changed my 2 rear roters for FREE!  I didn't even ask them to do it, they just knew the issues I was having and it was out of everyones control.  Peter told me they wanted me to have a fresh start and wanted to do everything they could to make me happy with the car again.  So a service that should have cost me $500 only cost me $118!  Regardless of the free roters I would still highly recommend this service department to anyone.  Thank you for listening and trying to fix a VW problem that they should fix themselves! ",5.0
93,"April 11, 2011","This is the second car I've purchased from Metro VW in the last decade.  On both occasions they have been friendly, courteous, and got me exactly the car I wanted.  Most recently, my wife and I purchased a 2007 Rabbit from them back in February of this year.  We bought it used, and worked with Schlevia to make the deal happen.  

Schlevia and I worked on the deal for about 2 months before we came to an agreement.  It took long enough I was actually surprised that they still had the car I wanted.  During that time frame Schlevia kept in contact with me to let me know what they could and couldn't do and walked my wife and I through the process easily.  She was open and honest, and when she didn't know the answer to a question I had she would either find out and quickly call me back or refer me to someone within Metro that could answer my question immediately.  She didn't just answer a question the way that she knew I wanted it answered.  She told me the truth...even when it was an answer I didn't want to hear.

I chose that the price was only Good instead of Great because it wasn't the price I wanted to pay.  The car was still a very good deal.  It just wasn't what I hoped to pay...which would probably have made Metro lose money on the deal.  Good.  Not Great.  But I was happy with the final price.

I plan on replacing my commuter car (not a VW) next year.  Maybe go back to a GTI.  Schlevia and Metro will be the first call I make when the time comes.

Metro VW had no obligation to serve me as I did not buy the car from them, only used them to take delivery.  From the first email from Iraq to Antonio, he was friendly, amicable and ready to help me transition back home to pick up my VW.  He checked on the status of delivery of my car and provided updates to me.  When the time came to pick up the car, Antonio made sure the car was prepared, fully detailed and full of gas for me.  He took well over an hour and a half to show me the details of my new car, be sure that my questions were answered and introduce me to the service staff and familiarize me with the dealership.  I have had a bad experience with another VW dealer in Dallas since I'm a life-long VW owner.   Metro VW and especially Antonio's attitude and demonstration of peerless service has renewed my faith in dealerships.

102,"November 03, 2010","I am now a very happy client of Metro VW and a proud owner of a brand new 2011 Jetta Sportwagen TDI coming from a 4wheel drive Z71 Chevrolet Silverado which is a very big jump! This was only made possible by the absolutely wonderful and patient Internet sales consultant Mrs. Schlevia Estrada. 

I am an intense research nut to say the least and by the time I contacted Schlevia I had a very thorough knowledge of the Jetta Sportwagen TDI.

She has been so very patient with my decision making over the last three weeks never pushing too hard making sure that I knew she was there to help me through all the processes. She listened on how I wished to be contacted, listened to what I was looking for and answered all my questions and doubts thoroughly to the best of her ability.

I commend her for her expertize on dealing with a difficult customer not because I am harsh or savvy in anyway. It can be next to impossible to gain my trust and belief that I am making the right decision and that a person has my best interests in mind as well as the company they work for especially going from a truck owner to a sportwagen owner. 

Mrs. Schlevia Estrada without a doubt has just done that. Her professionalism and abilities to gain a customer for life needs to be told. She was thorough in every step in the process making sure my comfort level was addressed easing any doubts that I may have had. Not only did her patience present itself throughout my never ending emails. It was also very present as she walked me through my Jetta SW showing every area, button and feature that my Jetta was able to offer me.

She introduced me to Kevin on of the service advisors who was very friendly and who answered any other doubts I may have had around the TDI diesel. He also advised me on keeping my DSG automatic serviced regularly and the cost as well to keep it in good shape which is right on in the research I had done. They both let me know the time intervals for service in the first 3 yrs. 36000 miles as well as what will be serviced. Very thorough! If the service department as a whole is anything like what I’ve been through so far it will be great to have this dealership as my service center.

The finance department Ryan was very detailed and thorough. He helped me choose my extended plan and was right on in explaining the time period that suited me best showing me that 5 yrs. 100,000 was better suited to me then 7yrs which I was not going to purchase because of the cost he helped make the decision to purchase the Platinum plan showing me that I didn't to spend more asking my miles driven and showing that I should step down the 7 year plan and that it would be more of a better value. He was also able to provide me with a better rate then I received through a well known company that gives you a blank check. 

I do believe I really did get a great deal because of the great customer relationship building and the confidence given to me to purchase the TDI Jetta Sportwagen by Mrs. Schlevia and the staff. What a great experience I received and what great care and concern was provided to me by Mrs. Schlevia as well as Kevin and Ryan.

Don't hesitate to contact Mrs. Schlevia she really does care about making you a happy customers.

104,"October 29, 2010","Schlevia is one of the most professional people I have ever worked with when purchasing a car.  

I was being put through the ringer w/ several dealerships and I contacted at least 4 dealserships regarding Kia Souls they were selling and advertising over the internet.

I was VERY specific.... I asked all dealerships to ONLY contact me via email because I am a receptionist and could not take personal calls during business hours.

Mrs. Schlevia Estrada was the only person that respected my wishes.  This act alone, motivated me to pursue purchasing the vehicle from Metro Volkswagen in Irving.

Schlevia, turned a very stressful 2 WEEKS of car hunting into one of the most pleasant car buying experiences I have had in a very long time.  She was aware of our financial circumstances, aware of our need to make a change and did whatever she could to try to get us at the payment we could afford.  She is reason WHY we purchased from Metro Volkswagen.  I will recommend all friends and family to your dealership and when my husband and I are ready for another car purchase, it will be with Schlevia and it will be a Volkswagen.

Schlevia not only followed up with a phone call but also via email to make sure we were pleased with our purchase a few days later.

She deserves a heavy reward for possessing such great customer service skills.

Ryan Storm (finance) also did a great job, especially since I was in Atlanta and they were in Texas. All documents were overnighted to us, and even though my wife and I forgot to sign in one place, Ryan overnighted the documents right back so that all the paperwork was signed correctly.

It was a difficult task to find a standard transmission 2010 CC the exterior and interior colors I was looking for. They worked with me until I felt satisfied with my purchas.

I would recommend this dealership to others because you are left in peace to look at the vehicles at your leisure without being hounded and harrased with a thousand questions. They allowed me to test drive the vehicle on mu own and to ask whatever questions I needed answered. ",4.6

I asked that all the work be completed by the time I returned and I also asked to be kept up on any issues that may occur during the service process. Metro VW went above and beyond my expectations and completed all the work I had requested as well as checked the car over for anything additional that may have needed corrected. Upon my return they picked me up at the airport and spent time with me reviewing the results and detailing the work completed.

Being ready to buy my next car, I was really not looking forward to feeling pressured. Bob was great, very matter-of-fact, and friendly, so I didn't feel overwhelmed and that means a lot to me. I like that all of our VWs are very reliable cars, so it's easier to deal with people you can trust.  ",5.0

They spoke straight to us.  We dropped in and tossed around options.  Luis and Ryan located the vechicle my daughter wanted and without commitment had it at their location to view without pressure to purchase.  Luis worked to give us everything we needed and Ryan sweated to get the numbers I wanted.  We drive past 3 VW dealerships for an oil change at Metro in Irving and are happy we made our first new car purchase at Metro.

157,"April 06, 2010","I had spent a 2 weeks looking for a car.  I had almost giving up when I called Kevin Pak at Metro Volkswagen.  The best part of the dealship was that they did not start right away knocking down your trade in like all the other dealerships did.  Kevin did not put any pursure on me at all.  Should me the car and ask what would it take to get in the car.  I told him and the GM came out and told that what I wanted he could not do.  They did not play the dumb game will take it for this or how about this price.  When I want back to buy the car it did not take three to four hours like other car buying experience I had.  If you are looking for VW BEST place in the metor plex to go to.  I had a VW dealership 6 miles from house, glad I want out of my why to see the Metro Volkswagen dealership.  Please take a hour or two of your time to go see Kevin Pak.  You will not wast your time if you are looking for a VW.  Surprise yourself go see them, will be a great time for all.

159,"April 02, 2010","I had a Jetta TDI, and was having problems with the radio speakers having  a hissing sound, I had taken my car to another volkswagon dealership closer to where I live for 3 different occasions for this same reason, and their response was always the same: ""can't hear it, bring it back when it happens again"". Even when I did bring it back, they couldn't fix the problem.  I was frustrated with them, and thought I'd try a different dealership.  That's when I went to Metro Volkswagon.  The first time I took my car in, Kevin was very courteous and listened to all I had to say.  They got me a loaner car while they worked on my car.  That same day, when I got home, I received a call from the mechanic that was going to look at my car to let me know that we would be looking at the car to see if he could fix the problem.  Basically, the whole time they had my car, they kept me informed of what they were doing.  They were very proactive to fix the problem, and they even called the Volkswagon Central office to trouble shoot the problem.  I was very impressed with the service and attention.  I now have a Tuoareg, and I took the car in for the first check up.  I also had questions about the bluetooth.  Kevin again helped me out with checking the car, Baron was very helpful and knowledgeable about the bluetooth, and he took the time to sit with me and explain everything.  Basically, they were prompt in taking my car when I brought it in, and they were knowledgeable, professional and took the time I needed to answer my questions.

162,"March 20, 2010","This is the second VW I have purchased from Metro and I have visited their service department several times as well.  The buying experience as well as the service is excellent each time.  I got on the waiting list for the final edition bug on 12-7-09 and was contacted when the first vehicle was delivered.  I purchased it the next day.  Both sales and service are exemplary and I would gladly recommend this dealer to friends and family.  I have purchased another VW from a local competitor and when I contacted them about the final edition, the salesman knew nothing about it, didn't volunteer to find out and never followed up.  This was also a guaranteed sale, so this should tell you the other dealer did not care at all, even when they confirmed I was an existing customer.

I love the new VW and know that when it does need servicing, I will take it only to Peter at Metro.

Thanks, Frank and Peter.

The experience from when you walk in is not like other horror stories I've heard about--and experienced myself--with other dealer services.  They are always prompt, efficient, friendly, caring and 'normal'.  I've never felt like I'm being swindled with their rates etc.  Truth be told, it's never that dreaded feeling of visiting the dealer service as oftentimes is the case with others.

173,"February 19, 2010","MY METRO VW DEALER REVIEW
Sales Experience

I have owned VW’s since 1964 when I got my driver’s license.  My journey began when my father purchased a 1957 Karmann Ghia on February 9th 1963.  I loved to clean and polish it and purchased the car in 1965.   I learned to drive in that car and kept it for several years.  I owned many air-cooled Volkswagens until 1996 when I decided that because of driving requirements I needed to switch to the water-cooled cars.  My first purchase was a 1987 Scirocco 8 Valve from a man at my workplace.  My wife liked the car so much that we purchased another one from an individual along with a 1989 Jetta GL.  

We discovered sometime later the Sciroccos were a little too temperamental and in early 1998 I purchased our first car from Metro VW.  It was a 1988 Jetta Carat.  On the way home the speedo died and Metro quickly took the car in and replaced the speedometer.  That car proved to be one of the most trouble-free VW’s we ever owned.  Metro didn’t do too much on the repairs at first because I always figured the hourly labor charge was too much.   I later learned this was poor thinking on my part and in 2004 began using Metro VW for most maintenance.  Over time, Metro has actually proven to me to be about the same price as independent shops and in many cases cheaper.

In 2000 I purchased a new 2000 White Golf TDI at Metro.  TDI’s were becoming popular and I drove it a year till I sold it to a friend at his insistence.  In July 2001 I again returned to Metro and purchased a Red Golf GLS TDI.  I really like the TDI engine VW introduced in 1998.  It is efficient and delivers excellent performance and mileage.  In December, 2001 I purchased another TDI.  This time I got a 2002 Red Jetta GLS TDI.  I am still driving both cars.  My highest fuel mileage was in the Jetta on a Trip to and from Tulsa, Ok.  I averaged 63.8 MPG.  In each sale the sales staff has treated me with respect and never pressured me to make a decision that hour or day.  They motto is to make the customer satisfied even if it means not selling a car at a given moment.  In my case I was always satisfied because it was our decision.

Service Experiences:

Metro Volkswagen in Irving has given me excellent service on all the cars I have purchased, but especially the TDI’s I am currently driving.  The Red Golf GLS TDI currently has 108,000 miles and Metro has done a superb job of maintaining it.  Tim Kimber, Service Manager is very cognizant of my resources and treats me with respect and courtesy.  In 2009 the Golf needed a new Alternator.  I had the car towed to Metro where they installed an alternator that was defective.  Instead of arguing with me about fault Tim and his Shop Forman drove to my home 45 miles away to pick up the car and take it back to Metro.  They discovered the alternator was indeed defective.  They replaced it, filled the fuel tank with Diesel, washed the car and returned it to my home all in the same day.  Another reason I use only Metro VW is that I can wait on my car for service.  While waiting in the service area I always hear customers rave about the sales and service team that wait on them.  I often hear stories from customers as far as 400 miles away who insist Metro is their dealer for sales and service.  When you hear positive comments like this from other satisfied customers you know you have made the right decision about where to buy and service your new vehicle.

In 2006 I purchased two additional cars from Metro.  A 2006 Jetta TDI that became my daughter’s car after the passing of my wife and a Gas Golf GL which replaced a 1992 Passat that I had added as a 3rd backup vehicle because we were driving a lot of miles.  

I have been privileged to know Brad Hagestad and his father for as long as I have been a customer.  They are attune to the needs of their customers and always stand behind their work.  It is indeed a privilege to work with them on any new or used car and the service department is second to none.  I guess that is why I rarely see a turnover in staff.

174,"March 23, 2009","We stopped at Metro VW to testdrive the ""basic"" Jetta to see if we wanted to pay a little more for it, or get a corolla,sentra,or mazda3 for cheaper. Worked with John in internet sales and he was great.  After being underwelmed with the Corolla and sales staff at Toyota next door, we were pleasently surprised by the Jetta and sales staff at Metro VW.  They offered us a fair price below invoice, gave us fair value on our trade and we walked out happy new Jetta owners. Sorry nissan and mazda, maybe next time.  ",4.5
