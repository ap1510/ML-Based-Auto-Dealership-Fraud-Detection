14,"November 14, 2019","Henson Ford ruined the Henson name for me. I recently moved to Madisonville and attempted to service my truck at this dealership (10/25/19).  The Service Manager, Mike Thompson, told me my brake pads weren’t covered by my extended service plan/warranty, etc. He was wrong. I don’t know if they lack competence or integrity. I attempted to address my concern with the dealership and made multiple calls to them as well as corporate. I spoke with the General Manager, Kip Hines, but gave up. He told me more than once he’d return my call, but hasn’t after approximately three weeks. Computers and phones are too much for this bunch. Back to driving to Huntsville or Conroe.",1.0
15,"July 25, 2019","I have not purchased from them, but I feel like they are family as much as they do for basically the whole USA! If I could afford a vehicle even living in NC I would deff buy from them...
I have never dealt with a automotive dealership with honest and sincere hopes in helping someone!!! 
I am not posting to gain anything, just paying it forward my way! Good luck to the customer that wins!

16,"April 01, 2019","Very Friendly and helpful. Sherry and Jerome made me fell liked they cared about what I wanted. Leon called me on a Saturday, to tell me they had located me a vehicle and he gave me a price.",5.0
17,"December 18, 2018","I had a good idea of what I wanted and Jerome Dickey asked questions. 
He took us out to the cars to see if he could find exactly what I wanted.
I took the test drive and we sat down to look at the money aspect. I agreed
to the price and went to see Daniel Strickland in the finance department.
The deal was even better than what I expected (much to my husband’s surprise)
and I drove off in a new Ford Explorer. Everyone was friendly and Jerome did not
give up until he found the car equipped with what I wanted. I have put over 400 miles
on it and love the way it drives, but I have not learned how to use all the apps. 
I say give them a chance if you are looking for a new (or used vehicle).",5.0

27,"February 12, 2018",We needed a new work truck for my husband who works out of town. Nate went above and beyond to get the truck across Texas to him the next day.

29,"November 21, 2017","We picked up our new F-150 from Henson last week, and what a great experience!  Kassie did a great job of guiding us to Henson Ford for this transaction - we can't thank her enough!  We then worked with Jodie to process an order for the F-150 which took about 8 weeks for the build/delivery process.  During this time Jodie was super responsive when we requested statuses during the build process.  When we arrived at the dealership, the truck was very clean and fully prepped for us to drive off the lot.  We worked with Daniel on the financial paperwork - he was very knowledgeable and easy to work with - everything was in order and he did a great job of explaining all aspects of the financial process.  All in all, this was a fantastic new car purchase experience.  It is obvious this dealership understands and owns customer service.  We will definitely return when we need a new Ford!",5.0
