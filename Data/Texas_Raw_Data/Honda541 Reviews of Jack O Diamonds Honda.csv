3,"June 19, 2020","The service is excellent.  The staff are nice and accommodating.  An animal chewed some wires under the hood of my Odyssey.   It took them a long time to take everything apart so they could get to the wires but they repaired it and then put it all back.  I believe if they had a system that allowed updates to scroll across a screen, those in the waiting room would be less anxious as to why they are having to wait so long.

9,"June 10, 2020","The staff at the Lincoln service center went above and beyond when I had my car in for an oil change. I asked Peighton at the service desk if there was fresh popcorn in the customer lounge.  She said that she would have someone check for me. Before I left, I had fresh popcorn. The reason why this is worthy of a review is because it would have been easy to have forgotten my request and because of the employee who made the popcorn. He had a wonderful smile and the friendliest manner.  In this time of societal frustration and heartbreak, his attitude and behavior reminded me that kindness and happiness are still around.  Thank you Peighton and happy popcorn guy for making my morning!",4.8

95,"March 29, 2019","My first experience with this dealer was when they loaned me a brand new CR-V to drive while my Ridgeline was waiting for a replacement airbag inflator a few years ago - even though I had never done business with them at that point. Their service department was very accommodating which prompted me to buy two new vehicles from them. I've since sent a few friends there to buy new Hondas and they all had good things to say about the pricing and staff. It's apparent when a dealership has good owners and managers. In the spirit of keeping this review real and honest - I must admit that they damaged my vehicles on two separate service visits. One time they gouged the rear bumper and another time they chipped the paint on a wheel. Both times, they offered to replace or repair each component to my satisfaction, which they did. Jerry is a great general manager, Craig is a courteous salesperson, Cory goes above and beyond expectations as a service manager, and Kaylen is a very friendly and sincere service writer. They don't always have the absolute best price or the exact vehicle I'm looking for in stock, but they remain my ""go to"" dealer when I'm shopping for a new Honda.",4.6

I went early that morning to test drive vehicle, got financing arranged, approved, added new vehicle to insurance, deleted my trade in and even went back after the kids got out of school to pickup vehicle but because my credit union hadn't sent drafting we didn't get to ""see"" the finance guy either. We agreed to complete the transaction after I got off work only to come to this poor excuse for a dealership and be told that someone else had purchased my vehicle. Maybe he has a job because he last the same last name as the GM, I don't know but if you agree to one thing and they don't honor it their word, it just lends to the bad wrap that you guys keep getting.

The truck Travis showed my husband was a little more than what we were going to pay for in Ft Worth.  So, we thanked him and informed him that we would purchase the truck we had seen on Craigslist.  Knowing that we were on our way to Ft Worth, Travis went the extra mile and continued working on a better deal for us.  He called to inform us that he was able to get  better deal on the truck if the one in Ft Worth did not pan out. Well, needless to say, that truck did not pan out and we felt relieved knowing that there was a truck waiting for us in Tyler and we did not feel pressured into taking the one in Ft Worth.  Had it not been for Travis calling us back, we would have purchased the truck that my husband was not too happy with.

James gave concise and expert demonstrations/explanations of every aspect of the Pilot before during and after the sale. He and the other staff convinced me by their actions they were working hard to get the best value for my trade in they could which pushed the sale over the brink so to speak. A representative from the service department took me around post sale, making me feel comfortable with that department, and I had a relatively lengthy conversation with the service department manager all after normal hours no less.

",5.0
227,"July 02, 2017","I purchased a vehicle from this dealership on June 30th, 2017.
I am going to start out this review with the positives:
My salesman James C., Ernest (and his bearded coworker - sorry I did not get your name), and DJ the finance manager. These men handled themselves with dignity and professionalism. My entire experience with my salesman was very positive from start to finish. If I could rate these men alone they would get 5 of 5. I was referring individuals to this dealership due to my interactions and experience with James, before they decided to attempt to not honor an agreement.
The negatives:
The amount of trouble I had to get this dealership, specifically the general manager, to honor an agreement.
Jack O'Diamonds accepted my deposit in May, signed car info and MSRP agreement, and took copies of documentation from me so we would be ready to get the purchase going when the car arrived (ID, Social, Insurance, finance info). Communications with this dealership made every indication the purchase would be made upon arrival. On the last day of the car‚Äôs ETA I am told that the manager regrets the MSRP agreement and decided to hold the car for a minimum of 90 days (confirmed by a call I made to the sales manager) to draw customers in to get their moneys worth. I was not informed of this until June 28th (the last day of my ETA). I was told the transport truck with the car arrived, but left without delivering it. I never claimed they had it, just that they rescinded their agreement to sell it to me when it DID arrive.
I have seen claims that I should have talked to the dealership before I posted a video. I confirmed the 90 day hold situation with both my salesman and the sales manager as soon as I was informed and before the video discussing my experience was ever created. I intentionally stayed away from posting any reviews or encouraging individuals to do so, even though it appeared employees were attempting to bait me into posting in the review section by calling me out in their reviews. What other people do with information given is not under my control. 
When the Jalopnik article discussing this situation was posted I was not contacted by the author, who made a couple of incorrect assumptions based off of what other individuals misinterpreted. I saw some errors and immediately posted a clarification (not a retraction) on Facebook publicly, the article comments itself, and emailed the author directly. The dealership has continually addressed issues that I did not claim and ignored the actual issues.
In a meeting that my salesman was not allowed in, even though we requested him, the GM stated he was at fault for this situation, but he was still going to keep the car in the show room. He has on multiple occasions stated if my experience wasn‚Äôt positive I wouldn‚Äôt have an experience with them at all. I have these claims documented.
In every interaction the GM threatened to give me my deposit back if I didn‚Äôt have a positive experience and stop ‚Äúlying‚Äù or attempted to convince me to take my deposit back. Throughout all of this they called it my car, but would not back anything up with writing (since my documents for my initial deposit before they changed their minds about the agreement).
The personal and unprofessional level this dealership took this to.
I received after-hours phone calls from the GM to accuse, manipulate, and vent at me (when he was off work). Employees of the dealership messaged my friends on Facebook to speak negatively of me and call me a liar. Employees who are not friendly towards me attempted to ‚Äúfriend‚Äù me on Facebook.
The environment of the dealership when they changed their mind (due to the negative feedback they were receiving) and allowed to purchase the car.
I was not assisted until I texted the GM I had arrived, even though many workers were clearly not busy as they spent their time pacing around us and glaring. Which is unlike the experience my friend had coming in to meet me there. He walked through the doors and was immediately greeted by a nearby salesman. I have these claims documented and witnesses to this.
The bottom line is: dealer‚Äôs remorse is not the customer's responsibility. The agreement was honored not because of the integrity of the dealership, but because they got called out. There was time before the backlash got out of control to make this right.
Yes I have my car now, but I am not a satisfied customer. However, I stuck to my agreement and bought the car upon arrival at MSRP.

However, I went to open my glove compartment box and I was ""missing"" my black Acura book that the manual, and other items were inside of it. I immediately called back to the dealership and reported this to the customer service representative. She placed me on hold to have the staff go check, I then informed her that I was on my way out there..... Pulled under the express service line, and the staff were just sitting there not working, nor looking for my items. I informed them that this was very unprofessional on the technician's part to take things out of my glove box, and not put everything back. I had my current insurance card, pens, $20 worth of postal stamps that I had recently purchased, and I kept these things in the manual cover booklet. The manager Cory came out and expressed that they had called the technician who had already left for the day ( whom knew nothing, and wasn't even concerned), he said he would give me a FREE oil change, and order me a new manual book. Really? I don't want to bring my car here for anything else, I'll travel to Dallas/Shreveport the next time I need any service on my car. Then, he called me at my office the next week informing me he had ordered me a manual off E-bay( I'm sure it only costs $2.99). Like, dude seriously you just told me where you got it from, not even brand new, from E-bay???? I finally went and picked it up today, and OMG, it was no Tag or price on it, used, had scratches and sticky stuff all over it. Ridiculous! I just drove off, and knew that I must write this review although he begged me not to. Well, had I gotten a brand NEW Acura Manual I may would've not shared this story. 
P.S, I see now why Acura said go to the nearest ACURA dealership :-)

The whole no car note thing was really working for me, ya know? I went to another Honda dealer in East Texas, they left a bad taste in my mouth. But Jack O' Diamonds changed the game for me and what was a stressful and tiresome experience, actually turned out to be a good day. I walked away with my new whip and I love it! James McLouth was my salesman, he's pretty awesome, if I do say so myself! J.D. was the finance gent I dealt with, also very friendly and personable! Everyone at this business was suuuuuuuuuuuuuuper nice and I didn't feel like I was being taken advantage of. I received very detailed information.

They even make an extra trip because I left my phone charger at the dealership on accident.
The cost of the repairs and labor were reasonable, and they did an outstanding job. When it's time to buy a new Honda, I just might drive the 3 or so hours it takes to get there and buy from JOD.

I used my cell phone to browse the web for 5 minutes and found an identical car in Dallas for $700 less.  I verified equipment then asked this dealership to match.  The salesman took the offer to the sales manager and said ""yes, we can do that.""  I asked for it in writing and he wrote it down on the back of his business card.  We left for an hour to consider the offer.  We returned and our salesman was briefly visible for a few moments, then he disappeared and was replaced by a sales manager.  He showed me the contract, which was for the higher price.  I produced the offer on the card, he acted indignant (way over the top, bad acting) and immediately went and angrily paged the salesman over the PA system.  Of course the sales man was nowhere to be found, so the manager returned and said it was wrong and we had to pay the higher price.  We got up to leave.  He dramatically threw the card with the offer on the floor in front of me.  

This is old-fashioned, good-cop/bad-cop, rude, in-your-face, money grubbing car dealing.  If you like that sort of thing, come to Jack o' Diamonds.  In the age of the internet, however, I don't think any of us really need to put up with that.    ",1.3
