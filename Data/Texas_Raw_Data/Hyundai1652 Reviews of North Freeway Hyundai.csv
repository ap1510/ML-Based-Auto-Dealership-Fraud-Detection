1,"May 10, 2020","I called and informed them my back passenger door handle broke on a Wednesday and he informed me it would have to be painted and I said yes. Eric set up an appointment for me for Monday @9:30 the following week. I check in on Monday sit there for a while and a man tells me it has to be painted and I said yes I know he said he has to talk to painters. He returns and says there has been miscommunication and they will call me in a few days to bring my car in for installation. I said miscommunication, I discussed this with Eric before he set up my appointment, there was no miscommunication on my part just a waste of my time and energy. I leave and two days later they call to tell me to bring my car in and what time. I said how about 10:00 on Thursday & he says fine. I show up to check in and the guy says we don’t have you down for an appointment, then goes inside & says they have open order. Fiasco to say the least. Not impressed with service depart, they couldn’t even bother to wash my car off. Employees don’t wear masks either. ",1.0

Having already bought two cars from North Freeway Hyundai myself, when my daughter needed a car for college, we went back there to see if they could find what she was looking for within her budget.
As ALWAYS, the sales and documentation / title staff were A+ ! What a POSITIVE experience all the way around ! 
Paul Peebles and his staff in every department always treat us with respect; are helpful to  a fault; and make the entire purchase experience hassle and stress free. THANK YOU !!
I can HIGHLY RECOMMEND North Freeway Hyundai !
You will DEFINITELY be selling me and my family more vehicles in the future ! ",5.0
3,"March 21, 2020",We had the pleasure of meeting John Lewis who did an excellent job assisting us with the purchase of a 2020 Palisade. He made the car buying experience very easy and comfortable. We would be happy to return to him in the future should we need an additional vehicle. ,5.0
4,"February 10, 2020",Took my Equus in for warranty work and the service manager Brandon got me right in and delivered car back to me a day earlier than promised.  A lot of dealerships give you the run around but I'm very pleased with my experience at North Freeway Hyundia  Service work can be frustrating sometimes but this was a very good job by all the employees that I came in contact with.  ,5.0
5,"February 08, 2020","I feel like royalty when i come here for service. Brandon, in service, always takes time to educate me about my car and how I can do things myself to save me time and money in the long run. And if I cant, He always gets me in and out in a jiffy, and saves me money. Love this place. They really try to help me out. ",5.0
6,"December 22, 2019",I took my Santa Fe Sport in for 15K oil change at North Freeway Hyundai and always amazed with the friendly service and caring staff. I always walk around the showroom and a friendly face always greets me. I had an interesting talk with JD Michon on the Genesis cars.,5.0
7,"October 09, 2019","I took my car to North Freeway Hyundai yesterday for scheduled maintenance, and my car was taken care of by Clay Nedal in a short period of time.  Clay even explained the details of my bill.  While waiting, salesman Zachary Sckittone took the time to show me the new features coming in the 2020 models.  It was an enjoyable experience.",5.0
8,"September 17, 2019","I bought a car recently at North freeway hyundai and the salesman is Jean Babtiste Leconte.  Mr. Leconte sold me a car which he knew had a broken hood release mechanism that release the hood;  that's why he had the hood already up before I had the chance to try to open the hood myself,  so I couldn't attempt to look under the hood and detect the hood release mechanism was broken.  If I had known that the car had a broken hood release mechanism I would never have bought that car, and Mr. Leconte  knew it.  He had the hood up on that car already by  pulling a string that no one should have to do just to open a hood of a car.  When I returned the car back to North Freeway Hyundai to complain about the hood release lever not working,  Mr. Leconte made outlandish reasons why the mechanism was broke including I could have ""damaged the mechanism when I drove it .""  Mr. Leconte was determined to take of advantage of me to sell me a car which had mechanical flaws under deception only because I am a  woman.  I doubt very seriously that he would make any attempt to sell a car that has  significant damage to it if a man was considering  on buying the car out of fear of a  reprisal from a man.  I will never buy a car from North Freeway Hyundai again because of sales people like Mr. Leconte who practice unethical, dishonest tactics in order to sell defective cars to people especially women.  Mr. Leconte has made North Freeway Hyundai look bad.",1.0
9,"August 29, 2019","I dealt with the Internet Sales Manager, Pat Barcas who was very professional,honest and transparent from start to finish during the buying process. It took two different attempts to work out a deal but it happened thanks to his personal involvement and efforts. He was fair during our negotiations and did exactly what he said he would do. There were no surprises, hidden agenda's or anything under the table. I would purchase another vehicle from him and would recommend to anyone I know who may be in the market for a new Hyundai.",5.0
10,"August 27, 2019","I recently bought a 2014 Jeep from this dealership.  It was a 2 day process because they had to replace a windshield.  The salesman I dealt with (JD) was the only bad part of this deal.  He was constantly wrong with my deal, and even started arguing with me when I went to finalize the paperwork.  I asked him for a simple inspection date, and you would thought I requested a complete overview of every item ever listed in the history of Jeeps.  Even my wife (who is a saint) couldn’t believe how rude he was with such a simple request.  The Sales Manager and Finance Manager were great, but please do yourself a favor and avoid this rude guy if you decide to purchase a vehicle from there.  ",2.6

13,"April 27, 2019","When having my car serviced I was welcomed by Mr. Michon in the waiting area.  I mentioned that
I would be buying another car in April and he immediately gave me his card and took my phone
number.  He did a friendly, but not aggressive,  follow up call.  When I called a week later to ask for an appointment with him, he took all the information on what I wanted in a vehicle, and when I arrived he was prepared with the perfect car and a friendly, professional attitude.  The paper work was well organized and rapidly completed.  Throughout the process I felt that Mr. Michon was  a man of integrity.

Although I declined the moon pie, I left the dealership knowing I had been treated with respect and honesty.  ",5.0

74,"August 28, 2018","I chose to write this review because I was completely satisfied with the experience I had with North Freeway Hundai.  While my contact was primarily with the online salesperson, Randy, and not with the dealership itself, I have always felt that the quality of the customer contact person reflects the business for whom they work.  As a former CEO, it is my strong belief in the critical importance of hiring well and supporting the work of your team.  That is the key to any successful business.  Since this was the first time I purchased a used vehicle online, I had a series of reasonable, yet pointed questions regarding the vehicle I purchased and the process I would be going through.  Randy was accessible at all hours of the day, night and week, including the weekend after hours, and took the time to respectfully respond to all of them.  When I received my vehicle across state lines, it was transported, without any problems, to my home, as promised.  They used a transport company that was responsible and responsive.  The vehice is remarkable and I am completely satisfied.  I would recommend this dealership to anyone who is interested in purchasing a vehicle, sight unseen, without concern that a promise made will not be a promise kept.",4.8

77,"August 22, 2018","I walked into the dealership not knowing much about the product, only what others have told me. I knew what I needed and what I could afford going in and was immediately greeted with a sales manager who was very accommodating and inviting. He then headed to get a sales person to assist me. That is when I met Randy Breaux. Randy listened to my needs and really applied them to what products we could start looking at in the price range I could afford. I was with Randy for atleast 3-4 hrs looking at and test driving the different products we thought would be in the price range that we discussed. He helped me look and consider all options new and used. I really felt comfortable with his suggestions and felt he really listened and understood what I was looking for. Almost like a father teaching his kid. THat first day I was unable to meet the payments for the products and walked away. Later that evening Randy callled me and was very confident in the Elantra and suggested I atleast take a look at it. The next day I came down and found that he was right. The car met my family’s needs and met the payment I could afford. When meeting with the financial person I felt at ease talking to him about the money of the deal. He also was very impressive and not ever pushy. Which is nice when dealing with the logistics of buying a car. THe staff at north freeway has definitely impressed me in their humble nature and realistic views in dealing with customers in the situation I was in. I am also impressed at the product and confident that it will continue to work for my family.  I appreciate everything Randy and the staff at north freeway Hyundai has done for me and they will forever have my business. I am very glad I walked in that Saturday. ",5.0

313,"September 17, 2017","First, I was informed that if I left them positive feedback on Google or other sites that they would install window tinting on my car for free. I would save about $150 from having to do it myself. I have decided that the truth is more important than the money I would save. So here is the truth about this dealership. I was shopping for a car as a replacement to one my son killed in the recent Hurricane Harvey and so I decided to give him my new Prius V (Love that car!) and replace it with a high-end cushy Genesis G80 Ultimate package. So far, I love the car itself BUT no one ever took the time to explain anything about how the car works, maintenance requirements or any of the many perks that come with the purchase of a Genesis like Service Valet. Then when I got home, the next day I realized they let me leave the dealership without the lug key required to remove my wheels if I got a flat. I reached out to the salesman various times during the week and that is when I saw the real way they treat customers. Nice folk if you are actually in the act of buying a car but don’t have any time for you after you have already purchased the car. All I kept getting was the same “Oh, I am sorry. We are getting slammed by people wanting to purchase cars” throughout the week. My needs were never a high priority to them; only selling more cars was important. At the end of the week, when I was attempting to start using some of the perks for purchasing a Genesis I found out that they let me leave the dealership without any and I do mean ANY of the sales documentation. Not even what my final deal looked like. How much I paid for the car. No documentation for how to create Genesis accounts or sign up for anything. The finance guy handed me an envelope at the end of my deal and I assumed that all I required documentation was in that envelope. Nope; Nada!  Just some Platinum warranty documentation for 0$ deductible 10 year 100K mile bumper to bumper warranty contract I purchased, an odometer statement and literally nothing else. Can you believe they sent me on my way without even documentation for how much I paid for the car; that the car was even mine or a method of taking my tire off in an emergency. No return phone call back to me that the key was even ordered for me until I reached out to the dealership general manager’s office. BTW, my car purchase price was $48500 ish cash deal so you can imagine what you might get in terms of customer satisfaction if your purchase price is less. At no time did anyone explain anything to me. My hope is that now that the general manager’s office is involved things might get better. I will update my review of this dealership if things get better but as for now, I would rather take my new car to a Ford dealer for service than North Freeway Hyundai. I could not image what my next visit to this dealership might yield.

359,"August 13, 2017","I recently bought a car from Hyundai North Freeway and was the worst decision I had made. First my sales guy Paul Clos that was selling the car was too busy with other customers to fully help me with the cars that I wanted to look at which I set up an appointment with. When I found one car that I liked the trunk did not open and I went to talk to Paul and he told me that he would have to charge 250 dollars to fix the trunk. Which was ridiculous because they are going to have to fix it anyways. After I found another car that I liked I talked to the financial guy and could not get a loan through them because I am a first time buyer. I decided to go through a credit union, but I already singed the paperwork that states that the car is on hold for 15 days so I can get payment for the car. The next day I got a call from the dealership saying that I need to pay or that they are going to put my car back onto the market. That this caused me stress because of waiting on the credit union that nothing was in my hands. After dealing with the credit union and getting the car I was told that there were not problems with the car. When I received the keys for the car and asked if there was another key and told that there is only one if I wanted another one I should have worked it into the deal but I was not informed of this information. After receiving the car and having it for two days I realized that there were problem and I went to pep boys and told that I need new tires and a alignment ASAP. Disappointed I emailed the dealership telling them of my situation and was told that they never said the car was in “good condition” that it my problem not the dealership.

My favorite thing is how quickly the sales person (Randy Todd) gave me the bottom line price. He was very familiar with the vehicle I was interested in and completely understood all of the promotions the dealer was currently running. There were no shady sales tactics or unnecessary wait time during the pricing negotiations. The only time I had to wait was for the financing department, and when I had to wait, I was put in the comfortable VIP room with satellite TV. One day prior, I visited Munday Chevrolet and although they were quick to get me into a vehicle for a test drive, the sales associate did not seem familiar with the particular vehicle or any promotions they were running, did not ensure my comfort or respect my time. I had to wait over 45 minutes for the sales person to agree to the advertised price on their website and even then they lied about having two other people interested in the same vehicle. They were pushy, unprofessional, and forced me to wait.  North Freeway Hyundai is the exact opposite of Munday Chevrolet.

508,"May 04, 2017",My experience was ok the day I bought my SUV but my experience after I bought it has been difficult and frustrating. My sales person did not follow up with me after I bought the car nor did he return my phone call. It is horrible that I have to take a survey in order to get the things that is wrong with my SUV fixed and get a free tint on my SUV. When I called the service department the gentleman named Brandon was nice but I just feel like my sales person could have been more involved and he seemed really nonchalant about everything. I wish I had a more engaged and willing to assist me kind of  sales person.  I may recommend someone one day because my experience while buying the car wasn't bad but I just feel like you have to still care about your customers or clients even after they buy a vehicle.,2.2

I told him specifically what I was looking for, asked him to check his inventory and let me know if my goal was attainable.  Within 30 minutes, I had a call back with several options meeting my criteria.  Honestly, the hardest part of the transaction was deciding what color vehicle I wanted to buy!  My salesperson was personable, able to answer all of my product/feature questions, spent plenty of time with me and ensured I was not rushed.

536,"April 19, 2017","After many years (yes, years) of research and contemplating upgrading to an SUV, my husband and I finally purchased a 2017 Hyundai Tucson Limited from North Freeway Hyundai.   We had a very specific list of requirements for our vehicle and I had a bottom line price in mind. I wanted to be that person that gets an exceptional price on TrueCar.com, and I succeeded! I sent a detailed email with my list of features and our budget to six Houston area Hyundai dealers. This email was not just a test of whether the dealer had the car I wanted at a price I wanted, but also a test of whether they would honor my request for transparency up front. Kerry Smith from North Freeway responded with two options for our vehicle and pricing for both.    When we arrived to test drive the vehicle it was ready out front for us. Kerry was available to answer all of our questions but didn't linger needlessly as we explored the vehicle, and he even suggested we test drive the car on our own. He honed in on what we were interested in about the vehicle (tech features, safety, warranties) and didn't bother wasting our time on things we didn't care about (engine, technical specs, dealer add-ons). While we were test driving, he appraised our trade in and offered a surprisingly fair price. Before we left that evening, we did talk pricing, and we were about $500 off from my desired price point, but I knew we could make a deal when I returned with a check in hand. Sure enough, we return the next day and I show a competitor's price on an identical vehicle, and Kerry matched it! Overall, Kerry was friendly (but not overbearing) and respected my requests for transparency and efficiency in making a deal.   We had to wait about an hour to get in with financing, but the VIP room we were shown to was comfortable with a big screen TV and free sodas, coffee and water. Overall, I thought the entire dealership was clean and nicely updated and all the staff were all consistently cheerful. The financing advisor -- Larry -- was knowledgable, prepared, and efficient as can be when signing so many documents.   BONUS POINTS: We brought our well-behaved beagle both times we visited the dealership because I can't bear leaving her in the evenings after working all day, and everyone at the dealership was so nice about her being with us.",5.0

I went to over 7 different dealerships Different type of Cars and models.  Looking at many different types of cars and models.    They asked me all the same questions. What is you  want your features etc etc.  But not you guys. They did not try to pressure me. Keep in mind I sell for a living... So I understand a sale.  I sell ads in a print magazine so I know how to pitch a sale.. Also I'm almost 55 years old ha..  So bottom line..  I walked into your dealership and had the pleasure of meeting Joseph Perri .   He didn't bullship me (He was easy going).. Did not try to oversell me.  Try to pressure me into anything. He did not ask me stupid questions and waste my time.. (Lord you don't even want to know about the other deanships that wasted my time.. and by the way that was such a waste of time...)

No pressure. and the next day that was it.. both Wells Eckhardt and Joseph Perri worked with me. So ask yourself.. I actually had a obligation to go to Ford.. Yet I walked away with a Hyundai.

695,"December 21, 2016","Was contacted by internet salesman.  I was using USAA's car buying service.  That service notifies multiple dealerships of the potential sale.  I thought I had a deal with another dealership that was a very good price, but when I contacted them to come and pick up the car, they said they were still trying to locate one in the area.  This, after they told me they had one in inventory. North Freeway Hyundai had said they would beat the other guys price by $100 previously, but I had already committed to the other dealership, and was not going to break my commitment for $100....my word that said I was going to buy a car.  I'm an old guy. Was raised that my word is my bond.  Obviously, a lot of car dealerships don't work that way. When I  called North Freeway back, salesman said yes they had the car, and yes they would honor the price. When I showed up to pick up the car, the salesman and his mgr. indicated I could get another $500 off the price because I was a veteran.  They brought it up and made me aware of this.  They didn't have to. Buying a car can be a real PITA, but not if you do it from these guys.",5.0

702,"December 15, 2016","The sales part was great 5 years ago when I bought my car. but the service department is beyond HORRIBLE!!! First they had my car for over a month working on repairs. The week of Thanksgiving they called and said my car was ready to be picked up.  I live 45 miles one way from this dealership.  When we arrived three diffent repairs issues were not completed. They claimed they couldnt duplicate the repair issues,  yet when we got in the car 1. the window got stuck and would not roll up. 2. electric seat got stuck and wouldn't move. 3. The glove box was broken.
So yesterday I went to pick my car up and they called us that morning and said that the front passenger tire keeps going low and they have to add air to it. When I arrived at the dealership, I asked them was there a problem with the tire and they showed me that they had to put a plug in it...and do so without communicating back to us or our approval. Come to find out they have ran over something at the dealership and then when I called and said y'all ran over something they claimed that I had ran over it yet I have not had my car over a month. The type of plug that they used, destroyed the tire so when I took it to Discount Tire they said that the tire has been damged with the plug that North Freeway Hyudai used to ""fix it""... also the dealership metioned, before I realized the tire was destroyed, had offered me $1,100 worth of new tires. North Freeway Hyundai are CROOKS!  
When I drove my car off of the dealership parking, my gas gauge showed BELOW E...EMPTY...in other words I was running on fumes and they could not even put $2 worth of gas in my tank. I returned the loaner car with way more gas than when I  got it.   When I received the loaner car they only had a quarter of a tank of gas but yet I returned it with a half a tank to three-quarters of a tank of gas... sorry sorry dealership!
Please don't have your car repaired here!",1.5
703,"December 15, 2016",We had an excellent experience at this dealership. We had previously looked at another vehicle at a Subaru dealership and left there feeling really upset and dissatisfied. We came straight to Hyundai after that because we always had good experiences with maintenance with our previous Hyundai and we ended up buying a car and feeling great about the purchase. There was no feeling of buyers remorse and we love the Veloster R-Spec we ended up buying. It turned out that we were Mike Houston's first sale and we think he did a great job. I can't remember the name of the finance guy we worked with but I remember that he is originally from Nigeria and he did an excellent job as well. He even was able to find us a better finance deal the day after our purchase and reduse our payments a little. We will definitely be returning for future purchases.,5.0

735,"November 17, 2016","I just completed purchasing a Hyundai Santa Fe Sport Ultimate vehicle through North Freeway Hyundai.  I used an online service and specified exactly what I was looking for and in less than an hour had an email from this dealership.  My contact was Randy Todd and he asked several more questions ending with what he could do to earn my business.   I said ""honesty & fair price.""  Randy was true to his word in delivering on both aspects.   I received emails letting me know that this dealership had several vehicles that matched my selections available.    I spoke with Randy the next day and in les than 24 hours I had a written quote that proved to be by far the lowest of the dealerships I visited.  When speaking with Randy he was VERY knowledgeable regarding the SUV and was able to answer all my questions.  During this conversation he educated me on several things I was unaware of which helped me to be a better consumer as I continued my search for the right deal.  I was able to ask the ""right"" questions at other places to help me narrow my search.  (Did the price include tinting and other ""extras"" that might increase my final purchase cost.).  I was also told of the free loaner car available at N Fwy Hyundai  if they ever have to keep the car.  I was also impressed with the 5 yr warranty and service department. 

Randy was a delight to work with.  He went over the vehicle after my purchase and even paired my cell/downloading contact info, etc...   He patiently explained all the options on the ""tech package.""  He then suggested I drive the SUV and return in a couple weeks when he knew I would be more familiar with the vehicle and also to ask any other questions that I would have.  Throughout the entire process Randy looked for ""incentives"" that helped reduce my cost even more.  
I am glad I followed up at the other dealers that contacted me, since I really do Know that I had wonderful experience and got the best deal through Randy Todd at North Freeway Hyundai!

Just this past Monday the rear view mirror came loose and vw as dangling by the wires. Again. I stopped by Hyundai and they said, no problem. Our Texas heat probably caused the adhesive to loosen.

I did not get that from their GM of Sales, Chris.  I had to have my 2013 Genesis Sedan fixed...had two bent rims, out of alignment, and unbalanced tires.  After they dodged me for 2 weeks, I finally spoke to GM of Sales and he was as arrogant and condescending as they come.  After owning several Lexus, Lincolns and Cadillac; I have never had anyone be so unconcerned and unethical.  What a shame.

853,"August 13, 2016","This review is for Exotic Cars of Houston ... North Freeway Hyundai's exotic used car department (?)

Be careful buying a vehicle from these guys out-of-state. It was a very poor experience overall. You'll see the white G63 I bought in the dealer header photo. Paid cash and had nothing but poor communication and lies after the sale. 

Several items were not discussed including dents and engine problems. On top of that the dealer agreed to cover our all-in-price agreed to (taxes, fees, etc) and then backed out of it. I have to take these guys to court now to get a resolution. 

I worked with Matt Blevins. 

In cases like this, it helps to have actual facts and evidence on hand. 

I have, in writing, you agreeing to an all-in-price with no additional fees. As you pointed out, in AZ we don't pay tax with private party sales. I mentioned during the sales process that there was one other G63 from a private party that I was considering buying. You can see why I wanted an all-in-price, so that it was a comparable deal.

In addition to lying about the taxes and failure to disclose issues with the car... Exotic Cars of Houston isn't even incorporated or have a dealer license in the state of Texas (which they are going to hear about).",1.0

I purchased a vehicle and expected that the vehicle would be delivered in good working order.  The navigation system did not work when I purchased the vehicle.  I was led to believe that it was an easy fix and that the problem would be resolved in a reasonable amount of time.  It has been almost one month and I am still waiting for the correct SD card to be installed so the navigation system can work. I cannot believe that it is taking so long.

The wait between that part and make ready / financing was a bit long as we were there 4 hours when I've done the same many times in 3, but part of that was we spent a lot of time looking at various cars on the lot and Mark was patient.

They also held their word on our verbal agreement of no fees (like ad fees) just registration + tax.   So overall, it was a great experience.

My wife told him that I also had an old vehicle and that it would be nice if the both of us could drive off in new vehicles.  The salesman was able to work out an option and some numbers that fit into our budget, and we both drive off happy customers with new vehicles.

1144,"January 29, 2016","My decision to buy a new car came down to either a Lexus or Hyundai, and in the end I felt that Hyundai was the best option for what I was looking for.  I was thoroughly excited to purchase a 2016 Hyundai Sonata Limited.  Unfortunately that excitement would be crushed through a series of disappointments and failures on the part of North Freeway Hyundai of Houston.  I am a military veteran who utilized USAA’s car buying service, a benefit provided by them to members.  I received three different quotes from Hyundai dealers in the Houston area, see attachment 1 containing those quotes.  I have also attached a letter from North Freeway Hyundai’s President and CEO, Paul Peebles, who did not live up to the promises made in that letter.  I am fairly certain that his grandmother would not have received the same treatment that I have received.  
On December 30, 2015 I showed up to North Freeway Hyundai at 10:00am, excited and ready to purchase my new car.  Per the letter I received, I never received a phone call from a member of his management staff, instead I received a call from Shellie who is not a member of his management staff, nor was she anyone who could make a deal with me on the phone.  I met with her once I arrived at the dealership, and she linked me up with Ash who is a salesman.  Ash linked me up with Ty to take a test drive because he (Ash) was busy with another customer.  The test drive went well and I was more than happy with the vehicle, features, and how well it drove.  At this point the only issue was they did not have the vehicle I wanted on the lot, a 2016 Black with tan interior Sonata Limited.  
I can’t remember the man’s name who took me on the test drive, however, he worked entering my information into their system to get the ball rolling to make a deal.  Finally Ash showed up and we started working toward making a deal.  He put some numbers together and made an offer of $35,000 and some change, I don’t recall what the exact numbers were over $35,000.  I told him that I was thinking more around $30,000, that I already had an offer from Hub Hyundai for $30,945.  Mind you this back and forth game is contrary to the letter sent to me up front.  He went to the sales manager Jeff, who came back to the office to talk to me.  I told both of them about the offer I received from Hub, and Jeff told me that I must not have read the fine print.  Jeff stated that there was no way they were selling it for that much, and that if they were they were losing money. He went on to tell me that I should go buy it there if they were willing to take a loss on the sale.  I was well aware of each quote and the dealer installed items that made the difference.  I don’t race cars and have no need for nitrogen to be put in them, and I wasn’t going to bring the car in every six months to have it detailed.  Not to mention that the quote they sent me showed the car detail service for $591, and in store they wanted to charge me $695.  I should have went with my instincts at this point and went somewhere else.  I am a professional who knows how to read a simple quote sent to me, and this totally went against the letter sent to me by their President and CEO. Ultimately, Jeff made the same offer made to me by Hub.  So this proved that neither he nor Hub was taking a loss on the vehicle at that price.  This is the exact reason why people hate buying cars, and supports the bad reputation cars salesmen have as being sly and use all kinds of tactics to screw people over with for their own personal gain!  
The deal was made and we started the paperwork for me to purchase the vehicle.  Several hours had passed and I told Ash that I needed to leave soon if we couldn’t finish up the transaction.  The only thing they needed from me at this point was a copy of my DD214 to get the military discount of $500.  I immediately got online and got a copy for them without delay.  Eventually I made it to the finance department where I met with Dave, who told me that he literally had my file on his desk for 18 minutes.  He asked me why I was there for so long, and I told him that I had no idea.  He stated that they strive to get people in and out within 3 hours.  At this point, I had been there for over 4 hours.  While working on closing out the deal, Dave proceeded to tell me that part of his job was to sell extended warranties.  He stated that it was the end of the year, and that he was one of the top sellers of extended warranties, and that I would really be helping him out if I purchased one.  Rather than selling the warranty for what it is, he was more concerned about winning an award for himself.  What an insult, I really could care less if he wins an award or not.  This is a pitiful attempt in my opinion, and not something a buyer wants to hear when already spending a large amount of money.  In my opinion the extended warranty speaks for itself, you either want it or you don’t.  The paperwork was finished up, and I’m walked out front to make the down payment and meet back up with Ash.  I’m thinking that after the payment I will be handed the keys to my new vehicle and be sent on my way.  Instead I’m told that the vehicle is being brought in from Austin, I will be given a loner, and my vehicle will be ready in the morning.  
I asked Ash if they could deliver the car to my residence since I was there for so long, and he stated that they would deliver it to me.  Ash stated that my vehicle would be arriving later that night, and he would deliver mine in the morning after it is detailed.  On December 31, 2015 I called the dealership at 9:46am to see what time they would be delivering the vehicle, I needed to take a friend to the airport who had been visiting for the holiday.  I was transferred to Jeff, who stated that he came in, got busy, and forgot to send someone to get the vehicle.  Jeff told me that they would not be able to deliver the vehicle until later in the evening.  This shows that I was told a lie that my vehicle was arriving the night before, and was lied to about it being on the way.  At 10:35am Ash called me and stated that the vehicle would not be in until late that night, and that they would not be able to deliver the vehicle until the next morning January 1, 2016.  He stated that they would detail the vehicle in the morning and then bring it over to me.  I asked him if he could have the windows tinted for me before they delivered it.  On the day of purchasing the vehicle, he told me that they would tint the windows for free if I gave them an excellent rating.  Ash told me that I hadn’t completed the survey yet, so they could not tint the window for free.  I told him that I didn’t care about the free tint and would pay for it myself.  At this point there was no way I was giving them an excellent rating.  He said that he would talk to the tint guy the next morning to see if he was available to do the job.  I asked him to go ahead and check now to make sure the tint guy didn’t get booked up, and to call me back and let me know for sure.  If not, I wanted to make my own appointment somewhere else after they delivered the vehicle, as I was taking a trip to Dallas on Saturday morning.  He stated he would let me know, but never called me back.  At 11:46am on Friday, January 1, 2016 Ash called me and said that he would be on his way within the next 15 minutes to deliver the vehicle.  He arrived at my residence around 11:00am and we exchanged vehicles.  Ash did not go over the vehicle with me regarding how things worked, he only asked me if I had any questions about the vehicle.  I told him that I didn’t have any questions, and he got in the loaner vehicle and left.  At that time I did not have any questions because I hadn’t been in the vehicle yet.  I later had questions that I figured out on my own by reading the manual and watching videos on YouTube.  
Later that evening I picked up some friends and went to a gathering at a friend’s house.  While there, I showed off the Blue Link app and what it could do.  I went to show them how the app could locate where my vehicle was, however, it did not locate my vehicle which was sitting less than ten feet away from us.  The app said that the vehicle had to be within a one mile radius to locate it.  I didn’t think anything of it and continued to show off the other features of the vehicle.  On January 2, 2016 I left for Dallas around 11:00am and entered the Dallas address into the navigation system.  Upon further inspection, I noticed the navigation system did not show me to be sitting in my driveway.  It showed that I was somewhere totally different.    

North Freeway Hyundai was on my way to Dallas so I stopped by there for them to look at what the issue was.  I pulled into the service department only to find out it would be at least a two hour wait to have my vehicle looked at.  I went to the front where I talked to Shellie who called Ash, who sent me to Ty.  None of them were helpful or went out of their way to get me taken care of, even after telling them this was a brand new vehicle that was delivered to me faulty.  I left and went to Dallas with an inoperable navigation system, resorting to my smart phone to give me directions.  I made an appointment for Monday at 1:45pm at North Freeway Hyundai through the Blue Link app to have the issue looked at.  I arrived at North Freeway Hyundai around 12:30pm and they took the vehicle back right away.  About 10 minutes later Brenden in the service department made contact with me, and told me that the vehicle had a bad antenna and they would have to order a replacement to fix it.  He told me that they did not have an antenna in stock, and would be ordering one to be sent overnight.  At this point I asked Brenden if the General Manager was available, and he contacted him for me to talk to.  A little while later I met with Chris the General Manager.  We went to his office where I explained everything I had been through to this point.  He apologized and stated this was not the experience they wanted buyers to have.  He gave me a card for a free oil change, and stated they would order my part right away and put me in front of the line when I brought my vehicle back.  I also told him about the window tint “incentive” if I gave them an excellent rating.  He said he knew about it and hated that they have to do that to get good ratings, which they strive to get at least a 9.5 rating on every sell.  I told him that while I understood wanting to get a good rating, they were going about it the wrong way.  I told him that they are not getting honest or accurate ratings by bribing people, otherwise we probably wouldn’t be having the conversation we were having.  I discussed the other issues with him and he stated he was sorry that I had to go through all of it.  I told him that they really ruined my excitement of having a new car.  He thanked me for bringing these items to his attention and I left.    
On Wednesday, January 6, 2016 Brenden called me about 10:00am and stated the antenna was in.  I told him that I would be there around 11:45am, and arrived at noon.  They took my vehicle back to make the repairs.  At 5:30pm my vehicle was finally ready and I left.  This was an excessive amount of time for anyone to sit in a service department, someone should have told me it would take that long to repair. Either way, I left the dealership worn out and went home after sitting there for five and a half hours.  Brenden thanked me for my patience waiting that long without complaining, and he gave me a card for two free oil changes.    
On Thursday, December 7, 2016 I got into my vehicle that morning to go to work, and noticed that something didn’t look right on the headliner above the right rear passenger door.  It looked like the headliner had a crease in it.  I looked at the same spot over the left rear passenger door, and it was obvious that there was damage to the right side.  When I arrived at work I took a picture of the damage and sent an email to Brenden.  I told him that I was more upset that no one in the service department said anything about the damage, I had to bring it to their attention.  Maybe the repairman didn’t know about it, but I seriously doubt that.  Besides, where is the quality assurance/quality control?  This along with the faulty GPS makes two failed quality checks!  A little while later Brenden responded stating that he was not in, and would follow up with me the next morning on Friday.  Later that day, Tim the Service Manager called me and asked me to send him the pictures.  I sent the pictures over to Tim, and he asked when I could bring the vehicle in for them to fix it.  I told him I could bring it in that day, or the next morning.  He asked me to bring it in the next morning at 8:00am, which I did.  I dropped my vehicle off at 8:00am on Friday, December 8, 2016, and they gave me a Santa Fe loaner vehicle.  This vehicle was dirty inside, had a credit card machine in the back of it, and was not full of gas even though they showed it to be on the loaner paperwork.  Around 6:00pm on Friday Brenden called me and stated that their service guys could not repair the damage, he stated that the trim guy would be in Monday to see what he could do to fix it.  Brenden stated that Tim said this was a new vehicle and needed to be fixed properly, that using steam to try and fix it was not good enough. Brenden told me that the trim guy would be in on Monday to look at it, and he would contact me regarding the repair and give me a better idea of when my vehicle would be ready. 
On Monday Jan 11, 2016 I hadn’t heard from anyone, so at 2:13pm I sent Brenden a text asking about the status of my vehicle.  Previously he told me to text him because he would responder faster than answering the phone.  At 2:30pm I called Tim because I had yet to receive a response from Brenden.  Tim never answered and it went to his voicemail.  I then called the service department and Brenden answered the phone.  He told me that he received my text, but he hadn’t had a chance to respond back to me.  He stated that they were able to get most of the creases out of the headliner using steam, but there was probably about 5% of the crease still visible.  He stated that he would text me pictures of it to see what I thought about it.  I told him that if it didn’t look exactly like the other side, he didn’t need to send me the pictures as it wasn’t acceptable to me.  He said that he was going to send them anyway, so I could at least see what it looked like.  I also told him that I wasn’t satisfied with the Santa Fe loaner vehicle that they gave me.  I told him that I have been driving a Hybrid for several years, and that the Santa Fe is a gas guzzler compared to what I was used to.  On Friday when they gave me the loaner, it was the only vehicle that they had available at the time.  He asked me how many miles I drove to work, and I told him that it was 32 miles one way to my job from my house.  
At 4:04pm Brenden sent me six pictures that still showed the crease being visible.  I told him that this was a brand new vehicle and it wasn’t acceptable to me.  I told him that I was insulted if anyone thought that this was an ok repair job that I would be satisfied with.  I told him that if I damaged the loaner car they gave me, they would want it repaired back to the same condition it was in before the damage.  Brenden replied that he understood and just wanted to give me an update on my vehicle.  He also stated that he agreed with what I said.  He stated that he spoke with Tim, and they were going to replace the headliner.  He said he would call me the next morning to give me a better update on when my vehicle will be ready, and he would check to see if they have a more economical loaner car for me.  
On the morning of January 11, 2016 I submitted everything above this point to the online feedback email that I received from both North Freeway Hyundai, and to Hyundai USA.  I later received an email from Tim asking me for a contact number he could call me at.  At 11:15am he called me on the number I provided in my response.  Tim stated that he just got out of a meeting regarding the letter I sent, and that I had their attention.  Honestly, it should not have taken me spending a lengthy amount of time documenting my experience to get anyone’s attention.  Considering what all I had been through at this point, and both Chris and Tim knowing about it.  Tim apologized and said that they were going to use my letter as a teaching tool to help preventing anyone else going through what I have been through.  He stated that after reading my letter they realize how bad they had failed at providing quality service, and a good buying experience to me.  He said that they were going to make it right, and he would be in contact with me later about how they were going to fix things. Tim stated that I should not have waited for the antenna to be replaced, that it was a lengthy job.  He apologized for me waiting five hours for the repair to be completed.  I told him had I known it was going to take that long I would have made other arrangements.  He also stated that he talked to the repairman who stated that he did not realize or see the damage to the headliner, he stated the repairman was experienced and came to them from Lexus.  I told him that I understood that I could have been missed, but there should have been a quality check before the vehicle was given back to me.  He agreed and stated that is something that they will be working on.  Tim called me back at 4:03pm and stated that they had some options for me to consider.  He stated that the trim guy was making more repairs to the headliner, and they are telling him that it will be about a 90% fix.  He stated that it would still be visible but not stand out like it did before.  He stated that due to the car being new that parts were not readily available yet, and that it could take 2-4 weeks to get a new headliner in.  He wouldn’t have an exact time until he placed the order.  Tim proposed that they finish up the repair, detail the vehicle, and deliver it to me tomorrow to look at.  He stated that it was completely my decision on how to proceed.  He said to take a look at the repair, and if I was ok with it they would compensate me.  He said that due to me taking a loss for the damage, they would write me a check for $400 to cover the loss.  Tim stated that if I was not happy with the repair, they would order a new headliner and replace it.  Because of the length of time that would take, he stated that he wanted me to have my vehicle back until then and they would make arrangements if I chose replacement.  
I told Time that I would look at it and make a decision, but I was concerned about long-term effects of the repair not holding up.  I told him that I would be using the sunroof often and concerned about the wind hitting the headliner and what effect it may have on the headliner.  He stated that the material they used to make the repair would probably hold up better than the rest of the headliner, and he said they would give me a written lifetime warranty on the repair as well.  Tim stated that they would have to remove the back glass to put in a new headliner, and that there wasn’t room to flex a new headliner making it a delicate repair.  He stated that humans and not machines would be replacing it, so there would be the possibility of something else being broken during the replacement.  He seemed worried that if something happened it would be more time that I would be without my car, and other repairs that would have to be made.  I told him that at this point I was already at rock bottom with the purchase, that it would be really hard to go any lower.  All I wanted if for the car to be repaired to its original condition and be done and move on with my life.  I told him I would be at home all day, and that I would take a look at the repair and let him know my thoughts. 
On January 13, 2016 at 1:52pm, Tim called me and told me that they were finish up the vehicle detail and would be headed my way within the next 30 minutes.  He said to take a look at the vehicle when I get it, then give him a call to let him know how I wanted to proceed.  I told him ok, gave him my home address, and the call was ended. At 3:30pm, my car was delivered to me at my address.  I exchanged the loaner vehicle for my vehicle and the delivery guy left.  I examined the repair job, and it was ok but not spectacular.  At this point I weighed my option of the $400 offer, and I considered what can of worms would be opened from the extensive repair job of having a new headliner installed.  In previous conversations with Tim, he stated that it was a big job.  He stated that they would have to remove the rear glass, and there were a lot of clips that hold the headliner in place.  He stated that humans would be doing the repair and not robots, leaving the potential for causing other issues.  I did not have any confidence in their ability to complete the repair properly based on what I had already experienced.    
At 5:27pm I called Tim on his cell phone and told him about my concern of causing other problems down the road, and I told him that I was concerned about the loss of value if I were to later trade my vehicle in for another one.  I told him that I had researched the cost of a new headliner, and from what I could find a new headliner would cost $800. I told him that I was confident that they probably didn’t want to tackle the job, and I was hesitant about what issues may arise from replacing the headliner.  I told him that I would be willing to accept the repair if they were willing to compensate me with $800 based on the cost of a new headliner.  Tim stated that he understood my concern, and that in his years of experience in the business he didn’t feel that the damage would have a big effect if any on a trade-in.  He said it was possible, but he didn’t think it would be an issue.  Tim stated that he thought $800 was a fair offer.  He said that he was authorized to approve it and even though he thought it was fair, he wanted to discuss it with the owner first.  He stated that as soon as he had an answer he would give me a call and let me know.  
On January 14, 2016 at 11:29am, I received a call from North Freeway Hyundai letting me know that my licenses plates were in and ready for pick-up.  I arrived at the dealership around 4:15pm and picked up the plates.  When I arrived at home, I received the check for $235 dollars in the mail that Chris had promised to cover the window tint.  At 4:35pm Tim called me to discuss our conversation from the day before about the settlement.  Tim stated that I was pretty much right on with the cost of a new headliner.  He said that the dealership would pay less than a consumer, and they wouldn’t have to pay to have it installed.  I guess that the mechanics at North Freeway Hyundai work for free?  He said that they were willing to meet me somewhere in the middle and were willing to give me $600 rather than $800. At this point I just wanted to be done with them and get on with my life so I agreed to the $600.  
I have to say that North Freeway Hyundai attempted to make it right, but they could have done better.  Much better! Whoever thought that haggling for $200 after everything they put me through was a good idea really needs some remedial training in customer service? I was lied to about when my vehicle would be delivered after spending 5 hours to buy it, my vehicle was delivered faulty, I spent another 5 ½ hours waiting for the repair, my car was given back to me with damage that no one caught or failed to mention, my car sat in the shop for 6 days.  All of this was in the first twelve days of owning the vehicle.  I can tell you that I’m not anxious about buying another Hyundai anytime soon, if ever.  My wife owns an Acura, and I previously owned a BMW.  Neither of us have ever experienced anything like this at those dealerships.  I love my car, and honestly I would compare the amenities and comfort just as good as the Lexus ES300h (car I opted not to buy, and chose the Sonata Hybrid Limited instead).  North Freeway Hyundai blew a great opportunity to go above and beyond to make things right after so many screw-ups on their part. Needless to say, this will probably be the last Hyundai I will ever own.

1250,"October 27, 2015","What an awful experience. The first time I visited the dealership, I test drove a vehicle I was very interested in purchasing. It took approximately 45 minutes for the salesman to bring around the vehicle for me to test drive. I assumed it was because I stopped by on a whim and hadn't made an appointment - no big deal.

Three weeks after my initial visit, I was ready to purchase the vehicle. This would be my first ever new car buying experience (had only ever purchased used), and I did a lot of researching. I came to the dealership pre-approved for X amount from my credit union. I asked to be approved for a certain amount because I knew the MSRP, the sales price and I had price-checked and found out how much the same vehicle had been sold to other customers. 

Three days prior to coming to the dealership for the second time, I emailed the salesman I had visited with when I did my test drive. I told him the VIN's for the vehicle I wanted (their online records showed they had two in-stock). I knew there would be a chance the exact vehicle wasn't available since online records aren't always accurate, but I emailed him so that he knew what exactly I was looking for. Plus, I had already test driven the exact vehicle I wanted.

The day I visited the dealership (10/21), I yet again waited for 45 minutes while they attempted to ""find"" the vehicle I wanted. I brought my dad with me for extra support, so we walked around and walked around, until finally the salesman drove up with a car. It was the wrong color, but the correct trim, so I figured I would give it a shot. I opened the front door, and there was already a tear in the seat. The salesman acted shocked and said, ""Well here's what I can do, we can fix it for you or I guess I can find you another vehicle."" We then test drove it again, and I noticed that the dashboard display said, ""764."" And I thought that was strange. When we parked, the display said, ""766."" So I asked my salesman if that was number of miles on the vehicle, and he said no. Then he checked and retracted his statement and informed me that the 766 I was seeing was indeed the number of miles on the vehicle. I said between the tear and miles, there was no way I would be taking the car. I was a little offended that I said I wanted a brand new vehicle, and he had the audacity to show me a car that wasn't even the one I wanted and had nearly 1K miles on it. Maybe that's the norm for dealerships, but it was rather off-putting to me. He said he found the exact model that I wanted at a sister dealership and would have it brought to their dealership. My dad stepped in and said let's talk numbers first. The salesman started talking financing, and I told him my financing was in place. He didn't look pleased. He started adding paint features and more to the cost, and by the end, the vehicle was marked up about 2K before taxes, title and fees. I told him I had no interest in the special paint he was trying to sell me and that I wanted a lower number or the best offer they could give me. He laughed, went back to the financing department, and came back with the same price minus the paint features. He didn't even entertain the idea of trying to lower the price, and when I gave a number to put out some feelers, he said, ""Uh no one in the city will sell you that car at that price."" He then began to ramble about how they're a competitive dealership, etc. I said I would probably go look at Toyota and his exact words were, ""You do realize Toyota had a massive recall today right? Even 2015's and 2016's."" He then called over to the next cubicle next to him and said, ""How many were recalled?"" ""6.5 million,"" was what the other man responded with, and then my salesman said, ""See. While here at Hyundai we have the best warranties. 10-year warranties."" And my dad is frustrated by this point and said, ""Well I have an '08 Elantra that's AC went out right after its warranty, and no one was interested in helping out, so don't talk to us about how great your warranties are when the product fails once the warranty runs out."" The salesman didn't respond to my dad's comment and kept talking about how unreliable Toyota is. The fact he was willing to trash-talk Toyota was very petty and concerning, especially since the information he gave was utterly and blatantly FALSE. He refused to deal with us, so my dad said we were leaving, and we got up and left.

Because of his attitude, I drove straight to the Toyota dealership by my house and purchased a brand new 2015 Toyota RAV4 Limited with only 9 miles on it (4 were mine). I didn't have to wait and see if the one I wanted was in stock. My salesman drove me in a golf cart around the property to see what inventory they had. He played no games, showed me everything on the vehicle again (had test driven it before too). While it's not a 2016 (won't come out 'til Dec.), it has everything the Hyundai vehicle has. Great experience!

Would NEVER recommend North Freeway Hyundai. AWFUL service.

1299,"September 16, 2015","I went in to buy a Sonata, and the dealer did not have it on the lot. I was told they could get the car to the lot, no problem. So, I filled out the loan paperwork, and they ran my credit. Hours went by, and I needed to leave, and meet someone (It was 8pm at that point). I figured since they didn't have the car, I could come back when they did, and finish everything up. My salesman said he didn't think they could get the car to the lot without me signing the loan documents, so we asked his ""manager"". The manager (Chris?) told me that policy would not allow them to ""give up"" a hot car for me to get the car I was going to buy on the lot. So I left, and called the Hyundai dealership in Houston, and asked if they would get the car on their lot before I purchased it, and they said of course! So I called my sales guy back, and told him that if he didn't get it figured out, I would go to the Houston dealership to purchase the car. Then the actual manager (Jeff) calls me, and says he will get the car to the lot. Also, it not legally yours until you drive it off the lot, so I am not sure why they made such a bug deal about signing everything before I left... I did not have to leave a deposit for them to get the car to the lot. I felt like they gave the runaround, and were not taking my business seriously. I asked Chris, ""You're not going to give up a hot car for me? Because I am going to buy the car your bringing on the lot."", and he told me ""No."" Once that was worked out, and I met with the lender, he tried to sell me the actual warranty that covers all maintenance on the car. I suggest you negotiate this before meeting with the lender, as well as your interest rate. I believe the starting price he gave for extended warranty was $1599, but he ""used all his coupons"", and got it down to $999. I still think I paid too much. I wrote a personal check for the down payment, but needed funds to clear in my bank account from my investment account, and David Harvey said he would hold the check. He did not hold the check, and it was cashed the next day. Thankfully my bank protected my payments, and I was only charged an overdraft fee. I purchased this car 1 wk 2 days ago, and have not received any title paper work, or phone calls regarding its whereabouts. I did receive a notification today that a payment has been transfer from my bank account for my OLD CAR LOAN (The one I traded in for this purchase). My old car payment loan was supposed to be paid off, and my new car payment is not due until next month. So, now I have to get this cleared up as well, when it should have been done, and done correctly by their lending company. Overall, this experience has been, and continues to be a pain in the xxx.

More importantly, he wasn’t dismissive or disrespectful as some sales people are when you aren’t dressed a certain way. All in all, I had a very good experience, no waste of time, and because he knew the inventory, Mr. Bass was able to show me a few other options without spending a lot of unnecessary time walking around the lot.

All he was only interested in getting any information I needed about their vehicles and never once tried to push me into making a decision before I was comfortable. He took a lot of time with us explaining all of the electronics and the features of the car as well.  He had the maturity of someone much older and the energy to help us in any way he could.  Chris Thomas, the general sales manager was completely ethical and was enjoyable to do business with on these sales.  He has the perfect demeanor for his job.  He is factual and lets you know he wants to figure out a way to earn your business.  Never once tried to trick or deceive us in any way.  Chris actually found a rebate that we could use against the cars and what was unique about it was, it was after I had agreed to the deal.  He could have pocketed the money for the dealership I'm sure but wasn't willing to mislead us.  Dave Harvey and the Finance Mgr Frank Adames were both as honest as dirt.  They explained every detail of the paperwork and didn't try to hurry through the process. I asked several questions and they stopped what they were doing and explained in detail everything I needed to understand.

I have never been told by a Hyundai service department that if they find that the problem is not a warranty issue, like a rat chewing through a wire, or hitting a curb and knocking something loose, that I will be responsible for paying over $100 for them taking time to look at my car, whether they fix the issue or not. I can understand the cost of fixing the issue, but not the cost of just looking at it. I can understand if I was bring in a 2001 Toyota. But I am bringing in a Hyundai to a Hyundai dealership while under warranty, It is implied that while under warranty the dealership for that brand of car will check your car when it has mechanical issues for free, and if it isn't a warranty issue charge you for the repairs. I mean they sure do talk up how good having a warranty is when they talk you into buying that 10 year 100,00 mile extended bumper to bumper warranty, but if you want to get it looked at, you better bring $200, just in case the problem isn't under warranty. Because whether they fix it or not your paying. This was my experience at North Freeway Hyundai in Houston TX.

1553,"November 27, 2013","We were shopping for a new Sonata online and Ray was the first to reply us. When we came on a Saturday for a test drive, Ray was busy with other sales and he sent Dave Harvey to assist us instead, and he was very nice and helpful. Not sure if it was typical for them to let customers test drive on their own or they were simply too busy to tag along, we test-drove 2 cars by ourselves! I thought this is good practice because it can impress potential buyers and earn their trust. 

After agreeing on the price via emails with Ray, we returned to buy the car. Perhaps because we had no trade-in and came near closing time on a weekday evening, we were not pressured to purchase extended warranty and the whole buying process was smooth and quick. I appreciate Ray taking time to go over the car with us. 

Of course, we were relatively easy customers. I am sure we could have negotiated a lower price but didn't. We actually visited another Hyundai dealer which was closer to us than NFH. However, I was underwhelmed by the customer service at the other dealer. I made 2 online requests and even had a live chat with a rep who promised me someone would contact me but no one ever did, how strange! 

On the contrary, North Freeway Hyundai was prompt with their replies to me and provided all the info I requested. They definitely won me over with their customer service than the other dealer. Overall, we were happy with our buying experience at North Freeway Hyundai. I highly recommend Ray Funk and Dave Harvey.

I felt no pressure from Dave after returning to the dealership and told him i would think it over. I felt very comfortable there and did not feel hassled at all.

1635,"May 28, 2013","I was in the market for a new car so I shopped around and the Hyundai Sonata was the car for me.
It has a super high safety rating and has room from my family. Plus it gets excellent gas mileage.
As for Jeff and everyone at North Freeway Hyundai you can't ask for a better group of people. 
From the time we walk into the showroom the whole staff treated us like family. And they put us 
into a Sonata for a unbelievable price with all the options we wanted. So if your in the market for
a car don't hesitate to go see the folks at North Freeway Hyundai in Houston they will take really 
good care of you. Thanks Jeff and all of the folks at the dealership.",5.0

I knew he was a musician from our initial conversation, but after talking a bit longer on the test drive I found out he was in his church's praise and worship band at church like I am.

He asked what was important for me in a new car and got me the perfect car for less than I was expecting to pay. I recommend everyone call mark for an awesome deal!!",5.0

Mark called me first thing the next morning and within a couple hours and a couple calls, we everything lined up!

We just bought a car from North Freeway Hyundai and it wasn't because we wanted to, it's was because they will take advantage of you just for starting to make a deal with them. Stay away from this dealership, nothing they say can be trusted and they don't care if in the end your an unhappy customer. They will charge you for their advertising, $299 worth will show up on your contract and they won't say a thing about it, unless you call them on it. They took our trade in on a Saturday night and we made a deal on a new car, then noticed the contract was completely wrong so we called them early Monday morning and went back up there to get it strait. When we got there they started acting underhanded so we told them we wanted our car back. They said they already sold it and that we had to take their deal ( no three day grace with these people) they gave us no negotiation. Scott Thomas was the big shot there that likes to make women cry. Save yourself some grief and stay away from this dealership. ",2.2
1644,"December 12, 2012","The sales experience was a typical back and forth... we are losing $ on this deal for you. I recently completed the hyundai survey, reflecting my honest, unfavorable opinion of the sales experience, related to my salesman Terry Cowart, and the dealership.  A week later, Mr. Cowart TEXTS MY CELL PHONE, and states that I am the most miserable person he ever met, and could never be satisfied!  I'm still surprised at his anger, intimidation, and unethical behavior, which was minimized by his sales manager.  I have followed-up with the hyundai corporate office.  Avoid this dealership. Their management seems very unstable to allow this insane scenario to unfold!    ",1.4
1645,"August 13, 2012","I can'y say enough about North Freeway Hyundai.  I visited the dealering on 4 seperate occasions before actually purchasing and the customer service I received on each visit was second to none!

On my first test drive, Noel was extremely helpful in explaining the feature and differences between the GLS and Limited versions of the Hyundai Tuscan.  On my second visit, Noel was not available so Charles stepped in to help, while my wife took the test drive this time.  While my wife and I sat in the car talking over our options, Charles helped us narrow down what we needed vs. what we wanted and decided that the GLS was right for us.

When we got back into the office, we were greated by Noel who was now available and we began looking at the numbers.  We certainly didn't make it easy on them.  With the budget I had, and the negative equity on my trade, we had to do some work to get within my comfort zone.  After a little bit of negotiating Noel and manager Ray were able to help us get to a price and payment we were comfortable with.

The finance department went to bat for us as well.  We thought we had found the best interest rate out there through a credit union we belonged to but Howie was able to find one better, thus lowering our payment even more.  He explained our options with extended service and warranty plans, and again helped us make the best decision for our needs.

We are extremely pleased with how friendly, personable, reasonable and helpful everyone was during our purchasing process at North Freeway Hyundai.  I would highly recommend that anyone looking to purchase a Hyundai visit their showroom before anywhere else!",5.0
1646,"August 11, 2012","We did not have a good experience at this dealership. Please note that the prices advertised on their website are ONLY available IF you go with Hyundai financing, and if you do, you get a $1,000 rebate. The Hyundai financing is a terrible agreement (high % with balloon payment), so you'll have to transfer the loan soon after (a hassle). Furthermore, their fees are HIGH. Others have noted this. They will throw in a $299 consumer advertising fee (that other dealerships in town do NOT charge); a $51.70 inventory fee (again, not charged by other dealerships in town); and a $200 document fee (that is fairly standard, but usually the only fee you see). They do not explain this upfront. You will find out in the financing office. You may not be able to negotiate out of these. Furthermore, in our case, they added a $1,495 extended warranty without discussing it with us, and we did not see it until we were in the financing office. When we cancelled several days later, they ""lost"" our cancellation. They will also pester you about getting a ""10"" on the follow-up survey, including using pretty heavy guilt ploys. They do not, however, actually give a 10 in service. Please be wary of this dealership: 1) Avoid financing with them unless absolutely necessary; 2) be sure to read everything; 3) be sure to discuss FEES and EXTENDED WARRANTIES upfront. Compare apples to apples! You may get as good as or a better deal somewhere else when you account for the fees and the hassle of transferring the loan!",1.7
1647,"July 25, 2012","Where did the bad reviews come from? I went in with an offer from Manager Jeff, who introduced me to salesperson Charles D. He allowed me to test drive the car. I already knew the color I wanted might not be available; or, if it was, it was with trim package #2. So we worked with getting the same interior with a different color on the exterior. As to my trade-in, which was wrecked, they did not offer the amount I wanted. So Charles asked me what I wanted for my final price. We negotiated and got close to the amount I wanted. The entire experience was not painful. They are salesmen, but I drove off with a new car and I was happy. I think everyone did a great job, even the finance guy, Thomas. I didn't feel pressured. Loved them; you should visit this dealership.  I had already eliminated three other dealerships after talking to their salespersons and not liking the way they addressed the initial process of trying to start a car-buying relationship. ",5.0
1648,"March 23, 2012","On January 2nd Salesman got me the car I wanted and was satisfied with the sale until the Finance manager said that the hyundai warranty costs $1195. Since I liked the vehicle and wanted the warranty, I signed the paperwork and left. Once at home, I went through the Hyundai website to see if I had missed added costs on warranty and on not finding any, called Mr. Scott  just to make sure. He insisted that it did have a cost. I then called the hyundai 800 customer service line who told me I had purchased an extended warranty to give my car a total of 15 years. Now why would I want all those years of warranty especially if none can be transfered to a second owner?
Anyway they told me I could cancel and get 100% credit. I went to the Gen. sales mgr. to complain about it and he told me Mr. Scott would take care of it. Thomas claimed he had disclosed the infomation to me which was a lie and told me to sign a cancellation form. I cancelled it on 14th of January and was told it would be couple weeks before I got the credit. on 21st of February I called the dealership and they said the cancellation never went out until 26th of January. A week later, I called the warranty issuer who said they had sent a refund to the dealership. After another week I called the dealership which said they would send a check to hyundai finance once their statement reflected the issuers credit. I called hyundai finance yesterday (03/22/2012) and they said they hadn't recieved any check yet from the dealership. I went on to call the dealership and the accountant told me they had my check and have been backed up and would overnight it. Its 7pm and Hyundai finance don't have the check yet. Whats going on Mr. Scott and Team?
Mr. Scott obviously lied about the warranty, sold it to me for a commission and now together with the accountant are sitting on a check that belongs to the finance company making me pay extra interest. This is not the way to treat customers period.",2.4
1649,"June 30, 2011","Great new car buying experience.  Salesman, finance rep, and GM all were very good and handled deal in a straight forward manner.  Highly recommend this dealership. Haven't used service dept so I can't address that part of dealership.",5.0
1650,"June 18, 2011","Stay away from this place. Shady business tactics. 

They try to slide in hundreds of dollars in ""document"" and other fees at the end. Literally they print out all the documents and try to skip over all the fees. I refused to pay and was a real hassle but finally had them mostly removed.

The sales rep was nice and did a good job. However, I had a problem on the car that I discovered when we got home. We bought the car during the day so didn't see that the tail lights weren't working. called the next day and was told that the car was sold as is. Too bad. 

Real nice way to treat your customers. I tried calling a couple more times but wasn't getting anywhere. Decided to cut my losses and pay the $300 to get it fixed. 

No reason to go to a dealer you can't trust and treats its customers so badly. I am sure they could have fixed this for a few dollars but they certainly lost all of my future business and likely many others now. Poor way to run a business. ",1.0
1651,"April 04, 2011","My wife and I shopped for a new Genesis or Sonata for more than three months at numerous dealerships.  I was referred to North Freeway by my mother as she had purchased a vehicle from them in the Spring of 2010.  I went onto the website and found Jeff Bogle's name and email address at sent an email as to what we were looking for along with pricing quotes and trade-in value on our existing vehicle.  I was very forthright with him and gave him all of the information I had in hand as I did want to waste his time or ours.  I subsequently asked if he could make a better deal on eacch vehicle quoted as we did not want to exceed our budget.  Jeff responded immediately to my email and stated that he honestly felt like he could do it.  On Friday evening after getting back into town, I phoned Jeff to ask if he was available, however; he had already left for the evening, so we set-up a tentative schedule for the following morning to meet.  Upon arriving at the dealership, we sat down with Jeff for approximately 15 minutes as he listened to our wants and needs in the transaction of the new car.  He had a demo pulled around for us to drive, and proceeded to have our trade in evaluated.  (I had purchased a subscription to Consumer Reports Buying Guide on our trade-in, and both new cars) in addition to having the previous quotes in hand.)  Of which I dont feel that I even needed!  When we retuned from the demo ride, Jeff had everyhting togther as far as our trade value and new car price and he EXCEEDED the other quotes and was actually within the budget we needed to be!  There were absolutely NO GIMMICKS, SURPRISES, UNWANTED ADD-ONS, NOTHING!!!!!!  The price was the price and the deal was done.  All in less than 45 Minutes!!!!!!!!!! 

The next question I had was regarding financing, and I explained to Jeff that I did not want to get into financing and have the HARD-SELL on the extras.  Jeff assured me that would absolutely not be the case, and it wasn't.  We left adn came back about an hour and a half later as we had some errands to run, and Jeff ushered us into financing with Howard to sign the paperwork.  Howard was just as exceptional as Jeff was, and kindly explained the extended warranty to us, and after we declined, he moved on and had the paperwork signed and completed in less than 20 minutes!  

We essentially bought the car we wanted at the price we wanted in less time than it takes to eat-out on a Friday Evening!!!!  I can't say enough GREAT THINGS about the way in which we were treated by Jeff, and Howard at North Freeway Hyundai.  I would absolutely suggest anyone looking at buying a Hyundai visit with these guys!  They are Top-Notch and set the Bar exceedingly high for any future car buying for us!!!!!

Thank you so much for the incredible car buying experience!!!!!!!  ",5.0
