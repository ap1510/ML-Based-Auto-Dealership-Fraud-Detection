1,"March 16, 2011","I just purchaed my second CR-V from Brew Honda and when it comes time for a third I will buy it there as well.  Friendly folks, fair pricing, great service after the sale.  All that and a free car wash every time I bring my CR-V in for service.  Will definitely purchase there again and highly recommend to others.",5.0
