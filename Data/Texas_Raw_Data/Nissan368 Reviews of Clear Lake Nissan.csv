1,"November 07, 2019","SCAM!!! Watch out for $1700 Apex GPS add on. The advertised sales prices look good, but they hit you with unscrupulous add-ons and fees. The worst is a $1,699 fee for an ""Apex GPS security system."" 

Apex is an inventory management system created for car dealerships. They've just figured out a way to pass the cost onto unsuspecting buyers by packaging it as a high tech anti-theft system. What's worse is that Apex is used for target marketing. After you drive your car home, Apex tracks and sends mileage and other info to the dealer so their service department can send you advertising and coupons at just the right moment.

They tried to sell this to me on two different occasions. The first time, I told the salesman to take it off. He responded by offering me a ""great deal."" Since I didn't want it, he would take off $1,000 and just not activate the security monitoring. 

What a great deal - I'll pay you an extra $699 for an inactive GPS security system! What a joke.

The second time I tried to buy a car (different car, different salespeople) they tried to charge me $1500. I stuck to my guns. I was willing to pay the sales price of the car plus taxes, title, license, and even some doc fees. But they wouldn't drop the $1500 Apex fee. The used car sales manager straight up told me that the low advertised prices are necessary to get people in the door in this internet marketing age. He said all the dealers do it with an expectation that they will make money with a big addendum.

So there it is... Clear Lake Nissan's modus operandi. They advertise a low price to hook you, but they won't sell you the car unless you agree to the dealer fees and add-ons. Save your self the frustration and buy a car somewhere else.",1.0

3,"October 15, 2019","Clear Lake Nissan has an outstanding sales staff.  Kristyn met us at the door with a smile and went beyond the call of duty to help us find our ideal used truck.  Wonderful service at all levels -- online sales, in-house sales and finance.",4.6
4,"September 23, 2019","Well I am very upset because I emailed back and forth with a “Jasmine Miller” in internet sales or whoever or whatever responds to your emails yesterday.  I did not appreciate the fact that she, or whoever, lied by informing me the red SRX was still available then scheduled me for a test drive at 6p, when we last communicated after 4p. I ran a little late, but I did go yesterday. However, upon arrival was told it had already been sold yesterday Morning!!! If that was the case, I should’ve just been told that instead of being lied to...I don’t appreciate playing these games where apparently I was just reeled in even though they knew the vehicle I inquired about had already been sold thinking they could make a sale anyways if I showed!!! Your staff should be considerate about the fact that I lost my vehicle in the recent flood and don’t have time to be messing around with their games. Whether it be “Jasmine Miller” or whoever runs your email responses, either way, they didn’t even have the decency to tell me in my face. Instead they had the audacity to have the salesman which greeted me to relay the message, after which I walked out. Y’all should do better business!

5,"July 03, 2019","I will never buy from this dealership. I own a nissan and think very highly of their vehicles being reliable. The salesman I spoke with was very customer oriented and professional throughout my time test driving the car I was interested. The poor experience went all down hill from there. After the test, the salesman brought me back to his desk, while he apparently went to get his sales manager to discuss the numbers. This poor excuse for a human being had NO customer service skills what so ever much less professionalism about him. He totally negated my time and effort for travelling across town in Houston traffic to see a car and asked me on 3 occasions if I was 100% satisfied with the vehicle. I had asked him 3 different times what is the best price he could make on the car, is the internet price the best price, what makes you think I would not be interested in the car considering where I traveled from. Needless to say, the car profile shown on their website stated false information about NEW TIRES and the price listed being valid ONLY if you finance through the dealer. Also, the car was equipped with some APEX tracking system that the dealership adds to every car both new and used and the cost is $1200 with is added to the total cost of the vehicle. So BE WARE! I have bought quite a few vehicles, I believe 10 plus in my lifetime so far, and have never had an experience like this. I am in disbelief on how this dealership has such a good rating as it does. I was really disappointed in the total experience all together minus the salesman I dealt with.",1.4
6,"July 01, 2019","I was merely comparing vehicles for a friend. Budget wise I like the Rogue. Fantasy wise, I like the Armadi. The salesperson didn't treat me as if I was financially unworthy. We test drove both cars as if I was a you tube celebrity guest.",5.0
7,"June 21, 2019","I had the best customer service hands down, my salesman Serrick Auzston was very informative, knowledgeable, helpful, easy going, and he was not pushy.  He did not bug me, he let me look around without bothering me every five minutes.  I highly recommend this dealership and the salesman Serrick Auzston. ",4.8

9,"May 24, 2019","We walked into this dealership ready to buy. When we arrived, the Certified Pre-Owned Murano was waiting for us to test drive. The moment we stepped into the vehicle was when the horrible experience began. Besides our sales person, Andre, nothing we OK about this ""Certified Pre-Owned"". Cigarette burns in the seats, broken parts and pieces, broken shocks under the hood and very obvious repairs done under the hood....Certified pre-owned? Really? I could have bought this vehicle off the street. Once inside the ""used car sales manager"" was quick to tell us that he would drop the vehicle only $800 for the issues and we needed to take the deal now or it's off the table. He assured us we couldn't find a better deal on a certified pre-owned (if only the car was even close to that standard). When my fiance explained all the issues with the vehicle, the manager's tone changed and the only words out of his mouth the rest of the conversation was ""take the deal now, or I can't guarantee you anything."" although we were trying to logically discuss the issues with the vehicle, he obviously wanted nothing to do with us or selling the sub-par vehicle. Andre was the only saving grace and the only reason I am giving this dealership 2 stars. Good luck to Andre trying to sell cars that are falsely advertised and a sales team with that attitude around him. Can't be easy! We did end up buying a vehicle that evening from DeMontrond. Thank you to the DeMontrond team for the excellent service and showing us how a car dealership should treat their customers.  ",1.6

He truly cares about his customers. This is 60% of the reason I return for sales. The other 40% is because the service department is wonderful. They are friendly, prompt, and trustworthy. ",5.0
23,"January 04, 2019","I purchased a used Nissan Frontier from this dealership. Despite my objections, I was forced into their overpriced APEX protection and have been getting the run around about cancelling it ever since. I am extremely disappointed in my buying experience and will not be back.   ",1.5
24,"December 14, 2018","I hope this is helpful to you car buyers.

I believe this is not a honest way to deal with Americans. 
They gave a price of 11,993.00 and as we are accustom to plus the TTL
When the paper price came, they added almost $2k to the price, with what I understand was prepping the car to make it ready for sale, and a system I understand is a car locations system which I do not need. The $2k was something they added to the car already so if that was part of the cost of the car, shouldn't they just say the price is $13,993.00. 

I thought the car was still a good deal even paying $600 for a car locations system so I filled out the credit app thing on their website and they said I was approved and they setup a time for me to come in at 6:30 PM to purchase the car. I get there to find out, they sold the car to someone else. Why didn't they tell me, for me to hold the car, I would have to put money down. I wonder if the person who bought the car paid more than I was going to. 

I will never purchase a car from them and I would never recommend Clear Lake Nissan. 

Be well all.

27,"December 10, 2018","I refinanced my car 3 months after purchasing it. I obviously was due a refund on the GAP insurance I purchased when I purchased it.
I turned in the necessary paperwork for the refund. I was told 6 to 8 weeks.
As we approached that time, I called for a status check, a couple of times. My wife received a phone call from accounting stating if you refinance before a year was up, you don't get a refund.
That was NOT told to me two months prior. 
AVOID this dealership. VERY SHADY.

33,"July 17, 2018","Clear Lake Nissan does not stand behind their products. We purchased a car from them in February 2018. Unbeknownst to us, there was an recall notice on the car we purchased that was NOT repaired prior to sale. After repairing that recall, we immediately began to have problems with the vehicle. The vehicle has been in the shop under repair for 8 week!! (that's about 60% of our time of ownership) The car was returned to us yesterday, ""repaired"" and within hours the ""fixed"" problems were back. The repair process has been close to torture with Clear Lake Nissan taking little to no initiative to keep us apprised of the process. Our phone calls today have not been returned.",1.0

78,"August 19, 2017","I would give this dealership Negative 10 stars since they made me waste 3 hours of my time to supposedly sell me a used vehicle. I walked in one day and sat down with both the salesman and manager (manager was not friendly, but who cares its' business), and we respectfully walked away after reaching an impasse (we were fine up until this point). The very next day the salesman called and texted me repeatedly stating that his general manager would agree to sell me the vehicle at a certain price, to which I agreed. I stated that I would be in within 2 hours to sign, pay, and take receipt of my vehicle. When I arrived they were in the process of selling the same vehicle to someone else. The salesman went on to tell me it was first come, first serve, completely ignoring the fact that he had called and texted me. Needless to say this is easily the worst experience I have had when buying a vehicle, their word means nothing as all they did was bait me in and then sell the vehicle out from under me when both the salesman and general manager had both agreed to sell me the vehicle. DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THESE FOLKS, AT LEAST THE USED CAR SALES DEPARTMENT! THEY ARE TERRIBLE,and they think with a bottle of water or a cup of coffee they can be dishonest with their customers.

86,"July 14, 2017","I purchased my used vehicle about 3 months ago. I was impressed with the facility and the perks they offer while visiting (drinks and such). I purposely waiting to write my review until I was able to look over all the paperwork away from the dealer and let the dust settle if you will. Here is what I learned from this particular dealer and purchase. Now some of this can be on me for not paying closer attention when dealing with finance manager however if you have bought a car then you know paper is flying when you get to the finance manager. So here are my thoughts.
1. Make sure you are dealing on final price not the monthly payment. They will sneak in things if you are dealing on monthly payment and not bottom line price. (example when I looked at my paperwork I was charged $895 more than what the vehicle was advertised on the internet. More on this in a bit.
2. Make sure if they over you a perk (warranty, service package, ect...) you get it on there ""WE OWE"" form. If you don't get this info on this form and ask for a copy before going to finance you will be charged for it (as I was) when you think the dealer is picking this up for you.
3. Do not buy GAP insurance through this dealer. They charged me $995 and I later found it priced at $395. They WILL triple charge you on GAP. Also pay attention to the rate they offer you if you finance through the dealership as well as it will be higher than what you can actually qualify for by getting your own financing. 
I was hit with all of this from this dealer and although you can go home and study what they burned you on and then go back and cancel within 30 days you still feel taken advantage of. When I returned to this dealer in person to cancel my extended warranty which I was told they were going to pay for (Pay attention to that ""WE OWE"" Form), and to cancel my service agreement which I never signed for but they stated was including with this purchase all i had to do was bring it to their dealership for service (oil changes, tire rotation ect...). I ended up canceling over 3K in warranties, service plan, and gap insurance. So back to the $850 charge that was added to my vehicles advertised priced. When I tried to recoup this or ask about it I was told this is a charge added to price on all used vehicles for reconditioning fee. Cleaning, balancing tires, ect... This is mainly for used cars as the new cars will have this shown on the sticker.  So this $895 I have yet to get back however I am not going to give up. So once again ask what the final price of this vehicle is before going to finance. 
Hopefully this will help all of you who decide to use Clear Lake Nissan ",1.6
87,"July 14, 2017",I recently purchased a vehicle from Clear Lake Nissan and dealing with the staff was a pleasure.  I had a specific vehicle in mind that I had seen advertised on the internet and expressed an interest.  The sales representative (Jeff) had it ready for me whenever I arrived and did not try to push me for upgrades and extras that I did not want.  I wanted to pay cash for the car and the finance group didn't try to get me to go through their financing sources (as some have done in the past) and all the paperwork has been handled efficiently.  I would recommend the deal and Jeff both to others. ,5.0

90,"July 05, 2017","The overall experience of buying a new Titan was great. I already did all of the homework and had the truck picked out before I went up there so the sales part was easy for the guys. Traded in my Ford and got less than what was even on the trade in valet but I'm not one to argue so I went with the sale. The approach of trading and buying new was great and would definitely go back. Reason for the 4 stars is for buying a truck that was brand new and it had many surface scratches and some marks that went passed the paint. The correction was done by buffing out some spots and the other was taking a paint marker to a brand new truck and not fixing the paint correctly. Granted, the spots are covered but you can clearly tell where the marker was used. Would have been nice if the paint was taken care of professionally and repainting the spots that needed but you can tell that it was amateur quality and just need to make sure that when you buy new and you see these spots, have them fix it before you drive off the lot.

In 2005, she went to Baytown Nissan and had a great buying experience for me. In 2015, I decided to buy another Nissan, of course my mom is not here to go with me, but I found myself at several Nissan Dealerships, but I felt uncomfortable at numerous dealerships in the Houston, Baytown area. So, I traveled several miles away from where I live and found Clear Lake Nissan, just as soon as I walked in I felt there was a red carpet rolled out just for me!  I got in told the salesman what I wanted and he went right to it with my price range. I knew that I was at the right dealership. I have Clear Lake Nissan on the brain!  On June 23 2017, I decided to go back and make another purchase. To God Be The Glory! Everyone there was still pleasant and warm.  My salesman, Andy Pickens was awesome!  David Singletary took care of me, just like he did at my last purchase! Andy and David you made my day!  The following Monday,  I called Andy  Pickens, he answered my call and questions immediately!

As I expressed to my salesman, Mr. Benoit, this vehicle's primary use would be by my 16 year old daughter and that safety was essential.  After a successful test drive we complete the paperwork for purchase.  Upon driving out directly after purchase the vehicle shut off on my daughter at a speed of 20 miles per hour just minutes from the dealership.  Our salesman gladly assisted in getting us back on the road again thinking she had the car in the wrong gear.  Once driving on the freeway at a speed of approximately 60MPH the vehicle shut off again dangerously in high speed traffic.  We then left the vehicle for ""diagnostic testing"".  We were contacted the next day when I was told that during servicing the vehicle's battery was disconnected and upon reconnect the system programing had not been complete.  I was assured that the problem was fixed after speaking towards return of purchase.  In less than a month later we again experienced the vehicle shutting off while driving at a speed of approximately 45MPH whereas a vehicle behind her swerved to miss but mildly struck her with its front guard.  I called and left messages with the dealership and with my former salesman on five instances and never received a call back. I emailed the manager and general managers twice in the past two weeks and NO RESPONSE. The only care about the sale NOT the customer and NOT my 16 year old daughter!

I have to be honest I was doubting the whole time but then Mr Dee showed up and those two got together and got me not only approved for the Color I wanted but got me one of the top models with an awesome deal.

165,"May 27, 2016","If I could give 0 stars I would! Dishonest, Sneaky and The Absolute Worst Customer Service! They will manipulate numbers and take advantage of you if you have never bought a car and do not know what you are doing. I came in 5/24/16 to look at a 2016 Altima advertised for $17,777.00. Salesperson Leo showed me a red one and a white one. I liked the white better than the advertised red because of the color. It was similar to the advertised but a little more expensive. He talked to his manager and came back to tell me he had good news and they would sell it to me for $17,777.00. He told me that I could not get 0% financing at the sale price but I could get 0.9%. I told him I had never bought a new car and wanted to also look at a Camry. He said to call me if I decided to go with the Altima. I went to Toyota to look at the Camry and it was nice but I liked the Altima better. 5/26 I came back to Nissan and Leo was not there. I explained to salesperson Jonathan that I looked at a car with Leo and wanted to see if they would still sell me the white car for the sale price of $17,777.00. He brought around the white car to make sure it was the same car and it was. He said they would still honor the price. The only difference is that I decided to trade in my current car. Nissan offered me $4,000.00 which is what Toyota offered and I was fine with this. The manager, Angel, explained that Leo was mistaken and they could not offer me 0.9%. I wasn't thrilled that I was misquoted a good rate but it was understandable and I said that was fine. I asked them to please give me a printout of final cost and I would finance at a credit union. When Jonathan came back, there was only a $400.00 difference in final price than when I first came in. I told him there must be a mistake because the first time my trade in credit was not factored in. Final price should have been about $3,600.00 less. He said well this is the payment amount you asked for before...I said yes when my trade in value was not included. I see you have increased the car price from $17,777.00 to $21,549.00, (coincidentally about the price they offered for my current trade in ADDED to the sale price). I said no, I would like the price I was offered. He left and came back and my payment was lower but it was only because they extended the term by 12 months. Tricky! I said please do not include my trade in value or financing and print out a total for the car at $17,777.00. At this point he said that he could not do that and questioned me as to why I didn't take the offer on my first visit. I said I already explained that I wanted to look at a Toyota and compare them. I did not appreciate being treated this way. I asked him to get the manager and ask whether they would honor the price of $17,777.00 or not. He said that he didn't know if he would be able to locate the manger since they were closing and was trying to rush me off. I told him I did not appreciate being given the run around and I specifically asked for a price and was lied to or I would have walked back out the door instead of wasting over an hour of my time. He said he would call me after he talked to the manager. When I was leaving I saw the manager in his office ( because the walls were glass). It is now noon the next day and I have yet to hear from them. Toyota has already called and beat their offer. However, I really had my heart set on the Nissan. But it is a shame because I do not trust them enough to buy from them at this point. I will contact another Nissan dealer. Please do not go here and have the same stressful and disappointing experience I have had! Beware if you go here and you are a woman shopping alone or a first time buyer! ***By the way I checked online and entered the VIN of the car in their website an not only were they not honoring the price they added an extra almost $2,000.00 to the price of the car during my final quote trying to scam me out of my trade-in value*** Unbelievable!",1.0

The vehicle I had seen advertised was actually on the lot and for the price advertised.

240,"May 20, 2015","Update - After reading my reviews I was contacted by the Service Manager and my car was returned to me today (May 23) in excellent condition.  

My car flooded in only the floor wells last Wednesday in the early morning.  I took it in to the Service Department at approx. 3:00 pm the same day after I saw my insurance adjuster.  I heard from CL Nissan on Saturday afternoon.   They filed an insurance supplement.  At that time I was told that my car would be ready the week after next.  The insurance adjuster was there on Tuesday and approved repairs which were $3,000.00 over what the Ins. Co. estimated.  Instead of (as of today) next week it will now be the week after next when my car might be ready.  I realize that they have a more than normal amount of cars to fix.  But when you take your car in ahead of others and they should know based on their experience that they will get their money they should work them in the order received.  ",4.0
241,"May 18, 2015","So like most women I assume the worst in car dealerships. Feel like I walk in with a sign around my neck that says “next victim” as the piranhas circle. But I am pleased to say for the first time in my car buying experience, I was treated with respect and honestly feel like I got a decent deal. 
I came in with my credit union already giving me the green light to shop away, which is a good feeling. But it was an even better feeling when the dealership was able to cut my interest in ½ simply by applying with Nissan Finance. 
Initially, I was not happy with my trade in offer but when it was all said and done the math worked out and I am in a much better place then I was with my old car. 
As for my Sales Man, Richard Witte, his mild manor demeanor and patients with me was very impressive, I can be pretty  bossy. He explained everything about my new car in a manner that was not demeaning. (Bonus ladies he’s pretty cute ? )
From A-Z they have done an excellent job and look forward to many more pleasant experiences in the future.

246,"April 27, 2015","Our only car needed work, and CarMax would only cover the first week of rental; when the rental expired, we brought it in and asked them for the cheapest car on the lot. We were able to pay cash for a car received as a trade-in, and even though we paid the last $5 in quarters, they provided the kind of service one would expect with the purchase of a new car. 

They were weirdly insistent that we bring the car back for detailing, though. Also, the salesman strongly criticized my decision to purchase a Nissan Leaf as our first vehicle and seemed to want to tell me all the things that are wrong with an electric vehicle and how silly it was to buy one of these when I could have a gas car. This soapbox speech included interrupting me on several occasions and treating me like a child. This is not something you want to do when a customer makes the decision to purchase a vehicle from your product line, particularly not one with the kind of consumer advocacy that the Leaf has.

Service was two weeks total for our Leaf, even though parts needed to come from the factory overseas. The interior of the car was kept tidy and they even charged the car after the work was done. Mr. Keith communicated with MaxCare even when it was a pain in the butt, and never complained about having to do so. 10 of 10. I will never take our Leaf anywhere else!",4.6

Claude did an excellent job in show casing the features on the platinum edition.

282,"May 15, 2014","      On my visit to this dealership, I traded in my 2003 Ford F150 SuperCrew for a 2011 Ford Escape Limited.  I had wanted something larger (midsize V6 SUV) , but, to stay within my budget, I accepted a deal for the Escape, which is a smaller vehicle with limited cargo space. It has been a difficult adjustment, but it is clean, runs well and gets better gas mileage than what a larger SUV would have gotten.  The part of the deal that I really was dissatisfied with was the low trade-in amount I received for the truck, but car dealerships are notorious for that.  So, as far as the actual deal goes, I believe the price I paid for the Escape was fair, but I don't believe the price I received for the F150 was fair.  I have some friends that say I should have left just due to that issue or, at the least, argued for a more fair price.
      I did have some complaints regarding things that the Escape was lacking (door code, full tank of gas, spare key) and some buyers remorse (trade-in value and size) and did post some negative reviews as a result.  However, between Calle, the customer relations rep, and Nick, the used car sales manager, the Escape issues were taken care of adequately.  Nick found the door code card and had my gas tank filled up while Calle arranged for the dealership to pay for a new spare key.  I will always believe the trade-in value I received for my truck was too low, so that will remain a negative aspect of the deal that can't be fixed. 
     I am slowly adjusting to the Escape's smaller size and limited cargo space, but it does handle well.  My wife and daughter both say they'll take it if I don't want it, and it may end up with one of them driving it.  The Sync feature is very nice, the seats are comfortable, and it has a lot more pep than I would have expected.
     In the end, I had a pre-set budget which, by working together, we were able to stay within, and this will save me money on my monthly payments as well as on my gas bill.  While it will obviously take time to adjust to the drastic change is size and power, Clear Lake Nissan sold me a nice vehicle at a fair price, and regardless of which member of my family ends up with it, I'm sure it will serve us well.  
     Would I go there again for future vehicle needs?  I don't know.  If I thought I could get a good deal and didn't have a trade-in, maybe.

307,"September 05, 2013","My wife picked out the car she wanted - a new Nissan Altima. I went up on a Tuesday to test drive the car myself and to let them look at my wife's trade-in. We haggled for a while over price. This included all the normal sales practices from repeated ridiculous offers for my trade-in to repeated visits to the manager. Finally, they presented me with a document that was close, I counters with a deal of $500 more for the trade in. They agreed, we shook hands and I said that I would be back later in the week to buy the car. At that time, I was dealing with both the manager and the salesman.

When we returned on Friday, we were told that our salesman had been let go and they seemed a little unaware of the fact that we were coming in to buy the car. I presented them with the paperwork from Tuesday and they agreed to honor our verbal deal that was $500 off from the final paper document. 

After a while, I took our infant home and my wife stayed to complete the paperwork and drive the car home. After I left, the salesmen and manager told my wife that they would not honor the verbal deal or the written deal. They claimed that the manager was asking the price to be raised $500 instead of agreeing to lowering it $500. 

This was an outright lie. Luckily, my wife was able to play them a voicemail from that morning in which that same manager called and asked when we were coming in and confirming the price we had agreed on. They relented and we got the car at the price we agreed on.

This is the lowest of low sales tactics - to attempt to raise the price on my wife after I left. Additionally, it seems that the salesman we were originally dealing wit was not actually fired, but is still employed there.

Something is very wrong with this dealership.",2.3

She first greeted us when we arrived with a smile and upbeat helping hand personality. On a hot summer day she first asked if we would like something to drink! My husband and I had been car shopping for over 3 weeks now and visited over 25 dealerships all over Houston, Katy, Tomball, Spring, Sugarland and Jersey Village. Not once did a salesman offer us a drink and didn't even bother to come outside. We happen to have already picked out our vehicle online considering we live over 100 miles away from Clear Lake Nissan. When Brenda asked us and we told her which vehicle we were interested in, with NO HASSLE she offered us to take a test drive to check it out! She was able to answer all of our many questions about the vehicle. Her warm personality made us feel comfortable around her from the start. When we told her we were ready to purchase the vehicle she got us the best price possible! We did not have to sit around and wait countless hours nor have to deal with the ""typical car salesman"" who will try to find a vehicle which would make them the most commission and try and sneak in extra charges that are unnecessary. Brenda made us feel she was doing everything possible to make us feel as if we were getting the best vehicle, the best price and the most of all best customer service! I was also pleased to be greeted by the Sales Manager, Rury. He as well was available for any questions, with a smile! After we purchased the vehicle and came home Brenda was still available to assist with any additional questions. We didn't have to wait for her to respond to emails or wait all day for a returned phone call she was on top of it and got back to us promptly.

313,"July 10, 2013","The Salesman, Frankie Burns, was very friendly and helpful with the sale, my major concern was if my power wheelchair lift (from my Trade-In a Toyota Sienna) would fit in the Quest. Both the sales manager and a service tech manager came over and assured me that the lift would fit in the Quest with no problem and that they could install it in the new Quest. It turned out that they were wrong on both accounts, I returned the new vehicle on the following Monday for some add-ons and for transferring the lift. Later that day I received a call from my salesman telling me that their service tech could not transfer my lift because he didn't know how to transfer it, they claimed it couldn't be done because they didn't have the equipment/tools to make the transfer. So with Mr. Burns' help we got a VA representative to come out to make the transfer, when he arrived he determined within a few minutes that the lift could not be installed in the Quest due to body style changes in the 2013 Quest. Two weeks later I still don't have a lift to load my power wheelchair into the Quest, but VA is supposedly working on the problem.
The second problem I am experiencing is that being 100% disabled due to military service I am exempt from paying sales taxes in Texas. I gave the dealership a copy of my certification from VA but they now insist that the lift must be installed and approved by VA before they can get the vehicle titled and the sales tax refunded to me. So, due to no fault of the salesmen, I am stuck with a vehicle that I can't use without giving up my mobility. At this point I would be happy to take my trade-in (Toyota Sienna) back and returning the Quest, but I'm pretty sure that that isn't the way the new car business works.

We went in last week to trade it in on a new Pathfinder because we have had nothing but problems with the Murano and they cant seem to fix them. We were told by one of the service reps that the Murano convertible has a lot of bugs in them that they have not worked out and he would recommend us getting rid of it. He also stated that their technicians are not trained on that vehicle and that is why we continue to have the same problems. My wife went in and picked out the Pathfinder that she wanted and set up an appointment for us to come back the next day. We had received a "" Customer Appreciation Event "" notice in the mail that stated if we enrolled and set up an appointment we would get higher than normal trade in value. We followed all of the instructions and when we arrived they offered us "" rough trade in value "" for a 18 month old, 12k miles, spotless Murano convertible that we had bought there. That would put us 10k upside down. When we asked about the customer appreciation event they tried to give us a $500.00 off coupon. The salesman had the paperwork ready when we arrived and the price on the vehicle was $7500.00 more than the exact same vehicle right up the freeway at McDavid Nissan. We then asked to speak with the sales manager and was told he would be right with us. We sat there for over an hour with no one coming to see us. We could see the sales manager sitting in his office with his feet on his desk and arms behind his back talking with anyone who happened to walk by his door.

When she got close to the door she heard the manager say "" get ready, here she comes "". When she told the salesman that we wanted our keys and we were leaving he was trying to convince us to stay and "" they were just getting ready to call us in "". When we told him that we were very upset and are now thinking of pursuing the lemon law on the Murano since it has been in for service for that same problem 8 times and still not resolved he said "" good luck but the lemon law is real hard to prove and you will not be successful "".Worst customer service that I have ever experienced in my life.

321,"March 20, 2013","This is not your typical dealership....
Here's my story... I started looking for a vehicle at a different Nissan dealership. After thinking about it, I set my mind on a Maxima. I started looking online and found Clear Lake Nissan and found their new car inventory. I searched for the Maxima I thought I wanted and got a great e price online. Kurt Moisant emailed me the next morning. I met Kurt that day around 2pm to look at the Maxima. He was so excited, friendly, and made me feel important. He stated that making me happy and satisfied was his number one priority, but not in an obnoxious way. He kept asking me what I wanted on my Maxima, and I wanted all the bells and whistles. I wanted the fully loaded car, but I got picky and wanted the dark rims with the technology package. They did not have my car at this location, but Kurt assured me he would make it happen. This is my first new car purchase, and Kurt broke down every detail and penny when it came to negotiating. He made everything easy for me to understand and after I asked him a million questions he still was smiling. To make a long story short, he found me the exact car I wanted with all the options on it, brand new in Rosenburg. He went there immediately and got my car! We went to dinner around 5pm and came back and there was my dream car! A fully loaded sports package and technology package Nissan Maxima in pearl white with dark rims! It gets even better..... I went to sign all the dreaded paperwork, but Tim Dickerson made that very easy. I ended up getting an excellent rate, 1.89%!!!! Even though I thought the rate was 2.49%. He also answered any questions I had about the financing, warranties, etc. It was getting late and Kurt washed and detailed my car! I don't think you will see a salesman anywhere that would do that and still have a smile on his face! 

This dealership made my first car buying experience a breeze! I highly recommend them! I love my new dream car!

My wife and I stopped in simply because CL Nissan was the first lot we came to the next day. My plans were to visit at least 3 other lots besides yours but as it turned out I didn't need to go anywhere else. Gerald met us on the used lot and without making me feel pressured showed me several different vehicles (because I honestly couldn't make up my mind between a pickup/SUV or a sports car).  He had a lot of patience and a very thorough knowledge of the vehicles we looked at, even the brands other than Nissan. I decided on a Tundra, we went in and started the paperwork, and a couple of hours later I was on my way. Tim in the finance office was also pleasant, knowledgable, and extremely easy to deal with. I normally leave a car lot feeling like I have been involved in a brawl, but that was not my experience at CL Nissan whatsoever. I think the only way my visit could have gone any easier is if I had come in pre-approved for a loan, but that of course is nothing the dealer can control.

  My sales rep was Gerald Imes. He was very attentive and knew what I needed before I could say what I needed. He told me of an auto recently added to their lot a few days prior to my appointment. I had a few cars in mind to look at. I knew what I wanted - low mileage, great maintenance, low monthly payments, approval ratings, carfax, integrity and no bologna from sales. 

 It took very little time to test drive, complete the final approval, return a rental car and drive my volkswagon home. Four hour tops. 

  Let me add the  staff were so pleasant. By the way, even the auto service department guys are cool! I came here to service the other auto. They were one of the other reasons for returning to purchase a used auto.

341,"June 27, 2012","First of all, a week ago I had sent an email to this Nissan Dealership website, asking if this dealership had a 2012 Nissan Altima S, Sedan with Navigation for under $30,000. 
The next morning I was contacted by Angie who informed me she actually had one fully loaded with navigation for $27,047 and asked if I would like to come by and test drive it. I informed her that was a great price and I would be by there at 6:00pm to look at it. 
I arrived at the dealership at 5:45pm and asked for Angie, a man by the name of Brandon Johnson approached me and asked if I needed help and said he would go get her. I waited for about 10 minutes and he came back out and said ""Angie is on the phone but I will go ahead and bring the car you wanted to see around"". I waited another 15 minutes and he came back out walked around, looked a little lost and I waited for another 10 minutes when he finally came back out. 
He said ""Well actually they just sold that car right before you got here"". I said really, well why didn't Angie call an inform me of that, rather than making me drive all the way down here for nothing. 
I was upset that I had driven out there for nothing and said do you have another car that has all the same features as that one?
He went to go check on that and while I was waiting I was approached by Gerald Iams and he asked what was wrong and I explained what happened. 
He said I am so sorry we will do whatever we can to make that up to you and he was very nice. So I decided to stay and give this dealership another chance.

Brandon Johnson returned and said ""No, I'm sorry not at this dealership. However we can let you see the one you initially came to look at and test drive it to see if you like it and we can find you one if you like it"". 
I agreed and I fell in love with the car, however that particular car had  145 miles (was a new car)and there was a problem with the alignment. I told Brandon as I was driving that the alignment was messed up and he agreed. Hopefully the gentleman that bought that car was able to notice it before he drove off. 

I went back inside and sat down with Brandon and said okay so when can you find another car? He said whenever you're serious about buying, I said I'm serious now I need to see the car and the numbers. He said well when you are ready come back and talk to us. I said I am ready now I need the numbers. He went back to talk to his finance manager and came back and presented me with a price. It was around $29,000 not sure he kept that first paper. I asked why Angie gave me a different price and he said well what did Angie quote you and I told him $27,047. 
He went back to talk to his finance manager and had a new price. He came back and said we are going to honor that and price she quoted you and then gave me the rebates and so called discounts which brought the car to $26,916.32 if I financed with them. If I didn't finance with them it would be $500.00 more. I said that looks good try and find me a car like the one you sold and call me when you find it and I will come back. 
(The piece of paper they gave me with the quote was very vague with the pricing and did not have anything broken down. I didn't mind because it was a good price. I did however contact other Nissan dealerships looking for the same car with navigation and the quotes they sent me were very detailed and had the pricing broken out)

He then told me there would be a $500.00 deposit required if they brought in a car from another dealership. I said well if you had not of sold that car I could have bought that one. I asked why I should have to put up a deposit for a car I haven't even seen a picture of nor driven. I could drive myself to another dealership and get it without a deposit. He said it was Nissan policy. I was not pleased with this but I told him to call me when he found the car. 
He never called me he just sent an email and said thanks for coming by the dealership. I emailed him back and asked if he had found a car, no response. The next day after I emailed him I received a call from Angie and she said they would look for a car. He called me later that day and asked if I was going to come back in. I said did you find a car he said yes a couple of them. I wanted black he said they could only find white. I said ok I will bring my car in for an appraisal tomorrow. He said you can reach me on my cell. I text him the next day and told him I would be there by 6:00pm. No response again. 
When I arrived today he did the appraisal when they finished we sat back down at his desk. He was trying to figure out my pay off on my vehicle so they could give me the appraisal value. My credit union was closed so he went to talk to the finance manager again and came back and said he was waiting. I said did you find a car, he said yes we will have to go get it and you will have to put up the $500.00 down. I said if you are going to give me the $500.00 back if I don't buy the car why do I have to give it to you to see the car. We went back and forth and he was arguing with me and he went to talk to his finance manager again who came out and informed me there was only 11 cars like the one I wanted in the State within a 500 mile radius. I said okay well where are they and I will drive to see them instead of giving this dealership a deposit. Finally he said we will just waive the deposit. I said thank you, it's not about the money it was the principal. I said look I just want to know what the bottom line is for the car. If I was to purchase it today how much will I be paying walking out the door.(Don't remember his name Roger or Rodney. He said we will get those numbers to you and they went back in his office.
Brandon Johnson comes back carrying two sheets of paper one is like the quote he gave me before and the other was like a receipt that had half the information removed from one side. The price on the receipt, invoice like paper was $31,570 MSRP and $29,045 Invoice price. The other sheet of paper had the sales price for $29,045 after all their figures and my trade in the cost was $31,242.26. 

I said really than what is this price you gave me the other day for the same exact car (because that is what we were searching for) and pulled the sheet of paper out of my purse that had the sales price as $27,047 and after the discounts the final price of $26,916.32. He looked lost again and said ""oh I 'm not sure, let me go check"" and took the paper from me. He then went back to his finance manager for awhile and came back out with four pieces of paper. Now there was an invoice like paper with the first quote which I did not leave the dealership with that piece of paper! I reviewed all of the papers as he was looking for answers. The two invoice papers were for the same car. I asked him why is the same car a different price today. He was very rude and said will you let me explain and started trying to show me the mathematics of how they did the discount. Which was not explained clearly at all. I said why is the same car more today than the other day. He snapped at me again and said ""oh they made a mistake and gave you the rebate twice, sorry"". Then he said ""oh this car we quoted you on the other day did not have navigation""
I said you knew that car had navigation and that is why you have been searching everywhere and I have to pay the deposit because you didn't have another one at this dealership with that package and the NAVAGATION! He was very rude and basically was like sorry.
I said you know what just give me all those papers so I can go to another dealership. He snatched the papers from and said they were Nissan's papers. I said I would like to have those papers with the pricing you quoted me and the invoices. He walked off and said he was going to make a copy and talk to his finance manager about the papers. I walked away from his desk and went to the receptionist and asked her to call a manager. Some guy who was more unproffessional than Brandon Johnson approached me and I said are you the manager he said ""yea I'm OC what's going on"". 
I said I am not doing business with this dealership and I would like the copies of the quotes I was given and my keys and I would like to leave. He went back to the room that Brandon Johnson and the finance manager where in and I walked outside to wait. He walked back out and was holding three pieces of paper. I said where is the invoice page for the quote I was given the other day. He said ""that has our personal information on it and I cannot give it to you"". I said but you are giving me this one with the quote today. He began to argue with me and I said well let me copy the information of that piece of paper with the pricing and the descriptions, ect.. He refused to let me see that piece of paper again.
I think it was the same car and they got caught by not realizing what they quoted me before. I am a woman and I was alone trying to buy a car today, it's so sad but I knew this would happen again! 
Very disgusted by the way I was treated and the way this dealership handled everything. I was lied to from the beginning to get me in there and I was lied to as I walked out the door. I would not recommend this dealership to anyone.

342,"June 24, 2012","After visiting multiple dealers to find a car for my daughter I was expecting more of the same from this dealership. That is rudeness, unprofessionalism, deceptive practices, and the list goes on.
Instead I was faced with a sales person that was interested in answering all our questions about the cars we were interested in, he was professional, showed patience and was courteous during all aspects of the sale. 
The management was also very professional and was very interested in the customer’s satisfaction during and after the sale.
This is the only dealership I would recommend buying a car from at this time. I do not know about the other sales people in this dealership but Gerald Imes was the most professional and helpful sales person I have ever dealt with when buying a car.

343,"June 08, 2012","I really enjoyed my experience at your dealership. I found all the employees friendly and welcoming. It appears they enjoy what they do. I truly enjoyed my buying experience due to my sales representative Claude Strickland.  Your company is very lucky to have him on your team.  Mr. Strickland was wonderful to work with!  He actively listened to what I was looking for and what I wanted. He was knowledgeable, professional and patient. The experience was ""so"" easy!  

When it came to the final process of finance, I would also like to acknowledge Emron.  He, too, was a pleasure to work with.  He was personable, professional and concluded the paperwork quickly.  

I am very happy with my vehicle and I would most definitely return to this dealership for any additional purchases.

344,"May 22, 2012","Best car buying experience I have ever had. Gerald was great, helpful, honest and professional and worked to help me get my desires met. I had not planned to buy a car that day, but Gerald was very good in approaching me. He was persuasive and put me at ease and presented himself with the highest integrity. 

I actually came in dealership for service with Doug Keith on my 2007 Murano. Doug has assisted me with my service for 5 years and I think he is the best car dealership service Representative I have ever experienced. He has always given me exceptional customer service that separates good companies from great companies. He has been helpful always, detailed but conservative with his recommendations while presenting the highest integrity. I am usually a loyal customer, but it's all about the people skills of both Gerald and Doug. Doug was also very helpful when I decided to purchase the Rogue that same day.

Thank you Gerald and Doug!

347,"April 28, 2012","I had an overall great experience with Clear Lake Nissan.  The reason for my visit was to trade in my 2007 Altima for a new vehicle.  My salesman was Miles Walker and he was wonderful to work with.  He took time to find out exactly what I was looking for, showed me several cars, and never tried to rush me.  He worked had to get me a good deal and I was very pleased. I received a good trade in allowance for my 2007 vehicle and some rebates to apply towards the new vehicle. I ended up driving off in a 2012 Altima. I had a good experience with Pete, the finance manager, as well.  This is the 3rd new vehicle that I have purchased from Clear Lake Nissan since 2005.

All questions got answered and a lot of helpful suggestions and information was offered to help smooth things along. The people there are like a family :) Friendly - Fun - Entertaining during extended wait times. I feel like I want to buy another car just so I can have the repeat experience with the whole crew! I HIGHLY recommend this Nissan Dealership to anyone looking for expertise - patience - smiles - laughter - decent price - and willingness to please the customer.

The last time we visited and bought our '08 Nissan Sentra, we had a bad experience there overall.  The young salesman there was like on roller skates and never bothered to explain a feature on our car where it could give itself a selfcheck with a button on the driver side door.  We were told that now they are under new management and it shows.  Everyone was very friendly and not pushy and they did not keep us there for a long time.   Our overall experience this time around was much more pleasant and we drove out of there with a new car. ",4.8
360,"December 22, 2011","My car buying experience at Nissan (Clear Lake) Dealership was most enlightening.  Because I went in needing to buy a new car, I thought I would have a very long stay and have to bargain back and forth with the salespersons to obtain a fair and decent car payment and price.  I did not.  With the salesperson's assistance, we looked at the vehicle we wanted, sat with the salesperson and talked about price and payments.  All went well.  I could not believe how well the salesperson and other dealership staff worked so well with me and my daughter.  I have been a Nissan patron for many years since the 1980's and this purchase and my last Nissan purchase have been most rewarding in terms of having a satifying deal.  At one time in my car buying experience, I did happen to buy a Toyota, and it was an awful experience; going back and forth with price, car, color, and the salesperson was not as friendly.  It took them too many hours to finally complete the deal for the toyota.  After keeping the toyota for a few years, I traded that toyota for a nissan, and I had no problem with Clear Lake Nissan financing, salespersons, or the wait!  We drove from the dealership with a beautiful black rogue approximately in a 4 hour timeframe.Overall, IsreaL, Tony,and Rene were wonderful to work with.  All had friendly dispositions and we compromised on a price and monthly payment that we could manage.  I have informed my family and friends about the wonderful service a person receives at Clear Lake Nissan in League City, Texas.   Thank You     Gwen Byrd Gilmore

We use the Versa as a commuter vehicle, to and from work.  We came back to Clear Lake Nissan because of previous experience and overall satisfaction we had with Yvonne.  Yvonne introduced us to Angel who also was very personable.  We knew what we wanted and what we expected to pay.  The entire process was once again most favorable.  There is only one thing that I didn't feel comfortable with.  I really don't like sitting in the middle of your showroom discussing the purchase and financials with other tables and customers nearby.

366,"May 06, 2009","I was contacted several times by a internet salesperson and eventually responded to her email and said we had given up interest for a while after some of the horrible treatment and ridiculous trade offers we'd received at other dealerships. She was really nice and requested that we give her 10 minutes of our time to appraise our trade and said they have a buy-back program in which they guarantee 120% of NADA value for your trade. Sounded great! It just so happened that day a salesman we'd had previous contact with at another dealership contacted me and said he could come down to $32,620 on the new car I wanted to buy. That was the best price I'd received and asked the saleswoman at Clear Lake Nissan if she could match this price and specifically said I did not want to drive out there and waste our time or her time if she couldn't. She agreed to match the price so we drove down the next day thinking we were going to buy a car. We knew exactly what we wanted; she said she had it and could meet our deal and give us 120% NADA value on our trade.

Needless to say, we were extremely disappointed to get to the dealership at our scheduled time only to have her tell us she'd taken another customer right before our appointment time and was passing us off to someone else. Before leaving us she said she couldn't get me the color car I wanted for the same price, and that the color I wanted was going to be at least $1,000 more. She knew exactly what I wanted prior to coming to the dealership and as soon as we walked in she started changing the terms. Her quoted time of 10 minutes on the appraisal turned into over an hour as we sat there waiting for someone to come talk to us. When the salesman finally came out he offered us the color I wanted for a lot more money and gave us less than 100% value for our trade. We were furious to have had our time wasted and the salesman said we had a valid complaint after getting the terms in writing from the original sales person prior to coming in. He then had the manager come over and speak to me, but he didn't apologize for her mistake or offer to help us come to another arrangement. His terms were firm (and ridiculous) and he was condescending and rude in speaking to me and even seemed angry that I would expect what had been offered to me. I told him he needed to speak with his salesperson because she was the one who offered the deal. What a waste of time. They lost a sale because they won't honor the deals made by salespeople and aren't flexible enough to come to an agreement to fix the problem.

367,"December 02, 2007","I recently was the victim of a bad experience with the new car people last week on what they said in writing was a deal and I had to deal with General Manager Randy Stine to try fix the problem.  He would not retrun phone calls.  Typical, I thought.  He was always in a meeting or out of the office.  (This is a smaller dealership!!!) Ultimately, when a person finally called back, they said he would not back his own salespeople and what they clearly put in writing on a new 5 SUV!  So they agreed in writing on a number and then backed out when I drove with my husband all the way from Austin to buy the car as agreed upon.  I wish I could attach the back and forth here but you will have to take my word for it.  They tried to kill me on rearranging terms on financing---quite typical.  What a hassle it was!  Disgusting bottom feeders they are!  I am a loyal BMW customer and this experience makes me want to reconsider my loyalty to the brand.  Do not buy from Advantage or any Sterling McCall/Group 1 Automotive, Inc. dealership!!!!
