1,"January 10, 2020","Bought my daughter a car, 2019 Corolla,  12/14 from Toyota Of Irving. On 01/06 I receive a text msg saying they need me to come back in due to some good news. Please see photos. I go to the dealership and they instead meet me and say the car was not salvageable and should t not have been sold due to the carfax. They tell me they need my keys immediately. I refuse, pull up Carfax and purchase the $40 report and there’s not one single alert on the car. I leave the dealership and text them back to say they are shady and I will not be returning to the dealership until someone is truthful. They text me back and say the person that traded in the car I bought deal fell through and I HAVE to return the car to them. Absolutely not! I have a contract with signed documents where you sold me this car and why should I be inconvenienced due to your lies and mismanagement???? I WILL NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH THEM AGAIN. BE AWARE OF THIS HORRIBLE COMPANY! ",1.0
2,"December 14, 2019",I wish every business had the customer service that Toyota of Irving does. From Ashley who took all my information about my recall and made the appointment to Robert who handled my car when I arrived at the dealership. All super polite and they made you feel appreciated and they took pride in the job they did. And lets not forget about Nelson who drove me back to my apartment and picked me up when my car was finished. All top notch employees and Toyota is lucky to have them!!,5.0
3,"November 03, 2019",Toyota of Irving has very poor customer service. I went there at lease 5 times had similar experiences. My last visit was yesterday. I requested for car wash they did not do it.,1.2
4,"September 09, 2019","The AC in my 2016 4Runner stopped blowing last Friday 9/6. The light had recently come on telling me it was time for my regular maintenance and I had made an appt for 9/21.  When I got in my car to come home from work and the AC was not blowing I called Toyota of Irving to see if I could come in on Saturday 9/7 to get this problem fixed immediately.  The person on the phone told me that was no problem to bring in in Saturday Morning and they could diagnose the problem.  

When I arrived on Saturday Morning I was greeted by Shawn Williams who took my car in to get the problem diagnosed..  I told him I'd be waiting in the waiting room during the repair.  He quickly contacted me to let me know that they had determined the issue was the Blower motor.  He also let me know that I should consider replacement of my break pads, which I knew was coming due also.  I approved both repairs and asked how long the repair would take.  He went to find out and then returned to tell me that the blower motor was not in stock and I'd have to come back later to get that fixed.  This was frustrating but I understood, they continued to do the break work and I continued to wait.  A little bit later Shawn came over to the waiting area to find me and told me he had located a blower motor at another Toyota shop in Dallas and If I wanted them to he could send someone to get it and have it repaired that day for me!  Yes this meant I would have to wait there a bit longer but that was fine with me.

I really feel that Shawn Williams did an amazing job and went above and beyond to make sure I was satisfied.    I have had my 4Runner for 4 years now and have had all of my service done at Toyota of Irving.  And it is because of service like this that will keep me coming back.  I love that they have the waiting room for the service department in the showroom floor.  Most other dealers I have been to have a separating waiting area for service customers.  They do not want them talking to potential new customers.  Toyota of Irving does not do this and I am happy to tell potential customers that they have an amazing service department and if they purchase a Toyota from them they will be happy for years to come.  

Thank you Shawn for doing a great job!  Please never loose that customer service attitude!

5,"June 01, 2019","Never ever work with Daniel Luna
Never met most arrogant and disrespectful person 
Instead of listening to customer needs and budget he was so off guard to even meet to finalize the deal and raised voice and spoke arrogantly. He spoke very rudely to us,  instead he asked one of the car sales representative to come forward and speak to us while he was sitting in his office and ignoring us completely  We were fooled by him 
i had super bad experience that i would not want to have any services or deal with toyota of irving Somebody has to teach Daniel Luna how to behave with customers rathar than being arrogant and raising voice I would not recommend toyota of irving in my group

After returning the truck, I had to limp back into the dealership with no coolant after it was found out that one of their ""qualified technicians"" couldn't tell how to install the main water hose even though the diameters of both ends were significantly different.  Then after those supposed repairs, had to take the truck to another dealership to repair the engine plate because the Irving dealership technicans had stripped all of the screws and then just put the plate back on.  I was lucky that the unit didn't come off while going down the highway. ",1.4

22,"July 19, 2018","
I've never written a negative review in my life, but this is a first where I'll have to do so. I was in the market for a Toyota Corolla 2018 LE model. I called this dealership, Irving of Toyota, on exactly July 18th, 2018 at 4:10pm and spoke with a sales representative named Kelsey. I asked her for this specific car and she told me they had a few in the colors I wanted and also some other colors. They also gave me a quote of $16,903.40 driveout price for the car. So I said I was on my way. I drove literally for an hour and arrive at the store around 5:00pm that day. I asked to speak to Kelsey about the car and they gave me another representative named Brianna claiming that Kelsey was currently busy. First Red Flag, but I went along with it because I just wanted to see the car and buy it. 

Brianna sits me and my family down and ask us standard questions about what car I'm looking for. I tell them upfront ""Hey, I'm just here to purchase the Toyota Corolla 2018 LE model you guys have. Financing option. Color either grey or silver (Kelsey, the representative on the phone, told us they have these two colors we want). I see you guys have a 0% APR option promotion online, so I would like that aswell."" 

I'm just completely straight forward to Brianna on what I'm looking for. Brianna said ""sure let me bring the car to the front, so you guys can drive it and get a feel for it."" 

I said respectively ""No that's okay, we've already driven it before so no need for a test drive. We just want the price of the vehicle, so we can purchase it."" 

However Brianna was adamant on bring the car to the front to atleast let us see it; even getting the manager to come over and say ""It's our policy to show you the car before you buy. All you have to do is see it just to make sure it's what you want."" 

So I think to myself ""Okay policy is policy."" So I say ""Sure, I understand we'll wait for you to take it out."" Time goes by and we end up sitting there for around 45 minutes just waiting for Brianna to come back. Well, another person comes. Second Red Flag. I couldn't catch her name, but she was a female and who said she was ""director of internet marketing,"" as she herself told us.

I was really confused by why there was a whole new person talking to us again, but I soon realised after she started speaking what was really happening. She told me that the Toyota Corolla 2018 LE were all sold out and the last of them sold in between the time I was driving there. Every. Single. Corolla. However, she quickly tried to brush it off saying we have plenty of the Toyota Corolla 2018 SE models available. If anyone doesnt know the LE models are the cheaper models while the SE models are usually 2k-3k more expensive. 

I knew right then and there what had happened. We were lied to about the availability of the LE model, so the dealership could have us come there and try to sell us the SE model instead. Effectively eliminating the quote we got on the phone and forcing us to spend more then we were comfortable with. The dealership knowing we had driven an hour to get there, probably assumed we were vulnerable aswell.

This is disgusting tactic where the dealership will lie to you that they have a product available, make you drive there thinking you'll get the product and then claim the product was sold. However, they have a more expensive product that their willing to sell you.

My family and I left the facility claiming calmly that you guys decieved us and we would be leaving. The manager came and tried to talk to us still while we were leaving through the door insisting he would give us a deal on the SE model. We didn't want to hear it and left.


I do want to say that I'm not bashing Toyota as a company as all. I've been a Toyota customer for years with even my first car being a Toyota. They're reliable, amazing, safe cars that have literally saved my life in past accidents. I absolutely love there cars and I recommend them to my family and friends all the time. What i'm criticizing is the dealership and what they did to me and my family",1.0

44,"April 25, 2018","If I could give them a 0 star, I would. My father in law is in the market looking for a new car. He currently has his lease from Toyota of Irving and so we decided to go back to them for a new purchase. We initially spoke to an Internet Sales Rep by the name of Christina who emailed us, EMAILED us the pricing of a Toyota Rav4. When I spoke to her, she failed to mention that the car had hail damage on it, along with also failing to mention that the price that she has given us includes a rebate, therefore we would not qualify for 0% at 60 months. Infact, her email even stated that she understands we're looking for 0% at 60 months. While speaking with her on the phone, I also mentioned that the price she provided was high and that if there's anything she can do on the price. She assured me that they will be able to work the price out once we come in person. She had quoted us a price of $20,832 plus TTL, which would take the price up to $22,522 (I have this in EMAIL from her). Upon arriving at the dealership, we met with Jason and he showed us the car along with a different color and that is when we discovered the hail damage. When I told Jason about this and that I was astonished at the fact that nor him or Christina notified us about the hail damage on the car, he apologized and told us that they would be able to either discount the car or fix the hail damage. When I told him about the price of the car that Christina had given us and that they need to discount the price even more, he decided to call his manager, who's name was also Jason. Now this Manager for some reason thought that we were a bunch of idiots and came back with the price of $27,442 on the SAME CAR! I asked him how the price changed and his response made absolutely no sense. Not only did they provide false information on email to suck us into coming in their dealership, but they did not even honor their mistake. Clearly there is a huge training issue here with their sales team that they need to rectify and that came at the cost of a potential customer. I will never ever go back to this dealership, nor will I refer anyone to this dealership. I have personally owned over 4 Toyotas and my father in law has owned over 6 Toyotas. They lied to us and did not honor their price which was EMAILED to us. Save yourself the hassle, go to another dealership like Toyota of McKinney. ",1.0

47,"March 06, 2017","I had communicated with Mr. Dennis Alberto initially on-line about a particular 2014 Camry SE. We met and took the car for a test drive, which had low miles and navigation. The car drove well and had better acceleration on the highway than I expected from a 2.5L engine. 
What I enjoyed most was not having to meet with a number of people to make a purchase for a car.  I met with Anthony briefly as an introduction and with Mr. Steven Martin, Manager of Pre-Owned Sales 
-that's it.  Dennis and Steven were aware of my needs and listened to my requests. They respected my time and what I was looking for in a certified pre-owned car and closed the sale in a timely manner.  
I wanted to also give thanks to Mr. Bob Ford and Patrick in Finance in assisting me with all the necessary closing paperwork. 
In all, I felt good knowing that I was purchasing a reliable Certified Pre-Owned Toyota Camry for my daughter and the family and that I was receiving a good deal from those that I worked with at the dealership.  Thank you.

I had previsouly been interested in one but soon found out that it had been disabled in an accident and wanted a different one, but they were willing to hold this car for days for me.I went to go test drive the new car and wanted it and offered to put a deposit down on the car since I work in the OR and had a very important case coming up and would not be able to stay for the whole signing process. The used car manager told me that ""he would sell if this weekend instead"" and that ""could I just call and tel them I was going to be late?"" Absolutely never going back. I then wanted to try and speak with the manager again and instead overheard him mocking me to the general manager.

50,"January 17, 2017","Do not buy any cars from Toyota of Irving. I have never seen such unprofessional sales people and conmen in my life! I was ready to sign and buy a used 2016 Corolla from them where they never disclosed the car had a prior accident! I asked the sales person if the car had any prior accident, and his answer was no. As we were signing the closing papers, I grabbed the Carfax from him and noticed that the car had an accident on 10/30/16. When I asked the manager how come they didn't disclosed prior to me about the accident his answer was, ""I am not selling you the car."" As we were talking Jereme Shoemaker (the owner) came to me and told me get the f.. out of his property. He called the cops since I was asking for all my applications, papers, and driving license copy back. Toyota of Irving is surrounded by new immigrants and these buyers have no idea about Carfax or what to ask when buying a used car. I can see how Toyota of Irving tricks poor customers and takes advantage of them. There should be an investigation of all prior used car sells by this dealership.

53,"December 19, 2016","I made a deal for a pre-owned vehicle via email, which was a fairly smooth process (less than 3,500 miles on the car). After showing up at the dealership I was offered a warranty package for just under $1,000, which I declined to purchase. I’ve owned a number of Toyotas and never have had any problems. The sales rep was very professional/nice and did not push it further. A while later one of the sales managers offered me the same package at a discounted rate of $450, which I accepted. In finance I was told the $450 did not cover everything and she tried to upsell me to the higher priced package, which I declined. She even said something about how I was agreeing to buy the car with no warranty other than power train. After arriving home I looked up the car I just purchased online and noticed it was ""Toyota Certified"".  After an email I was sent a link showing what ""Toyota Certified"" entails. One thing is it comes with a warranty. I contacted the sales rep and asked what I purchased for $450 if the car came with a “Toyota Certified” warranty. What I was told made no sense so I asked for something in writing to clearly communicate what I purchased. Finally I ended up talking with a manager in finance, again asking for something in writing. He asked me to hold for a few moments and when he came back on the line he offered me a refund with no apology or any other real explanation as to why I sold a warranty on a car that came with a warranty. One would think somebody there would have said, “Sorry, we made a mistake”. Maybe is it wasn’t a mistake. The check arrived last week. Although I feel partially responsible for not having all of my ducks in a row and buying the warranty in the first place, I caution anybody buying a ""Toyota Certified"" pre-owned car to not take the bait on a warranty offer.

54,"June 08, 2016",I went there to buy a new truck.  They told me on the phone they had the truck I was looking for but when I got there they didn't have it.  They got a truck but it was not equipped with the options I wanted.  I agreed to buy the truck if they put some of the options I really wanted on the truck .

87,"April 30, 2014","1) Hidden microphones
2) Women need to bring a man with them (Still, in 2014.  I know, right?)
2) Refused to return my car keys despite frequent, polite requests. (I can't imagine that power play if I had been a man)
3) They require a full credit check, with SSN, before they will allow you test drive a car.

I went for a test drive with a friend.  Back at his desk, the salesman left me for a good length of time.  Through the hidden microphones, they listened to my conversation in which I expressed my disappointment and discussed trying other cars.  

The salesperson returned, and a power play ensued in which he refused to return my car keys (a possible trade in).  He was playing with me as a cat plays with a mouse.  Several polite requests were utterly ignored.  Finally I threatened to cause a scene if he didn't return my car keys..  He wasn't budging, so I caused a scene, yelling at the top of my lungs (seriously!).  He **still** didn't budge (WTH?) so I stood up and used my toughest ""Mommy"" voice to *order* him to get my car keys.  NOW!

On the way out the door, another sales person followed me, to harass me about wasting their time.  I'm handicapped, so I walk slowly, and the salesperson harangued me the whole way back to my car.  Then he stood and stared me - with his best effort at an intimidating glower - until I backed the car out and left. 

On the drive back, my friend was incredulous that such a demonstration would be required - *and* that I would actually do it!

I did some research, and hidden microphones and holding your car keys are common tactics among unscrupulous dealers.

90,"November 21, 2013","I purchased a new Tacoma Friday night (11/15/2013) from Toyota of Irving. When I was looking at the truck earlier in the day, the salesman (Brian Smith) mentioned a College Grad rebate and asked when I graduated. I told him I graduated in 2011 but forgot the exact date. He said that I would qualify for the rebate no problem and to bring a copy of my diploma in when I come back to purchase the vehicle later that evening. When I do come back that night to look over the paper work and finalize the sale, I meet with a new salesman (Tanner Branch) who does the paperwork. During this time, I volunteered on two different occasions to let him get a copy of my diploma and even showed it to him and both times he says ""its ok"". I go through with financing and get a loan secured and sign all the paperwork and leave with my new Tacoma. Fast forward to Monday, I get a call from the original sales guy asking to email a copy of my diploma in which I oblige immediately. Tuesday afternoon, I get a call from the dealership (Brian Smith) informing me I was 3 months out of the cutoff date for the rebate and I must bring them a check for $750 dollars or the truck back (never mind the fact I have a legal contract signed by both parties and nowhere is this mentioned that if the dealership messes up I would be liable). I went back up there that night (11/19/2013) to get this straightened out with the sales manager and finance manager, having a hard time figuring out how this is my fault and why I am being punished because Toyota of Irving failed to check their paperwork. We agreed that I would return the truck since I am not giving them any more money because they messed up and are at fault here. They asked me to leave the truck there at the dealership that night and told me they would send me my money and trade in vehicle the next day. I refused to do that since I have $10,000 invested in the truck including my trade. I told them I would give the truck back when they give me my money and trade in back. Today, I gave them until 11:00am to call me to arrange the switch until I would call them. 11am rolled around and I never heard from them. So I called them every hour on the hour and left voicemails with my cell number asking them to call me back. I left voicemails with three different people. Never heard from them. I told them the night before I was leaving to go out of town at 7:00pm the following day and would not be back until Sunday so the switch needed to happen before 5:00pm the following day (11/20/13). After several calls, I was finally able to get a hold of the finance manager (Louis McClinton) at roughly 6:20pm. I explained to him I was waiting at the airport getting ready to board my flight that I would not be able to make the switch until next Monday and that is why I made it very clear the night before it needed to happen before 5pm. Mr. McClinton told me would call me back. 10 minutes later I get a phone call from Don Ivey, the sales manager of Toyota of Irving, who was extremely rude and demanding his property back as if I stole it from them. Lets not forget I have $10,000 in the truck with a trade, lets also not forget I explained to them the time line the night before and tried calling at least 10 times through out the day leaving a voicemail with my cell phone number. Don Ivey then went on telling me they have been trying to call me all day long, which is a lie. I have never once received a call from Toyota of Irving on 11/20/13 and phone records will back that claim. He said they must have the wrong number on file as if it was my fault again, which is funny considering he called me immediately to make the trade after I finally got a hold of someone at the dealership. 

Something has got to be done with the behavior of these people at Toyota of Irving and their very bad business practices. They are representing Toyota in a very poor manner and it is embarrassing. I would highly suggest you avoid them and move on to the next dealership.

Asked about certification.  Was told it was not certified, but they could certify it for $600.  Sat down with them to talk numbers.  They added the $600 certification, TT&L and offered to sell it for $19,900.  I looked at the Carfax report and it said the car was offered for sale as a preowned certified dealer on 26 March 2011.  Pointed this out to the salesman, Leo, & Assit. mgr, Cade.  They lied and said it meant the car was ""elligible for certification.""  I pointed out the vehicle was way over retail value and Cade told me that ""Used vehicles are like snowflakes so you really can't put a price on one.""  We left.  I called in a complaint to Toyota's Corporate office because I knew word would get back to the dealership.  The next day they called me back to try to lower their offer.  I told the representative that I was upset because they lied about the certification.  He told me that he didn't know they lied about the extra $300-$400 certification fee (they said it was $600).  I told him I had already bought a car from their dealership & was really upset about their dishonesty.  I also said that I would be sure to post about my experience all over the internet.  The representative told me that I should realize that 1 customer's complaints will not impact their business.  The next day the Gen Manager, ""Rocky"" called to ""apologize"" he admitted they tried to sell me a vehicle already certified and charge a certification fee.   He told me that he would call me back later with an offer to make it up to me.  He didn't call back for over 7 hours so trying to give him the benefit of the doubt I called him back.  He told me that he couldn't offer me a better deal on the car because they got it for over retail value so it would be a loss for him.  I told him that I am evaluating him for honesty as well.  He promised to call me back before 10am today.  I am posting this at 10:01am, so obviously he is not honest as well.
