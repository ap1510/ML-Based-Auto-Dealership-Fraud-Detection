5,"September 07, 2019","Unfortunately their Service Department is incompetent. Did our oil change & didn't install air filter correctly. It filled safety filter full of debris, stranded us for 3 hours, AND we had to pay for Jim Bass to fix.  The Extended Warranty wouldn't cover, because it was the FORD Dealership faulty oil change. Said Jim Bass was lying, but Bass had the computer codes and fixed it. Ivey Motors refuses to reimburse the $242 to fix for their inadequate service. Will not do business with a company that will not stand behind their work.",1.4

8,"June 17, 2019","I have bought  trucks here and had trucks and cars serviced here. Buying here at Ivey is enjoyable with no pressure, but helpful information. Service is efficient and they stand behind their repairs.

Recent experience was a dead battery. They came out and jumped off my truck and replaced it back at the dealership. The man who came out and jumped off the truck was very friendly and helpful.
While talking with him, I asked him about a larger truck and he introduced me to Buddy, a salesman at the dealership.  I had previously bought trucks from Buddy and he was just as helpful as ever with information about a truck there on their lot.",5.0
