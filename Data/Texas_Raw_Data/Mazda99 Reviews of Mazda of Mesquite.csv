0,"May 06, 2020",Took my car to be serviced for a/c repair. It took them 2 days to fix .I would call and never got a call back. I had to go up there to check on my car and I wanted to talk to the service manager. The cashier girl knew I was upset .  I did see him a split second I told him I was upset I wanted to talk he just grinned and continued to his office. He was more concern about doing a job interview never called me back. Poor management skills. Phone calls are never returned. I will NOT be doing business with Mazda Mesquite. This place is under new poor management. Lack customer service even sales associates wandering around lack friendliness.,1.6
1,"April 24, 2020","I bought a car on 2/3/20 from Mazda of Mesquite, I have never received the title or plates. I have gone into the dealership and called numerous times. I was told by Maria in early March the paperwork was at the title office. Then I was told Maria was not working there anymore. After several more phone calls, Steve, Staci, Jeff, Anthony, no one returned my phone calls. The receptionist tells me no title work is being processed, tax office closed, dealership sold…… I finally get a return phone call from Emmitt on 4/24/20, he has no idea where our paperwork is and he is tired of dealing with the tax office. I now have a car with no plates and no title.
Later the morning of the 4/24/20, Emmitt called me aging, said he found my paperwork, it was brought to the tax office yesterday. I informed him, that was all the information I needed. He stated “THIS IS ALL xxxxxxxx”.
I told him it was not necessary to swear, and proceeded to hang up.

2,"February 13, 2020","I purchased a car October 2019. The sales process left a lot to be desired, but here I am four months later still waiting on license plates. Each time I ask about the status I’m given the run around and told they are getting more plates next week. I’m now getting hounded by my credit union because they don’t have the title or even proof that a title application was submitted. My second set of temporary tags expired this week. I asked to get a third set, yet no one will respond to my texts, emails, or phone calls. If you want to do business with a dishonest dealership who will take your money and run and provide no customer service, look no further!",1.0

My service agent Angela Gomes has been my preferred agent for a few years now. She’s a top professional who strives to Kee customer satisfaction at the top of her goal. I highly recommend Mazda of Mesquite for all your service needs.",5.0

She even checked on me a few days after I got my 2017 Mazda 6 to see if I was enjoying the car. If you’re looking for a new car I would most definitely recommend her, she’s amazing!",4.8

11,"January 21, 2019",My experience started with a phone call to the dealership.

13,"January 02, 2019","I’ve been a Mazda customer for many years and traded at the Mesquite lacation on all my purchases iver the last 30 years.  My current Mazda deal was on a 2017 cx3.  This is my 5th Mazda purchase at this location.  My experience this time around has not been a pleasant one.  
I’ve been treated very disrespectful not once but every time I’ve had to turn the car in to be serviced.  I’ve been met with attitudes, disrespect and unappreciated as a customer.  The customer service ladies are on some kind of power trip.  They act as if they would rather you not bring your car in for service, and enjoy having a bully attitude.   They are not friendly or approachable and want to argue instead if listen.  I’ve given them chance on top of chance to treat me right.  I’ve had it with them and I will not be doing business with this dealership in the future.  I deserve better treatment.  I’ve tried calling the owner but he don’t return his phone calls.  So it’s to no wonder the service is poor at this dealership.  
I have many other issues and bad experiences for the last two years with this dealership but it’s too many to mention.  My complaints are never address, so it’s not worth the time listing them.  ",1.6

22,"August 23, 2018","While researching different vehicles and planning a trip to another area where a friend I trust works at a dealership, Teresa with Mazda of Mesquite reached out to me to see if I would be interested in considering their dealership. I advised that I already had a negotiated price and plans, but if they could match it I would be interested in coming by. 

A few hours later that day I arrived at the dealership and she was with another customer, but assured me that she would make sure I was in good hands with Emily. Emily did great assisting me with the process and when we hit a snag due to a hold on my credit report, she patiently provided all of the details for me to call and get the hold released. 

They even let me take the car home for the weekend knowing I wouldn’t be able to resolve it on a Saturday afternoon. The manager came over as well and also wanted to reassure me that all was well and it would be an easy process. On Monday I was able to get my credit hold released and returned on Wednesday to finalize the purchase. I was greeted again with a smile and introduced to Brent in finance to sign the paperwork and seal the deal. 

I work in a similar industry and seeing the coordinated efforts of Teresa, Emily, and Brent work so smoothly I have no doubt that they value the whole team there and of course the customer. Well done team and thank you! I love my new Mazda 6 and will recommend Mazda of Mesquite to everyone I know when they are in the market for a new car!",5.0

24,"July 25, 2018","I went to Mazda of Mesquite to purchase my first car. The sales staff were extremely aggressive, did not listen to what I wanted, and made me feel extremely uncomfortable. The sales representative presented me an offer and I accepted. However, the offer I was shown was not the same offer on the contract. The sales rep made changes to the offer without notifying me/ asking my permission. When I became aware of his fraudulent behavior I contacted the dealership to get the issue resolved. The dealer was unresponsive and not helpful. I will never be conducting business with this dealer again.",1.6
25,"July 24, 2018",My husband went from a dodge diesel to a car and wasn't happy but that was until we met Gabby and she made car shopping fun and easy! My husband loves his Mazda! Great price and everyone was friendly.  They made sure we were happy and was in our range. We test drove probably 6 or 7 cars and Gabby was amazing never once complained and made sure we were happy with our car even weeks after buying. It's nice to have someone who wants to make sure the customer is happy. ,5.0

27,"July 11, 2018","Gabby Duran is THE BEST.  She helped me get into a beautiful silver Mazda 6 last year.  Then a girl ran a red light and totaled my baby.  Gabby got me driving off in black Mazda 6 in no time.  Actually same day.  She never disappoints.  She explains everything in detail.  Her professionalism and excellent customer service is why I recommend Mazda Mesquite to anyone.

31,"May 21, 2018",I looked online for the car I wanted at several dealerships.. I finally found the one I liked but unfortunately it was 1 hour away from where I live. Mazda of Mesquite (Gabby) located the same car and had it delivered to their location to help me from going that far away. She was so helpful from start to finish and made the whole process stress free... staying in contact with me through email and cell phone.

When it came to pricing she worked with management to get a price that worked for us. The entire process from start to finish was the best car buying experience I have ever had.

58,"September 23, 2017","My daughter purchased a Mazda 3 Turing from this dealership.   This is her first time purchase and the finance manager who initially took care of the matter was borderline rude.  He openly told my daughter and my wife it was ""very frustrating"" for him to help us.  GSM intervened and took care of the matter.  However, now she wanted to buy an extended ""Mazda Extended Total Confidence"" warranty.  After many phone calls and back and forth the Sales Manager agreed to a price.   When she went to purchase the warranty the whole story changed.  They offered a 3rd party warranty.  When she inquired on why Mazda warranty was not offered as negotiated, his response was Mazda ""does not offer any extended warranty"".  That is a false statement.  Mazda like all manufactures do offer warranty. They may want to sell 3rd party warranty for heavy markup purposes.  For a representative of a manufacturer to even deny selling the company warranty shows their lack of confidence in the product they represent and sell.  Never ever will buy a vehicle from this dealer again",1.0

I spoke with the used car manager about the price I had agreed to and he said, ""no way, John just told you that to get you in here '  after some back-and-forth he told me I'm not going to argue with you, you're not even a customer and hung up on me. Spoke to Mr. Justice after that he tried to save face and told me they would honor the price that had been agreed to. I waited a week for the car to be repaired came in to purchase it and the price had gone up again. He then insulted my integrity and intelligence by saying I must've misunderstood.

We walked in and told Jon exactly what we were looking for. He didn't waste our time or his. They ended up having the perfect car for our family - Mazda CX-9. The beautiful car had more than we could ask for and at the perfect price. From walking in, meeting the owner Ryan, to finance, to walking out with keys, we were treated with respect and felt like valued customers.

82,"March 21, 2017","Had great customer service from the moment I stepped in to the moment we drove out with the new vehicle. I wish the price of the car would have included the warranty and GAP, but unfortunately in order for me to get the price I wanted I had to give up those benefits. ",4.6

85,"March 07, 2017","Awesome experience with Mazda of Mesquite! I've been to several dealers in area and wound up upset and confused by the time I walked out on the negotiations. I'm glad I happened onto this dealership. They were courteous, friendly and bent over backwards to make me feel happy. I will come back here  in the future!",5.0

88,"January 18, 2017","To keep it as short as possible I won't go into too many details, I had a great experience with Donna at the front desk, she resolved my issue and went above for me. Throughout the sales experience I'd also recommend John, very quick and to the point and got me what I wanted. Now for the multiple sales managers I've dealt with, they've all pissed me off in one way or another. Rushing sales, pressuring which is typical, and not knowing anything about a single vehicle there, as well as straight up lying on multiple occasions (ie. they said a recall was done on my vehicle pre sale, well guess what I had to go back for 2 weeks later during inspection?). Overall experience was fine, management is lacking but the one's who work the most and actually put effort into their jobs are the good ones.",3.4
89,"January 02, 2017","There aren't enough words to describe how much I appreciate Mike and Mazda of Mesquite. Mike went above and beyond to help make my first NEW car buying experience so simple and painless. I honestly made the drive to Mesquite because I saw a used Mazda 3 that I wanted. Literally the moment I pulled up, someone was coming back from test driving it (they ended up buying it). Mike went out of his way to make sure I found the vehicle that I wanted. I never felt I was being pressured to buy a new car. He worked a deal and found a new one that was perfect for me. I know he stayed well past closing time to make sure that I was taken care of and that I was happy with my purchase. I never felt rushed or felt that I HAD to buy a car that day. He answered all my questions and had so much patience with me. When I went to pick up my plates, everyone there was so friendly and helpful. Mike saw that my month old car was already dirty (thanks to driving on country roads) so he got me a free car wash before they put on the plates. It might not be the closest Mazda dealership to me, but I will make the drive to Mesquite for any service needs I might have in the future. ",5.0
90,"December 22, 2016","We purchased a pre owned vehicle. Sales man was incompetent and didn't know his job. Sales Mngr ""Hoss"" is a complete disrespectful dis honest liar. They were very rude to my Wife and I. Made promises and did not keep. Told us the car had no warranty and convinced us to buy the extended warranty. 1 week late its in service at another dealership and found out the original manufacturers warranty was still good. Even the owner Ryan lied to us, said he was going to re finish the chrome wheels on the car and after we bought he would not honor his promise. We've called them several several times and left messages and no one will call us back. I recommend not using this place. Let us waiting and sitting for several hours.They will lie to you and not stand true to their word. Not professional at all. ",1.0
91,"July 26, 2016","Was trying to negotiate pricing for a 2016 Miata Club within reasoning, but the sales personnel involved acted like it was the end of the world. One flat out lied to my face saying they were the only dealer in the DFW area with a Miata with the options and color I was looking for in an attempt to keep me from leaving to another dealership. This was incredibly disrespectful considering the fact that I had only asked for that package and color because I had already test driven it at another dealer and was shopping around for better prices.  

Ended up buying the Miata I wanted at another dealership at lower payments than Mesquite was willing to go and with financing at a lower APR. Long story short, stay away.",1.8
92,"June 28, 2016","Their service department is incompetent and management doesn't care. The last time they changed my oil, they forgot to reset the service indicator. They claim they always air your tires, but as I left the dealership my tire pressure indicator came on. My car has been in at least 5 times for the same problem (which it has had since new). Every time it happens again they tell me to bring it in. They either apply an update or tell me they can't reproduce it. Twice they said the service manager would call me about the issue but he never did. At no point have they tried to replace parts, add data logging or anything else. They just repeatedly waste my time and gas driving the car out to them. I tried getting Mazda corporate involved but they are just as useless. They act like they are doing me a favor by letting me bring the defective car they sold me to them.

I would not recommend a Mazda but if you must have one, stay away from Mazda of Mesquite.",1.8
93,"December 03, 2015",At arrival to Mesquite Mazda I was able to browse the car lot without taunting of any sales person. After looking and returning to the main entrance of the center my family was approached humbly by Mr. Greg Powell.  In discussion of my current needs to purchase a vehicle Mr. Greg Powell was patient and detailed knowledgeable about each vehicle at Mazda and its amenities. Mr. Greg Powell is an excellent team member and I am excited and satisfied with the purchase deal of  my new Mazda 6 sport thanks to Mr. Greg Powell. ,4.6
94,"October 18, 2015","So far so good! Test drove a 2016 mazda3 s grand touring earlier in the week with Nick Searcy. Was blown away by the car. I was replacing a Elantra that had been totalled. I wanted the best car in that class. We were negotiating a lease for an i touring with a third party, not quite the car I wanted. We were to receive contracts to review the next week so we decided to approach Mazda of Mesquite by text because of our interaction with Nick. We worked with sales manager AJ and got the price for the s touring at a place we estimated would be worth the investment and the right monthly payment to buy instead of lease conveniently via text. We went down and drove the s touring and were ready to buy right off the transport truck. Don't get me wrong. When you purchase a car its going to be some negotiating for certain conditions even before talking to the finance person and picking a warranty. But it was a pleasure working with Nick. Best informative no pressure test drive experience ever. And we've bought at least 6 cars in the last 10 years. Then we had the pleasure of working with Alvin Davis wrapping up our warranties and financing. It was such a pleasure working with him and felt that he was very informative and helpful with any questions or concerns we had. He helped us understand the warranty coverage we needed for our circumstances and we were able to achieve the monthly payment we were aiming for. I highly recommend them. This was a great experience, we will use their service department in hopes that they are equally as great and will go to them next time we are ready to go buy another Mazda, which maybe soon, given the quality as compared to the loaded 2012 Volvo my wife has been considering replacing before the warranties run out.",5.0
95,"October 16, 2015",Great and happy experience!  Greg Powell from The Mazda of Mesquite Team was so awesome to work with and made buying a new Mazda CX-3 a fun and enjoyable time!  He's very knowledgeable and we left feeling like we got a great deal.  Very trustworthy.  We're extremely happy with the whole experience.  We love our new CX-3!  Zoom Zoom.  :),5.0
96,"July 13, 2014","I am an internet buyer and years ago I purchased a CX-7 and it went off without a hitch.  I made all my arrangements online.  I took my trade in at the same time I picked up my new car. They just verified the condition of my trade, showed me the new car, and I signed the paper work and was gone in less than an hour.  What car buying should be right? 

This year I tried to do the same thing.  On the first visit they mislead me on my trade worth and we walked out after getting a quote for our trade thousands lower than what they said they would give based on photo's and detailed information I provided.  A few weeks later they said they could now make the original deal.  I said okay, have the new car ready and I will come get.  I get to the dealership and they take 2 hours to re-appraise my trade.  Then when I get to the paper work part it was like starting from scratch, even though I had already prequalified and sent in all my information.  4 hours later we leave with a new car.  However, our troubles really began after the sale.  I told them when my next payment was due (10 days) and I was assured the trade would be paid off by then.  6 weeks later it was still not paid off.  I had to make multiple trips (45 miles away) to get it resolved.  The dealership was very apologetic and assured me it would never happen again.  Like a trusting fool I reached out to them a month later to get my daughter a car. 
 
I picked out the car online, gave them the purchase information, gave them an exact time of pick up, and expressed my expectations that the car and paper work would be ready to go when I got there and I could sign and drive.  I was assured that would be the case.  As you may have guessed it was not the case.  Even without a trade I was in the dealership for 3 hours before we drove out.   

Since we live so far away, I asked the tags be mailed to me, and I was told they would be.  However, this took 5 attempts with emails and broken promises before I received the tags.  And guess what?  The car had no bracket to hold the front license plate.  Meaning, I was sold a car that was not street legal as delivered.  I asked them to send me a bracket and he said it did not come with the car but he would do me a favor and send me one.  That was 9 weeks ago.  I have had multiple emails with multiple dates of when the bracket would arrive, but still nothing.  The last 3 emails have gone ignored by the internet sales manager. 
 
Bottom line...... if you work at it you can get a good price, but they can't follow through on promises or post-sales actions.  They could have had a customer for life who averages one car a year between family and business, but they blew it with me.  I will not be back.  

The little things count.

97,"November 21, 2009","I have purchased five cars from this dealership and each time, I thought it couldn't get any better than that purchase. Today, Saturn of Mesquite raised the bar again!! I am extremely pleased with my purchase and the wonderful service I received today! It was a little like dealing with family only these are the ones you'd claim and want to do business with! I have also had my vehicles serviced by Saturn of Mesquite. Each time the work was performed quickly and professionally. The service team kept be abreast of service or maintenance that might be due on the vehicle. These folks take pride in their work and it shows. I think you'd be hard pressed to find a dealer with any higher standards. I will continue to deal with these folks and look forward to their future success!",5.0
98,"October 04, 2009","WOW!  I am very impressed with the outstanding service that I received at Saturn of Mesquite.  Over the weekend I noticed that my Service light came on.  First thing Monday morning I called to see what I needed to do.  I spoke to Romney and he was able to get me in first thing.  I was prepared to wait to have my car looked over, but was offered a ride to work while they took a look, called with reason for service and they were able to fix and have it ready for me by the time I was finished working.  They even offered to come pick me up.  I was able to get a ride so I declined the offer.  After work I went to get my car and I have not had any problems since.  Most dealers I have worked with in the past have been very rude, could not get me in and service my car within the same day.   ",5.0
