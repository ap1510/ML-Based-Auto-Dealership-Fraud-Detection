0,"April 21, 2020","I scheduled an appointment for my Lexus RX 350 on March 23rd, 2020, for 100,000 miles service over the phone. At that time, I asked about the cost for the service and I was given about $ 215.00 plus any parts if it needs. I told my son to drop the car and the service adviser told him that it is going to cost around $ 400.00 which he thought it was already discussed with me. Anyway, when I went to pick-up the vehicle, I was surprised to see the cost and told Ms. Sarah (Service Adviser) that I was quoted only $ 215.00. She then tells me that my son has already agreed to $ 400.00 and she cannot do anything about this. Then I called the service over the phone and after several minutes the lady on the phone also confirmed that I was quoted $ 215.00 over the phone and she suggested that I talk to Service Manager. I went inside and asked the lady at the reception she told me that Service manager is in the meeting. When I went around and saw Mr. Paul (service manager) he was in his seat, not in the meeting and got up as soon as he saw me and instead of listening to me what I have to say, he said that I have already signed the contract, “Contract is a Contract” and you have to pay. He was so rude, I told him that I have to think second time before I come here next time. Then he tells me that it is my choice.

Ever since I bought my car from you, I am getting all the service and the repair from you, and I never had any dispute about the service or the price. This is not for the 200 dollars it is matter of principle. It is not right When I call, I get one price and when I come for the service, I get another.

I bought my car from your dealership and I was ready buy another car, now I have to think twice.

Of course, it doesn’t make any difference to you, but remember you have one dissatisfied customer.

4,"November 12, 2019","Yani Cole-Berry shows a lack of concern and customer service.

My car was finished with its service and the dealership set up an uber ride to pick me up and head back to the dealership. 
The uber ride was mistakenly canceled.   I called the dealership and my call was unluckily answered by Yani.  

Yani routes my call to the service department which ends up sending my call to voicemail.  I called back and Yani tells me to hold as she routes me back again. Same situation, my call gets sent to voicemail.  I call a 3rd time and ask Yani can she either setup the uber ride herself or walk over to the service department.  She tells me to hold, routes me back, and I get the voicemail yet again.  I call back and Yani simply stops answering my calls.  She would forward the call to the service department without answering, showing that she simply used caller ID to recognize my call. I was stranded on the street for roughly 30 minutes with no help. It was not until I called from my office phone and not my cell phone that she answered.  I asked for her manager, she tells me to hold and once again forwards my call to the service department/voicemail.  I called back and Crystal answered and took care of the situation. 

We pay alot of money for our Lexus and the services needed that I expect better customer service from the employees.  Yani Cole-Berrry shows a lack of concern, and she clearly does not value her job.  She needs a serious round of coaching or simply needs to not be at the front end answering calls.",1.0
5,"October 17, 2019","My previous vehicle had flooded in the Imelda storm and I was in a rental at the time which was up for mandatory return the next day as my insurance would not cover the cost any further. I found the pre-owned RX350 that I was interested in on Sterling McCall's website. Called Sterling McCall and Jae Sone answered the phone. She was very very helpful, very knowledgeable and understanding, very informative, very honest and true to her word. I purchased the RX350 as it was exactly what I wanted and Jae went above and beyond my expectations to have it ready in beautiful condition on the very day my rental was due for return. I didn't go a single day without wheels! I have never had such a great experience with any other dealership ever. I will definitely be a return customer if/when I should need to make another vehicle purchase in future! Thank you, thank you, thank you, Jae! ",5.0
6,"August 29, 2019","I went to Sterling McCall Lexus to buy a set of all weather mats for my 2019 Lexus RX350 FWD. I researched the part number and price and i called them before i come, a guy told me he has 1 in stock, so i headed over and met a guy named Justin A Page. He told me the part number i was looking for (PT9084816040 RX 4PC AWM) is not going to fit my car. It'll only fit an all wheel drive model. Apparently he thought AWM stands for ""All wheel drive"" and i thought AWM stands for ""All weather Mats"". He started arguing and said he has been doing his job for 15 years. He said ""if you want it i'll sell it to you anyways but it won't fit your car"". So I went to cashier and asked for a manager to make sure i get the right part. The manager named Jose Montano came and asked for my VIN number. He double checked and it was indeed the correct part. Jose was nice and professional completely opposite the attitude of Justin A Page. I wonder how Justin still had a job for 15 years given the terrible behavior and poor customer service skill. I always buy & service my car at Westside Lexus and they're always great and professional. Unfortunately, I did not have the same experience at Sterling McCall Lexus.",1.4

The technician who changed my oil gave me back what was left in the quart container. I didn’t preface I bring my own oil and oil filter. Very admirable. Jennifer did a great job on the write-up, kept me informed and wished me a good day in departure.  Customer service is key.  You want to make a good impression with your clientele.  It goes a long way and remembered.  Thank you Sterling McCall.

12,"November 10, 2018","11-09-2018,
      We are driving our 11th new Lexus since 1998. I brought our 2017 Lexus RX-350 in for a tire warranty replacement on Wednesday 11-7-2018. When the blowout occurred it knocked 2 pieces of trim off the fender wall. I asked for an estimate and was told $175 total for the trim replacement. Later in the day I received another call saying the estimate was now over $483 because they forgot to add the second piece of trim. I told them to go ahead and get the car ready. When I paid the bill the cashier said $120. She said the tire and trim was in warranty. I asked 3 times , are you sure and was told "" yes "".
After we drove almost home to Chambers county the cell phone started ringing. I was told they had made a mistake and I needed to pay another $363. I reluctantly gave my Visa card number over the phone. I'm not happy and I also think somebody @ S.M. Lexus is going to get reimbursed for the total bill just like the cashier explained to me. 
On the way home I noticed my front tires have 38 lbs and 31 lbs of pressure. Apparently the tire rotation tech didn't bother checking the N2 pressure in the tires. The tire pressure cap was missing also. I was told to go to Discount tires to have N2 added to the tires. Again I'm not happy. Everyone in the building dropped the ball. 
The service we used to receive was perfect, what has happened ? I'm seriously considering another brand . I can't drive an hour one way to get treated like this anymore.

13,"September 06, 2018","This review is on Parts department not on sales department .  Very bad experience from parts department ! Told me 50% more price over MSRP ! I said NO , Then sold me the parts @MSRP . He told me , that ‘s the best deal ! ? I don’t have time to shop around so bought it . Same parts at eBay from another Lexus dealer 45%  Cheeper ! It’s a rip- off place & dishonest people . So please check the price with different dealer / eBay before buy from there . Never go back again !",1.3
14,"April 13, 2018","I have owned many Lexus behicles since 1989.  This will be my LAST ONE.  Actually will get rid of it very soon.  
There was a recall of older vehicles that had problems with the dashboard, armrest and above the dashboard fading, gumming up and cracking.  

Same issue has happened to my 2011 vehicle with 46k miles.  Outside is in great shape.  Inside looks like an older car.   After spending months trying to get someone to give me an answer as to whether Lexus would  repair this due to previously having the same issue- finally received my answer and it was a firm NO.  Very disappointed and will not purchase this brand again.  This happen to another friend and he traded in his car. Very disappointed in Sterling McCall Lexus for not assisting me with this. Again stay away from all LS models! Interiors decay and fall apart.",1.5

16,"March 18, 2018","Service Advisor, Michael Mayes, was rude and lack courtesy! I came for an oil change .

17,"February 20, 2018","I had an awful experience with the Finance department. I called and left a message to return my call. The call was not returned. This guy only cares about selling warrantee contracts and we received no service during the payment transaction. This finance person did not present a business card in an attempt to remain nameless. In a phone call to a finance manager, she said he is not supposed to give you service his job is to sell more contracts. My impression is that service is what makes Lexus stand apart from others. The problem is that the finance employee was not honest with me and was in a hurry to deliver the car when the details had not been worked out yet. ",1.0

21,"July 30, 2017","I brought my RX350 in for 5000 miles service. When it was time to pick it up, I had to go in to use the restroom. The Service Advisor told me that when I was ready, just tell the valet and he will bring my car over by the door. So I did. But instead of bringing my car over, the valet simply handed me the car key and pointed (without saying a word) at my car which was parked in the sun. 
I couldn't help but wonder: is this the service that I should be expected from a Lexus Dealership? I probably wouldn't care if I was at a Toyota, but I seriously think a luxury car dealership should have a better service with better trained staff on the lot.

First, he offered a extended warranty for 100000 miles absolutely complementary. When I noticed I was charged, he made some exuses that soe taxes have been taken out by his boss. Further investigation showed I was charged without my consent.
I cancelled it by contacting the bank and the company who delivers the warranty.

33,"May 26, 2016","After almost 30 years and 3 cars with Acura, I decided to shop for a Lexus. My last experience with Sterling McCall car sales was over 10 years ago at both the Lexus and Toyota dealerships. Back then it was the typical high-pressure, fast-talking salesman experience, which at the time was a huge turn-off. Albie was very laid back from the start. No pressure and very patient with all our questions and requests. Made the buying experience very easy.

46,"December 07, 2015","This Lexus dealer is one that you need to DEFINATELY  AVOID AT ALL COSTS.They operate on the premise that the customer is dumb and naive and doesn't know anything about the car business. I worked with Ron J.-the New Car manager and a new finance manager that had very little experience. I also spoke to Alice-who is over all of them in the Finance dept. Just 2-3 days of spinning my wheels and not getting anything accomplished - I finally dropped the thought of owning a Lexus and went back to Honda of Spring where I was treated like family. I wound up buying a 2015 Black Honda Accord V6 that was loaded with Nav/and all options for under $29K. It rides and handles just as nice as the ES and saved thousands in doing so!!!!!

47,"November 13, 2015","I’m not sure if Sterling McCall Lexus Houston intentionally lies, or if the staff is just under-trained and misinformed.
 
I leased a Lexus GX 460, and the finance office offered to sell me a tire replacement warranty. I specifically queried the finance manager to make sure this was a REPLACEMENT ONLY warranty, like the tire warranty I had on my
previous BMW, and not a ``repair or replacement'' warranty. The price for the Lexus warranty was $2099.00,  so it would certainly not be worth the money if the warranty was not replacement only (you can get ``repair or replacement'' warranties at most large tire stores, like Discount Tire, and the price is usually no more than $30.00 per tire).

Unfortunately, I trusted the word of the finance manager, thinking that this is a high-end dealer and they would not have deceptive sales tactics. Wrong!!! Now Sterling McCall Lexus Houston says that the warranty I purchased is ``repair or replacement.''

Sterling McCall Lexus Houston was unwilling to refund the money for the warranty, so that I could purchase an independent replacement only warranty; the only thing they offered was to refund $600 of the warranty, on the grounds that I've already had the use of the warranty for two years!  When I complained that they misrepresented  the warranty they offered, they just said well, that's the warranty they had at the time, and they have changed the company they use for the warranties, because they didn't understand what that company was offering!

After numerous messages to the general manager I have still gotten no response. I keep getting pawned off on other managers who say they cannot or are unwilling to make this right.
 
This is not the first incident I've had with Sterling McCall,  there was another incident at one at their sister stores in Clear Lake. Both dealerships are owned
by Group 1 Automotive, and you might think that this is the fault of Group 1, rather than the fault of these two individual dealerships, but Group 1 is also the owner of the very BMW dealership I used previously, which went out of their way to make sure that customer satisfaction was a first priority.  So the problem is with Lexus itself.

I love my past two Lexus SUVs, but this is sure to be my last one, now that I know how Lexus allows their  ``independent dealers” to conduct business. There was no help after multiple calls to Lexus itself---they do not stand behind the brand and make things right for customers who have no success with their ``independent dealers''.

48,"November 05, 2015","If I could post lower than one star I would!  I have a 2015 Lexus RXH. I was sold on customer service.  Since I have had my vehicle.  Every time I have called service for an oil change, I have been hung up on, transferred three or four times or told that I called the wrong place.  Then when I finally get someone that actually knows how to work the phone, I cannot be scheduled until a month away.  I bought my SUV a year ago and this has been going on every time.  This passed Saturday I was scheduled for an oil change and a loaner vehicle.  I had my appointment for a month and half.  It was storming that day so there were only a couple other customers.  Three people ask me if I would rather just wait on the vehicle instead of getting a loaner.  It would be less paperwork for them and it should take less than an hour because they were slow.  That was at 10:30.  At 1:30. Three hours later....I get my truck.  I hate owning a Lexus.  Their customer service is horrible!  They have tons of trophies that supposedly came for good customer service....but if you read the horrible reviews.  I think they made those trophy a their selves! Will never buy a Lexus or a car from Sterling McCall Lexus again.  Customer service is:  if I promise your car will be don't less than an hour...and it is three hours later.

59,"August 15, 2014",Easy service experience and great Service Advisor Kevin Bayer. Kevin is easy to reach my phone or email. Never has dealership recommended a service that I did not need. Dealer has honored all warranty work and will make it right no matter what. My next vehicle will definitely be a Lexus just so I can continue to work with Kevin. Sterling McCall has earned a life long customer!,4.4

I came to the center at the end of the day when most workers are tired and ready to go home, but he rushed over to my car and was happy to help.

65,"May 19, 2014","Our Service Adviser was Kevin Bayer.  He is very nice to work with, very customer oriented, very conscientious.  The loaner cars are always a treat to drive!  We have tried another Houston Lexus Service Department when we first moved here, and Sterling McCall is much better.  We have been very pleased with every aspect of their service. They are not high pressure, but, helpful.",4.8

68,"October 18, 2013","I was shopping for a lexus and searched high and low with several dealerships in the Houston area. I bought a Lexus before from another dealer and I went back, but could not get the car that I wanted. I came to Sterling McCall after getting a card from Paul Hebert one night when my Landcruiser had some problem. I kept the card and several months later I called him and worked with Paul. He assisted me with buying the Lexus I feel I can be satisfied with. Thanks Gloria Derrow",5.0
69,"October 05, 2013","I called to have my car serviced because my battery was dying. I explained that I had it jumped started by AAA the night before. I was told be the service scheduler I couldn't get an appt for over 2 weeks. I believe a stranded customer is an emergency. Obvioulsy Sterling MCcall Lexus does not think so. I also told I was taking a trip and if the care was left for 2 days in the airport parking the car battery would be dead if left unstarted for so long.
I called Westside Lexus and was booked the next day with a loaner. I recieved fabulous service at Westside Lexus. Please don't waste your time even calling sterling McCall for a service appointment.",2.0

71,"September 04, 2013","I have purchased a half dozen cars in my life and by far, my experience with Sterling McCall Lexus and David Capin has been the best.  Not only has he found the vehicle/color we were looking for, got a fair price on it, and has kept in touch to make sure that we are completely satisified with our Lexus.  He will be the salesman for our next Lexus shortly.  His knowledge and professionalism and contacts, he is the go to salesman for ALL makes & models, not only Lexus.  If they can build it, he can get it.",5.0

I have bought numerous cars from Cody and continue to seek his advice for my purchases today.  He assists my employees in their purchases and we refer all our business to him.  I highly recommend Cody Phillips for you car buying needs.  ,5.0
73,"August 10, 2012"," I took my wife's RX330 in for a noise coming from the right rear of the vehicle. I originally thought it was a tire going bad but the Tire Shop told me it was the wheel bearing. The Service department diagnosed it as a bad tire which sent me back to the tire shop(NTB)after I refused to buy the tires from the service department.. NTB then again told me the tire was fine and there was no reason to purchase another one and sent me back to the dealer for a warranty repair on the wheel bearing. Again the service department told me the tire was bad.... ARGHHHhhhh. 

 The Service department again tried to sell me a set of tires. I told them that if they would guarantee that the noise would be gone or I could keep the tires for free that I would let them try the tires. Of course they refused, They told me that even if they replaced the tires and the noise was still there that I would be responsible for paying for something that didn't fix the problem. 
 I finally had to agree to pay the dealer $35.00 for them to remove the tires off another vehicle and install them on my wife's car for them to test drive it with a different set of tires.   They told me the noise was gone. I didn't believe them and went to the dealership to test drive the vehicle with the service writer, Sure enough the noise was STILL THERE. 

 Reluctantly they replaced the wheel bearing and the noise was gone. I don't think I should have been put through all this inconvenience and I dang should not have been sold a set of tires when that wasn't the issue.  In the end they also did Not charge me the $35.00 for swapping the ""test tires""  We will not purchase another Lexus from them. ",2.8

75,"April 01, 2008","Internet sales rep. Richard Joseph commited to the sale of an '08 IS350 with premium package and ML sound system.  After I signed, he delivered an '08 IS350 with X-package and ML system, not the features I had told him over and over.  Sales manager, Steve Wedderburn gave me tint for free and tire isurance, that was wrongly sold to me, for free as well, but that was it, nothing else.  Richard Joseph told me that he did not want to waste his time nor his coworkers time with me unless I was ready to sign that day.  I was not satisfied at all, and they did nothing else to compensate me for all my lost time - I was there for 5 hours when I found out I had bought the wrong car, and Richard Joseph tried to play ""dumb"" by saying he did not know the other features were a must, when I had asked him over and over if that car had what I wanted, what we had talked about and he kept reassuring me that it did plus the ML sound system.  The company did not deliver their commitment to the customer and now, they do not know me when I go there.  That is how professional these people are.  Stay away from them, they need to go out of business.  Service is as bad.  Took it in for a check on  my lights and they replaced an assembly because it was faulty, only to come back to me 2.5 hours later to tell me they had made a mistake and there was nothing wrong with my original part, so they had to go and take the new one out and put mine back in.  The second time for service, they took a CD out of my stereo, a burned CD.  What a shame, they should not be a Lexus dealership.",1.4
76,"February 27, 2007","Very straightforward dealing with the Internet Manager.  No jerking around or back handed dealing.  Everything was upfront.  Took possession of the car late in the evening and was invited to come back the next day so they could completely go over the car's features with me.

I'd recommend putting Sterling McCall Lexus on the shopping list.

77,"October 24, 2003","Very unaccommodating, dishonest, hard to work with, will lie to get you in and then demand a commitment immediately before even showing you the car, revealing price of the car, and telling you the interest rate; will never, never go there again and intend to tell everyone I know who is interested in a Lexus to go elsewhere; worst car dealership I have dealt with in my life.",1.0
