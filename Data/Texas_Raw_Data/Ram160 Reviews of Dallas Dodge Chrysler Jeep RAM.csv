0,"June 26, 2020",Amado was my sales person who drove the Jeep to my home for a test drive. He is a valuable employee  and I appreciate his help. The GM Pedro did a great job as well and I appreciate how hard he worked to make the deal! The customer service of the sales team is amazing. I also want to acknowledge Alex in service and his crew who helped out to install my tow hitch and wiring and make sure everything was perfect as well. You should be so proud of all of the employees at Dallas Chrysler Dodge jeep. I will be referring friends and family to this dealership. It was worth the drive for the Customer service! Thank you everyone for making my Jeep purchase fantastic and memorable. The team here deserves acknowledgement for sure! It is not often you run across a whole group of people working together like they do keeping their smiles on and making sure everyone is well taken care of and during Covid keeping themselves and the customers safe. Thanks again! Lori ,5.0
1,"June 18, 2020","I would like to start by saying that, I have experienced excellent and fabulous customer service from the Service Dept. of this dealership. Service Advisor Hector Alicea and Alex Padilla (Manager) went out of their way and displayed pure professionalism and helped me resolve my Jeep repair situation. At the same time, I truly appreciate them arranging and providing me a dealer loaner car, which seemed to be impossible considering it was a busy closing time and just hrs before a busy national long weekend.

Hector is extremely knowledgeable in his profession, attentive, energetic and friendly. I would definitely recommend this location as an excellent service providing company. 

Thanks a lot Hector and Alex!!    ",5.0
2,"June 10, 2020","Worst service experience I have ever had. I have been doing business ( buying cars and having them serviced here for 15 years ). This will end my relationship with them!!!!!
I brought my 2015 Durango in for service (Oil change, radiator flush and transmission fluid and filter change ) I was quoted $240 to $300.00 for the flush and trans. work. After a 5 hour wait I left the dealership and my wife remain. She called my when the car was ready and said they are trying to charge her $690.00 for the work. Naturally I was UPSET. I spoke to the Service manager and he NEVER explained what I was being charged for, he only said he will try to get the bill back to what I was quote!!!! When my wife got home she showed me the bill and it had been amended to $363.85. To my amazement they charged to $110.00 for an Oil change. They said they did Synthetic oil. I NEVER requested this service and had never requested synthetic oil in all the years I have been getting my vehicle serviced here. This smack to me as a Total padding of the bill.
I will now be taking my business to another Dealer.",1.0
3,"April 30, 2020","Sales portion was a good experience. I traded in a vehicle against the purchase of a new vehicle. 60-days later, the vehicle I traded in still has not been paid off with the finance company. Dallas Dodge has ruined my credit because they haven't paid off the loan on the vehicle I traded in. The vehicle I traded in was sold 5-days later.  I do not recommend doing business with this dealership.  I know I will never do business with them again.  My next move is to file a complaint for fraudulent business practices with the Texas State Attorney General's Office.",1.0
4,"January 30, 2020",Worst dealership I have ever dealt with! Truck was damaged prior to purchase they said they would fix (they have yet to fix) I schedule to have it fixed after dropping off and leaving they called and said couldn't fix it right now.. They lost a set of keys and the owners manual (still not replaced). Not one person has contacted me about the issues it has been about 6 weeks since I purchased the truck. I highly recommend using a different dealership!,1.0
5,"January 09, 2020",add $1500 warranty to the Fiat 500 I bought without my acknowledgement. It's been a painful experience to ask for a refund. Had to go there multiple times and they just wouldn't do it until I left google review and threaten with my attorney.,1.0
6,"December 14, 2019","Drove down to the dealership to look at a specific Ram truck that was listed on their site. It turns out the actual price is $3,000 more than what they advertised.  The explanation was these were dealer add-ons. The dealer add-ons are clearly shown in the pictures and listed in the description below the fake advertised price.  They include a vague disclaimer at the bottom of the ad which technically makes this bait and switch legal yet in no other industry considered ethical. When I asked the General Manager about his shady business practices, his justification was everyone else does it. Which is not true. If you are in the market for a Chrysler product go to Frisco CDJR. There advertised prices are higher but are legit. If I had listened to their warning about Dallas Dodge i could have saved 3 hours of my life.",1.0

8,"September 13, 2019","I found the truck I wanted on the Dallas Dodge website. Went in on Aug. 31st and worked with Valentine Daniels while purchasing the vehicle. After the test drive, I noticed a small spot where the paint was worn on the door. I asked if that could be fixed if I purchased the vehicle and was told by Valentine that it wouldn't be a problem. The truck also only had one key so he told me they would make an extra key. He originally told me to come back the following Monday to get everything done. Monday was Labor Day so of course they were closed. Ended up having to wait for them to order the key so took it in on Tuesday with the expectation that i was going to get a loaner to drive while they were working on it. After setting everything in motion, was told that there would be no loaner. So i dropped the truck off Tuesday morning at 8 am. Called several times that day, left voicemails with Anthony Biddle and never received a return phone call or update on my truck at all. Was told by Valentine on Wednesday that they were working on the steps and the door would be next. I told him I was having to find rides to and from work and needed my truck back no later than Thursday. Called at 12 pm Thursday and was told that nothing was done to my truck but the key and the reason was that I wanted it back the next day. By this time they had had the truck in their possession for 3 days and not once gave an update as to the status nor did the service department answer or return my calls. They has PLENTY of time in those 3 days to fix it and simply didn't. I honestly feel like after making the sale, my satisfaction was no longer a priority. I feel like they have zero professionalism and horrible customer service. I will not take my truck back there for any kind of service and do not recommend them to anyone.",1.2
9,"August 28, 2019","Lost all trust in this location and the service department is ruining Dallas Dodge’s reputation. I will never go back.  I would recommend looking at reviews and see the pattern regarding service, including the same response as far as using your experience as training, which is a joke. Also the three different “service advisors” that are also called “managers” gave me 3 different diagnoses. 
Been a loyal customer taking my ram for maintenance since purchase.  Have done ALL required maintenance faithfully.   Have complained on NUMEROUS visits starting at the beginning if not all about brakes squeaking. Was told normal.  Kept complaining, told normal.  Finally at recent visit as I complained AGAIN, they checked and said one side was worn down to 1-2 mm while the other side is still 75%.  As I explained ALL of my NUMEROUS complaints I’m informed that it is not documented.   Also was told that during services, they only check one side.   Be aware of that if you complain about your breaks, make them document that A. you complained and B. make them document they checked all sides.  ",1.0
10,"April 26, 2019","So, after paying upwardd of $1,500 for a new win module and key fob, I am told that I will have to pay in additional $50 for the key shank that goes inside the key fob. The shank does not stay in the new $280 fob, so my keys are always falling off. For the record, the sales associate Liz was quite Pleasant, but I am dissatisfied with the overall service. So, in exchange for them not giving me a $50 Shank, they have lost the business from my Dodge Durango, my Dodge Challenger, and my son's Dodge Citadel. I own a couple of clothing shops and I understand that companies are in business to make money, however, customer satisfaction is a big part of that. I will sacrifice a $30 shirt or a $50 Pair of pants if it means keeping a customer who spends hundreds of dollars a week. To me it just makes sense. Their shop manager Salvador doesn't seem to believe in this model. If it had been explained to me in the beginning that I may need a new shank then I would have not been so reluctant to get one, but all I was told was that I would be purchasing a new key fob, and to me as a customer, what that means is a key fob and a shank, because as a customer, I do not see these as two separate items... and that was never explained to me.",2.0
11,"April 18, 2019","I took my car in for it not starting. They tell me it’s the fuel pump rely and they have to wire it in. Only changed rely but charged me for the whole job. I even have pictures or the area and when I called and asked they never returned my calls. They will scam you on repairs. Please watch out!!
I have done reviews on other sites and they say they want to talk. When they called me he said would call me back and never did. So the replies to reviews saying they want to resolve the issue is just more lies. 
Hope this helps your decision on taking your vehicle into this place for any type of services. ",1.2
12,"January 01, 2019",I’d give them 0 stars if I could. I bought a new 2019 ram 12-29-2018. I traded my old truck in since it was time. They sold me a ram I thought was equivalent or even better than my old truck. I was wrong they talked about how the Uconnect was able to be download on phone to control vehicle functions. LIES! I confronted them and they tried to make me look like the idiot. I would get a ram again but not from this dealer because once they trick you into the vehicle they don’t give a crap about you. Go somewhere else where you will be treated right.,1.0
13,"December 19, 2018","I purchased some parts from Amazon that came from this dealership. The listing was for 4 speakers for my Jeep, when the box arrived it only had two. I called the dealership to see if they could send me the other two speakers. I was told the listing was incorrect even though the description was very clear, there were multiple pictures all showing 4 speakers and the price was exactly twice as expensive as all the listings with just two speakers and that they would not be able to honor the listing. Their solution was to credit me back 50% of the price and suggested that I go buy the other two speakers FROM SOMEONE ELSE. What? I left a review on Amazon similar to this... but wait, there's more! After I left that review Brandon calls me and says they are willing to give me an additional $10 credit for the trouble and IF I felt like updating the review that would be great. I told Brandon I was not interested in the $10 or in changing my review and I felt like that was very shady. I was not looking for freebies or a handout all I wanted was what I paid for and what was advertised by them... But wait there's still more! Following THAT conversation Brandon felt like it would be a good move to go to MY companies Google page and leave a 1 star review saying that I was a jerk and people shouldn't shop there.  Wow! I have screen shots of all this by the way. I can't speak to how this dealership operates otherwise, but I'm astonished that a business would have someone like this running their online sales department and speaks volumes about the poor customer service I received on the first phone call where all I wanted is what I paid for. You could have had ALL of my money and a happy customer willing to give you glowing review, but nope... here we are. Great job Brandon Ruffin.

14,"December 08, 2018","I only had a test drive with this dealership. I did not make a purchase. I have 2 complaints. The first is when I was shopping online I received a code for a $50 gift card with a scheduled test drive and I never received it. I’ve inquired about it several times and received no response. Secondly, about 2 months after my test drive I received a toll bill for a vehicle that the state of Texas shows was in my name for 3 weeks. The Texas DMV has record that I purchased that vehicle from Dallas Dodge. I also received a notification from carfax that the vehicle in question was recently serviced. I never signed any loan or title documentation with this dealership My personal information was used to commit fraud by someone at the dealership. A quick search online shows that the salesman (Valentine Daniels) is still employed there and the dealership nor the corporate office has rectified the situation. They never apologized or admitting to doing anything wrong. ",1.0
15,"October 18, 2018","The worst service ever!! First it took them 4 hours to almost complete the work that was supposed to be done in 2.5 hours. They didn't have on stock the tire that my vehicle needed so they ordered. I got a call saying that the tire was in so I can stop by and get it done. So I showed up and it took then 1.5 hours to find out that the tire was put in another vehicle. So I decided to leave since I had to to to the hospital to take my son for a follow up with his doctors. They gave me my car and didn't even bother to fill up the tire to the proper air pressure. They told me that if I change my mind to stop by in the afternoon. I finishing with the doctors appointment I decided to go back to the dealership and get it done once for good. I showed up and they still didn't have the tire. Earlier in the morning I requested to talk to a supervisor, no one has bothered to call or email me back. Be aware of the kind of service this guy perform in these dealership.",1.0

18,"July 05, 2018","I came in for an “open circuit” code relating to my torque converter. After hours of tests and test drives, the technicians spoke with me and indicated the issue was internal to the transmission. I agreed to do the necessary tear down. I was notified I had a burnt clutch and would need a full rebuild at 84,000 miles. I had to pay out of pocket since it was now out of warranty. After getting the run around for pricing with Josh, Peter and Derrick corrected the situation and I paid up. However, my vehicle FAILED inspection at their facility before I even got to drive it away, turns out, they hadn’t put enough miles on it to even inspect. I return the next day and notify them it’s DUMPING and SHUDDERING into neutral but am told they need approval to check it out. Two weeks later I get the OK to come in and they inform me that I have THREE OF FOUR BROKEN ENGINE MOUNTS! They are telling me it’s unrelated, even though they removed two of them AND lowered my engine to drop my trans. They never told me they were broken during any parts of the process... I’ve had 3 “multipoint inspections” in the time my car was there. Less than 24 hours and under 60 miles I brought back to verify the shuddering. THEY BROKE MY ENGINE MOUNTS!",1.0
19,"June 17, 2018","Hands down, one of the best car buying experiences I've had. I am not sure that the whole experience could have been any better. From the test drive and the great product knowledge of Ezell, to the quick financing service of Alex. Even Chapa, who helped me in completing the deal, followed up with me the following day. For anyone who is looking for a great deal, with a 5-star dealership, this is the place for you; highly recommended by me.",5.0
20,"May 16, 2018","Salesman Augustine was the only helpful one, the rest of the buying experience was awful ..
They tried to remove addons ion windshield after final negotiation,, without telling us., then found out when signing final paperwork. I was getting a hitch added , took it in for service to add. They informed me that loaner cars weren’t available for State Farm clients, I would have to use enterprise and put down s deposit. To top all that off after two day the put the hitch on but couldn’t get electrical part to work, then tell me they have to backorder a harness..

22,"May 12, 2018","Even though no one was able to replicate the problem so it could be diagnosed, Bill Marshall kept trying.  The afternoon after I picked the Jeep up from their most recent attempt to replicate the problem, Bill called me at home to tell me they had just received a notice from DCJR that the cause of the proble had been identified and what was needed to fix the issue.  At that time, Bill began working to set up an appointmentthat was convenient for me and when we decided the best day would be a day that he was off, he arranged with one of the other Service Advisors (Beth Anne) to take care of me when I arrived.

23,"May 01, 2018","So yesterday I called Dallas dodge  over a white jeep Patriot Sport, with supposedly 7600 miles speaking with a Chad , he went outside to put his eyes on it called me back told me it was there , we drive from Kilgore Texas and during the drive an internet sales calls over my same inquiry online over this same jeep tells me if I make it in today , the last day of the month they can do 14,000 . But only today , come on in . We get there on my nieces birthday at 3:30 . Not only is there no white 2017 patriot , there are absolutely no patriots . This was completely false . We leave , I call the manager supposedly the General manager, he says he’ll call me back when he finds out how this went wrong . He’s off today . This dealership could care less about customer service , all you get is apology’s. One after another . We are sorry we had you drive 6 hours on your daughters birthday for no other reason than to try to drive back fast enough to at least take her to dinner . She was getting a car!!! . This wax the worst car buying experience I’ve ever had I’d suggest to anyone trying to buy a vehicle in two or three days to steer clear of this dealership , they lied to just get us in from Kilgore Texas and could care less about repairing the situation. Dodge should definitely take a look into this dealerships practices. The whole time they had loaned both vehicles out knowing I’m coming to buy one or the other. Horrible customer service! Not one time did a salesman come out to us we had to literally go in and ask someone to come out and show us vehicles, whomever the used car manager is they should seriously think about someone else . This dealership must have money running out of there ears to throw my business away , thus would have been my third dodge product in 16 months the other two 60,000 dollar dodge diesel. Fool me once . !!!! Thank you General manager for calling me back over your used department, Great looking out !!!!!!!!  if it were not for me spending two days looking for this vehicle already I would not even think letting you repair this situation. But I have a feeling corporate will care a whole lot . if this  happened once it’s a habit . ",1.6
24,"April 20, 2018","The customer service when purchasing was great. After they have your money, they treat you extremely unprofessionally. I have been trying to get a hold of any person to return a warranty purchased on my vehicle and all I received was the runaround. After over a month of trying to get a hold of someone, I filed a BBB complaint and drove 2 hours to the dealership. I submitted the paperwork and they botched my return and are now blaming Mopar for my missing money (even though Mopar returned their portion) and have no interest in helping me and still won't return calls or emails. The only call I've received was someone named Billy Fritz, begging me to take the BBB complaint down and then promising the entirety of my refund will be processed. It did not get refunded and the very limited communication I have had with Billy via email (since he will not return calls or answer his phone, just like everyone else at the dealership) has been 100% lies and I have no idea why they are being so difficult considering the car I purchased was extremely expensive.

I would not recommend this dealership to anyone. If by some chance you have to buy from here, make sure you never need to return for service or anything else because the 100% do not care about you after they have received your money.",1.0

35,"November 27, 2017","DO NOT BUY A CHRYSLER PRODUCT  UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES!!!!!!! They sell you a vehicle and are so proud of their 100,000 mile power train warranty that comes with the purchase of one of their vehicles. Don't be fooled, when it comes time to use the warranty, they won't honor it. Apparently if a part breaks in the transmission before you even reach 50,000 miles, and they determine it to be broken and not failed, then they won't honor their commitment to you or their product. I'm not exactly clear on the difference between when a part fails or breaks, which breaking sounds like failing to me, but they seem very knowledgeable about the difference. And the difference is, they won't pay for it! From my experience at this dealership during this service nightmare, their service technicians and advisers are incompetent and disorganized, and don't really seem to care about their customers at all. Here is a run down of my service experience at Dallas Dodge.

1. Scheduled a service appointment to replace a recall item and have the transmission checked because it was sticking between first and second gear. The lady on the phone who made my appointment checked and confirmed a transmission tech was working that day that could look at my vehicle. When we arrived, our service tech Beth Ann seemed to not have any idea what exactly service we were there for, and when we explained about the transmission, she said they wouldn't be able to check it that day and would need to keep it until the next week. Since my wife needed her car for work, we couldn't do that, so they just fixed the recall issue. Beth Ann made my wife another appointment for the week of Thanksgiving to bring the vehicle back in to have the transmission checked. 

2. When the time came for the appointment, I called a couple of days earlier to confirm the time, and they had no record of an appointment for my wife at all. Apparently after all her assurances, Beth Ann didn't bother to even make the appointment for my wife as she told her to her face she did. Despite this, we still left the vehicle to be checked out.

3. The following Monday, I received a call from Beth Ann stating the techs put the vehicle on the computer and it told them the Primary Control Module needed to be replaced. She advised it would be the following Monday before the vehicle would be ready to be picked up. 

4. We received another call from Beth Ann on Wednesday, telling us the PCM had been replaced, but it didn't fix the problem. She also advised that they finally had a transmission tech look at it, and he found a broken transmission fluid fill tube. I was advised that since the tube was broken, it wasn't considered to have failed, so the power train warranty wouldn't cover the work. Beth Ann then quoted a repair cost of $700. When I reminded her again of our secondary extended warranty we purchased with the vehicle, she agreed to contact them. She then called me back later to advise me they refused to cover the cost of the repair. I contacted them directly, and was advised their computer showed the part was covered under my Chrysler power train warranty, and that's why they wouldn't cover it. They even contacted Beth Ann directly, who advised them the part failed but they considered it broken, Chrysler wouldn't cover it. Beth Ann then called me back and advised me they should pull the transmission pan and check for debris, then if there is any in there, they can replace the whole system and include the broken fill tube. 

5. Beth Ann called back Friday and of course advised me there was no debris in the transmission fluid. That being the case, Chrysler still refused to cover the repair costs, even though the part # is listed as covered on their website. I spoke to service manager ""Jay"", who also confirmed the part wouldn't be covered because of the fuzzy line between broken and failed.  

6. The following Monday I called the Mopar warranty company directly and was given the same run around between broken and failed. Then when I requested to speak to the lady's supervisor, she advised me it would be 1 to 2 days before i could expect a call back, the whole time my wife's car is still in their shop. Now I'm having to deal with my extended warranty company to get the repair work handled properly. 

It appears to me this service department is completely unprofessional. They repaired the wrong the part, then in  order to recoup their expenses on that mistake, they found another broken part, and decided they wouldn't cover that. I'm disgusted with the whole incident.

This experience has made it abundantly clear to me that Chrysler doesn't care about their customers. They don't even seem to want to honor the warranties on the products they sell. I've bought 6 different Dodge, Chrysler, or  Jeep vehicles over the years, but NEVER AGAIN.    ",1.0

I was told it would be an hour on the phone but when I got there they had gotten a little more busy and was advised it may take longer but opted to stay and wait anyway. They have a nice waiting area with TV and you can even watch your vehicle being worked on through a camera on a different screen. Even with them getting busier than they expected I was out in less than an hour. Good service, fast service, friendly staff, and mopar parts for my Hemi; all while being less expensive then the other “quick change” oil places I checked, sign me up! Normally I avoid dealerships because even though the service is ok the price is terrible. These guys had great service and specials that were a third the cost I was quoted at other places and yes that’s semi-synthetic in a Hemi for around 40 dollars!

88,"May 19, 2017","Had it taken in for a check engine light, warranty, I have the maximum care extended warranty that covers everything electrical. I had my ambient air temp sensor go out and my driver side mirror controls. They wouldn't give me a rental until they diagnosed if it was covered under warranty even though my warranty says they cover first day no matter what. My truck stayed over night I did not get the rental bc I would have been out money even if they did pick up the tab, it never got checked out until halfway through the next day. I had been dealing with the service manager there Carey, he had another advisor call me she told me it was not covered under warranty and it would be $650 for them to fix a corroded wire in the door panel, that has never been taken off since the factory out it together. Fought with the warranty department, we all know it is a door harness or connector issue, should be covered. It since the dealer said corrosion it would not be covered. I called Rockwall Dodge and priced the part it would be $114 that's not even at cost which I would get it at, so I asked for the service deptartment and told them I would be bringing my truck to them, because they knew exactly which warranty plan I had and said it would be covered and they would have a rental waiting for me. So I called Dallas Dodge and told them I would be picking my truck up. Carey called me back and told me he went back there and figured the issue out, after listening to my voicemail no doubt, and it would be only $130 to fix the issue plus my oil change. I told him no I wanted to get my vehicle and pay for the oil change, oh there is a $100 dollar diagnostic fee, so if it had been covered under warranty that would be the deductible but since they said corrosion it wouldn't cover. So pay $160 get my truck back and take it to another honest dealer or pay $180 plus tax to fix it. I was being held ransom after they probably figured out I was jumping ship, so to alleviate the headache I am having them fix it, to avoid more time loss out of work. Do your self a favor and go to Rockwall Dodge so you won't get angry or snaked. I am beyond furious and will be calling Chrysler Customer Care. ",1.0

103,"September 14, 2016","Ok. So I purchased a Jeep grand Cherokee used from CarMax. I noticed it had two open recalls that require taking it to a dealership. I called Dallas Dodge Chrysler and Jeep. The service person who answered the phone put me on hold for about four minutes and then got back on the phone and told me she would have to call me back in 25 minutes. She never did. So, I took the Jeep down to the dealer and went in and talked to a service person named Mary Lou. The person I talked to was very nice. She check to make sure the needed parts were in stock, and they were. Then I set an appointment for a week later. She said have the car in by 8 o'clock in the morning. It will take 3 to 4 hours to fix. Please be sure to call me, she said, if you cannot make the appointment. So, this morning at 8 o'clock, I brought the car in. I talked to a service rep named James  Jay Pecor. He was working on a new iPad and new software system and so it took about 20 minutes for him just to get my car into the garage. Along the way he informed me that the car needed a software upgrade to the tune of $130. I agreed, and reminded him that I needed the car by 1 o'clock that day, since I had been informed that the repair would only take three or four hours. He never indicated that would be a problem. Then at 12 o'clock, just as I was cleaning up and getting ready to go pick up my car, I got a call from the service rep telling me that there were seven or eight cars still in front of mine ( were none when I pulled the car in at 8 o'clock in the morning). Now there were seven! And I was told that my car would probably not be ready until sometime tomorrow. I told him that was not satisfactory, to just put the car back together again and I would be by to get it at the appointed time. He called me back a few minutes later and he said maybe he could get it out by six today. Still unsatisfactory. I had set up several appointments with the understanding that I would have my car.

 Please excuse my username. I had a terrible experience at a different dealership and there's no way for me to change it.  My experience at Dallas Dodge was so incredibly different prompted me to write this review 


 I had the pleasure of purchasing a 2016 dodge Ram from Chad Hickman. Not only was he  friendly and respectful of my time he also was extremely knowledgeable about the vehicle I was purchasing.    From the moment I walked on a lot Chad  made me feel comfortable with his no pressure tactics. I ended up purchasing from him and couldn't be any happier.

109,"March 07, 2016","UPDATE: I was contacted by Billy Fritz at Dallas Dodge and he turned my whole experience around. He located a brand new 2016 Omaha Orange with the interior I wanted and brought it to Dallas and took the other one back! The new one even had extra features that the previous one didn't and he did an even trade for it so I got a better Jeep for the same price. They wanted to make sure I was happy with my experience and Billy Fritz sure was able to turn the whole experience into something awesome instead of the frustration I was dealing with. Go to Dallas Dodge and ask for Billy Fritz, he's the MAN! :D

On 2/29/2016, I purchased a 2015 Jeep Renegade Latitude from Dallas Dodge in Dallas, TX. I felt like we got an okay deal but the next day I got curious about the mileage as it seemed a bit high for a new car. I pulled a CarFax report on the car and found out it had been reported as stolen in November of 2015 and an insurance claim of some type was paid out on it. I immediately contacted the dealership and spoke with Donald Grayson, the General Manager, who stated that he could look into this for me but, and I quote, ""I'm not denying the car was stolen, it happens a lot."" I let him know that down the road this could absolutely effect me reselling the vehicle and asked for an explanation. He stated he would get back to me by Friday, March 4, 2016. Not only did he not call me back with an explanation, I left multiple messages for him and after no response, emailed my saleswoman who told me that he was now on vacation! It also now seems suspicious that she told me that the EVT (electronic vehicle tracking system) was missing some information so she'd have to contact me with that information later (which she hasn't yet). I've now filed a formal complaint with Jeep and am waiting to hear back from someone for an explanation. My personal advice to anyone thinking about purchasing a Dodge, Chrysler or Jeep from this dealership is run the other way and if you do decide to purchase a new vehicle from them, make sure to ask if it's ever been stolen.",5.0

115,"January 11, 2016","I bought a brand new vehicle from Dallas Dodge on Saturday, 12/19/15 with 70 miles on it. At 350 miles my check engine light came on. I called Christmas Eve, explained the situation and was told to bring it in for service. When I asked if I needed to schedule an appointment I was told it was not necessary. I came in the following Saturday, 12/26/15 to have the check engine light looked at. I was told it was a small vacuum leak, put in a rental, and sent on my way. I picked my Jeep up from being serviced Monday, 12/28/15. The check engine light came on with 938 miles the same week. I made an appointment to bring my vehicle in on 01/02/16 at 8:30am. I arrived at 8:26am, checked in and was told to have a seat in the waiting area. After an hour and a half without an update I approached the service counter to find out what was wrong with my car. Thirty minutes later my service tech came to me to only say they haven't looked at it yet and they are putting me in a rental.

I understand repairs take time, not having a part takes time, what I don't understand is why I'm told to schedule an appointment when it ""doesn't guarantee my car will be looked at"". I expected to leave my car for repairs today. I did not expect to wait two hours without any update and without my car being diagnosed. I did expect some kind of concern, care I've spent the last two Saturday's in this service center with only having 1,000 miles on my car.

By the time that I went in for the test drive that night, I was greeted with Ray's friendly attitude and wide knowledge of the car.

I call Dallas Dodge and received the best service by my sales person Dan, he was awesome; Dan did all the things the competitor sales persons did not do. Dan even purchase me a beverage while I waited on the deal to go through.  I liked the fact I was not constantly annoyed by a talking sales person until I need to be spoken with about the deal.

Within a few days, they make a false report to the  police that you have not made timely payments and REPO your car.

139,"June 20, 2014","I took my car in on May 24, 2014 because the engine light came on, and I had a recall (the timing chain tensioner). My husband put a note on the dashboard to use fully synthetic oil, only. Of course they didn't do that, then wanted to charge us for the difference in price. They said they didn't know they needed to drain the oil for the recall. Really?  Then they said there were no stored codes for the ""check engine light"".  So we took the car home. 

On May 29 the engine light came on again, while driving home from work on a busy interstate at 5pm. Luckily, I was near the dealer and the car was running ok. This time they said there were 2 pages of stored codes (no stored codes 5 days earlier??) The guy said, there were too many codes, and he didn't know what they were for. He said, he'll clear the codes, and send me home and for me to bring the car back when the light comes on again. I have one of the first 2011 Dodge Charger R/T with the Road & Track Package....love my car and the Hemi. So I asked is that gonna hurt my engine? Is that bad for the car? Will I get home safely? (I'm female, and my husband was out of town) I won't get stuck? I live in the country. He said it's fine, you'll get home ok. I'll bring the car around for you. 10 minutes later he said he'll keep the car to see what's wrong with it. hmm?? Should have said that first. 5 days later, they still had no clue what was wrong with it, they couldn't tell me what the codes were for, I asked to speak with the tech, the manager, everyone was at lunch. So he says the tech will drive my car to his house for the night and bring it back in the morning. I said H...NO! Have my car ready for pick up. He then says it's running fine, nothing is wrong with it. So I pick it up...again. I called the dealer and complained, they didn't care. 

June 4, my car breaks down on the same interstate on my way home at 5pm, it's 100 degrees out and my husband is working out of town, again. In a skirt, I climb up the steep embankment to find I'm at Forrest and 635, not a safe area. This happened because Dallas Dodge had my car for 5 days and couldn't figure out what was wrong. I waited until 8pm for the tow truck, they took it to Richardson Dodge. I handed the lady at the counter the 2 page print out of my codes, and she read through them all. Telling me what each one meant. They had it fixed and on the road in a day. I gave her a hug, she has no idea what I went through.

If Dallas Dodge had looked at my car, and knew how to read the codes I wouldn't have had such a traumatic experience. They were awful. I will never, ever go there again for anything.",1.8

Do yourself a favor and do NOT take your vehicle to Dallas Dodge Jeep Chrysler. The next morning I drove 200 miles to my dealership where I purchased the vehicle only to find out my issue was common in Jeep Wranglers with my motor and that it needed a basic tune up (new spark plugs) to resolve the issue and that the work performed on my vehicle by Dallas Dodge doesn't necessarily fix the diagnosis they gave me.
