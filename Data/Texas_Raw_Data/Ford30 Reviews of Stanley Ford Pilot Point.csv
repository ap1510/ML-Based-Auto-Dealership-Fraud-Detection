0,"June 06, 2019","Very irritated with this dealership and how they handled the processing of my ""deal"" or offer. I drove to this facility late the other night which is a 45 minute drive from where I live on top of working an hour away. I spent a total of almost 2 hours on the road making it a point to check this dealership and vehicle out. DEVIN WILSON, my salesman, showed me the vehicle and let me test drive it. After being there until 7:30 or 8:00 we concluded a deal but it couldn't be finalized because the finance guy wasn't there and my wife wasn't there to sign with me. That was fine we agreed to meet tomorrow evening so my wife would be there and their finance guy too. Deven called me the day of the appointment and asked if we were still good for this evening. I told him we were still interested but that we couldn't make it tonight because my daughter is sick and we were trying to get her into the doctor's office for an appointment that same evening and that my wife wouldn't be able to come because she'd have to watch my sick daughter. DEVEN WILSON stated that was fine and ask what time we can come Friday 06/07/19. I told him we'd be there around 6 or 6:30. We couldn’t get my daughter in for a doctor’s appointment, it was booked. Lucky us I got my mother to agree to watch my little one so my wife and I could go to the dealership. I called DEVEN WILSON back to let him know we could come tonight to have my wife test drive and complete the process. DEVEN WILSON, whispered in the phone and began to tell me that another couple was there looking at it and that he'd have to call me back if it’s still available. What??? You guys ran my credit, had me drive out to Pilot Point 40 minutes away, stay late to work a deal out knowing your ""finance guy"" wasn't there, make an appointment with me for Friday for him to possibly sell it behind our backs.  That's shady business on your part. I will never deal with the dealership ever again and suggest nobody does. ",1.0
1,"February 02, 2019","Worked with Devin Curtis: Was very respectful, and found him very honest.  Worked to correct an issue with the vehicle I bought and delivered the truck to me an hour away. Followed up on the phone several times...very communicative.  I would work with Devin again!",4.6

3,"October 28, 2018","Let me preface this review by saying I very rarely post negative reviews, but after taking a day to cool off, I knew I owed it to other car shoppers to warn them about my experience.  This is a review of a specific salesman, as I never got the chance to do business with the dealership.  

On Friday evening, I called this dealership and spoke with Damian about a car I'd seen on CarGurus.  I was very specific about the model, trim level, and interior color I wanted, and I asked if this car was still available.  I added that I'd be driving about 45 minutes to see the car.

Damian told me he'd put me on hold for a couple of minutes while he checked to see if the car was still available.  After less than a minute, he came back on the line and told me the car was still there.  I told him I would call again on Saturday morning to confirm the car's availability before I drove out there.

Saturday morning, I called the dealership and spoke with Damian again, reiterating that I needed to confirm the car's availability before driving 45 minutes to see it.  He assured me the car was still there, and I gave him my cell number, asking him to call me while we were enroute, if someone else showed up and wanted the car.  We even joked about having him throw himself on the hood to prevent anyone else from looking at the car.

When my husband and I arrived at the dealership, Damian told us he was with other customers at the time, but would send out another salesman to show us the car.  We asked him where on the lot the car was, and he said, ""It's probably over there (indicating the left side of the lot) somewhere, because that's where our used cars are"".  That should've been the first red flag, because he didn't know for sure where the car was.

We walked out, and finally found the car parked against the fence on the side of the lot.  We thought maybe they'd pulled it out, since Damian knew we were coming to see it.  When the promised salesman didn't appear to show us the car, we went back inside to wait.  After about 10 minutes, my husband went to the front desk to see if we could get some help.  Another salesman was looking for the keys and the receptionist (?) said, ""That car is going to Brownfield"".  

We told the salesman we were leaving, and began to walk out the door.  He said, ""Wait, wait, let me check"".  He came back in and told us the car had been sold at auction, was going to Brownfield, and needed to go into the shop.  At that point, Damian came over and said he was very sorry, that he didn't know until a short time before that that the car had been sold.  Needless to say, we told him we'd driven 45 minutes to get to the dealership, and that I'd confirmed and reconfirmed the car was available, and that he had my contact info and could have let me know this before I drove all the way out there.  Apologies at that point were just empty words.

But wait, there's more.  Yesterday evening, this same car popped up again on CarGurus, with new photos.  It makes me wonder about deceptive practices at this dealership.  It seemed like we were deliberately misled about the car I wanted to see.  I thought I'd done my due diligence, but apparently not.  Lesson learned.

Stanley Ford lost the chance to make a sale to a husband and wife with outstanding credit scores, who were ready to buy a car that morning.  We took our business elsewhere that day, and had a very good experience.  I hope this review serves as a warning to anyone who is thinking about driving a distance to see a car at Stanley Ford.",2.0

6,"September 14, 2018","Casey Davis is the man to see if you need a new vehicle.  Just ask for ""Big Country""....The service was excellent, and the purchase was easy and most important TRANSPARENT with the terms and financing.   The process form start to finish was simple and swift.   Casey Davis, Joseph Bethel, and the entire Stanley Team answered all my questions, and more importantly gave me confidence in my purchase.   I will be back to buy again, and if your looking to purchase PLEASE don't waste your time sitting for hours at another dealer haggling.  Call or Drive to Stanley Ford and take the stress out of buying a Vehicle. 

Thanks Guys we love the Car!",5.0

8,"May 20, 2018",I was given the complete runaround at this Ford dealership in Pilot Point.  Overpriced vehicles.  Lying employees and not worth the drive to come here.  Just take a look at their 1 star Facebook reviews.,1.0
9,"February 24, 2018",Long story short told at 6pm after 2hrs. Spent negotiating a deal I would have to return to finish because ally the dealers finance company requested additional info on the truck I was purchasing and the person who could provide the documents requested had already went home for the day so chalked that up to bad luck things happen ok even though I'm an hour away from dealer next day get a call from dealer to confirm a 5:30 appointment first of all this deal which carried over the day before should be next morning priority you would only assume guess not waited all day had to call back myself to get any info at all now it's 2 days later called again only to get attitude from sales manager Devin when I informed him for the second time of the situation I was dealing with the most unprofessional experience I've EVER had from a dealership or any other place of business I was a licenced used car dealer myself for 5 years so I understand customer service priority to maintain a good service reputation and this place is a joke ,1.0
10,"May 13, 2017","Buyer Beware! If you want a run around and to be insulted and treated like your stupid buy a car here. We purchased a Jeep Wrangler Rubicon, lifted and decked out two weeks prior to visiting Stanley Ford, not at Stanley Ford. After we bought the Jeep we realized it's not practical for what we need and decided to go back to a truck. Stanley had a truck on the lot that was dollar for dollar equal value to our 2 week old Jeep. We talked to Chase and asked them for a trade value on a Friday afternoon and sent pics and the vin number. They asked us to bring the Jeep up on Sat morning. When my husband arrived he was told the truck he wanted was on test drive with another salesman and that its first come first serve there, not considering we had started the deal on the truck the day before. They looked at the Jeep and insulted us and treated us like we were stupid by offering us 14k less than it was actually worth even by blue book value. Our Jeep is valued higher than the one they had on the lot that they are trying to sell for over 50k. Extreme greed and no concern for the customer. They wasted our time and used us to sell the truck to the other buyer. Extremely unprofessional and a horrible way to treat people. Go and buy from a dealership that treats people honestly and with respect and won't waste your time. It's not just the fact that they insulted us with a low value on our Jeep it's that they played games, selling the vehicle out from under us and using the fact that we were there for the truck too to sell it to the other buyers. After we left we got a text that the truck sold anyway with a laugh. Awful dealership, awful people!!! We live here locally and I will make sure everyone we know knows how horrible this place is. An apology from the dealership will not fix the mismanaged, dishonesty of their people and culture.",1.0

I WAS SENT HOME WITH DOCUMENTS, MY MOM PASSED AWAY. WES SMITH, THEIR FINANCE MANAGER,  IS TOTALLY WRONG FOR WHAT HE HAS DONE TO THIS DEAL. OWN UP TO YOUR OWN MISTAKES AND DON'T THROW PEOPLE UNDER THE BUS, BECAUSE YOU WERE NOT IN COMPLIANCE.
WHATS EVEN WORSE WES WENT TO OUR EVENT,ON OUR CREDENTIALS, TOLD US ALL DAY FRIDAY HOW MUCH HE REALLY APPRECIATED US, THEN ON SATURDAY HE WAS RUDE,I WAS CURSED AND SAID I AM NOT TOUCHING THIS DEAL. AMAZES ME WHEN YOU MAKE A MISTAKE JUST OWN IT, AND WORK THROUGH IT.",1.0
12,"July 10, 2016","I'm very grateful to Harry David for all his work as well as the guys that helped him with the trade-in on my Lincoln for the Escape.  Harry was very professional, as always, and did an outstanding job helping me with this transition.  That is why my whole family comes to Harry with any car needs we have.  I appreciated the time that the guy (I'm sorry, I don't remember his name, and can't read his handwriting) who did the paper work took to explain things to me.",5.0
13,"April 17, 2016","We have purchased our last five vehicles at another DFW dealership.  We decided to try Stanley Ford since they are closer to our home.  It was a great buying experience.  We went to purchase a specific car on the lot at Stanley Ford, but it turned out it really wasn't what we wanted.  Cameron and Bob found the perfect vehicle at another dealership in order to get us exactly what we wanted within a day.  Signing the paperwork was quick and painless, we love our new car, and we are happy to have found our next dealership.",5.0
14,"March 28, 2016","These guys are fantastic! I change my cars every 2-3 years, and every time has been a struggle dealing with dealerships, not these guys. I dealt with Augie through the phone and he was very friendly, responsive and most importantly upfront with all the information. No BS, no silly sales tactics, no bogus claims, 0 pressure, everything he said was how it went down when I drove there. Harry was also very friendly showing me my new new truck and both of them went above and beyond to make the purchasing experience as smooth as possible. 
I can't recommend these guys enough if you are looking to buy a new car. I live in Austin and I drove there to get my new F150 and trade-in my car, and after my experience with Augie and Harry there is no way I'll be looking at any other Ford dealership in the future. The drive is worth it.",5.0
15,"March 23, 2016","I recently purchased a white platinum F-150. It started with a welcoming environment, walking the parking lot with a salesman that was knowledgeable in the vehicle. Price negotiation was start forward with the typical trips back and forth to the sales manger. What made this a good experience was that there was no talk about ""how can we make this deal today"" and instead they allowed me to take my time and ensure it was a good decision. They worked with me to receive top valve for my trade and encluded a price drop of their vehicle. The purchasing process went well, but it was the relationship after the sale that was the most meaningful. They continued to support me while I formiurize myself with all the new technology the vehicle has. I will most definitely use them when purchasing my next vehicle. Thank you for the great experience. ",5.0

17,"December 16, 2015","I attempted to work a deal with multiple dealerships, but only Stanley Ford went above and beyond to make sure we got it done.   They dealt fairly and honestly from the start, and I would highly recommend them to anyone in the market for a new vehicle.",5.0
18,"December 09, 2015","I'll start off by saying, the staff here at Stanley Ford were very professional ,knowledgeable and made my truck purchase simple and straight forward.  I wish I could do it at least once a year.  They made me feel like one of the family.  I had to make a trip out from Georgia, just to get the truck I wanted at the price I wanted.  No surprises, no bull.  They even followed up with a phone call to see if I made it safely home and how I liked the truck.    ",5.0

Mark Childs, Justin, Brandon & Tammy all conspired to make my truck barely operate. They're only response was, ""Why would we do that?"" Mark asks why did you come back a 2nd time?

23,"March 31, 2015","First purchased F150 XLT in 2011. This was my first time to Stanley Ford and was very surprised at the friendliness and assistance I received. I absolutely hate looking for a new vehicle and they made the buying experience easy. In my opinion I get what I wanted with a good trade in price and great price on the vehicle. Now 4 years later, I returned to Stanley Ford for another new F150 XLT and was treated just as well as the first time and got exactly what I wanted. I would never have driven more than an hour just to go vehicle shopping if I didn't think I would be treated right. I highly recommend Stanley Ford.",4.6
24,"February 02, 2014","Purchased used vehicle from Stanley Ford 1 year ago. The sales process was pushy and used the old trick ""I have someone interested in it and going to sell it today if you don't come buy it now."" No deal on the price whatsoever. No after-sales service or even follow up calls or letters. The car what COMPLETELY out of fuel when leaving the dealership. Also, the used car had many issues in the coming months after the sale. The vehicle had hardly any brake pads left, had a cracked radiator, and had look like parts of it had been repainted although dealership claimed it had a clear record. I can see why they couldn't do follow up calls about it! I got burned and I fell for it. Shame on me, but even more so - shame on this dealership. If you buy a used car from them, look it over closely. And don't fall for the tricks! Play them back!",1.0
25,"February 14, 2013","My husband and I walked onto their lot for one reason...to buy a vehicle for ME! We kind of knew what we wanted but they showed us different features, options, and colors so I could make my own decision. My salesman, Ben, was very patient and knowlegeable about the product and that made the whole process of picking out a car much easier. What was really refreshing was everyone knew the purchase was for me and I was included in all discussions. The salesman, the finance guy, the sales manager all made eye contact with me. In the past I have never even been acknowleged, but I was treated like I was actually a decision maker in the purchase of my car. I was introduced to the guys in service and shown the service area so now when I bring my car in for oil changes I know exactly where to pull up, the process of how it is done, and who to ask for. This will take the stress out of not knowing where to go. Excellent experience and I will def refer my friends to Stanley Ford!!",5.0
26,"February 11, 2013","The service department here was the reason I went back for a new truck but that has since changed.  Had 02 F150 serviced here years ago and was happy with staff and result of service.  Those folks have since left the dealer.  09 F250 diesel kicked a code during a trip to Galveston (I live close to the dealer).  I had to stop a local parts store to reset because it was in constant regen.  Wrote down the code that the scanner found and took it in to this dealer.  They had the truck for over two days and called me to tell me there was nothing they could do because the code was not in the computer (35K miles).  I asked what happens if it does this again and service manager told me to ""just don't drive to far from the dealer and bring it in next time"".  Not what I wanted to hear.  Fast forward to 2013.  Noticed slight drip of coolant (46k miles).  Took in truck and was called later and told both radiator hoses were bad and needed replaced.  $683.  I don't think so.  Asked about power train warranty and was told hoses were not covered.  Okay.  Took to local independent repair.  Figured out it was a o ring in the upper hose only (which is covered by power train warranty).  Found upper hose on ebay for $44 and paid independent $50 to replace.  Out the door in 20 min from independent.  Independent went on to tell me they see a lot of rad hoses.  Bad design with o ring updated to dual o ring.  Last time for this dealer and last time for Ford.",1.8
27,"November 09, 2012","Once they found out I was not buying until January, the salesman didn't want to talk to me any longer. 
Also, they had these sweepsteaks numbers i got in the mail. it said I won three of the above 5 prizes. They guy seemed to get agitated that I asked if I won anything, he said ""Everyone got the same number, all you can get is one of the two scratch off ticket or a 3 day two night vacation that you had to provide the air fare."" and threw it in the trash, got up and walked out.

Vern was on a peace of paper on the wall, bu the was thin had a deeper voice and talked real loud. He knew very little about what he was trying to sell or just didn;t ant to take the time, since I was buying right then.

I bought two cars which this dealer was David Ford, but they wil lnever get my business after this experience. ",1.0
28,"September 18, 2012","This was the worse buying experience I've had in over 30 years of any purchase. This dealer does not stand behind their autos what so ever!!!!!! Not worthy to buy here & I would never ever refer anyone to them!!!!!!  I purchased a vehicle in May 2012 and the one and only thing that was repaired was the dealer replaced the battery. They gave me the run around and now 3mos later I've replaced the transmission, DVD player that never worked,replaced the sunroof seal which allowed water to ener into the car,  air conditioner and now I'll have to pay for the brakes, air condition flush, and other general repairs that were never even checked out prior to them selling the vehicle. I went to the dealer at least 5-6 times from 5/12 thru 8/12 and they never would mske right my purchase. PLEASE DON'T BUY HERE!!!! NOT WORTHY OF YOUR TIME NOR MONEY!!!!!!",1.8
29,"August 28, 2010","I purchased a 2008 Ford F250 Super Duty Diesel pickup from Stanley Ford in Pilot Point. It is a beautiful truck and looked brand new. I was told it had passed a 120 point inspection and anything found in need of repair was already repaired. Well this was a BIG FAT LIE and I'll tell you why.  Three days afterward, the A/C stopped working and started blowing hot air. Upon further inspection, I found the oil was black and gritty and hadn't been changed in who knows how long. I checked the air filter and actually poured dirt out of it.  I called and complained and they admitted the 120 point inspection must have been overlooked on that particular truck.  The Manager agreed to fix it and told me ""Thats how we stay in business."" So I drove back to Pilot Point from Fort Worth. I left the pickup for 3 days and they did repair the A/C, change the oil and put in a new air filter.  Then a few days later, I discovered the tread seperating on one of my tires. Now I know they had no control over this but when I attempted to put my spare tire on, I discovered there was no crank handle for the jack  so I couldn't use the jack or lower my spare tire. There was also no lug wrench. I called and spoke with my salesman who promissed me 2 weeks ago he would get me one but I still haven't seen it.  Then I discovered the radiator had a coolant leak.  Now I only had the pickup for 3 weeks at this point. I again contacted Stanley Ford because even though I purchased the pickup ""As is no warranty"" I felt they should help me out because my pickup still hadn't received that 120 point inspection it was suppose to have.  I'm sure if they had done the inspection as promissed, they would have repaired the radiator before selling it.  Well this time all I received was ""No"" they couldn't help me with the radiator.  I'm sure I was becoming a pain calling and compalining all the time but I wanted to give them the opportunity to make it right but apparently they didn't want to.  I decided to forget them and take it a local Ford dealership, Bankston Ford in Ft. Worth.  Let me tell you they treated me like a king. When I took it in, they told me the radiator may be covered under Fords 100k mile powertrain warranty and they would check for me. The next morning the service advisor called me and told me it was covered and they would put in a new radiator free of charge.  They also did a multipoint inspection which included my tires, brakes, fluids, hoses and lines, and belts.  They pointed out to me the 2 serpentine belts had worn and needed replacing soon.  The truck was repaired the same day and when I picked it up, they had washed it, put dressing on the tires and it looked great.  They did all this and didn't charge me a cent.  Now thats the way I like to be treated.  Stanley Ford kept my pickup for 3 days and didn't inspect a thing. They didn't tell me my belts needed replacing, they didn't check my tires of which one of them was bad, or the brakes or even wash it for me. They treated me like I was a pain in their rear for complaining because they never performed the inspection I was promissed.  Well let me tell you, Bankston Ford in Fort Worth will get all my business from now on. I thought a dealership out in the middle of no where would be better to work with than a dealership in the metroplex, but I was wrong.
