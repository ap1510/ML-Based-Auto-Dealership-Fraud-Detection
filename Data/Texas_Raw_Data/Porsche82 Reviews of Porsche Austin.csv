0,"June 25, 2020",Have been servicing my 911 at this dealership since 2014.  They have continuously improved all aspects of their service to the point I would rate them as best in ATX.  Most recently had my car serviced and required new tires.  They quickly contacted me and took ownership for premature wear.  They admitted to having a bad alignment over 12 months before and replaced my tires.  Honesty Ian’s transparency is hard to find.  I applaud their values.,5.0
1,"June 24, 2020","I had a wonderful experience purchasing a new Porsche Macan and traded  my 911 Carrera 4S, I missed my 911 sooo much this dealership resold me my 911 at the same price they gave me for trade-in with the exception of necessary fees. I had a pleasant experience all the way from the sales &  finance departments. Extremely impressed with my sales person and her manager Christian Ames. I will definitely recommend this dealership to anyone I see in the Porsche community. I have owned a 911 Porsche since my early 30s, I am now 76 years of age! I guess they’ll bury me in one LOL

3,"June 16, 2020","Bought a used car and was going to pick up 3-7 days later after they fixed a few things on it. The salesman let me know that things were on schedule and when we got to the 7th day and I stated that I was getting a little annoyed that was it. I wouldn’t tell me what the issue was why I wasn’t able to pick it up. I finally let the salesman know that I was coming up there and he said OK. When I got there the used car sales manager told me that they found another issue after repair for a longer period and that they did not know when they would get the part in from Porsche. They had very little knowledge about the 996 they were selling me. When asked about the IMS issue...they said that I had the “good one”! Porsche didn’t have a “good one” which is why they were sued years ago. I then decided to cancel the sale. They tried to put my debit down payment on my debit card and said that they couldn’t. I was told I need to wait for a check to be sent to me and that could take up to one month.

43,"October 17, 2019","This was my first scheduled service on my Panamera and elected to wait since no loaners were available and it would only take an hour to hour and a half. The service consultant did no follow up. The cashiers were totally unconcerned to the point of rudeness. In fact the service consultant spent over an hour chit chatting with someone at her desk and ignored what should have been obvious concern on my part.

However, in the 16 years of getting my Boxster serviced at the North Austin Porsche dealership, this is the first time I have gotten the car back with such abysmal detailing (wash)!   Customer Service at your dealership has definitely gone down hill.  It makes me question whether I would ever purchase a car there again!  Please pass this feedback on to the management.  They should be made aware of my displeasure .  I have sent pictures to the Service Dept of the dirty convertible top.   ",2.0
45,"October 02, 2019","Overall I was satisfied. I bought a used 911 from a non-Porsche dealer that was still under warranty and since I had a week in Austin on business, I figured I would have them do the 10K service, which is essentially an oil change and a check-up (wipers, tires, recalls, etc.) sort of like a pre-purchase inspection. I felt confident that the car was fine, I just wanted them to look it over and if anything was wrong it would be under warranty. They called me to tell me the oil had been changed at 9K miles, which I thought was good of them, but I still wanted it changed as I frankly didn't know who had changed the oil last. I wanted a fresh start, so to speak. I also wanted to have the Porsche Connect service turned on, which only a Porsche dealer can do. Here's a rubbing point: they told me that would be free, yet I was charged $102.50. The final total was $502.48, but that's life in the Porsche fast lane--I feel comfortable knowing that the last folks to touch it were factory authorized. The second rubbing point was the symposer outlet panels just above the rear deck (it's a Targa). I asked them to ask the mechanic what they were as I didn't know at the time. They told me they were 'access ports for adjustments', which is just nonsense. I wound up pulling the trim pieces off and saw the symposer outlets (thanks Rennlist!). This bothered me as the dealer is supposed to be the expert in this, so I have to give them three stars for what I consider an overcharge along with not knowing something about the car, yet coming up with a ludicrous explanation.",3.2

47,"September 24, 2019","The service is average you will expect more for a Porsche. The guy was friendly 
San Antonio has better customer service.
I leave more than 300 miles for the closer dealership and in Austin they don’t try to work with you for your services even if I explain to them my situation.
 when your car is returned, I'm surprised that they didn't even clean it inside. I have a Mercedez and Jaguar before and they returned my car super clean and with a bottle of water",3.2

51,"August 29, 2019","I contacted Porsche Austin in hopes of getting a Pre Sale inspection done on a 2012 Boxster Spyder I was considering buying from a private owner. I had contacted another Porsche dealer ship in the Texas Hill Country only to be told they did not do pre sale inspections and that the earliest they could schedule an appointment to diagnose a specific problem with the PCM display was 3+ weeks. Porsche Austin was just the opposite. I dropped off the car the next day and had the inspection completed two days later including  fixing the problem with the PCM display. Great customer service; friendly knowledgeable, courteous with follow up calls/texts and clarifications. I will use Porsche Austin (yes I bought the Spyder) for future service needs.   ",4.2

56,"May 11, 2019","After searching the Web for a Pre-owned BMW, I found a great ideal at this dealership. I contacted them via email & Anthony Montaleone called to inquire, how he could be of service. He was willing to answer my questions about the vehicle of interest and agreed to seek a discounted price from the manager. After progressing with a deal, Tony (not in for our visit)  handed us off to Greg Morris, the Finance Manager and he assisted with additional request. Upon the day of purchase, Brendan Sipple assisted us and he was very professional, yet friendly. We closed the deal with our choice of Financial Institution and the dealership repected our decision without any pressure. We received excellant customer service, pleasant conversation, cookies & coffee; and drove away within two hours. In addition, Tony contacted us the following week to inquire about our selected vehicle performance and to verify if we needed additional assistance.",4.6
57,"February 27, 2019","Leased a new 911 in November and still don't have my plates. First time I called they said they would check on it and sent me another temporary tag. Called again yesterday and was informed they have had the plates since December and they tried to call me but the number didn't work (they had a number that was used a long time ago when my son took my previous 911 in for service). Woman on the phone made it seem like it was my fault and when I questioned why they had my number to call me about the 2nd temporary tag, or why they even issued a 2nd temporary tag when they had my plates, she didn't seem to care.

Have heard from 4 other friends who purchased new cars from this dealership and they are not going back. Crossing my fingers the service department is better then it was when I had my last 911 in for repairs.

59,"September 20, 2018","This is an email I sent to the GM of Porsche Austin.  After the email, the director for services called us and apologized but could not do anything except saying they will work hard to get our car back.  Well, after another day, they returned our car and guess what - they did not refill our gas even though we told the gentleman who picked up the car that we expected the gas to be refilled!!!  Talking about insulting to the injury!
We have not had this type of experience with any other Porsche dealership elsewhere.  Not sure what happened here.
Disappointing!



Dear Mr. Chang - I wanted to relay our frustration and poor experience with Porsche quality generally and your dealership in particular.  On Friday - September 14th, while driving to a business appointment, we received an indicator of PSM problem on our ~ 4000 miles 2017 Porsche Boxster.  We called your dealership and since we were nearby, were told to take the car in for an inspection.  After waiting for about two hours, we were told your service department would need to have the car for a more detailed look.  We informed your staff that we were planning to take the car for a weekend trip to OKC and explored if there is a loaner.  Well, there was none and your staff basically told us we would need to find other way to get to OKC for the weekend.  We said OK and asked for a loaner to be ready for us on Monday AM as we would then take our car back to your service department to be looked at.

Well, I left for your dealership early on Monday as I had a business meeting later in the AM.  About 3 miles from the dealership (our home is about 25 miles from Porsche Austin), I received a text from your service adviser informing me that there is no car available for the AM and there may be some coming back later.  I then texted back and advised your adviser that I would then go home and expect to have a loaner later in the day.  Nothing happened for the rest of Monday.

This morning, I asked your adviser for a status and I now am informed that there is no loaner available until October!

I finally agreed to have my car picked up by your staff today @ noon and asked for it to be returned to me by Thursday AM at the latest.  Since I have business appointment today, I reluctantly agreed to return to my home at noon so that the car can be picked up.

Mr. Chang - I can't tell you how disappointed I am with a) the quality of a Porsche car (we had a Cayman S before we got this one from your dealership) and b) the level of support (lack thereof) your dealership has on this matter.

Your adviser, Sam Starkey, I am sure, tried hard to work this out but it is obvious he could not resolve this issue in a timely manner.

This has caused me a huge level of frustration, inconvenience and time (including last minute getting another car for the past weekend trip to OKC).

I don't know if this is an isolated event to us or a typical experience at the dealership.  Certainly, we expect much more of being an owner of another Porsche....

Sincerely,",1.0
60,"November 21, 2017","Went in because we had decided to purchase a Porsche Cayenne.  Had the unfortunate experience of having Tony Montaleone be the salesman that didn't help us.  To make a long story short, Tony obviously didn't take us seriously that we wanted to purchase a car and treated us as such.  After I got tired of bugging him and him telling me that he would call me back (which he never did), we went to another dealership where they actually believed that we had money to spend and were happy to treat us as such.  We are now the proud new owners of a fully loaded Porsche Cayenne Turbo and our money is at another dealership and everyone is happy.",1.0

Fast forward to May 2017 with the dealer under new ownership my worries were put to rest.  The professionalism of Thomas McCall (TR) and his team gave me the confidence to purchase a 2017 Panamera.

68,"May 08, 2017","I bought a used 2006 Cayman S from Porsche Central Austin almost a year ago. I had a great purchasing experience, and I knew when I bought the car that it would need some work. The car and its issues are not the reason for the single star rating. I love my car and, as I said, anticipated having issues since it was 10 years old when I bought it. The dealership's service is the reason for the bad review. I had several bad experience and wasted thousands of dollars. Almost every time I wanted them to work on my car, I had to contact them multiple times before they'd respond. 

Once I scheduled an appointment with them over the phone. I showed up at the right time, but they told me that they couldn't help me because the appointment had been scheduled at an earlier time. I know this was only the result of a miscommunication, but I am sure that it was not on my end because the time that they told me the appointment was supposed to be was in the middle of my work day.

Most recently, I took my car in because ""check oil"" kept popping up on the display and I kept hearing an unpleasant sound when I would start my car. I spent over $5,000.00 during this visit. They supposedly performed major maintenance and replaced my brakes. The ""check oil"" is still popping up on the display, and the sound when I start my car is even worse than before. I left a voicemail with my name, number, and a message requesting that they call me back. After about a week, they had still not returned my call, so I called a new Porsche specialist in Temple. He told me that he only charges $100 an hour, and he couldn't believe that they charged me that much money and didn't fix the problem. He said the issue should have been resolved during the major maintenance. 

There were several other issues, but I'm not going to spend more time writing them here. If you live north of Austin, go to Temple for Porsche services. If you live further south, go anywhere but Porsche Central Austin. ",1.2

Our service representative, Richard Walker is very understanding and goes out of his way to help out and answer any questions or address any issues we have had in the past. Katy Love is very professional as well as friendly!

75,"January 18, 2017","Thanks for this follow-up message. I really do appreciate the service I gain from this dealership  over the past 3-5 years. And, you may not recognize me but, I am the guy that delivers fresh flowers to the front desk about every 2 weeks or so.

Mr. Richard Walker, service dept., keeps close tabs on my car and, he and I have gained a close relationship since the new ownership of Porsche Austin last year. It is always my pleasure to bring the flowers to the reception desk and, many of the sales-persons recognize my appearance and always take the time to shake my hand with a greeting.

I also sit on the Board of Directors with our local HCR-PCA club and try to boost every Porsche driver to join the club.  It’s a great gig….

Thank you for reaching out to me here and, if there is anything I can say, or do, to benefit PA, please let me know.
Sincerely,
Ron Todd

76,"January 18, 2017", The new owners have transform this dealership into a first-class operation . Whether you need sales or service go see the folks at Porsche Central Austin.,5.0
77,"January 17, 2017","My title is not an exaggeration - the service at Porsche Austin is so good that I truly don't ever want to have to go anywhere else. When I schedule my service appointment it is quick and easy. Porsche then comes to my house, picks up my car, and drops off a loaner. My service advisor, Richard, always keeps me updated on what they are doing and answers any questions I have. My bills are always exactly what they have quoted (sometimes even lower), and there haven't ever been any surprises. This is my 3rd Porsche (I had the other 2 serviced at other Porsche dealerships), and these guys seriously blow the others out of the water.",5.0
78,"January 17, 2017",Everyone at Porsche Central Austin was extremely helpful. Service Advisor Monte Regar did a top-notch job for us. General Sales Manager Beau Rice and this dealership is one of the primary reasons we keep buying Porsches.,4.8
79,"January 11, 2017",Chase is the man of you need any service!!!! I've told another Porsche owner to use HIM!!! He always greets me with a smile and listens to all of my concerns.,4.8
80,"November 07, 2016","In March of last year I had a service done by this dealership because I was still under the service package for my 2012 911S. They said nothing needed work except for the oil change. Fast forward 1,840 miles later. The service package I bought had expired and the car was not performing as it had in the past. Took it too a local Porsche certified mechanic to be fixed. He found the air filters were not changed the last visit, the brakes needed replaced (I saw them, he wasn't just adding to the bill), and other little things that should have been caught at the last inspection before the service package ran out. Don't recommend them and I just ordered a new 911 from San Antonio Porsche. Too bad Austin can't have a good dealership for Porsche!",1.0
81,"September 16, 2016","I bought a 2009 Porsche Cayenne GTS and the initial experience was great while physically at the dealership. I paid money to fly there to pick up the vehicle, they did get me decent financing rates, but as soon as I was gone from the dealership I had mechanical problems with the car. I called about the vehicle on line and was contacted by someone from their Audi franchise. He handled the financing part well, then I had problems that had to be part of why the car was for sale as some of these faults in the computer were dated before I bought the vehicle. I contacted Porsche North America and they tried to help then the dealer pulled the switcheroo and said the vehicle was purchased at Audi as a used car and NOT Porsche so that they would be off the hook and make me just go away and not to have to fix a car not even a few days old to me. The car sat in my garage broken for the first two weeks of owning it. The dealership, Porsche North America, as well as the salesman from Audi put my phone numbers and email on some blackball list and refused to return any of my requests for information. YES EVEN PORSCHE NA DIS-OWNED ME FOR ASKING FOR HELP!!! So I would NEVER recommend buying from any of the Central Austin, line of cars or EVER owning a Porsche as their customer server is the worst. Buy a highline BMW or Mercedes but NOT from Austin Texas. Dishonest sales and service practices!!!!!!!!! :( ",1.8
