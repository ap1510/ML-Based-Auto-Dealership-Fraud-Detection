0,"November 17, 2009","Very helpful and went out of their way to make sure the car was right for me and I was happy. Price negotiations were friendly and no undue pressure was placed on me to close the deal. The purchasing experience was one of the best that I have experienced.

The only reason I did not rate them a 5 for all categories was that they failed to contact me on the availability of a part that is needed to fix a fit and finish issue. Unfortunately they also had to tell me that could not give me a delivery date either. This is rather lax. However they are always friendly and helpful when I call.

The car has only had some rather minor fit issues (3 of them) and a single irritating squeak. The squeak and all but one of the fit issues was rectified without any issues.

I await the missing part and the fixing of the remaining issue.

Overall, Charles Maund Jaguar have given me a pleasant introduction to the Jaguar ownership experience but need to be a little more attentive on the service side.",4.4
1,"August 26, 2009",Their service dept is the worst but unfortunatly I have to deal with them for another 4 years till my car is in warranty . Will not buy another Jag just because of this service dept and dealer. Had 2004 and now 2008 but not again. The next clsest dealer is in San Antonio but 1.5 hour drive bit too much.,1.2
