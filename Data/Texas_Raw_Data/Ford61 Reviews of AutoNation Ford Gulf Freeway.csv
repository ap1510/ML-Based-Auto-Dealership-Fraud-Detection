0,"November 23, 2019","The reason why I bought from this dealership wasn't only because of the discount but also the level of service. I randomly called in and Cecil Fontenot immediately answered all questions on the Raptor I was looking for. Within ten minutes the sales manager Steven was put on the phone and was so straight forward he even gave me the bottom line with his name signed on the bottom of the quote. Dealerships usually don't do this because they're afraid you'll take it to another dealership and ask them to beat it. Other dealerships in the area such as Doggett, Legacy, and Katy (there sister company) gave me attitudes and run arounds on pricing. I immediately closed the deal within 15 minutes after speaking with Cecil and Steven over the phone. Picked up the Raptor a few days later and everything was professional, smooth, and quick. Cecil gave me his number and welcomed me to call him anytime if I had any questions. 

10/10 would recommend, idk xxx the other reviews are talking about.

1,"November 04, 2019",Worst experience I‚Äôve ever had.  And just when I thought i was over this whole situation.  I just looked at my credit report and they ran my credit even after I told them I didn‚Äôt want them to because I have my own financing.  I did not authorize this nor did I fill out the proper paperwork for them to do it ,1.0
2,"July 29, 2019","Be careful, they charged me for options they did not install on the vehicle passing them off as pre-installed and that since they were already installed I had to pay for them. I brought this to their attention that these options were not installed and they told me they would return my money then went silent and now no none knows what is going on. ",1.0
3,"July 07, 2019","I bought a 2019 Mustang a year ago.
I have had my car in, appointments both times.  I waited 5.5 hrs the first time and 3.5hrs the next...it was only an oil change and tire rotation.  The second time they did give me a discount for inconvenience.
Now I have 3 warranty issues and do not even get a call back to set up and loaner and time to bring it in for service.  One of the issues is with the traction control taking over and shooting me across a lane, thank God no one was there...what happened to safety is Job 1, Ford?
Definitely looking for a new service department.",2.0

5,"March 10, 2019","Just wanted to voice my total dissatisfaction with this dealership.  Showed up looking to buy a new 2019 F250 Saturday February 16th was told the one I wanted would be there either Monday or Tuesday the following week.  I signed a contract and handed over a 28K check to Hugo. I called the salesman John Wilson Monday at 11:59am and he informed me then that the truck I was supposed to get was sold.  Needless to say I was upset that I had to initiate the call.  I showed up at the dealership Monday and asked to talk to a manger, I got Richard who looked for another truck and said he could get it soon.  After several calls and text this one was sold also.  The third and final attempt was when both John and Richard found one in Georgia. This one would arrive in five working days due to having to send a driver.  Well I found out Friday that this one had extensive damage to it.  I have purchased vehicles from your dealership in the past but after this I can promise you I will never buy another from you nor will I recommend anyone to you.  Really sucks that I have to give you a single star, you deserve NONE!!!!",1.0
6,"March 01, 2019","Lazy, incompetent xxxxxxxx who basically screwed me so they could get home 15 minutes early and wasted me entire night. 

My car was there for something that has a recall and the next day they called me at 4:40pm (Service closes at 7pm) to tell me it would be done in about an hour and a half, I wait for 2 hours only to have no call, try to call them and have one person say they were transferring me to the person handling my case, they hang up on me, I call back 3 times only to have it ring forever, have to call and press 2 for the used car section so I could have them transfer me, and it goes to voicemail saying they're closed.

Unbelievably horrific customer service, would never ever return or recommend.",1.4
7,"February 26, 2019","Signed for a mustang without the full down payment and they gave us a month to come up with the 2,900 for the 3,900 down payment cause I already gave 1,000. 2 weeks go by and they called me tell me I needed to bring the car back because I wasn‚Äôt approved because I didn‚Äôt make enough to afford the car which is understandable, so my boyfriend ran hit credit because he make more so we can keep the car. But the guy said ‚Äúif  bank don‚Äôt except it we don‚Äôt get paid‚Äù. So they told us to come back the next day but, we didn‚Äôt because my boyfriend got off work late so we went Saturday. Friday we discussed getting something cheaper so we financed a cheaper car. And was approved with documents to prove that we were. So that Saturday we got the new car and tried to take the Ford back but the finance guy (after about 10mins., pretty sure he was figuring out what to say) said, ‚Äúyou signed for it so it‚Äôs yours‚Äù! WE WERE NEVER APPROVED FOR THE CAR! We called the back we weren‚Äôt approved for and they said they sent the contract back, but Jorge Rodriguez said that we got a ‚ÄúSpecial Managers approval üòë! He lied! He‚Äôs been buying time or thinking we would leave it alone but not us. There‚Äôs xxxxxxxx and will take you for whatever your worth. Even though we signed the contract we went approved for the loan so there‚Äôs no deal between the Buyer and Seller and you should receive you down payment back because there is no deal, it‚Äôs just a piece of paper with your signature on it! But theytook our down payment and said it‚Äôs already been cashed so we‚Äôre currently fighting for it back and won‚Äôt stop till we get it. Use this true story as an example",1.0
8,"May 12, 2018","Dealt on a truck listed for $35973.  Dealer would not sell for $35973, wanted to add $750 for financing even though the pricing structure clearly did not require that additional cost when paying cash..  When questioned the dealer just stated that was how the truck was priced.  Heartily recommend customers avoid this dealership.  Perhaps the most dishonest dealer I've seen in 37 years of buying.",1.0
9,"April 04, 2018","We went here with an already APPROVED  loan from Bank of America. We were approved for 16900 but the vehicle was 20000. We had money to pay the difference and thought it would be an easy transaction. However our sales rep JUAN BARROW Insisted that we had to go to Bank of America to pay the difference. We didn‚Äôt understand why we were going there but we went because he was insisting. When we got to Bank of America they didn‚Äôt know what we were there for, WE didn‚Äôt know what we were there for and we called juan and HE didn‚Äôt know what we were there for. So we came back to the dealership and when we got back and told him we got nothing resolved there because they don‚Äôt have on site vehicle loan officers he again INSISTED that we were supposed to pay Bank of America the difference. My usband was already LATE for work! We explained to him again that we were already approved and willing to pay the rest as a down payment. At this point 3 hours of our time was already wasted so we decided to talk to the finance manager CALVIN  and he explained to JUAN that all he needs from us was the approved loan document proof and that we would be good. That was at 4:00 pm. Then finally at 5 pm after waiting in a cold waiting room we were brought in by finance to finish up. 

A complete waste of time. JUAN completely disappeared and didn‚Äôt apologize. Calvin didn‚Äôt apologize as a manager. We end up buying the car because we really need a car and liked the one they had. But if I could‚Äôve went else where and saved my time and headache and my husbands work time I WOULDVE! PLEASE AVOID GOING THERE ",1.2
10,"February 01, 2018","I'll start with how they quote you a price and then once you agree add many unnecessary fees into the paperwork to drive the price up. The rudest salespeople and managers I've ever seen. We were lied to and told some of the fees would be removed and that we would be able to handle our own paperwork for our title. Had my husband fly to Houston to get the vehicle and once he did and we then called to follow up about paperwork for our title and what we werw previously told, now suddenly we were misinformed and were lying about what was told to us and are being treated horribly after purchasing a 70k vehicle from them.

Once I got there they changed the price and add $ 600 worth of ""dealer addons"" like $ 300 for plastic strips on the door edges.

I don't like being scammed and I figured they would try and screw me on the price where else was I going to get the shaft before they finished with me.

Eventually I go up there for them to tell me it will be two weeks for a dang part! They bungee cord my door shut and tell me it's safe to drive, but the paper work says it is NOT safe to drive due to the  back door possibly opening. Well here it is, 2 WEEKS LATER. all of a sudden they need another 21 days to get the latch. Worst service ever, I stay on hold for 45 minutes at a time, never get who im calling and I've been hung up on. They need to restock on their asst service managers ASAP !!!",1.0
20,"July 16, 2013","Bought a used diesel truck about six months ago from this dealership, bought the warranty also to make sure I was covered. Well check engine light came on no worries because I have a warranty right? WRONG brought it in and got a phone call saying I needed a trans flush, my radiator was busted, needed new brakes, shocks for the suspension, and more. The best part the sensor wasn't covered under warranty!. Let me give you some background on the truck is has around 100 thousand miles on it and since I bought it I have only driven it maybe once or twice a week to work and back since I have a work vehicle. So didn't put a lot of miles on the thing, o and I just replaced the brakes, and did the transmission flush about a month before I brought it to the dealership. I had a prior bad experience with my old dealership so I checked my truck top to bottom and took pictures before I brought it in for service so I know my radiator wasn't busted plus I would have noticed it leaking in my garage. Looks like they are just trying to make a buck, will never go back! ",2.2

30,"November 15, 2012","If you are looking for a smooth car buying experience. NEVER GO TO THIS DEALER. I've seen a bunch of raving reviews for this dealership on the internet, it's all false and probably sales folks trying to get people into this dealership. I've bought two cars from this dealership and had so many issues with them. I took the first one back when i found out that it was wrecked and they lied to me about that not being the case. Their used sales manager Tanya Eubanks is the worst manager i have ever dealt with and is totally unfit for managing a used car dealership.

The sales people promise you the world and does not have any control over making good their promises. They have the crappiest customer service department and they only treat you good that one time you go there to buy the car, if something were to go wrong with a vehicle after the 10'th day, you are treated like they don't even know you.

Bryant addressed some concerns I had with the CPO vehicle to my satifaction also. Calvin handled the paperwork and add-ons without pressure while presenting the advantages of his products.

We are from out-of-town so time was a consideration as we shopped (and we did shop on the internet and at dealer lots). We bought a new Champion Toyota last year at the adjacent lot. This time, we were looking for a Ford product. I am glad we looked at Champion Ford. ",5.0

38,"September 24, 2012","I recently purchased a F150 FX4 from Champion Ford Gulf Freeway, and worked with Peter Bahnev.  Actually, let me restate that - I was in the market for a truck and was blessed enough to run in to Peter at the Champion Ford dealership.  In the past I've had some negative experiences with car buying in other states, so my expectations were fairly low.  Peter and Champion greatly exceeded my expectations and restored my faith in car dealerships, and proved that excellent customer service is still something that you can find.  I'm not often inclined to write reviews, but when you find a good car dealership and salesmen everybody should know about it because there are a lot of bad ones out there.  

If you are in the market for a truck or car and in the greater Houston area, or even within a reasonable distance from Houston you owe it to yourself to go to Champion Ford Gulf Freeway and talk to Peter.  He will get you the best deal possible, and take care of you no matter what your personal circumstances are.  My situation is a little complex and they went above and beyond to make my deal happen, and for the truck I wanted.

45,"May 29, 2012","Dealer did not honor advertised internet price on vehicle.

After going to dealer with a printed out copy of an internet special, dealer first tried to switch me to a different more expensive vehicle. Since the advertised vehicle was on the lot and available I stated that the advertised vehicle was the one i wanted to purchase. After about 20 minutes they returned with a price that was $750 more than the advertised price and explained that I had to have a trade in to get the advertised price. Even though nothing about a trade in was mentioned on their website, other than through a general disclaimer regarding general pricing policy printed in fine small font print at the bottom of page, they stated internet price was only valid with a trade in. No where on the website does it mention that ""condition"" specifically. They refused to honor the price on that vehicle. After another 20 minutes or so, they stated verbally that they would come down another $250 but would still not honor that the advertised price. After another 20 to 30 minutes the general manager came out and again stated their position that the advertised price was only with a trade in and that their general pricing policy disclaimer supported their refusal to honor the advertised price. The general manager then offered to let me have the advertised price on a different but similar vehicle which i declined.

I found the dealer's pricing on their website and the lack of specific information regarding how to qualify for that pricing to be VERY DECEPTIVE. The time spent at the dealer was a total of almost 2-1/2 hours. The fact that they attempted perform the classic ""bait and switch"" initially to a higher priced model and then at the end attempted to offer the advertised price on a different model a strong indication of their business honesty and ethics (OR RATHER LACK THERE OF)",1.0

As a first time buyer with very little established credit I knew it would be difficult to get financed without a cosigner.

Paul has helping other friends and family of mine before. All have been positive reviews. Not sure how Paul came up with the deal but Mac Haik could not touch it and even admitted it.
We had to leave the first time because we had a family event and we were there so they could appraise my trade anyway. When we left, they did not hold us there. It did take them a week to call me back but when they did it was worth the wait. They had better numbers than I asked for. The truck I asked for. 
They never once tried putting me in a truck I didn't want. They never treated me like I was crazy. 
MOST IMPORTANT they never tried anything funny during the finace part of the deal.

It was a pleasure to work with these guys, they help convert me from GM to Ford.",4.8
