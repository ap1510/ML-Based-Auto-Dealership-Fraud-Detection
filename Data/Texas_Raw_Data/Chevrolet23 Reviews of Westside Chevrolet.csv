0,"December 16, 2019","Twelve weeks to repair my truck. I had the most frustrating experience with Westside Chevrolet bodyshop. I was told originally that my truck was totaled by the professionals at Westside as they also provided this information to the insurance company. However somehow the insurance company convince them that the Frame was not bent enough for the truck to be totaled. By this time I had purchased some wheels and taken off the ones I had on the truck. And was about to buy another truck. They said they were going to fix it and that it would take two weeks. I based my  decision on leaving it there because I was paying for a rental out-of-pocket, and they told me I would have it fixed in two weeks. And because I assumed that Chevrolet would do a better shop than anywhere else. I was told By westside that the dealer can and will install used parts. Two weeks came around and no one called me so I calledAnd they said it would be ready next Friday I followed up every Friday for the next three weeks, with no resolution. I went in to look at the truck and the estimator took me back there and said that all they had to do is put the bed back on. When I looked at it the frame was still bent and had no work done to it. I was told then they would be done in two days. It didn’t happen. I called to talk to the body shop manager which had just started working there and said he would take care of it. He was rude unprofessional on text and on the phone. and very frustrated with the entire body shop situation that he inherited. After I went back two weeks later I showed up unannounced we went to look at the truck and the muffler was bent from the back all the way to the Engine. I indicated that it needed to be repaired, and the manager replied to me that I had never said anything about the muffler. I told them that, that’s why I brought it to the professional so they could fix what was damaged. On the end of the eighth week I got my truck back after several frustrating conversations. My Son pointed out that I had the Ford emblem engraved in the trim above the grill from the vehicle I had hit before. When I called the manager he said, he didn’t know if the insurance was going to cover that. Then a week later I was stopped by the police because three of the bulbs in my tail lights we’re off. I purchased the bulbs. Then I went to wash my engine and I noticed that the air intake duct at the engine was broken. I immediately called the manager and he said that they did not damage that. This truck has never been worked on, so it was obvious that it was broken while they were working on the front end. Needless to say I called and Barry the Manager over the shop parts and service and told him that at that point I would pay for the part just to get my truck out of their shop after a 12 week Nightmare and that I didn’t want to  pay full price for the part of $187. He said he would help. When I picked up the truck None of the supervisors were around. They told me that they were told I needed to pay $168 before taking the truck. I paid it and i left. I have a lot more to write but will not bother.I would discourage anyone from taking their vehicle there.
I did provide a rental vehicle for six weeks.",1.0
1,"November 09, 2018","Car #4 from Ryan is the nicest one yet. He has taken care of me since the first one back in 2012. This guy bends over backwards for me and I know Im not a high roller, but he treats me like one.

2,"September 04, 2018",i had a problem with my daughters car and it just wasn't worth fixing so i talked to Wali the used car manager and he worked out a deal where i could trade in my broke car for a really nice 2 year old Malibu.  It was great and she is very happy.,5.0
3,"June 11, 2018",i made an appointment on line and when i pulled in they were ready for me.  i had oil change and tire rotation and they washed my malibu for me.  i was in and out in an hour.,5.0
4,"March 18, 2018",They fixed my car fast and gave me a loaner.  Melvin was great. I will always take my car to Westside Chevrolet. Thanks for the great service. ,5.0
5,"February 16, 2018",Great fast service.  Jimmy was great and everyone else kept checking on me.  They washed my truck and had good free coffee and WiFi.  The whole dealership has gotten much better. ,5.0
6,"April 29, 2017",They tried to charge me $926.80 for a rear passenger window regulator which I paid $176 for at another garage. Avoid Westside Chevrolet of west Houston/Katy Texas.,1.0
7,"December 20, 2016","2 hours to change oil, tire rotation not done as promised, had to use car alarm to locate when it was ""completed"". Not friendly. Worst experience to date from any dealership and have been buying cars for 45 years. Will walk before taking anything back to them to work on. ",1.0
8,"December 15, 2016","So the dealership calls my wife and says mam you have a recall would you like to bring it in, wife says sure how long will it take? Lady says 45 minutes, wife says ok I'll wait for it, they set the appointment for 11 am. At 1 pm wife calls and says they still haven't finished. So I call up there and raise xxxx and all I hear is excuses. I get better service at my FORD dealership on my wife's CHEVROLET. Last time we will be there and worst service ever.",1.0
9,"August 06, 2016",I had my car service for the recall on the radio. My radio now doesn't work properly antymore and it says service rear view system. I called and was told to bring it in Saturday morning early and I said I'll be there before 8:30 after my run. I get to the service department only to be told that I had spoken with someone in PA which isn't true and that their are no techs their on the weekend. I'm at work Monday thru Friday at 6:30 to 4pm and I'm at Kingsland park and ride by 5:15 to make it to work on time. This is the second time that I've had extremely poor customer service from west side Chevrolet and it's very frustrating to be told one thing only to get there and be told that you can't be helped. ,1.0
10,"August 04, 2016","AVOID this garage: 3rd in line at 6:30am. Given all the small talk about the car being ready the same day. Call late afternoon with a ""sob"" story about being under staffed and the car not having been looked at even though it was 3rd in line! I had to make alternative arrangements to pick it up on Tuesday following what was later explained as an easy repair. At pick up nobody knew where my key was although they we very quick to point me to the payment booth. The car was clean on arrival. On pick up oily finger marks on the side window and door but more disturbing was a huge grease mark on the door interior. Just let me know ahead of time when I drop the car off that there is a possibility of delays. Don't feed me a bunch of excuses. While collecting the car another customer was in an argument. His aircon was suppose to have been fixed but continued to blow hot air....just like the guy that dealt with me!",1.6
11,"August 04, 2016","Very unprofessional. We had an agreed upon price for a car and planned to pick it up after work.  When we have purchased from other car dealers they are happy to have the car and paperwork ready to go for us. These jokers called us at 2 pm to tell us they'd sold the car to someone else. They obviously used the fact that we were purchasing the car to goad this other buyer into making a deal that day. Up until that point they did not seem like typical used car salesmen, but I guess everyone shows their true colors if you give them enough time - Westside Chevrolet only took a few hours.  I'd highly recommend taking your business elsewhere.",1.0
12,"July 27, 2016","Took my 2014 Corvette in for two electrical problems, after keeping the car for 2 days they told there is nothing wrong with the car. One of the problems was the drivers seat wouldn't hold it's settings, I called another dealer and read the book they told me the wrong way to how to set the seats.
The service advisors and cashiers have no concern for your time or satisfaction . How Chevrolet lets them stay in business is beyond me.
I was in the automobile business for 47 years and in all my life I would never treat people they way they do.
DO NOT GO TO THIS DEALERSHIP FOR ANYTHING!",1.0
13,"July 22, 2016","UNETHICAL!  ELDER ABUSE!  This dealership (Chad Mulholland/ R Crandall) took advantage of my 83 year old father.  I acknowledge that my father is responsible for himself so the fact that they low-balled him on his trade in is on my father.  However they sold him a 2014 demo as a ""new"" truck (which my father thought was a 2015) and we later found out when we went to sell it, that it had previous body damage which was not disclosed to my father.
The dealership was unwilling to do anything that made the situation right so they lost our business for the new Chevy we just bought.",1.0
14,"February 14, 2014",horrible service techs...over tightened my oil filter and oil drain bolt.  did not tightened my lug nuts on one wheel and almost had an accident...not quality work and will never bring my car or recommend them to anyone...stay away!!,1.0
15,"February 28, 2013","I bought a 31,700 dollar vehicle from westside, a few months later The dealer had to work on my 2012 Malibu 2LZ at which it had 7000 miles(5,800 at time of original issue and 0,450 at time of leather issue), the front right strut went out which they replaced and screwed up my alignment and my steering wheel does not sit strait anymore. my ac went out, and now it doesn't blow out evenly. they also had to work on my leather, in which they completely ruined it in their ""repairing"". they put some kind of patch on the parts which needed work and painted the rest of the seat to match the patch. i told them it looked discolored and they simply got uproared and angry threatening me, talking down and disrespectfully to me (all of which i have a recording.) when i got home, i figured i would use the leather wipes to maybe make them match the reat of my seats which i have always used them on. the leather wipes removed the ""paint"" revealing the patches on the seat. They claimed they only touched up a little spot, which was obviously not true. They are simply being a bunch of 5 year old children, mad that I caught them ""CUTTING CORNERS."" This is the worst dealership i have ever been to, I would think twice before being sucked into buying something from this dealership!",1.0

17,"June 07, 2011",Bought a used Dodge truck for my son. This was his first car the truck and we were not sure if we should buy from a dealership or a private seller. They were very helpful at the dealership!,4.2
18,"May 06, 2011","I have been a customer of Bob Johnson for 9 years. Over this time my husband (also a Vietnam vet)and I have bought 10 vehicles through Bob. He's always been professional and friendly and has always gone the extra mile for us. I've lost count of the amount of friends and family members we've sent to him over the years. Bob certainly makes buying a car a pleasure rather than a dreaded chore. I reccommend him highly to anyone looking for a sales consultant who will listen, explain, provide options and after sales support.",5.0
19,"May 05, 2011","I bought my 7th Corvette from Westside Chevrolet. The salesman Bob Johnson was informative and knowledgeable about vettes. To top it off, he's a retired Vietnam veteran who served our country. Much props to him! After owning 6 vettes it's hard to be impressed from a typical salesperson who learned everything from a brochure. Bob was different. He's owned several vettes himself and was a fellow vettenut like myself. He made the process painless and I got a great deal. Thanks Bob and Westside Chevrolet for making it happen. Save the wave!!",5.0
20,"March 28, 2011","There are so many dealerships in this area, so I was not sure where to start.  I made several calls to dealers and Westside is where I ended up.  What a great place to buy a car! I had a wonderful experience.  The service and the price is what got me!!  Will be a customer for life! Thanks!",5.0
21,"March 17, 2011","Salesman of the month, HAHA! This guy is a joke. I saw an add online for $1000 off the price of a car, and they wouldn't give it to me. Kept BSing me around. Bob kept talking to me like I was completely stupid. Explaining to me how the 4 cylinder motor was a 4.1L. Really? HAHA. Even I know that is not possible. Try a 2.4L. ""Look 'Hun' If you push the window button all the way down, the window will go down automatically."" I am 26, I know about windows, or how the tray inside the console comes out. I wam a women, I am not clueless. He kept bragging to me about how he supposedly had owned 30 different corvettes in his life so far. blah, blah, blah. I can not believe how rude he was. Told me that I was never going to get the car I was looking at for the price I wanted. That I might as well try financing with them, even though I was already preapproved through my bank. Jokes on him though. Even if he could have matched the price I wanted, I would have never bought a car from him. He is a JERK! ",1.0
22,"September 01, 2009","Incompetent staff resulted in cheating me out of $3500.00! I went to Westside Chevrolet and bought a new 09 Malibu LTZ during the Cash for Clunkers (CARS) program. I bought the car on a Sunday and the following Friday (nearly a week later) they called me to say that the car I bought did not qualify for the program and I had to bring it back. 


They had punched in the LS model with the smaller engine on the CARS website, but the LTZ came with the 6 cylinder which made it not qualify due to gas mileage restrictions. I'm sure I could have gotten a lawyer and kept the car since I had a contract, but they promised me they would ""work with me."" I took the car back and got my ""clunker"" on Friday evening-They did not give me my title back at the time because some office was already locked up for the night. The next day, Saturday, was the last day of the CARS program, and every other dealer in Houston tole me ""No Deal if no title in hand."" I could not get my title because Westside is closed on Saturdays. I even drove an hour to get to this dealership-What a mistake! I was really happy with my car for the 5 days I had it. Avoid this dealership. There are too many others to choose from in Houston. 

I wonder what Westside Chevrolet would have said if after owning a new car for 5 days You or I decided to just take it back?
