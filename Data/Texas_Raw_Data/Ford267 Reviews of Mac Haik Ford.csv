0,"June 23, 2020","I cannot rate the service department since I cannot get through to them on the phone.  I tried calling to schedule an appointment for warranty work three times on Friday, June 19th, four times on Monday June 22nd and two times on Tuesday June 23rd.  Each time the phone merely rang, and rang and rang. The switch board did not even pick up. As much as I want to do business with this dealer, I refuse to go to the service department without an appointment and drop off my truck that has less than 10,000 miles on it without some type of assurances of how long I will be without a vehicle.  I would hope with unemployment being what it is, Mac Haik would at least hire someone to answer the phone.",1.0
1,"June 09, 2020","Update:
I just got off the phone with the service manager. I received his call about 30-45 from posting this. Apologies were given and accepted for not returning phone calls, etc. Things do happen and things get forgotten. I am an understanding person.

They have made this wrote by giving me a credit for service equal to what I paid for the second tow fee. I am satisfied with the outcome.

I would like to say thank you to the team for responding and showing that you actually care. I will be going back now that they have made this right.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

The service department at Mac Haik needs some serious work. Mostly with the service advisors. The mechanics are doing what they are instructed to do, and overall are very skilled. If we could get the services advisors to listen to their customers and the mechanics, or just get rid of them all together, I think they would be in better shape. The mechanics are the only reason for the one star. 

My truck died on me while driving down the road. Had it towed it. Service advisor calls me and says that after sitting a few days over the weekend, they got in it and it fired right up. They pulled the codes and suggested a fuel pump failure. SA said to replace it would be best.

I asked him if they would recommend dropping the tank and flushing it and the sending unit. My though was perhaps some debris was in there that was getting stuck on the suction lines. I was told no, that is next to impossible. Anything like that would get sucked through and be caught in the filter. Dropping and flushing the tank would be a waste of time and money.

So, I trusted him and replaced the fuel pump. Picked up the truck, and a few days later I'm having it towed again. This time, to the house. Where the next morning I dropped the tank myself to find a piece of wax-paper gasket stuck to the high suction line of the fuel pickups in the sending unit!

When I went back to speak to the service advisor to try and get some restitution for the $1400 he F#$%^D me out of for the fuel pump, I asked him if they even hot-wired the pump to run a while to see if it was OK or not; NO. I then asked to speak to the mechanic and showed him the piece of debris I pull out of my tank, and I showed him the pictures of it stuck to the suction lines. Mechanics words, ""Oh yeah, I've seen that hundreds of times. I told him we should have dropped the tank"". Clearly the SA was in this to make revenue numbers and not take care of his customers. Funny thing is, I would have paid for both the pump AND the tank flush.

SA gave me his managers number. I have called and left messages twice. All I was asking for was for them to clear the (second) code in the truck and perhaps reimburse my tow fee by giving me some oil changes or something. No call back.

Last time I go here.",2.2
2,"February 20, 2020",Working with Roy was a pleasure.  He showed us three different versions of the Expedition we were looking for and there was zero pressure towards the higher priced version.  Roy allowed us to make our choice on our own.  Roy worked to get us all the rebates and perks I asked for.  Will gladly buy from Roy Casas again!  ,5.0

They're the best in customer service. Sales people are very courteous and knowledgeable. Aladdin Atassi & Cameron Gray took care of all our needs in our vehicle purchase.

4,"September 04, 2019","recently bought a used f150 with 85,000 miles so i was expecting some issues down the road, but i did not expect to be paying for a tow truck and repair cost of 500$ before i even made my first payment. called the salesmen right as it happened expecting some help to at the very least get it looked at that day, to find out ""there was nothing they could do"". i didnt buy the $4000 warranty so i guess ive learned my lesson, but i can assure you i will not be buying my next vehicle at Mac Haik Ford ",1.0
5,"August 17, 2019","I usually keep a truck 20 years, I have sent over 11 friends to Mac Haik Ford. And everyone of them treats with reverence and respect to directing them to see Aladdin Atassi. I bout my truck from him last week. It was time for a new one, my 2001 F-150 had 400,000 miles on it. Runs good but needs to rest more often. I asked Aladdin for what I wanted. He killed it, knocked it our of the park. He sent me the Mac Haik Ford promise of savings. I completed the paper work ahead of time. I live in Dallas and decided there is only place to buy any vehicle, Mac Haik. I came in Saturday evening, Barry Graves had the paperwork prepared, I added a warranty, wheel and tire and gap insurance. my payments were a lot lower than I expected. I bought a new Ford F-150 in less than 45 minutes. Chris McKInney, the GSM looked in over everything and made it so smooth. Terry Shields, the President, I say thank you and I will always send my family, my friends and business partners to see Aladdin. Good Job Aladdin and keep in touch

6,"July 17, 2019","It was my first visit to Mac Haik Ford searching for a new vehicle, Aladdin understood my requirements & needs and answered every question i had,  He and the sales manager helped me all the way to what i think is a great deal for the car i took.",5.0

It was a great experience. Quality vehicle at a fair price I would definitely recommend Alladin and MAC Haik to friends. ",5.0
8,"July 03, 2019","I bought a certified pre-owned car from Mac Haik Ford's Used Car department with a 100k powertrain warranty & 12k bumper to bumper warranty.

Soon after taking my car home, a buzzing noise would start at high speeds. The noise got louder the faster I went (freeway speeds). I took my car in and spoke with Kelli, who said it may be a loose panel under the car or the disintegrated soundproofing on top of the passenger side wheel well which would not be included in the bumper-to-bumper warranty. I tried to look at it myself but didn't find any loose panels. I gave in and made the soonest service appointment with Ron Gunter because I had a long road trip coming up.

Ron Gunter said that there were screws loose under the car and that after replacing, the sound went away. They charged me $200 for an oil change and supposedly four screws. I explicitly didn't remember any missing screws under the car when I had checked previously. In picking up the car from service, they left my car running in the middle of the parking lot with grease stains all over.

On the drive home after the appointment, the buzzing noise was still obviously present. It was too late to reschedule as my long road trip was right after. On the road, I realized the rubber surrounding the windshield was lose and flapping in the wind, making the sound. I glued the rubber strap back down and vowed never to go back to Mac Haik as they had misdiagnosed my problem and charged me for it.

After submitting a bad review on the follow-up email, I got a call from Cyrus Makvandi wanting to make things right. He wanted me to bring my car in to fix the soundproofing and make sure everything else was ok.

I brought it in and left it with him, then he came back promising to fix the soundproofing and give it a full detail, and give me oil change coupons if I left him a perfect review. I told him that sounded like a deal. Then he said that he was not going to do anything until I left a perfect review and he got a confirmation that it was received.

I told him that I was already deceived by the sales department when Nathan Wood promised a lot was covered in warranty, which ended up being incorrect, and as such I would not submit a perfect review for service that was not yet rendered. He refused to do anything until the review was submitted, so I came back to collect my car and leave. I am baffled that any company would hold services hostage until receiving prior confirmation on perfect review of services.

The Mac Haik Service center wasted my time and money. They charged me over $200 without double-checking the problem was fixed, left my car running in the parking lot with grease stains all over, and tried to scam me in to leaving a perfect review before making things right. I will never go back and strongly advise others to not do business here.",1.0
9,"July 03, 2019","I was on the market for a car knowing pretty much what i wanted and with little time to spend on the whole process and a very specific credit situation. (Foreign national)

Aladdin helped me every step of the way making sure he understood what I needed and providing options. He guided me through the credit application process and helped me get my credit approved in 3 days. Finally he helped me get exactly the car I wanted in record time and matching my budget. All that was done in a week and I just had to walk to the dealership to sign papers and pick up the car.

Overall the service from both Aladdin and the entire team at MacHaik has been a very pleasant experience, fast, precise and flawless. Would highly recommend him and his team.

Thx again,

13,"June 04, 2019","After spending nearly a month searching for the right car I had gone to a dozen dealerships and car lots looking for something I knew I would love. It wasn't until I sat down with Elena Estopellan at Mac Haik that I had come close to finding what I knew I wanted. She was amazing from beginning to end in the process of finding and purchasing my vehicle. Both her and Mannie Patel in their finance department worked with me the whole way to get me into my new car. No hassle, no broken promises, no pressure. 
If I ever need another car in the future, this is the place I'll definitely be coming to first.

21,"April 04, 2019","I had a recall for my Ford Edge to fix the adaptive steering, and I also needed an oil change, and battery replacement, called Mac and made an appointment, took two weeks to get in.  Had my car in the service stall at 7:30am as scheduled.   I told ROBERT GONZALEZ, my service rep,  make this recall fix a priority over getting the oil changed and replacing the battery.  ROBERT GONZALEZ did exactly the opposite.  He changed the oil, replaced the battery, and told he just could not get to the recall.  ROBERT GONZALEZ is not a man of his word and this was the last time I will have service or purchase another FORD from MAC HAIK.  The service is poor, the employees are poor, and it was a total waste of my time.  I have since gone to Covert Ford in Hutto and it took 60 minutes to fix the recall.",1.4

In every experience so far without fail, the service department has been extremely hard to work with, and rude.  Everything takes an extremely long time.  I have had to have my car in for repeated service on the same issue.  They don't take the time to see if something is covered by extended warranty.  Everything is an up-sale.  

Today I spoke with the service department director Edwin Holmstrom.  He was very rude, had no customer service skills and I'm appalled that this person is directing the service department at Mac Haik.

I told him I don’t care about the so called upgrades.  I wanted the no haggle price.  I went home.

138,"March 08, 2018","Scheduled an appt. for service with service advisor, Paul Sokol.  I let him know I would need a loaner in accordance with my service plan, which he said he would arrange, and to ask for him when I brought in my car.  He told me the recall work would take half a day.  Arrived on my scheduled day/time and asked for Paul.  After waiting over 15 minutes for Paul to show up, another employee stepped in to help.  When I went to the rental car counter, no car had been reserved, and they did not have one in the price range allowed by my service plan.  Big Kudos to Dan and Jordan in that department.  They were awesome.  They took care of me without penalty.  Waited to hear from Paul Sokol about the status of the repairs and finally called him at 5 p.m.  As he was looking on the computer, he made the comment, ""Oh your car was the one which we caught on fire and ended up in a ditch,"" and then chuckled.  I didn't think the comment was funny or appropriate.  He then said my car had not been worked on that day, that it would be worked on first thing the next day, and that he would call me and keep me updated on the status.  This meant rearranging my schedule for a second day which I could have done more easily if I had received a courtesy call early on to let me know.  Day two:  No call from Paul Sokol all day.  I called to talk to him at 5 p.m. on day two only to be told he wasn't ""in"" that day.  I was told the repair work had been completed earlier in the afternoon.  I would have been able to avoid rush hour traffic if I had received a call when the work had been completed.  When I arrived to pick up my call, I asked to speak to the service manager.  I believe his name is Paul Scanlon(?).  He had left for the day so I spoke to Andy, the service dept. foreman.  He was very nice and apologetic, but didn't have authority to act on the situation.  He made a copy of the paperwork and said he would give it to the service manager and I would receive a call from the service manager the next morning.  No call was ever received.  When I got in my car to leave, there were black grease(?) marks on the passenger seat.  Andy was able to remove them with upholstery cleaner.  I bought my car from this dealership and this is the first time I had need of the service department.  I said ""yes"" I would recommend the dealership because of Andy, Jordan, and Dan, but I will only recommend with full disclosure.  As for me, I most likely will not be using this service department in the future. ",3.6

163,"December 27, 2017","The beginning of my experience with Mac Haik Ford was less than satisfactory. The salesman that approached me didn’t seem too interested in selling anything to me. It was as if he already assumed he wasn’t getting a sale and so he felt like he didn’t need to put much effort forth. He didn’t lead the conversation much so there was several long pauses until I initiated more of the conversation. I came to the dealership for the exact car that I bought, so unfortunately he was going to get the sale regardless of his customer service. I love my vehicle, but he didn’t explain much to me. I had no idea how long my Sirius XM free trial would last along with many other questions regarding the functionality of the vehicle. I was dead set on getting a Ford Explorer though so that didn’t deter me from purchasing the vehicle. I figured I could just teach myself the ins and outs later. It just would’ve been nice if he was a lot more customers service oriented and acted like he was excited to sell me the vehicle. It wasn’t until the very end, after I signed all the financial documents, that he perked up and started smiling. It was disappointing to say the least. I will continue buying Fords, but I don’t know if I’ll go back to that particular dealership. Even the financial manager was a little rude when I was questioning the numbers and unsure about getting the extended warranty. I ended up walking out paying way more than agreed upon originally because they tacked on a few things and used my trade in to get me to the agreed upon price, even though I wanted to walk out with a certain price BEFORE my trade in was incorporated. That was my fault. I should’ve known. They were being sneaky. ",2.3

Finally on the 17th I did get someone to answer and set up an appointment for the following Monday. The dealership was undergoing renovations at the service drop off location. That wasn’t an issue but no information on where to go. I moved car and went to quick lube. They told me I had to go to service. I moved car back and went to the only door that wasn’t blocked off. That was also the wrong place and a person took me to right place. No one would go that way because you had to go through another door and no way of knowing the right location.

187,"September 18, 2017","As many others in our community both our cars were totaled along with our house and possessions. Along with dealing with everything else we’ve been researching car options while our insurance claims are processed. Finally after a long day dealing with our home we decide to visit Mac Haik to see four vehicles I had picked out from their online inventory of new cars. I had been researching all week long.

I came in with my wife and children since I wanted this to be a positive experience for all. We were greated at the door by this salesman, he directed to his working area where we sat down. I was very sincere by starting the conversation saying we were still waiting for our claim checks and will not be closing a deal right then and there. I also specified that I was expecting the funds this weekend. 

When I showed him the screen grabs with both explorers he stoped me to asked again how many cars I wanted to see. When he heard four his response was that I needed to narrow my list down because he was too busy. 

I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. To be honest, I lost it. On top of that the floor was empty, it really wasn't busy at all.

I took my family and left, put them in the car and then decided to come back to simply ask this gentleman’s name. When I did he tried to defuse the situation by saying that he now was willing to show me the cars. Offer I didn’t care to accept. When I asked his name he simply said Abraham and when I asked his last name he asked me if I was a cop. At that point I turned and left. 

This was my first visit to a dealer and I hope this is not the type of treatment I will encounter on what clearly appears to be a sellers market. 
In hindsight my error may have been to tell him I wasn’t ready for a deal right there and then. However I’m glad the true colors came out at this point of the process rather than after more time was wasted. 

I admit that lately with everything going on and having to deal with FEMA, Insurance companies, etc my fuse may be a bit short. However after I do all the leg work and come to show my family the possibilities of our new family car I do expect better treatment. Maybe those that say I should go to Dallas and buy my car there are right.

206,"August 20, 2017","I was looking for a very specific vehicle.  Ford Edge sport white with 21''wheels and I found 3 on internet, one in Mac Haik.  
Went to Mac Haik and Esteban received me.  Unfortunately  he couldn't find the car as it was supposed sold.  Esteban, gave me all the attention needed and said he would find out another car like this for me.  Long history short, this car was been purchased by another person but he was not approved and Esteban was able to find this out and secured the car for me.  I test drove it and decided to buy.  Didn't have all docs with me in the first day I went there, so I would have to come back.
 Went home and next day, Esteban called me and asked me to send all docs to his e-mail so he could make sure all would be approved before I got there.  When I arrived to the store, the car was ready to be delivered (including all checks and cleaning) and I was approved already.  (Previous experience in Autonation, took me 5v hours from the time I decide to the moment I left the dealership)). Brought the car home and few days later discovered it has a minor problem in one sensor and a small scratch.  Called Esteban, and he took the ownership to organize everything with the maintenance and body shop departments, and also got approval to give me a rental car (another edge) during the time of the repair (few days).  So, I can certainly say he went beyond what other people would do.

 If you want to buy a Ford, and want to be very well treated without all that pressure to force you to buy, go in Mac Haik and look for Esteban.  I bought my old car in Autonation and now I was looking for cars for months and I can tell, it's a huge, huge diference. ",4.8

I had been searching for a new mustang GT premium for a few weeks when I stumbled across Mac Haik's dealership. They had the exact mustang that I wanted, and for a price I couldn't believe. The car was listed for $32,880.00. Now, we all know that dealerships quote you one price online, and then it changes when you get there. However, that wasn't the case with Mac Haik. I had the pleasure of doing business with Esteban! I called the dealership to inquire on the price. Remember, I thought it was too good be true. Esteban assured me that this was the price (as all other dealers do to get you in the door) and that he wasn't in the business of playing games. Esteban assisted me with valuing my trade and applying for financing all the while, I'm in the office in Dallas. Esteban was very honest and forthwith with all negotiations and was very diligent in responding to all of my questions and correspondence. We got the deal done over the phone and I was able to pick my car up the next day. The next day I drove to Houston to pick up my car. It was already detailed and ready to go. Esteban checked my trade-in in and we proceeded to financing. I was there for an hour and a half (30 minutes of that was waiting for my bank to approve a transaction. I've bought a lot of cars from a lot of dealerships. This was by far the best sales and financing experience that I've ever had. Esteban, and Jesse in the finance department are stand up guys who don't mess around. If uou want a new or used Ford for the best price in the country. Go see Mac Haik! You won't be disappointed.

239,"October 26, 2015","We’d like to take this moment to comment on the service we received at Mac Haik Ford.  We’ve dreaded visiting dealerships because we just can’t handle being aggressively attacked by blood thirsty sales staff who says whatever falls out of their mouth just to get a sale.  So often we see men and women who it is obvious aren’t there to serve but to get a paycheck until there next job comes.  Today, it is common for sales people to use foul language and tell disgusting jokes.  As a result, we don’t ask many questions because we have very little faith in what they tell us.  As a result, auto shopping for us has been a treacherous and dreaded experience. 
I had emailed about the Focus and received a phone call back shortly after that. Made an appointment with Scott to see car and when I got there he had the car out front and ready to drive. He went over everything completely and off we went.  Came back and was ready to buy. He made everything go easy and I’m so happy. Scott and Mr. Brown were able to get us a better rate than our bank. I will surely go back and buy from Scott.
 I am always interested in those who have served in the military and I commented on the picture of the Navy carrier in the office down the hall.  Scott was very complimentary of his co-worker…not jealous or condescending.  We were immediately impressed.
We felt compelled to tell you about our new and exciting experience at your dealership.  We were privileged to be served by Scott Walker.  Scott was very professional throughout.  He actually listened to what our needs were and what we were hoping to find.  He was professionally firm but never pushy.  He helped us find that just right vehicle and get that Mac Haik feeling.  It isn’t just a slogan with Scott.  
We hope you’ll have him share his style with other staff.

I have dealt with Bayway Lincoln, Motortrend in Alvin, and several other dealers who wouldn't budge at all when I told then I wanted a walkout price that I wanted to pay.  I contacted Scott Walker from Mac Haik.  First thing he did was immediately confirm whether or not they still had the exact make and model i was looking for.  Immediate response was awesome. He even sent me a picture of it on the lot and it's location on the lot.  First impression was awesome!  Also, as you are aware of internet pricing being different than the price when you get to the Dealership, this was not the case with Scott.  We had agreed to a price before I left my side of town.  Mind you I live almost in Galveston, and he was located almost in Katy.  What a relief when I got there and the same price we had agreed upon was what he presented to me when i got there.  The sticker price was 2k more than the internet price.  Nevertheless, he kept his word and I got the  exact price i wanted to ""walkout"" with.  Absolutely amazing guy.  I felt comfortable.  He didn't try to upgrade me, or pawn off a different, or newer car to me.  I have never felt that experience with any other dealership.  He had the car washed and ready to go before i even got there.  It was parked up front and awaiting my arrival.  The car was exactly what was advertised, and I enjoyed my test drive with no pressure on the specific route I wanted to take.  I had my own financing through my credit union but because it was later in the day, I couldn't get the required paperwork to be able to take it home that day.  This is when Travis Brown stepped in.  He secured me financing for the exact same rate, and exact down payment so that I could take the car home that day.  I spent about 2 hours at the dealership maybe less.  This experience was incredible and I wanted to share with everyone how amazing these two people are.

241,"October 05, 2015","First of all, be prepared to leave your car for at least 3 days!!!! I'm not sure why if a service department is backed up so much, why they wouldn't hire more technicians to meet the demands. 

I took my car in last August for a noise in the left rear wheel. They told me at that time I needed new brakes, so I replaced them. My car started making the same noise again, now they tell me they can't find anything mechanically wrong with the car, suggesting I need an alignment, so basically I paid for new brakes for nothing. 

I also took my car in last October because the heater wasn't working. They fixed it while it was still under warranty (supposedly). Now my heater isn't working again, and it's not under warranty, they want to charge me 565.00 for the repair.  My car only has 55,000 miles on it, what are the chances of the heater breaking twice with only 55,000 miles on it? 

Needless to say, I did not let them fix my car because I certainly don't trust them.

Quick Lane said there was a transmission leak and that the Service department would have to look at it but it would be 125 to look at it plus all the repairs and labor. 
Then they told me the battery, that was a year and a half old, was dying and they needed to replace it. That was suspect to me so I asked them to check the alternator. They said to LOOK at the alternator it would be 125. 
So they were charging 125 to LOOK at the transmission and 125 to LOOK at the alternator. So every time they had to LOOK at anything they charge 125 not including repairs and labor. REALLY?!?!?! I have NEVER had a Ford dealership charge me to just LOOK at my car. NEVER.
They also said that to look at and fix my transmission leak it would be four days. That was yesterday. Today they are saying 10 days. When asked if we could get a loaner car they said no but we could rent one. REALLY?!?!?! On top of all the fees for looking at my car they now suggest we pay them to rent a car.

245,"December 07, 2014","I drove 500+ miles to trade my truck for a new 2015.  We had agreed on the phone on the new truck price, and a ball park price on my trade vehicle.  Their ball park price was $6000.  I told them I was looking for $8000.  He said we could work something out in between those numbers.  I decided to do the deal.  Upon arriving they immediately took my vehicle to inspect it.  When they brought it back it had "" blown power steering fluid all over the parking lot and had an engine knock"".  Being surprised at the news I decided to investigate.  We found that the fluid on the ground was not from my vehicle.  And the engine was not knocking.  They went to discuss this among others, and another salesman said our new one was ready, to come and look at it.  After looking at the new truck, we went back in to close the deal and they offered me $3000 on my truck.  All the rhetoric was how bad my truck was and we had driven all that distance but they just couldn't give any more.  They were trying to make it sound like the truck was on it's last leg.  To shorten this up, they had no intention of trading with me unless they got a steal on my vehicle.  I had not haggled on the price of theirs at all, trying to trade in good faith, and they were trying to break it off in me.  I told them I did not appreciate the attempt to make mine look like it had all kinds of problems, oil on the ground, knocking engine, etc. and I was not going to give my truck away and that I could drive it home for $100.  They then suggested we go ahead and buy the new truck and drive them both home.  I told them I could have flown in and drove it home if I was going to do that.  That option was even discussed on the phone the day before.  We left without making any deal at all and drove home.  And we had no issues with engine knocks or power steering fluid leaks at all.  This whole episode was planned by the people involved, and I believe, but can't prove, that the oil issue was staged, hoping we would not investigate the problem.

246,"July 01, 2014","I went to this dealership to purchase a new Focus.  I was lied to every step of the way and ended up walking out in the finance office.  This dealership has given me one of my favorite lines ever said to me by any salesperson, so I suppose that's worth something, here's the story:

I don't like cars with brown interior.  They only had one focus in the style that I wanted and it was blue with brown interior.  The guy told me after I drove it and said that I didn't like the interior color and would like to have them search local dealers to see if they could get me one with grey or black interior the guy said ""oh it's only brown because it's overcast right now.""  What?  I actually just kinda stared at him dumbstruck and then said ""I'm no car expert, but I'm pretty good with my colors.  I passed Kindergarten.""  I then requested a different salesperson.  That guy was better but the hoodwinking started again when I hit the finance office.

I negotiated a pretty good price for the car, which was around $15,500.  It was a pretty base model, almost stripped.  That's what I wanted.  Then I get to the finance office and they are talking about a $572 payment each month!  WHAT?!?!?  I'm not purchasing a Mercedes S500 am I?!?!?  No, but I was purchasing just about every add on, warrantee, etc that they could come up with as well as a 17.9% interest rate (when I have excellent credit).  They tried to tell me all these reasons why, and I just said ""ok, thanks.""  I got up to go find my sales person to get the keys for my trade in back and they wouldn't give them to me!!!  They tried to tell me I'd already bought the new car!  I hadn't signed ANYTHING except something allowing them to run my credit.  I told them they had to be kidding and I at that point I lost it.  I started screaming in their lobby, yelling about how they were crooks and I wanted my keys or I was going to sue.
