0,"July 31, 2006","Each time that I have brought my Vue in for warranty repairs, the parts needed are not in stock. I can assure you that making multiple trips to the Saturn dealership, because they can not effectively manage their business, is not what I need to spend my time doing.
Today, Jeff Taggart, Service Consultant, told me that the needed part can not be delivered until Monday, even though I asked for overnight delivery of the needed part. I believe that to be a lie. It's been my experience that you can get overnight delivery service from reliable carriers, such as Fed Ex, even from foreign countries. I needed to get the repair performed before the weekend and brought the car in two days early to ensure that the weekend goal could be met. My mistake! I feel that my repair service needs are being denied as a cost cutting measure. If a Saturn dealership can not reliably and immediately obtain needed warranty parts, then the problems at this dealership are far greater than I first suspected. It took from 7/26- 7/31/06 to obtain the needed part. They do not have loaner cars and their shuttle only runs from 7/30am- 3:30pm.
I have reason to believe that my experience is not unique. Customer dissatisfaction appears to be the daily mode of operation in the service department of the Austin Saturn dealership. This opinion is based on conversations with other customers while waiting for and during courtesy rides to and from work. There isn't a continuous improvement effort being made to meet customer needs. Failure is accepted and that fact is also obvious from my conversations with the service department employees. ""I can't"" is the only words that I hear. 
It is inexcusable for the only Saturn dealer in Austin to be incapable of maintaining an adequate inventory of repair parts for CURRENT models being sold on their lot. Covert Saturn has failed me every time that I have needed repairs! 
I detailed the spare parts problem in the Customer Satisfaction survey that I completed after the first service department failure. Why bother to have the surveys if they do not act on the results?

1,"July 25, 2005","It has become a trend lately, that everytime I take my car in to get serviced, the result is always two trips to the dealership.  My service rep never calls to update on the status of the vehicle and is very vague when notifying me of the problem.  Just today I was told that I had a brake issue.  I had to probe him further to find out what ""kind of an issue"" he was speaking of.  Finally, when I did get the car back, I was missing a hub cap.  Thus, my second trip back.  Thier service is horrible.  I would not recommend this dealership to anyone.",2.2
