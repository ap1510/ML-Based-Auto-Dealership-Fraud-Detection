5,"June 01, 2020","Working with Elias Pasos (salesman) and the entire team at Don Hewlett was easy and painless. They went over all of our options for upgrades (Gap insurance, extended warranty, actual vehicle upgrades, even provided an auto insurance quote) to our vehicle, but never pressured us into anything we didn’t want. The whole process took maybe an hour, but most of that was just conversation. We would definitely recommend Don Hewlett in Georgetown and would have no problem buying there in the future. Elias Pasos isn’t listed in the sales person section to rate, but would give him 5 stars ⭐️. 
We give Brett McCleney in the finance department 5 stars ⭐️. We give Chris Parker the accessory sales consultant 5 stars ⭐️. We give Don Hewlett 5 stars ⭐️. ",5.0

9,"May 09, 2020","Our salesman, Chase  Bass, was so very knowledgeable, and worked very hard to help us find just the right car. He was so easy to work with...he worked tirelessly. He found us just the right color, and the right interior seating...and at this time of Coved-19. The Malibu drives very beautifully and has a lot of spunk!
We will happily recommend Chase to our friends.

A big Thank You to you Chase.
Most sincerely, Kay and Don Webster ",4.8

15,"April 21, 2020","I had looked online and found 2 vehicles that I liked within my price range. Looked at both and chose the one that I liked better. Knew the approximate trade in value of my car.  Knew my price range and had my monthly payments in mind before we sat down and started deliberating. First payment wasn’t to my liking... Told salesman, Ronnie Bradford, again my price range... Second payment was to my liking and we had a deal. I was in and out in a little more than 2 hours.",5.0
16,"April 21, 2020","Was clean alot of vehicles to choose from. I email someone to find out if it was available and he said it was then tried to schedule an appointment and said I couldnt give a set time because I work nights and he said he would send a video of the car and let me know if its available the next day, and I never heard from him the next day so i went and made the 2 hours drive to see it. The lady at the front at the front desk was nice and helpful and set me up with a nice salesman and he gladly showed me the car and answered any questions I had and even did some further investigation on the car. When we decided to buy the car he help negotiate the price and set it all up and when he tried to take it for wash, detail, and inspection he was met with harassment and bullying from other sales associates or someone higher up. Then he was trying to round up the manuals and keys and they were continuing to pick on him. I am not sure if this is a normal thing, or if he is fine with it but it aggregated me and pissed off the people I was with. The finance guy was nice and helpful explaining everything and getting us out quick. Besides the way the other sales men were acting it was a ok buying experience ",3.0

22,"April 06, 2020",I was in for a typical oil change. Experience was good for the most part employees did a good job of maintain 6 feet spacing. A few came in closer but did not bother me. My only complaint. I got a price for new brake pads on my corvette. The Price for pads only was 816 dollars. I went online to GM Parts direct and could order the Pads myself for 530 dollars. Not exactly sure why yall are changing just an insane price above GM Parts direct but oh well pretty much just let yall keep doing oil changes and nothing else.,3.6
23,"April 06, 2020","We have bought many vehicles from Don Hewlett Chevrolet over the years. It has always been a good experience in the past, and with our latest purchase this last March they didn’t disappoint.  It was actually one of the best. Because of current shelter in place requirements, they made us feel safe with whole process. It was organized such that our time there was limited, social distancing was always maintained, and we were given new pens when we arrived which we left with.  
We had been shopping for awhile, never felt any pressure to make a purchase at anytime, everyone was friendly and helpful.  When we saw a new offer on the vehicle we were interested in, we contacted them. We came to an agreement on purchase price and trade, scheduled a time to arrive at show room and were in and out of there in less than an hour and a half with our new vehicle. I will always buy from Don Hewlett Chevrolet and recommend you do as well. ",5.0

28,"March 23, 2020","I purchased a new Chevrolet Silverado PU from Don Hewlett Chevrolet in Georgetown. The Hewlett Dealership is without a doubt a first-class operation. My salesperson was Shannon Wolf who was a pleasure to work with.

36,"February 27, 2020","I took our Buick Avenier to the Hewlett express oil change. Darius was my advisor and he informed me that there were two Recalls on my Buick. One was a software issue of no immediate consequence but the second was a recall because this type of Buick reportedly could slip out of Park. The recall work would take an additional hour. Darius could tell I was concerned about safety and he knew I had to be in Austin for a vip by noon. I asked about the possibility of a loan vehicle. Darius was able to approve a loaner for me and got me connected to Kelan and Bryce in the service department. Kelan and Bryce quickly got me in a nice loan vehicle and on my way. I was able to meet all of my objectives for the day, return the loan car, pick up our Avenier and be home by 6p! As a bonus, I was able to spend a little time with Paul Conrad in Service. He has been a blessing to our family for nearly 25 years when he and Rick Dungan rescued us off a downtown Georgetown street in 100 degree weather. Our old model Cadillac had broken down next to downtown Hewlett. Paul put us, including our 2 year old, who later became a Hewlett customer, in one of the two rentals Hewlett had back then. Were able to get home in time to meet our other 4 children at the bus stop. I digressed there... Thank you Darius, Bryce and Kelan.",5.0

Salesman Joseph Loya was absolutely an outstanding, knowledgeable and professional person to deal with and I highly recommend him to anyone who wants a genuinely pleasant, fair and honest car or truck buying experience. As a side note, I was told numerous times at the dealership that its family business model was designed to eliminate much of the hassle traditionally associated with car sales. And I found this to be true. I don’t think I have ever dealt with a more professional bunch of people who have lived up to their promise to deliver a simple, honest, and hassle-free vehicle purchase experience to the public. I sincerely doubt there are many car dealers in the state of Texas that operate as well at this family dealership does.",5.0

60,"December 17, 2019","Ronnie Bradford did a great job.  Excellent follow up.  Excellent customer service  The dealership could improve by having better systems to allow for faster check outs when customers make appointments to pick up their new car.  For example, having the car ready, washed, paperwork ready, keys ready, everything ready since a pick time has been pre established.. This is not Ronnie's issue, but rather the a lack of dealership procedures.",5.0
61,"December 14, 2019","Very poor customer service. I got a new trax last October and within the first week, damage occurred to the muffler due to the condition the car was sold to me. I tried getting assistance, spoke to a couple representatives, who assured me they would call me back and ultimately never did. I called back several times and always told they would call me back and never do. I still haven't gotten a call back, over 2 months later, and looks like I won't. I don't know why i bother with a warranty, which proves useless already. If i knew this was the kind of shady customer service I would experience, i would have ignored this dealership and gone elsewhere. I regret going to Don Hewlett.",1.0
62,"December 11, 2019","Earlier my brakes in my 2017 Encore had been making a random grinding sound.  I made a recording of it and let Joe V. hear it when I was in to have my oil changed.  He made an appointment for me to come in and get a loaner car so they could check it out.  I brought my Encore in and Joe showed me to the rental car area.  They were very nice and soon I was on my way.  Joe called me that evening to let me know that parts had been ordered and I should be able to get my car the next day.  The next day, Joe called me to let me know what they had done and that my car was ready to go.  I took the loaner car back and picked up my Encore.  There was no charge because it was under warranty.  Elise, the cashier, was so nice.  She made sure that my car had been washed and vacuumed and soon I was on my way in my nice clean, quiet car. (no grinding brakes). Thanks to Joe V., the people in the service department whom I never get to meet but who always do a great job servicing my Encore, and Elise.  Great customer service all the way around.  Thanks, Don Hewlett.",5.0
63,"December 10, 2019","I don't like car problems, but I drive a 15 year old truck with over 215k miles.  There is no way I could do that if it wasn't for Don Hewlett's service team.  Paul Conrad has been my service tech for several years.  He is so patient and willing to work with me to get any issue handled quick and also be aware of the cost to me.  But the entire service department and support teams are great!  Also, the express service makes it so convenient to get an oil change and other minor services done so you don't even need an appointment.  That means you don't have to deal with one of the annoying oil change places that tries to sell you something you don't really need every time you go to them.  People tell me going to the dealer is too expensive, but not if you go to Don Hewlett!

Thanks so much!!

65,"December 06, 2019","Networking brought me to Hewlett when I bought my 2013 Equinox, but the service and the people bring me back every time.  The service department was good enough to bring my tire pressure up after the first cold spell, so when I got a low tire alert Wednesday, I figured there was a problem.  Sure enough the service department found a nail in the tire and fixed it for me.  Since it was close to time for an oil change, they took care of that AND in the free multi-point check they told me a varmint had been up on my engine--they cleaned it up and replaced the cabin filter.  THEN they washed and vacuumed my car.

There is NO WONDER why I continue to return to Hewlett--the best people and best service I have found.",5.0

I was lucky enough to get assigned to Carl and he took very good care of me.  While I was at work he pulled the truck I wanted to look at up to the front of the dealership and took a quick all around video to send to me so I could see what it looked like.  He did a lot of work to make sure that my experience was pleasant. the finance manager could not have been more accommodating and actually made it fun and less stressful to make such a large purchase. Overall this has been the best car buying experience I have had in my 30 plus years of car buying there are no high pressure tactics being used here.

I contacted salesman Cameron Smith and described my criteria. Cameron got busy and ran down all the trucks that met my criteria. While Don Hewlett has a good set of pictures online, Cameron went the extra mile and sent me additional photos and video of cars that met my wants. By the time I arrived at the dealership, Cameron and I had narrowed the deals down to three trucks. Cameron got me a great deal and good trade-in. All the staff at Don Hewlett were friendly and helpful; Lee the salesman helping Cameron, Noemi in finance for finding me a low rate, and Chris Parker in accessories was helpful on describing products that might meet my needs.

I thought I would get another Ford, but when I met with Sam Evans at Hewlett Chevrolet, he took me straight to EXACTLY the vehicle I needed and wanted.  After looking at a lot of trucks, we eventually came back to the first one Sam showed me; I think he had listened so well to my needs that he knew before I did which truck I would want!  The trade-in they gave me for my Ford, which was like a member of the family, was fair, and the pricing was ""no hassle"" on the new truck.  Jeff Grazioplene handle the paperwork without a lot of trouble, and the check I had, based on the quote from Sam Evans, was correct to the penny.  My new Chevy Silverado 1500 LTZ 4x4 is a FAR better truck than the Ford in nearly every way - better tech, quieter, handles better, more powerful, better fuel economy, more comfortable, and on and on and on.

113,"September 09, 2019"," Unfortunately I can't give 0 stars as this was the worst service experience I have ever had with a dealer. Took my 2019 Silverado in for a flat tire, broken bed cover buckle and rod holder, exposed dashboard cable, and a misaligned bed cover panel that was preventing automatic closing of the tailgate. 

After almost a full week I was called to pick up my truck. When I got there, the only thing that was done was the fixed flat and the cable. They literally forgot about the other stuff. They quickly tried to get parts off the show room demo to replace on the broken bed cover and took the truck away to adjust the cover so that the tailgate would close properly. They didn't put the jack and tire tools in their proper place - just left them under the back seat. Took them a while to find someone that knew how to put the tools back properly. And, finally, I found out they lost a bike helmet chin snap that was in my center console. The service rep tried to get me a reimbursement for the helmet which was $32, but Greg Grove, the service manager, denied the request because I couldn't provide a proper receipt with an amount. I did provide other evidence from Amazon, but because it didn't single out the amount for the helmet he didn't approve it. 

All, in all, almost a week + another hour and a half in the service waiting area while the service staff scrambled to fix the truck was really quite embarrassing for Don Hewlett Chevrolet. Especially after spending more than $65k on a truck.",2.0

147,"July 09, 2019","I purchased a used 2013 Ford C-Max Hybrid from this car dealership. The car was listed for $10,000, I paid $10,000, no haggling involved. I also opted to purchase the extended warranty from them out of good faith. Another $3000 out of pocket there. Was told upon purchase that there were some plastic pieces that had been ordered that were missing on the car. Two months after purchase, I have still not received a call to tell me the parts have arrived. 

Roughly 50 days after purchasing the car my wife went out of town for a week and the car sat, unused. When I went to drive it to work Monday morning, the battery was so dead the Key fob didn’t even work. Upon popping the hood to jump the car, the terminal covers were already off (obvious this car has been jumped before and they sold me a battery they knew was going bad)

I placed a call to the dealership to see about getting this issue resolved. I got no calls back so I called again the next morning at which time the runaround started. I was transferred to various employees who had no idea why I was speaking with them about the issues I was having. When I finally asked for a manager to just call me because I had spent hours on this by now. I was met with a response of “good luck with that” from the salesman. 

This dealership is scummy and does not make good on the deals, once they have your money you are no longer any good to them. I highly suggest taking your business elsewhere if you value professionalism!

148,"July 08, 2019","Carl seems to be a very proud  member of the Don Hewlett sales team, and it shows by the way he carries himself. He was very helpful with our needs in buying a new car, and eliminated all the hassles that people go through when buying a new car. Usually you run into pushy sales people that seem to want to sell you anything just so they can get their commission, not caring about the needs of the customer. Carl Staves made our vehicle purchase experience very pleasant, he made sure that we got what we wanted. So we say to Carl, THANK YOU and we will see you in three years if not sooner.

150,"July 04, 2019","My wife and I were looking for a new family SUV to replace our aging Honda, and we'd settled on the Chevy Traverse. We got a quote from another dealership in the Austin area, and then showed it to Ronnie on the Hewlett team. We already knew the quote was good, and we didn't think Hewlett would be able to match it.

Ronnie went to ""talk to his manager,"" and I'm not sure what he said, but not only did Hewlett match it, they beat it. To double check, we talked to the first dealership we got the quote from, and even they agreed the price was too good to pass up. Hewlett even had the color we were looking for in stock.

It's important to make clear that we did not go in with the expectation of a price match, and no such thing was ever advertised by Hewlett. So the price they offered was a degree of service that went above and beyond any expectations we had.

We didn't do financing through Hewlett, but the closing process for the loan was as smooth as I think anyone could hope it to be. We were asked if we wanted to include a wheel protection plan, which I declined, and that was it. No hassle, no pressure to add on any more extras or features I didn't want. I spent a few hours waiting to close on the loan and only about 10 minutes signing papers and wrapping up. We drove home with the car that evening, and they even offered to mail us our new plates and registration once it arrived (which took about a week). We declined and just brought the car in when they arrived, but I can imagine how that would be a convenient service for a lot of people.

I've heard horror stories about purchasing cars, but after my experience I can't imagine any of those stories come from Hewlett. If we ever buy another Chevy (we expect this Traverse to last us over a decade) we'll go to them first.",5.0

156,"June 13, 2019","Had the car for about two weeks and took it in to have the luggage rack repaired. The service dept used contact cement to glue it on. Lasted a few months. Took it in for a 2nd visit and they replaced the whole rail because it was faulty. They should have done this on the first visit. During the repair, the technician had to remove headliner to install the new luggage rail. Looks good during the day, but at night there is substantial light leakage around the 2nd and 3rd row DVD screens. Still waiting on a call back. The second issue was the tire pressure was low on one tire after they performed the routine service. No one was around to assist. The car was driven 30 miles while in their possession and had picked up a nail in the tire. They would not accept responsibility when I called the advisor back. He wasn’t available when I went to pick up the vehicle so another advisor pointed me to the courtesy vehicle counter and cashier. I find it strange that there wasn’t an issue with my tires going into the dealership but coming out there was. The original advisor was pleasant to work with when I brought the car in. But the overall experience with the service department and a damaged tire score low points.  I would appreciate a call from the dealership to remedy the tire ",2.8

162,"May 30, 2019","I have taken my 2017 Silverado to GM on MULTIPLE (nine times and counting) as of May 2019 and I just purchased in November of 2017. The main concern is the ever prevalent transmission issues. It feels as though the truck has been rear-ended and is throwing me forward while driving at a steady speed, accelerating, or slowing. The shop foreman has been taken on SEVERAL rides with me to show him the problem in the transmission. He admits there is an issue and the truck replicates over and over. Even the upper and lower valve bodies were replaced as they thought that was the issue. This only made the problem worse. Rob Elliot was the foreman that rode with me. Rob said, ""That kick and hard downshift are normal. there is nothing we can do to fix it."" Jason Jordan also claimed that they ""drove the heck out of it"" so much ""they had to put gas in it."" Yet, the odometer only read 9 miles. Even the dealer's records for the repair only reflected 9 miles. When I brought this up, Jason claimed when the ""computer was connected to the truck the odometer doesn't count miles."" That's the biggest load of xxxxxxxx I have ever heard. Seems you absolutely have to get an attorney and a lemon law claim filed to actually get anything fixed, even being under warranty.

170,"April 28, 2019","I purchased a used 2011 Chevrolet Grand Sport Corvette which the engine had been modified and was high performance and the car pricing reflected that the car had been modified. The sales person was Neal Slocombe. I was also sold an Extended Service Agreement for $2698.00 from the Hewlett chief financial officer. Only 8 days after the purchase the engine wires burned. I took the car to the service department & I was told it was not covered by the warranty, that I would be responsible for the repair. I had further conversations with the financial officer about what the warranty did cover & he said ""major problems such as the engine."" I expressed to him that perhaps that I should return the car to the dealership since I had that option within 45 days of the purchase date, but was assured by the financial officer that the car had been thoroughly inspected by the dealership & that I should not have any major problems but if I indeed did have they would be covered by the warranty. Less than 6 months later & less than 3000 miles the car had been driven, an engine valve lifter broke & fell into the engine. The car was taken to a reputable repair shop. The company that had under-written the warranty that was sold to me was contacted and as requested was provided pictures of the damages & a detailed estimate of the cost of the repairs, over $5,700.00. I was notified a few days later that the warranty was cancelled due to Don Hewlett Chevrolet not informing the warranty company that the car had been modified when the warranty was written. After numerous conversations with Mike Hewlett, I ended up having to pay for the needed repairs. I would not have purchased the car without a warranty and trusted the dealership to stand behind the warranty. The warranty was not worth the paper it was written on. Mike Hewlett was eventually ""generous enough"" to refund me the cost of the warranty that I had paid for myself at the time of purchase.

178,"April 05, 2019","Showed up on a Saturday afternoon to look at Chevy Equinoxes, new and used. After looking around for a while I was greeted by a very friendly woman named Poppy. She showed me several new and used Equinoxes, but I was a bit indecisive until I decided I wanted a new one but didn't see one in my price range. With the help of a very friendly gentleman named Abraham, Poppy and he found one for me that I liked and gave me a good deal on. I then got to meet with Noemi in financing, another down to earth friendly individual. Noemi was able to get me a really good rate and monthly payments that was exactly where I needed it to be. Drove off that evening satisfied with their great service and new vehicle. 

Unfortunately something went wrong with it 3 days later, and I had to have it towed back to the dealership and serviced. Abraham personally delivered it to my house the next day. 2 days later it broke down again, so I showed up at the dealership very frustrated and spoke to a sales manager named Tommy. He was very understanding when I explained the situation to him and how I was not comfortable with that car regardless if they were going to repair it again. He told me not to worry, and that I could start from scratch again and pick out a different vehicle. I didn't have time to do that right there and then because I needed to get to work, so he took me over to service where a nice attentive gentleman named Cedric put me in a loaner as quickly as he could so I could get to work. Several days later I was back at Don Hewlett and once again Abraham gave me a great deal on another Equinox, an LT this time. I then met with Noemi again in finance. She got me another great interest rate and was very apologetic, as was Abraham. I don't blame them - I understand that these things sometimes happen and am glad that I was very well taken care of the 2nd time around by Abraham and Noemi. I left very satisfied with my new vehicle, the great deal I got on it, and Abraham and Noemi's professionalism. 2nd time was a charm for me, and I highly recommend Don Hewlett Chevrolet, they will take care of you as they did me.

193,"February 20, 2019","Purchased a brand new (with 30 miles) 2015 Tahoe on December 31, 2014. Purchased the extended warranty -- 5 year / 100,000 miles. Over the next three years, took the Tahoe into the service dept about 4 times due to problems with the transmission / fuel lines.  Our vehicle would act like there was an air bubble in the gas line, it would act like a brief stall at times.  It was not consistent.  They claimed to have ""checked it out and found nothing"" each and every time.  In January of 2019 (and 117k miles), we discovered the problem, as our transmission went out on us, leaving us stranded in Dallas.  After discussing the issue with three different transmission shops, this is VERY common in the 8 speed automatic transmissions.  We have had the transmission replaced, and it is still acting the same as before.  :-(  

Prior to the transmission going out, we also had to have our air conditioner replaced, as it went out at 105k miles.  We also had to have the shocks replaced at about 80k miles (not under warranty, as shocks are excluded -- for a reason).  Come to find out, the shocks have metal pieces in them and thus cut the lining, which causes them to leak......also VERY common in Chevrolet vehicles such as the Tahoe.  

Of course, NONE of these problems are included in recalls, despite the known issues time and time again.  So I called the dealership, as I feel in our new cars today, 100k miles is ""just getting broke in"" -- and that was what the salesman told me also.  However, when Mike Hewlett called me (over 2 weeks after I left the message) to talk to me about it, his attitude was one of ""that's A LOT of miles"" and ""you got a LOT out of good use out that vehicle"".  I reminded him that I am still making payments on it, and did not feel that 100k miles was a lot.  He had a very arrogant and flippant attitude and had zero desire to make anything right in the matter.  

I will NEVER purchase another vehicle from this dealership, as I feel their service department just kept pushing me off until the warranty ran out.  As I read some other comments, it seems this is also a common practice at this dealership.

As to the problem with the transmission on the Silverado, I was given a we can’t find anything wrong with it and we will be happy to look again if it becomes a more regular problem.  Thus the no service, service appointment.

I was also told that they would have to talk to the quick lane service about not worrying customers about leaking shocks.  It seemed to me to be a don’t worry the customer about the problem while it’s under warranty approach, but that may just be my cynical nature coming out.",3.5

This happened with two different service reps. that I have dealt with before.  As a result I went elsewhere for service. The last time was with the express lube service.  After I left the service center I noticed that they had not checked the tire pressures which I suspect that they probably did not rotate the tires.  I checked the work order when I got home because I noticed that the mileage for the next oil change on the window sticker showed less mileage that when I went in for this oil change.  The paperwork also had the wrong license plate number on the work order.  It did have the correct address and name.  It makes me wonder if they actually changed the oil or just reset the computer.   Scott Nowling has done a wonderful job at setting up a good relationship between me and Don Hewlett which was excellent in the past.  Sorry, but three strikes and you are out.

But last week I took it in to get an State Inspection and they completed the job quickly. The Service Advisor asked if I wanted a Free Wash and I agreed. I assumed the service employee knew to turn off my sensor controlled windshield wipers. He did not and the water activated the windshield wipers. The Washer Brushes damaged one of my windshield wiper arms and I had to bring it back the next day to have it repaired. I did not use the wipers for a few days after the repair until my wife was driving in a small rain shower and when she returned home she told me that the driver side wiper would not clean the rain off of the windshield. I looked at the wiper blade and found the rubber had pulled out of the retainer in the middle of the blade. I removed the wiper blade and used a tool to reinsert the rubber blade back in the retainer and now the wiper works fine.,4.6

After some initial issues, they made sure that everything was working properly, and the Tahoe is now as good as new. Paul went the extra mile to keep me informed as they kept the Tahoe a day longer so his mechanics could randomly drive the vehicle to insure they had found the small issue giving me an error message. All the extra time spent on this repair was part of my initial repair I had already paid for. They stood behind their work and didn't stop until everything was right.

242,"October 29, 2018","We brought our Chevy Volt to Don Hewlett after having it at 2 other dealerships for service. The first flat out indicated they didn't have a trained tech, and the second dealership clearly didn't understand electric vehicles and the PHEV concepts. The team at this dealership, through Chance Newman, worked to troubleshoot a very difficult issue to reproduce. They spent a lot of time and engaged the appropriate field resources at GM to go above and beyond to try to resolve the issue. In the end, the issue first experienced has not since reproduced itself for them or myself, but I now again have trust in this vehicle and the Chevrolet network of service. The team worked with me while travelling and kept me up to date on their efforts, where clearly matched the OnStar trip diagnostics further adding to my confidence in what they were doing.

We engaged with Shannon while wandering around the lot scoping out future possibilities. He helped us look at some trucks, offered to let us take for a drive, and then applied no pressure to get us to do anything more that day since we clearly indicated this was for research purposed only right now.

266,"July 12, 2018","I referred this dealership to several friends and co-workers the day after I purchased my vehicle.  This is not the first time I purchased a vehicle from Don Hewlett.  My first experience was in 2006.  That experience was identical to this experience in that I researched vehicles online, was immediately contacted by a salesman, and followed up with a visit to the dealership.  From that first internet contact to closing the deal, I felt as if I was the only customer they had.  Here's what I liked about the dealership:  Walking into the dealership feels welcoming in that the cars (the product) are on display.  I've been in other dealerships where all you see is a bunch of people milling about.  Patriotic pictures (including Texana) are on display.  As a military veteran, that appealed to me.  Everything is immaculately clean and in good repair.  The receptionist was friendly and greeted me promptly.  Carl Staves, who started out as my salesman, became my new friend.  As a senior citizen, I have purchased many new cars and I abhor the negotiating process.  The salesmen always seemed to be the ""middle man"".  I've gotten to the point where I just want to deal with the manager and not have to go through the middle man.  However, the industry doesn't work that way.  This is the first time I EVER felt like the salesman represented my interests fairly to the manager.  I felt like Carl was fighting for me to get the best price possible.  Carl did not use clichés like ""what can I do to earn your business"" or ask ""if I can get the price right, are you ready to buy today"".  Had he done so, it would have interfered with the process because I would have tuned him out.  Because he didn't, I felt like an individual being listened to.  He took the time to patiently demonstrate features on the car.  This is very important because there is so much technology on the vehicle and it can be overwhelming to senior citizens.  This example alone is important enough to refer all senior citizens to him to buy their next new car.  After the purchase, Carl followed up with me several times to ensure I had everything I needed and to answer questions, which of course I had.  This proves that the sale doesn't stop once the contract is signed.  The finance personnel, Jeff Grazioplene and Buddy Shepperd, were great and did not resort to high pressure sales tactics.  Neither did they ""sulk"" when I declined their products.  I purchased accessories from Jerred and he was very informative about the products and also offered fair pricing.  I would like to add that I do not live near this dealership but the way I was treated and the price I got - including the price of my trade-in vehicle - was worth the distance it took to drive there.  This purchase was an expensive one and the most important thing I can say is that the deal was great, I was treated fairly, and I walked away a very happy customer.  Happy customers make more happy customers.  ",5.0

Then all the problems started, got to finance  and the numbers didn't match the deal, finally got that taken care of and papers sign. Then It was time to get with the salesperson and get the keys and remote fobs and was told they could not find the second key, fobs or the owners manual and would have them for me the next day and I would get a phone call when they were ready to be picked up. So when I did hear from the salesperson I decided to send him, the general sales manager a email to try to get someone to get back in touch about my not have keys to my new truck. I finally called to talk to the salesperson or one of the sales managers but no luck they were all busy, finally the salesperson call and was told he still didn't  have my key and would have them the next day at noon. So I went in  and the salesperson was not there and was told the make ready manager had key and would take care of it. So I hand it to the make ready manger for jumping through hoops to make sure our visit as painless as possible, very nice guy to deal with unlike any of the sales team which I hope to never have to deal with again. A truck or car should never be sold if the key can not be located. If I would have know this truck had no keys and fobs i would not have signed the papers. I think the sales team only interest is making sales no matter what. I will never buy from this dealership!!!!!! And any body reading this beware ask to see all the keys before signing papers.

289,"April 16, 2018","I was working with Carl Staves and Steven Lawrence on a 2016 GMC canyon for my wife.  Carl and Steven are both very responsive to requests,  and much to my delight,  they,  and the dealership,  are extremely transparent. there are no forced dealer additions here, either.  That's a big plus in my book.

These guys are the EXACT OPPOSITE of the ""old school"" car salesman philosophy of ""screw the customer out of every penny for a little extra in my commission check"". You will not have anyone play games with you here.  They will not throw your trade in keys on the roof to wear you down to get a deal.

Here's what you will experience: Your sales team member will be a customer advocate for you.  They actually strive to get you the best possible deal they can. If you need space to discuss decisions,  they will respect you and give you space. The Hewletts ""get it"" and understand what it takes to sell a car in 2018(I even had a chance to meet Mike Hewlett.  Nice guy.).

They will make sure that you are happy,  and well taken care of.  I hate buying a car because of what a long process it is.  We spent 5 and a half hours here on saturday(after driving 3 hours from Houston,  mind you) and it didn't feel like it at all.  They even made my 5 year old daughter feel welcome,  rather than an inconvenience.

Jeff didn't force warrantys down our throats,  either. I've never in my life bought an extended warranty,  but I felt that the value of what F&I was offering was both fair and valuable. Again,  he was transparent and straightforward.  I know he/they made money on the warrantys we bought and I have no issue with it whatsoever.

Sure,  we didn't walk away with the 2016 GMC canyon,  but after discussing it with my wife,  we ended up purchasing a 2017 silverado that was a demo unit.

353,"August 28, 2017",So in 2015 I came to Don Hewlett to buy my wife a new Suburban.  At that time my salesman was BBQ. I was so happy with everything that about a week later I was back to buy myself a new Z71 Silverado.  I was blown away by the deals and the quickness of both purchases that I decided that Don Hewlett would be my dealership for any future car/truck business.  Ahead two years to August 2017.  My wife and I decided that we would help our daughter purchase a newer dependable vehicle.  I called Don Hewlett and ask to speak with BBQ and was a bit disappointed to learn he did not work there anymore.  I spoke with a salesman and explained that we were looking for a used Suburban for our daughter because she operated a child care and needed the third row seating.  Since she had never applied for any credit I would be co-signing the loan.  Shortly I was contacted by Shaun who said they had just what I wanted and ask when would I like to see it.  I told him this afternoon.  When we got to the dealer the Suburban was parked in front of the building ready for our test drive.  I was not happy with the condition of the tires so Shaun spoke to his manager and they put brand new Goodyear tires on it without changing the asking price of the vehicle.  They also replaced all the brake pads on the vehicle. Wow talk about going above and beyond!  Jeff in finance really came through for us with finance as well.  I will be a Don Hewlett customer forever!,5.0
354,"August 28, 2017","We were finally allowed to sit in Marty's office after we agreed to purchase the vehicle. After about 5 minutes of printing the paperwork (The only work he did for this sale) we signed the agreement, and we were quickly ushered out of the office so he could meet with his next potential sale. 

While my wife and I sat in the lobby for an hour waiting to finalize the financing, Marty had one more request from us. Since he was so busy helping other people, he had no time to get the cars odometer reading on a sale he was getting commission for. So rather than walk outside, in hurricane weather, he decided he would ask his customer to do it...At this point I was ready to walk out, or start the whole process over with a new salesman. 

Not sure if this is how Don Hewlett wants their customers to be treated, but to be honest, this left a terrible taste in my mouth, and I will never be back to place ever again!

355,"August 25, 2017","Coming from another dealership in Spring Texas where the sales person was arrogant and slightly rude, I called Neil from Hewlett as we drove back to Austin. He answered all my questions on a used vehicle, even went out to rinse it off to check body condition for me before I made the drive there after such a long journey already. When we arrived the truck was everything he said it was, no hidden surprises and a perfect fit for our family.

357,"August 16, 2017","We purchased a used vehicle at the end of July. As part of the purchase there were 3 things that the dealership said they would fix. One being a back passenger door that didn't open from the outside. After they ""fixed"" the door and we drove off my daughter noticed that the same door now wouldn't open from the inside. We contacted the salesman and we agreed that they would fix it at the time they fixed the other two items. So about a week later we were called to come in to have the vehicle fixed. My husband took a day off work to get it taken care of. The vehicle stayed at the dealership all day getting fixed. When we picked it up we checked the door and it was still not fixed. We were told we would have to bring the car back in order to have it fixed. Our salesman apologized and said that when we brought it in he would put gas in the car and have it cleaned up. Great we thought that was fair. So fast forward to today when the car was taken in to get fixed. I got there and the service representative said he was going to try to have it done today and they could provide me with a ride home. I was fine with that when I was called to the shuttle along with two males. I was told they would be taking me home first but because of one of the other parties having to go to work I was bumped to the second stop. The paper with my address and all the other addresses of those who had been in that shuttle that day was sitting in the open for anyone to see. As we got to traveling it dawned on me that I was going to be dropped off at my house in front of two complete strangers. Your policies need to be updated to protect your customers or you need to make it clear that you don't do anything to protect address information and location of your customers who use the shuttle. As we were traveling down my street I was notified that the vehicle was ready. So the shuttle did a u turn and brought me back to the dealership. The service representative told me he was trying to get authorization for the gas and clean up that was promised to us. I sat there in the waiting room for an additional HOUR after the car was ""ready"". The service representative was not able to get the salesman to return his calls and the sales manager wouldn't authorize the gas or clean up until the salesman called back. At that point I just wanted to leave. So they brought my vehicle to me. I didn't get the gas or clean up promised to me due to the inconvenience of having to bring it back multiple times and when I got in the car I noticed red paint transfer of the driver side door like a car door was open into it. I honestly feel like since we purchased a used car we were not a priority... I feel like after we signed the sales agreement we were no longer a priority... It's hard to get phone calls returned and promises were not followed through with. ",2.0

382,"May 31, 2017","I drove all the way from Houston to purchase my 2015 Mazda 6.  Ronnie was wonderful making sure we were ok on the road reassuring us that he still have the vehicle and when we got there made things as easy as possible, including the test drive and getting our trade in value taken care of right away.  I do remember another gentleman that came in and talked to us about scotch guard and other add on products no of which we wanted or purchased.  
Here is what I had an issue with while in your dealership.  While we were present, there was a lot of ""Shop talk"" that I being in customer service deem inappropriate to have especially while customers are present.  Though the other individuals seemed oblivious to the fact that the nickname calling that they had for Ronnie it appeared to us that it kinda hurt his feeling being picked on so much.  I would hate for your dealership to loss one of your valuable team members of this type of behavior.  I also did not need to know how drunk the staff has gotten at various events including an incident with someone falling out of a golf cart.  If I had not just driven all the way from Houston I would have left and found what I was looking for else where.
Now to your Finance offer Jeff.  I understand how auto financing works with dealership up selling the rate to make more money but lets get real you have a customer with an over 800 credit score and you say that BOA can get them at 4.25% then when the customer questions the rate you forget that you said that BOA would give them that rate then you say ""oh look BOA just came in with a 2.65%."" give me a break.  Secondly hard selling the warranties your dealership offers to make more commission and then when told that a warranty would be purchased else where bashing the Credit Unions and what they have to offer (warranty and otherwise) especially when a Manager of a Credit Union is on the other side of the desk.
Once again I will say if I had not driven all the way from Houston to Austin for the car and if it were not for Ronnie I would have never purchased an auto from your dealership.  Best wishes to your company.",4.0

You say what you want and they all work as a team to make it happen. Ronnie Bradford in sales has helped me with my last three purchases and he calls to check in when I have to go in for service to make sure everything is okay. The finance department is great. Always respectful of your time and they make sure you aren't overwhelmed during a deal.

414,"January 20, 2017","Terrible service at the ""Service"" center.

Key fob failure under warranty replacement, and pairing to truck.
Appointment made 24 hours in advance by phone for 10:40am the following day. The next day, I showed up slightly early at 10:30, got assigned a ""consultant"", John Jarvis, who tried a couple of quick fixes but fob was dead. Not the battery as I had tested it.

Car went into queue on time at 10:40 and I left my cell as I walked around used lot, then went to waiting room. 1.5 hour later still no sign of progress; had to get rep paged to get an update: only at that point was the car even being worked on.

20 mins later still chasing, found the guy, finally complete. Got the new fob in a baggie, not even bothering to add to keyring. Warranty cards to be mailed out as they wanted to get me out of there ""quickly""!

Now everyone has a bad day and things go wrong but must have spoken to 4 people during this time and not one really cared. Not a happy workplace, nobody smiling. Would never consider going back unless for this one part, certainly would never consider buying a car from them.",1.2

I had a routine oil change and my right rear view mirror replaced. Which I would like to add the part was in stock. My service advisor was Mindy, I informed her that my Chevy Avanlanche was my only means of transportation and to let me know when my cars done to send a shuttle driver. She told me the service would take ""a couple hours."" My last phone call was at 545pm asking Mindy if she could just send a shuttle driver to pick me up and I would just wait the rest out in the lobby. She firmly told me they closed at 6pm and no shuttle service was provided. She then stated I would need to find a way there. HELLO, I just told you earlier in the day this was my only ride. She then stated she would pick me up and then changed her mind because payment couldn't be made that way. I asked for a supervisor. His name was Zeke and he insured me he would take care of me and that they would come pick me up. Once I got there they took my payment and shook my hand goodbye.

I drove over the next day to look at the car and take a test drive. The Mustang was used, but had very low mileage and was exactly what I was looking for. Carl put no pressure on me to purchase the car, he left the decision totally up to me. I made an over, Carl presented the offer and called me back with a counter-offer, which I accepted. My sister purchased a new Buick from Carl the same day, since I had recommended him to her and since Hewlett gave her such a great deal.

433,"November 04, 2016","My husband took his car here because it kept shutting down on him. He told them what he believed to be wrong with it and gave them our warranty info. They came back and said it was carbon in the throttle up which of course wouldn't be covered under our warranty with a minimal deductible and that it would cost us $175.00 for them to fix it. My husband told them he didn't believe that was all it was but if that worked great, BUT asked (Mindy) if it continued to happen would he get his money back or get what was actually wrong with it fixed. She told him he would absolutely get taken care of if the problem was not fixed and when he asked for it in writing she told him they could not do that but not to worry because they would definitely work something out with him.  Of course 1 day later it has happened again and when my husband called they told him sorry, but we can look at it again for free but were not giving you your money back and when we figure out what is wrong with it you will have to pay for it, they told him there was nothing they could do because they don't know if they could recreate the problem anyway. (keep in mind my husband told them there was NO hurry) 

This is ridiculous if you can not figure out what is wrong with someone's car why charge for some BS reason that you knew was not going to fix the problem and if you didn't know it would help maybe you should have some more training. We have moved away from our home state of Michigan from people we trust with our cars and a step dad who use to work on them to Texas (which I love) but to people we can not trust that are not doing their jobs and keeping their words. Unfortunately this is why mechanics get horrible reputations.

439,"October 11, 2016","Took my new Camaro in for service. Service advisor contacted me that they would need to keep my car overnight. I get a call from the owner Mike Hewlett the next day saying that the dealership was broken into and the wheels and tires were stolen from my vehicle and there was body damage as well. He stated that the police were called and he needed to put wheels and tires on my car to get it over to the body shop for an estimate. The next day he leaves a voicemail that he has an estimate for the repairs, I was thinking why do I need an estimate just get my car fixed and I'll pick it up when ready. I returned his call and he called me the next day stating he needed me to contact my insurance and file a claim as he had a signed waiver releasing him from any liability due to loss or theft. He said he wanted me to be out of pocket the least as possible. I couldn't believe this was getting placed on me and my insurance company. I told him how is this my fault, he said this certainly wasn't his fault and seemed more annoyed that his fence was damaged. I asked him how about just doing the right thing and fixing my car and he just blew me off and complained about his damaged fence. 

I contacted my insurance company and they sent an adjuster over to look at the vehicle. I told the adjuster if I had to file a claim there was no way I wanted to Don Hewlett to do the repairs and make a potential profit off of me and my insurance company. The adjuster contacted me and said he looked the car over and spoke with Mike Hewlett and he was adamant that he wasn't assuming any liability for the loss and damage to my vehicle. I contacted Mike just to clarify his stance and he stated he did not negotiate with insurance companies and he had a signed waiver that he was not liable for the damages. He did offer to pay my deductible if I had the repairs performed at his dealership. I told him I would talk to my insurance company and think it over. 

I received a text message late in the day from my service advisor asking if I wanted her to order the wheels. I didn't respond as I thought a phone call would have been more professional considering the situation. She ended up calling me the next day, I asked if I could take the car to another body shop and get a second estimate which she didn't think was possible as they had put their wheels and tires on my vehicle. I stated to her that I wasn't happy with that I had to file a claim with my insurance company and Mike Hewlett's arrogant attitude and that he was more concerned about his fence than the damage to my vehicle. I told her that even if he paid my deductible he was still making a profit off the parts and body shop repairs to which she replied most likely.

I thought about the situation and just couldn't get over Mike Hewlett's arrogance and his handling of the whole situation. He made a bad situation worse. I decided I would pay the deductible myself and have my car repaired at another shop. I went to the dealership the following day with a borrowed set of wheels a floor jack and a lug wrench. I told her I wanted to pick up my car and had wheels and tires with me, I stressed to her I didn't want to talk to any manager and especially Mike Hewlett as I just wanted my car and no confrontation. I told her I could change the wheels in the parking lot or out in the street after waiting an hour she came back to me she said they would swap the wheels for me as they didn't want me to damage theirs. 

In all honesty I cannot recommend Don Hewlett Chevrolet to anyone. I already have two friends that were considering buying trucks that will go elsewhere and a good friend who's fleet manager of a neighboring city that will not use Don Hewlett for parts or service for their 60+ Chevrolets. I'm sure Mike Hewlett could care less about losing my business or the cities fleet as he is to busy stepping over a dollar to collect a nickel.",1.0
440,"October 05, 2016","We had a grandchild's ball game so we got to the dealership just before closing.  I had communicated with Ronnie Bradford on line about availability of 2016 Traverse's.  He was with a customer when we got there so a Mr. Doss took us into his office and we  visited with him and then he took us out in the lot and showed us two of the 2016 models.  When Mr. Bradford was available, we went into his office.  By this time, it was closing time but Mr. Bradford took all the time we needed, answered any and all questions we had.  He offered us bottled water and made us feel very comfortable even though I am sure he wanted to go home.  We gave him a check for the car and whle he was completing the paperwork, Mr. McCleney took us into his office to do our warranty papers, etc.  He was an absolute blast and kept us laughing the whole time.  We were all tired by this time, but, we forgot our tiredness visiting with Mr. McCleney.  It probably took much longer than necessary but we were all having a good time!  Afterwards, Mr. Bradford took us out to the car and went through every detail with me.  He set up my OnStar and gave me a complete run through on the radio, etc.  I know he was tired, because we were tired.  It was 9:00 pm before we left the dealership and Mr. Bradford had to lock up but never made us feel rushed and wanted to make sure all our questions were answered.  He assured us we could call him anytime with questions and he would be happy to answer them and if he couldn't help us, he would direct us to someone who could.

441,"October 03, 2016","We purchased a used HD 2500, took it in to have the oil changed. When we got the truck back the technician failed to put the oil cap back on. The second time we took the truck in to have the oil changed, they did not tighten the oil filter and we had oil splatter all over our vehicle. Fast forward to our next vehicle, we bought a used ford f-150, we took the truck in a few days after purchase to have new tires put on and complained about ignition issues however they could not find anything wrong with it. Fast forward 7 months we took the truck in for the ignition issue again to a ford dealership as Hewlett said since it was a ford they could not properly diagnosis the truck. During the service repair many other issues were discovered to be wrong with the vehicle. The timing chain had slack in it (stretched out), the ignition switch was faulty and needed to be replaced, the rear door lock was not functioning, the battery needed to be replaced, the spark plugs needed to be replaced, and the coolant system had a leak. I do not feel in the 7 months we've had the truck we should be dealing with this many issues, some of which we complained about when we purchased the truck. To be honest based on our last experience we would not have purchased another truck from Hewlett, however they had the specific truck we were looking for. We have extended family that has purchased many vehicles from Hewlett, which is why we ended up here in the first place. However we have ONLY been continually disappointed with the service we received here. I did speak with Mike Hewlett in the service dept. who basically informed me that with used vehicles you take some degree of risk and that is why you should buy an extended warranty. We have purchased extended warranties with ALL of our vehicles and have NEVER used them. Based on our past service experience I do not have any faith in the service dept. at Hewlett, I feel they missed many of these issues during their inspection of the vehicle, I was told my Mr. Hewlett that they would be willing to look at the vehicle to examine the coolant leak however we would most likely be responsible for paying for at least a portion of the repair and he would not agree to pay the $319.61 we paid out of our pocket to have the other issues repaired. We also have not replaced the spark plugs or battery. Bottom line - stay away from the service dept. We will not be returning, nor will our family and friends. I don't feel Mr. Hewlett offered us a satisfactory resolution to this issue. Now we need to come up with the money to repair the other issues.

Update 10/3/2016 (issues still unresolved) I have spoken to Mike Hewlett again. He informed me that I should have purchased a new vehicle to avoid these issues we are having now. I told him that our family could not afford new vehicles, and that these repairs (again some we complained about 2 days after purchase) were difficult for us to cover financially. Then he insulted me by saying ""we should live within our means"" Is this REALLY how you treat customers???? Our family does not have the government to bail us out, we are ultimately responsible for our bills. My husband and I own 2008 Toyota with over 100 k miles on it, (paid for) and my son drives a 2007 ford f-150 with over 100 k miles on it (paid for) both of which we keep maintained and we have not have any issues with. Further more we both have 800 plus credit ratings. Mr. Hewlett we do live within our means, THANK YOU!!! People do yourself a favor stay away from this dealership at ALL costs!! Take your business elsewhere, they do not value their customers, and their service department is deplorable.

463,"July 07, 2016","I hate having to take my vehicle in for service because I normally have to deal with being told that I ""must"" get additional services for my car and the hard push for me to agree to it. I scheduled my 2016 Suburban for its first oil change and took it in this morning. The great service started from the moment I stepped out of my vehicle in the service drive-up. I regret not getting the name of the gentleman that greeted me there and walked me (didn't just point) inside to where I needed to wait for David McKnight, with whom my service was scheduled. David was working with another customer at the time. The other advisor sitting at the desk next to David's (again, I regret not getting his name) quickly finished whatever he was working on and said he could get me checked in so I didn't have to keep waiting. He said they would get it started and that it would be about an hour for the work to be completed and asked if I knew where the waiting room was (I did). 

Just a little over an hour later, David came to the waiting area to let me know my Suburban was done. Although I had been very pleased with the service and had no complaints, he apologized for not being available when I got there. I feel like all three of these employees were focused on providing good customer service. I'm quite surprised at some of the recent bad reviews I read because I had a completely different experience and wanted to make sure I shared that. I plan to continue getting my vehicle serviced at Hewlett even beyond the first two scheduled maintenance visits that came with my purchase.

Also, when I purchased my vehicle  months ago, I also purchased after-market running boards that open when the vehicle door opens. Twice, the puddle light by the driver's door has come loose and dangles down under the vehicle. Both times, I have brought it back in and it was quickly taken care of without any issues. I neglected to write a review then and wanted to mention the great service I received that time as well.",4.8
464,"June 30, 2016","I have visited this service center twice and each time they were unsatisfactory.  Firts time I asked for the android auto update installation but they did not know what it was and when they looked into it for over 30 min I was told the dealership that sold me the car was suppose to install it. Not true. Went to Autonation and they knew what to do and did it in a timely manner. The second time, I got a nail in a performance run flat tire. They said it could not be repaired and I would have to buy a new tire. Called the dealer where I purchased the car and was told that discount tire would be able to fix it. Took it to discount tires and was told it was repairable. They fixed it witout issues. I will not attempt to take my 2016 camaro in the future to this chevorlet service center for any type of maintenance or repair because I no longer trust their advice.",2.3

They both were very upfront about their procedures and I left feeling confident that I got a good deal.

I found that Phillip Davis at Don Hewlett Chevrolet was very patient with my process of narrowing down my selection criteria. There was no pressure to steer me toward a particular make, model or body style. In a week's time I made four trips back to Don Hewlett Chevrolet and Phillip was there every time to help me out. It was nice not to have to re-explain what I was looking for.  On the last visit I had my credit union papers in order and Phillip arranged to complete the sale quickly and I drove the vehicle home that afternoon. It was a pleasant, no pressure car buying experience.

It was used but when they pulled it up after I bought it the truck was really dirty on the inside and they didn't fill it with gas.

487,"March 27, 2016","DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE DEPARTMENT!!!!  THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT IS NOT THE SALES DEPARTMENT!!!!

I've not had any issues with the sales department other than minor paperwork issue one time.

I've bought three vehicles from them and every one of them has had issues which should have been easy fixes and ended up with multi trips for every one of them. Now that I think of it, not one of my issues was ever completely fixed. I just gave up on trying to get them fixed. 

They are polite and easy to talk to. But that's where all the goodness stops.

My last visit ended our relationship period. 

I have a black 2013 Camaro I truly love. I've taken great care of this car. It's NEVER been through an automatic car wash. I waxed it the week I took it in for another repeat issue. I have NEVER let the dealer wash my car, EVER. I didn't have them was it the day I bought it new. This time they washed it before I got there. It was covered in water marks, half-assed washed and COMPLETELY COVERED IN SCRATCHES like they used sandpaper to wash it! I was so pissed off I didn't even go back inside to raise xxxx about it. 

Upon reflection, I was told the car would be kept inside as much as possible. It seems the shoty car wash was intended to make me think it had been kept inside all the time. I understand they run a business and indoor space makes good money, not good parking. I would have rather had the car pulled around while covered in dust rather than to have had it washed at all, and I've told them as much in the past. 

I've filed a formal complaint with Chevy about it. I've never been satisfied with this service department and there is nothing they can do to salvage this relationship at this point. I'm normally very forgiving, but I'm done at this point.

If you're car is nothing more than something to get you from point A to point B, you still wouldn't be happy with this service department.

488,"March 22, 2016","GM sent me here to fix a Cadillac recall issue, literally a 15 min repair on my keys. I was bounced around to 4 different people in various departments throughout the Hewlett business and gave my contact info and VIN to all. I answered no to all 4 that I had not been to the service dept. I finally get a very nice lady, Sheila to make an appt for the next day..I expected about an hour wait in the service dept.
 The Hewlett complex is a maze of buildings along an interstate frontage road and they don't all connect...needless to say it took me awhile and another phone call to find my way to the correct complex. Had I known there were so many to chose from I would have asked.
I finally find the service dept. There are about a dozen associates awaiting customers and I go to my assigned person. No one says a thing to to me so after waiting in front of her empty cubicle I say why I am there...they page my assoc. I wait some more...they page her again... I wait some more and ask the guy if she is the only one that can help. So he looks through her clip board ( sorry I bothered him) and finds my name and asks me my contact info..uh again. 
So she finally comes from the back and she asks where my car is and needs to find out what parts are needed...hmmmm spent a half hour yesterday doing all this.

So she takes a me to a pristinly clean and very comfortable waiting area. 20 min later she comes to ask me which key to use because they can't start my car...I say all of them start the car...but they don't need my car for this repair.
An hour and 20 min after that everyone in the waiting room has come and gone except me.

I get up and go ask about the car and all 12 idle associates are staring me down and my associates begins a rundown of the delays some of which she blames on me because I didn't park near the service area..she didn't have my info including my VIN ( why they needed to go find my car). All they had to do was walk 10 feet to ask me for the info I gave to 4 people just yesterday to set up up this repair appt.

Here is what I learned..the looks of the place scream the highest degree of professionalism and customer service yet only one person actually said ""Hello how are you"" and was genuine about it and that was the custodian cleaning the floor; and that I was inconveniencing the whole staff with a recall repair.

My reasons for purchasing exclusively with Don Hewlett include the feeling of being treated fairly, familiarity with the sales personnel, and being able to conclude the sales in a timely way. As long as these issues hold up, I'll probably continue to buy my new vehicles at this location.

The only reservation I have in the process of purchasing a new vehicle is the valuation of the trade-in vehicle.

498,"February 03, 2016","I recently bought a 2016 Chevy Malibu from Don Hewlett Chevrolet-Buick in Georgetown, TX. My salesman was Brandon Luther. I spotted the car I wanted on their website and requested a test drive and quote. Brandon contacted me very soon after and although the car I wanted had not yet arrived, Brandon arranged for me to test drive a similarly equipped Malibu and I was thoroughly impressed, not only with the car but with Brandon's knowledge of the car's features and the relaxed manner in which he dealt with me. This was my first time getting a new car (or any car) in 10 years and this was also the first time that I was going to go the leasing route instead of buying and Brandon's professionalism made this an enjoyable experience.

There was one hiccup in that when my car arrived, it was discovered during the inspection that it had a leaky freeze plug which needed to be replaced. Problem was that this model car was so recently released that the part wasn't in stock and had to come from GM which at the time was experiencing blizzard conditions. Bottom line is that although it took a week longer than expected for me to receive delivery, I was thoroughly impressed with the service department's service which included staying late one night to make sure the part was installed correctly.

By the time I received my Malibu, I was certain that it was in perfect operating condition and Brandon was very thorough in going over all of the car's systems and electronics to make sure I knew how to use all these new gadgets which are new to me.

Have never had a problem with comfort of the seats but obviously the new Tahoes have been redesigned with less comfortable seating. we Traded our 2013 Tahoe for the 2016, the seats in the new Tahoe are much harder with less cushion and cause my wife a lot of pain. After just driving it home and the next morning she had a pinched nerve. Called the dealer back early the very next day after purchase asking if there was some way we could return this vehicle and look into something else. They refused and didn't seem to care about my wife's health at all. Saying the deal was done, sorry. 
We've done a lot of business with Don Hewlett and never expected they would not even help work with us to find something my wife can comfortably drive without pain. But I guess it's all about the money not really the customer satisfaction. So now we have a brand new vehicle she cannot drive.
We also have specialty license plates that should have been taken off the old Tahoe and put on the new Tahoe. When my wife asked the dealer about doing that he said they no longer do that.

507,"December 01, 2015","I took my 2012 Chevy Camaro, still under factory warranty in to this service center because it completely died on me for no reason after a doctor's appointment. There was no reason for the car to die... no lights or radios were left on and it was running fine with no issues just minutes before it went dead. I was told by this service center that it was just a dead battery, probably because of the cold weather, and that they would replace the battery for free and send me on my way. At the time, I did not realize that my factory warranty was going to run out only 4 months later. Sure enough, several months later, after my warranty ended, my Camaro died yet again. Same circumstances as there was no reason whatsoever for it to keep dieing (no lights left on, not running it without the ignition on, etc.). So I called this service center back & had it towed in a second time. I'm told, once again, that the battery was just dead, so they charged the battery & sent me back on my way. This happened several times. Car dies for no reason, they charge the battery and send me home. A battery should not go dead after only 6 months of use unless something is drawing the charge out of it... that is not normal & even if it was, it should be covered under the battery warranty regardless. This last time it died (number 4), I had it towed in and was promptly told that my factory warranty was now out, but my extended warranty was now in place, that the battery they replaced months earlier was no longer any good, it wouldn't hold a charge, and it would cost me $275 for a new battery cause the extended warranty doesn't cover batteries. When I asked about the battery itself having a warranty, beings it's only several months old, they said because it was put in under the factory warranty, it won't be covered and I would have to pay full price for another brand new battery. I asked them to look at the car and find out why the battery is being drained, it was obviously NOT a battery issue. They said okay. They had my car for 2 days with no call back telling me what they found out. So I finally called THEM back the day before Thanksgiving and was told, once again, that the battery is no good and they will put in a new one for $275. When I insisted that the battery was not the problem and asked them to figure out what is drawing the battery down, they said they'd have to keep it for 3 days, then test it for any problems, so I brought it back in the Monday after Thanksgiving and after 2 days was told, yet again, that the battery was no good and I would have to pay $275 for a new one cause its no longer covered by my warranty. Fed up and deciding that I could get the best battery on my own for far less, I picked up my car from the dealership and took it straight to the local Autozone along with my step-dad who is also a retired mechanic to buy a new battery. Before buying the new battery the dealership said I needed, the mechanic at Autozone along with my dad tested the ""old"" battery to see if it was a bad battery unable to hold a charge like the dealership said... and to my non-amazement, the battery was fine! No defect like Jason from the service department told me it had. First, I was lied to in order for my factory warranty to run out, then I was lied to again now that I'm on my extended warranty in hopes that they can put off finding out the real problem after all my warranties run out. DO NOT TAKE YOUR CAR HERE FOR WARRANTY WORK!! They are liars. So I am now going to take it to a servie center with a good customer rating that can find the REAL problem that's draining all these batteries BEFORE my extended warranty runs out. I wish I had checked it out before my factory warranty ran out because whatever is wrong with it SHOULD have been covered by that warranty back in January when the problem began. There is no honesty at this dealership and I will tell everyone I know NOT to take their vehicles here for any service work. And when I look to upgrade from the 2012 Camaro to the newer Supersport model, I will NOT go to this dealership for my future purchases, nor will I ever purchase a warranty from these people again. I bought every extra warranty with all the bells & whistles with this car and this is the 3rd warranty I have tried to use that has turned out to be a worthless waste of hard earned money. ",1.2

511,"November 17, 2015","This review is for warranty coverage on a 2014 Silverado 1500 truck but it applies equally to the GMC Sierra. We're talking about a fully loaded $42k+ MSRP vehicle when you include all the accessories.

After approx. 15 months and 10,000 miles - the paint has started peeling off the bottom of the passenger front door. There is a GM bulletin that explains this defect is on ALL of the Silverado's and Sierra's built at the Ft Wayne plant up until mid May 2015.

IF YOU OWN A 2014 SILVERADO OR SIERRA KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE DOORS/FENDERS ALONG THE CHIP GUARD FOR PEELING PAINT!! REPORT IMMEDIATELY BEFORE YOU REACH 3YRS/36K MILES.

They are not willing to fix all the areas where the defect exists - only where there is a visual failure (the paint starts peeling - it peels more with every car wash). GM's intent is to ignore the areas they admit have the defect in hopes that the peeling doesn't start until after the vehicle passes the 3yr/36k mile coverage for the paint and then they wont do squat.

There is also blotchy dark spots and streaks in the Silver Ice Metallic paint where the primer is showing through the thinnest of base color coats I've ever seen. Hewlett is making it very difficult to get this resolved. The body shop told me to call Chevrolet, they were useless, no one returned my calls, on one of my calls to Chevrolet they said that I was to get in contact with the Cust. Exper. Mgr. and I asked why I had to drive this - why isn't he contacting me - they said to just go in and speak with him, he understands the root cause of the peeling and will address the inconsistent color in the paint.

I go in, he won't see me, has a service rep try to hand me a phone number to ""call him later"" and this is 3 weeks into this process!! I've had enough, I block their service lanes until someone will assist me with a frickin $42k truck that has paint peeling off the doors and the paint that sticks to the truck has blotchy spots/streaks.

Never again will we buy from Hewlett and very likely never again buy Chevrolet or GM. You would think GM had figured out how to handle their known defects in vehicles after the recent PR crisis they faced ... but nooooo.",1.0

I walked in right to Jeff, it's funny they thought I was delivering.  I said I need to buy a new car and I only have 30 minutes (lunch).  We sat down talked a bit about my credit and finances then looked at some cars.  
     I had to go back to work but Jeff and I texted back and forth any info that he needed from me.  The next day I was off from work drove to Georgetown and an hour later a proud new owner of a 2013 Equinox.  I couldn't be happier with my new car and the service that Jeff provided.

My two girls were treated like princesses and not once did we feel like they were an inconvenience to the staff. WHICH IS SAYING A LOT!!!! 
    My only issue that bothers me is being assessed with a ""dealer tax"" (to compensate for THEIR inventory)  and ""documentary fee"" that totaled nearly $200. BOTH are NOT required to be added to the cost of the vechile. If they had been explained  I would have payed  those fees rather than FINANCE them.
     The first offer on my trade in was a bit low.  When I said I had been offered $500 more at another dealership, they countered with a very fair amount, which I appreciated. Still, if I hadn't been on my toes I would have lost out by $600 on my paid off trade in.
   In closing.. no matter how fabulous and wonderful the customer service is... this is a car dealership.. read the fine print.
     Don't buy the extra warranty!!! If it's offered you don't need it... if it is not offered DON'T buy that vechile!

525,"October 16, 2015","Hello,
Let me start off by saying I absolutely love my 2011 Chevy Duramax 2500 HD (92k miles)
but I am writing you to one voice my concern about a problem I am having and complain about a dealership and how they handled the situation. 
My truck went in the shop at Don Hewlett Chevy Georgetown Texas on 10/8/2015, it just wasn't acting right and sometime blew white smoke so while it was in the shop they did not find anything on why it blows white smoke from time to time but there was a break switch and a fuel sensor that were not good anymore. of course neither were covered in the factory or extended warranty that was sold to me. I could only afford to do the break switch ($300) at the moment because the fuel sensor was going to be over $500. let me continue... while it was there I asked if they could do an oil change and air filter replacement as well since I recently had shoulder surgery due to an on duty injury as a firefighter and am not able to. When I received the truck back 10/09/2015 from being serviced I noticed a loud clanging noise coming from my truck and also noticed that they had spilled diesel exhaust fluid all over my engine. well let me tell you I wasn’t very happy … the service guy tried to tell me that the noise I now heard is “how diesels sound”… and that I would have to wait till Thursday of this week before they could look at it .. I told him as long as I have had the truck it has never made that sound before.. He was very disrespectful and an embarrassment to the Chevy name. Anyways they treated me like I’ve never seen a truck before in my life or have been around a diesel. They say they pride their self on customer service but I was treated terrible. I drove the truck back to service on 10/10/2015 so that they could figure out yet again why it’s doing what it’s doing. On 10/13/2015I was called “BOY” and said that I need to be quite and listen by some shop guy.. I then told him to get the manager. Which didn’t help either. I’d like someone to hear my story and to know this is how they treat people over at Don Hewlett. I have specific names if you’d like them.. 
 I had to remind them to clean the diesel exhaust fluid off of my engine that they spilled. I had to reset my oil range in my truck because they forgot, I had to remind him to check the factory warranty for the parts being serviced. They used ¼ of my fuel and got my driver side floor board dirty.
I take pride in my things and have worked very hard in my life to get the things I have including this truck. I was treated awful and now there is a loud noise that they refuse to look into fixing.

530,"September 26, 2015","All I wanted was an update to MyLink, if any, for my 2013 Camaro that I bought at Don Hewlett, so I made an appointment 6 days prior and stated what I wanted.  I know the 2014 can play .wav (lossless) audio via the USB, and my 2013 can only manage mp3.  Dennis started out well enough, he wanted to know if something was broken.  After explaining everything 3 times, he goes out to my car, says he needs to put a placard on my rear view mirror but my fuzz buster is in the way, and before I can even say anything, he pulls it off the mount with my wire that goes along the headline.  He then asks if I'm going to wait or if someone is going to pick me up, telling me it will take probably 4 or more hours to update, I ask why so long for a simple update, he says because X many cars are in front of me (it's 7:30 am).  And apparently, this is just to see if they can even figure out if there's an update for it... thanks for wasting my time, and gas, again.  I had a prior issue that they couldn't be bothered with for hours and Nyle Maxwell Service took care of it the same day.  So, I'm looking to Maxwell yet again to get service, and guess where I will be going the next time I buy a car.  In fact, I'm not even going to attempt Hewlett service ever again, 2 strikes and you're out.

From the first phone call with my salesman Ronnie to getting in the door and working with all the great people there.  The atmosphere in the show room is great.  There is no pressure to buy a vehicle, Ronnie spent his time informing us about the vehicle we wanted and made me and my wife feel at home - ""like family""  Everyone on the team was outstanding from the accessories team to the finance dept.  Jeff in the Financing department is outstanding - there was no pressure.  Steven in the accessories dept was great we picked a few upgrades there.

532,"September 18, 2015","I was dreading to look at new cars.  I hate when the salesman shuts you up in his office and when you can't make a deal, he calls his manager to come in and persuade you.  What a difference a salesman makes.  We were so lucky to get  Phil Davis.  Right away you feel at home with him and feel that he has your best interests at heart.  He showed us several cars and we didn't make a decision the first day.  Phil said ""fine"" and to think about it.  No manager was called in.  We did come back and bought a Buick Enclave. Phil took us around to meet the people who work at the dealership and whom we will be calling when we need service.  I felt like we had a ""car family"" now.  I asked Phil if I could call him if we had any problems and he said ""of course"".  We have had no problems but I have called him and arranged a meeting with him.  We needed some help to show us how to use all the new ""things"" that are  in the car.  He spent a couple of hours with us showing us how to use the many ""tools""-------we also had some good laughs, too.  Phil is just a really nice guy and one you like to think o f as a friend.  He is a great asset to Hewlett Chevrolet Buick.  He made buying a car a very ""fun"" experience for me and my husband.",4.8
533,"September 12, 2015","First let me say that everyone's time is important. Something like a service visit or oil change is never fun, as it always has to be scheduled around. When someone has to adjust their schedule and make time to make sure that their very expensive vehicle they bought is serviced, the last thing you want is for someone to disrespect your time. In a customer service based business, it is just unacceptable.

I purchased a 2015 Chevy Silverado back in May. I was told at the time that I had 2 years or 4 visits for free oil change and service on my vehicle. I was sent an email asking if I would like to schedule an appointment for my first service. I went through the online set up and set an appointment for 7:40am on a Saturday morning. The main reason for such an early appointment is that I have 3 kids and there always seems to be something going on. When I arrived, I was told to deal with some guy named Joe. He seemed very frazzled, and just started filling out some paperwork. He asked me if I was going to wait for my vehicle, I explained no that my wife was picking me up and that I would be back by 9:15am. He acted like that would not be a problem. He made a note of that and told me he may not be there when I come back to pick up my vehicle, but it would be ready and I could deal with the cashier directly. I arrived at 9:05am, walked in to pick up my truck, Joe was not there, the other reps did not have a clue what was going on, and then I was told that my truck had not even been worked on yet. I guess as a way to try and make it up to me they said they could push it through, but that would still take an hour. My wife had to leave, I had an 8 and a 3 year old with me. I explained that was unacceptable and to just give me my truck back. Pointblank, it boils down to this. The lack of respect for a customer's time, no matter what the scenario is, was shown through this visit. I did everything I was supposed to do. This Joe guy put his needs in front of the customer to deal with what he needed to and did not follow through on making sure the customer received the service that was told they would get. I own a business that deals with people. If I treated one of my customers like this, I would expect a bad review and the loss of a customer. I know that losing me will not make a dent in what revenue Don Hewitt brings in, but hopefully this review will either open there eyes to do a better job for someone else in the future or keep other individuals from having to go through the same thing.

In March of this year I began looking at the Buick Enclave, amoung many other like sized autos. I met Brandon but wasn't able to really look or test the vehicle because my wife was ill. My car search coolerd off until this past month, July 2015. I stopped in asked to see Brandon and he immediately recoignized me, inquired of my wife's health, and asked if I was still interested in  a new Enclave. I didn't see him refer to notes or memos he may have written, he just picked up the process as if I had just visiterd. I test drove a new Enclave on Friday, selected my colors and trim level on Monday, and drove away a happy new Buick owner on the next Friday.

562,"June 19, 2015","As with most of us, due to, our need for immediate gratification, can often raise our chances of making a reckless decision to purchase something based only on price. However, in our haste, we forget, there is a distinct difference between the cost of something and the price we pay to own it. 
My experience at, Don Hewlett Chevrolet Buick, was a customer friendly blend of both, competitive pricing, and the value of ongoing service and support that doesn't disappear when you walk out the door. Any time you can get the best price and the lowest service cost of ownership - you have made a sound business transaction. Working with Brandon Luther, Steven Ausborn and Karl Hoehn and meeting Mr. Hewlett himself that shared with me his vision and core values confirmed why his dealership is rated #1 Chevrolet dealer in central Texas for seven years in a row.

He went over all the car with me in detail so when I drove off the lot I was extremely comfortable, secure and knowledgeable about my new car.  This car has turned out to be my favorite!

We knew what we wanted and we didn’t need financing, we had a letter of approval from our bank.  Both of us work a lot of odd hours so my husband was looking at trucks and if he saw something he liked we made arrangements so I could go see it.  After a month of searching, we finally found the perfect truck for us; we drove from Kyle to Georgetown.  Bruce was our sales representative he gave us great saving and a fair deal.   Two things that I was not happy about, he was constantly on his phone, I don’t know if he was playing games or texting, I thought that was very disrespectful.  Also, when we went to pick up the truck after all papers were handle by our bank and the dealer, Bruce said that truck was going to be cleaned and detailed.  Of course, it was not, he told us to go back, with both of us working and driving all the way to Georgetown it wasn’t happening.  We just don’t have the time to be driving all the way there and I just don’t want to deal with Bruce again.  It just very frustrating and I was disappointed with his customer service.",2.0

570,"May 27, 2015","Their service department is awful and no one seems to care!! I have a 2013 Chevy Traverse and have owned it for a year and a half now. I have been complaining about two of my tires for the last year and have requested they be checked EVERY single time it's in for any kind of service work. I have to put 20psi of air in both tires on a weekly basis - there is no reason I should be doing that. Every time, I'm told nothing is wrong with your tires, everything is fine. Obviously, everything isn't fine if I'm having to put that much air in each tire weekly. This last time, I was told all of a sudden that I need brand new tires. The current tires are 6 year and 60,000 mile rated tires but I've only had the vehicle a year and half and and its at 33,000 miles but I need brand new tires??? I was furious, so much so that the owner, Mike, got involved. He was even less help than the service writer. I have been asking them to look at my tires for a year and all of a sudden now something is wrong and I need to replace all of them? I received such poor customer service from the writer and the owner. All they are offering is a safety inspection and giving me tires at a ""significant discount"" if I do in fact need new ones. For a year now I've complained about my tires and for a year I was lied to about their condition. I will never return to this dealership and would not recommend them to anyone. This was not the only issue I've had with their service department, but this is the most serious. I was very delighted when Mike reached out to me personally and thought the issue would be fixed. However, after my last email to him, all communication on his end has stopped. Not so much as an ""I'm sorry I can't help you"" or ""You're right, this is unacceptable..."" Nothing, not a word from him. I drive my three year old son in my car on a daily basis, this is a safety issue for me. There is absolutely no reason tires with this rating should need to be replaced this early. You could argue proper inflation could cause them to be worn sooner, but that is exactly what I have been complaining about for a year!!!!",1.0

583,"May 01, 2015","This issue with a fouled spark plug, the check engine light coming on and the vehicle running rough happened the first time at 18,000 miles.  I was living in Houston at the time and took my Avalanche to Munday Chevrolet on I-45.  All they did was replace the spark plug and state that they could not get the vehicle to repeat the problem.  If they had taken the time to actually diagnose the CAUSE of the problem, this wouldn't have happened again with just over 36,000 miles on my Avalanche.  This time, I took my Avalanche to Don Hewlett in Georgetown to have it serviced.  This service department not only furnished me a vehicle to drive but kept my Avalanche long enough to actually diagnose the problem instead of just replacing the fouled spark plug.  Mari Auston stayed in touch with me throughout the process, letting me know what they were doing and why at least once or twice a week.  She was out when I arrived to pick up my truck last Thursday but Jason took the time to explain to me exactly what they found and how it was fixed. I could not be happier with the way this issue was handled by the service department at Don Hewlett Chevrolet.

My experience came to a screeching halt when I had to sit in front of Buddy,  one of the finance guys. His bad luck was I knew everything about the car I was buying.  That didn't stop him from relentlessly trying to jam a warranty I didn't want or need down my throat.

601,"March 18, 2015","Last week, I called to make an appointment at the Don Hewlett Chevrolet Dealership of Georgetown, TX for our 2015 Suburban (purchased in January).  I explained that we had three issues: 

1) the navigation system was not working - the screen displays an X over GPS.  
2) the OnStar phone system was not working.
3) when the Navigation was working, the maps are out of date.  For example, roads that were completed over 3 years ago are not recognized by the navigation system.

We were given an appointment time of 7:30am yesterday (Tues, Mar. 17), and assigned to 'Paul' as our service advisor. When I arrived yesterday morning at 7:30, I was informed that Paul was on vacation this week and the person who scheduled my appointment should not have assigned him.  I waited while they tried to find someone who would take me.

Ms. Auston, another service representative, reluctantly picked up my paperwork and informed me they could possibly get my vehicle in this afternoon at the earliest and it would likely require several days to diagnose and repair. Furthermore, they do not have any loaner vehicles available.  I replied ""you must be mistaken, I have a 7:30am appointment to have the problem repaired.""  The service advisor told me that appointment was just to meet with a service advisor to talk about the problem, not to actually repair it. Does that seem reasonable? When I make an appointment to see the doctor to address a problem, it is not to talk to the receptionist and then actually see the doctor later that afternoon.  Furthermore, in 20 years of purchasing new vehicles every couple of years and getting serviced by local certified dealers, I have never had such a poor experience.

It seems Don Hewlett cannot properly schedule or staff and the service advisor was full of excuses to try to cover for their incompetence.  The lack of customer service reflects poorly on Chevrolet as well as the dealership.

My husband did receive a call from Mike Hewlett apologizing and stating that they would have got me in and finished by 10am. While we appreciated the call, his information did not match up with the communication from the service department. Ms. Auston very clearly communicated that they would only start working on my truck at 10am if I stayed there in the waiting room while it was being repaired (as opposed to taking a shuttle home and it not getting started until the afternoon) and it would probably take all day to fix the issue. 

I purchased a 2015 Suburban in January expecting a full warranty and the level of customer service of an industry leading company.  I hope this isn't the beginning of many disappointments from Chevrolet.",1.4

610,"March 03, 2015","I came in to purchase a new remote for my 2004 GMC 2500 HD. The circuit board had died and i knew that a new remote and reprogramming was what was needed. They sold me the remote in parts which was fine and then sent me over to service to get it programmed. I requested that a technician who has been trained and specializes in Duramax be the one to do the work because i have custom ECM programming (EFI Live) and would like someone who is familiar with it to do the work. The service writer just gave me this blank stare like i was speaking swahili and then said that they wouldn't do it. I then asked if i could speak with their Duramax tech and was told that the techs can't talk to the customers. I asked the clarifying question ""are you saying i or they are not allowed to speak with me or they are incapable of speaking?"" to which this service writers response was that the techs don't have time to talk to customers and that was his job. That response begs this question; How is it that your job is to talk to customers in place of the service technicians when you have not got a single clue about the system i am referring to? especially when the system is one that was developed in partnership with GM specifically for GM vehicles, the Duramax being the primary focus. Needless to say i did not get any work done there and went down the road to their competitor Nyle Maxwell GMC who were very knowledgeable and more than happy to do the work. Oh and happy to let me talk with their Duramax Specialist. So in summary I will NEVER return to Don Hewlett, even if my life depended on it.

618,"February 10, 2015","I started this car buying venture with looking on the internet and emailing Jason about a truck.  I had told myself that I would shop and be a smart shopper and it resulted in the simplest, quickest transaction ever!  Jason made time for me and it was a NO BULL test drive.  I didn't like the truck I went to look at, but Jason didn't stop and had his inventory well learned and was able to get me one to look at immediately.  I had bought a truck from Jason a few years back and was pleasantly surprised he remembered who I was, that is a huge deal; the entire staff was very personable and down to earth.  Whatever I needed, it was met, no haggling.  He even lowered the price to where I was comfortable before I even asked.  I also dealt with Steven in accessories and he was good to work with too.  The entire staff from Jason, finance, Steven, service was simple and hassle free.  I had some accessories put on and I was given a loaner that far exceeded the expectations.  At purchase time the spare key and rear floor mats were missing, and without balking, they were replaced without question.  All in all, it has by far been the best truck buying experience I've had, exceeding the last vehicle I bought from them.  My biggest impression was how everyone was professional and proud to be working at Don Hewlett.  Any business that has satisfied employees speaks volumes of the leadership.  If I were in the dealer business, Don Hewlett is an organization I would want to be associated with but as a consumer, I am proud to do business with them and keep it local.  Congrats to Don Hewlett for their outstanding customer service!  They just think of all the small details from pizza, coffee, water, bags to change over your vehicle contents, and so on. ",4.8

With my credit challenges, I was shocked that Brian could secure financing for me and staying within my budget constrictions.  I was overly impressed.  Once the financing was complete, Brian handed me off to Charlie Cook, who continued with the same straightforwardness and friendliness.  Even though the dealership was busy that day, they both made the 3 hour I spent there enjoyable and non-pressure filled.

I waited several months for them to call and they never did.  One call to Don Hewlett Chevrolet when we moved was all it took.  Even though they are a large dealer, they have no issues with taking care of people on a very PERSONAL level.

After secretly purchasing the Jeep Jeff Sawisch offered to put the Jeep in the showroom with a big red bow on the hood.  Two days after Christmas we took our daughter in to ""test drive"" some used cars.  While allegedly getting paper license plates for another car we allowed our daughter to sit in what she referred too as a ""really cute Jeep.""

They made us feel as if we were the only couple in the dealership buying a vehicle that day, when each sales person was dealing with at least 4 customers simultaneously. We walked away feeling like family instead of feeling like a customer or a number. The entire staff went beyond any other Chevrolet dealership we have dealt with in the past; and there have been many. we were floored to find out they offered 24/7 help on the new features of the 2015 vehicles with just a phone call to our representative; forever! That is unheard of. Love, love the OnStar app for the I-phone. We were also impressed with the 24/7 Roadside Assistance, an awesome warranty package that fixes dents and flats, 2 years of free oil changes, complimentary loaner vehicles and a shuttle service to the outlet mall and back when you car is being worked on, if needed. What more could a girl ask for? We will buy all our future vehicles from Don Hewlett. What an impressive experience on customer service.

	My Wife and I just purchased our 2014 Buick Enclave (NEW). This vehicle was for my wife I will add this is her forth Enclave but her First from Don Hewlett.  With the exception of my future Son-in-Law Jason Luther has now sold and actually resold within the past two years; to my Son,  proud owner of 2015 Silverado Crew Cab 1500 4-Wheel Drive LTZ, His Wife a 2015 Equinox , my Daughter 2014 Encore, and of course Dad Has a 2014 Silverado 3500HD Crew Cab Long Box 4-Wheel Drive LTZ Diesel OH Yeah!!
	Now when I say Jason has SOLD us, I should say Jason has worked with us to ensure the primary person’s needs were met while always trying to keep Mom & Dad’s bottom line REAL. That is when Mom & Dad where paying. We have always been a GM Family.  It is my opinion because Jason is a Family man that he totally understands the need to keep that happy balance.  No Surprises, from the very first Time I met him on the phone a few years ago thru or SIXTH purchase in that time as a Family.	I can honestly say I call Jason just to say “Hey” as I do with Family (as I’ll bet Ms. Mary Lois could attest to). He and the complete staff there at Don Hewlett are Great Folks.

679,"October 05, 2014","This would have been my second vehicle purchased here. First one was a 2010 Z71. Went to the dealership to purchase a 2014 Silverado which I found on the internet advertised for $29,000. I found the vehicle on the lot then went in the building to find a salesman. When I told him which vehicle I was interested in he let us take it for a test drive. We sat with him and he linked to the website and said it was a great price for the truck with a number of  rebates and incentives. After I said I would like to purchase the vehicle he went to the sales manager and came back and said the vehicle was now $38,000. Additionally, they will REALLY ""low ball"" your trade without anyone physically looking at your trade-in. They also added $3000 to my amount owed on my trade-in and I guess they didn't think I would really look  at the numbers. I didn't get a chance to meet the manager but it seemed like real shady business while I was there and will not be returning to the dealership nor will I recommend this dealership to anyone else.

680,"October 04, 2014",I had requested information on a Suburban on Tues Oct. 8th and almost immediatedly Aric called my house and scheduled an appointment for the next day.  He called and confirmed the day of the appointment so that he could have the vehicle ready and so he could be waiting for us.  He was very knowledgeable about the vehicle when he took us on the test drive.  We ended up buying it.  I have bought many vehicles in the past and I have to say that this was one of the best experiences with a salesman that I have ever had.  Keep up the great work Aric!!,4.8
681,"October 01, 2014","When I called about my windshield wiper motor dying, Mary was so helpful in setting up an appointment that meshed with my having to work in the Round Rock office.  She made sure I received a shuttle ride to the office so they could have my car all day--it was a busy Friday.

Bob, the shuttle driver, was so nice and got me to the training session in plenty of time while driving very well in the I-35 traffic.

Mary called late in the day to let me know that the mechanic (I don't know his name) had to order the part and that there would be a vehicle for me to use over the weekend.  Bob, shuttled me back to the dealership safely in miserable traffic--he is very nice.  They got me into the car very quickly.

The service dept. did a great job of getting my car ready on Monday and I headed in after work.  I had a nice chat with Valerie (I believe that is her name) at the shuttle desk while waiting for my Equinox to be brought around.

I want to commend your entire service department.  My car didn't look as though anyone had touched it other than myself.  The wipers work beautifully---and quietly now.

Now I know that my first experience with my free oil change was the norm for Hewlett--friendly, expert and timely.

Thank you so much.

698,"August 15, 2014","I had visited Don Hewlett's dealership this past spring to test drive a Silver Topaz Metallic 2014 Chevrolet Equinox. It was then that I made the firm decision to purchase this SUV. I was able to return in July to do so. During my second visit, I had the good fortune to meet Jeff Sawisch.

Jeff drove us by golf cart through Don Hewlett's huge selection of vehicles in search of the final 2014 Equinox available in the Topaz color (my daughter's birthstone). He was determined to locate the specific vehicle I requested. Bingo! Although the interior was different from the original Equinox I had test driven, the odometer read 13 miles (my daughter's soccer #). After a second test drive with Jeff showing me all of its bells and whistles, we returned to the dealership to finalize my purchase of this Equinox.

By this time of the evening, the dealership had closed. Yet, Jeff was more than willing to make us feel welcome. He was good-natured with a great sense of humor. I could have driven ANY vehicle off that lot. Yet, at no time during my visit did I feel pressured or bulldozed by Jeff into buying this vehicle or any other.

Buddy Shepperd, who was also working past closing time, prepared my paperwork in a timely manner. He was very thorough in explaining everything I was about to sign my name to and answered all my financial questions. It was a pleasure to have Buddy handle the business end of my Equinox purchase. Again, no pressure. Buddy was exceptionally courteous - especially considering the late hour when we finished in his office. 

Would I refer my family and friends to Jeff Sawisch? You bet!!! And would I hope Buddy Shepperd handled their paperwork? Absolutely. I am delighted with my new Equinox. Many thanks for making my dealership experience a stress-free, positive one.

Rita Michelson  ",4.8

Our salesmen's name is Jason Luther, I am writing this customer review so that others will know the experience we have received at Don Hewitt Chevrolet, where the staff has been more then respectful and trustworthy to my family and I; So much so that my father and sister also both bought brand new vehicles from Jason Luther in the last year too.  My father and I approached Mr. Luther about two years ago when I needed to down size from the current truck I was in, due to myself getting out of the Army and going back to college.

Mr. Luther was able to find me a truck that worked financially two days later.  Since then my wife and I which are stationed 400 miles away have purchased a 2013 Chevy Silverado 1500, a 2014 Chevy Silverado, a 2014 Chevy Equinox, and my father and sister have purchased a 2014 Buick Encore, and a 2014 Chevy Silverado 3500.

I had been looking for a new Malibu since Jan 2014, several dealerships gave me the run around, saying give them 3 days to locate a car, I call them back and get voicemail, they never return my call.  Bastrop Dealership salesman had me calling him once a week, he would ask me every time what type of car do you want. He wrote the type of car down every time I talk to him. And say I'm still looking, and Henna said they don't take cash/cashiers check.

Jason asked the right questions to see what our needs were, he didn't waste our time showing us vehicles that didn't make sense for our family size or price-point and he went the extra mile to get us the best deal possible for our growing family. If buying a car is this easy and can be done with such a friendly and honest approach as its been with Jason, Jason Luther and Don Hewlett will have our business going forward.

Again, a tremendous experience from Jason and the team over at Don Hewlett and we'll see them in the near future for my truck!!

774,"April 06, 2014","Wanted to down-size from a Enclave, which I purchased from Don-Hewitt three years ago, because I did not need  a large vehicle any longer. Don't travel out of town as often and didn't need the extra seating and cargo area. Told Mr. Luther my needs and he quickly showed with the Encore which I learned was a Buick product. After driving an Enclave for three years, I knew a Buick product is what I wanted. Took a ride in a used Encore and came back to the dealership to be shown a 2014 that was on the show room floor and said ""I want that one"". The right color and all the extra things I need.
I traded the 2011 Enclave for a 2014 Encore. I was given a choice of monthly payment plans with explanation of all. My new car was promised the next day and on arrival all that was needed was my signature and the keys to the 2011 Enclave.

798,"March 09, 2014","This was my 2nd time visiting Don Hewlett and Phillip Davis for a new vehicle.  The first time was in 2012 and I purchased a Traverse.  This time around we needed a new pickup for my husband since our old was declared a total loss by insurance.  I emailed Phillip to let him know we were going to be visiting him for this reason and he was on board.  We let him know exactly what we were looking for and he searched the entire lot even in the back lots where the new arrivals are, which is where he found our vehicle, our Traverse was also found in that back lot.  Despite the weather, he was running around looking for what we asked for and sure enough, he delivered.  I didn't expect anything less.  We needed accessories on the vehicle and he setup us up with Cory and he also gave us exactly what we needed.  The finance department also did a great job in looking for the best rate for us and the met the price and payment we were looking for on this purchase.  My overall experience with Don Hewlett and Phillip Davis was amazing.  No one ever tries to get us to buy something more than what we are looking for and they know what will benefit us.  Phillip literally treated us like one of his own, checked back on us and conversed with us while we waited to go sign our final documents with finance.  Phillip is an amazing person and his works reflects it.  I couldn't have asked for a better sales person.  He was with us every step of the way until the very end when we drove off the lot.  It is things and actions such as these that makes people come back to see you.  Most importantly, he gave my husband a new toy and he is just like a little boy again.  Thank you Phillip and Don Hewlett for such amazing and superior service.  If we ever need to buy a new vehicle, this is definitely the place where we would return and I would most definitely refer you to friends and family.  I can't thank you enough, but THANK YOU!!

Professional, great product knoeledge and great great followup after the sale.

We own 9 Chevy vehicles in the business (7 half-ton pickups and 2 Tahoes) and are located 70 miles north of Hewlett Chevrolet but they make it easy to do business with them so the distance is not a problem.  I wouldn't think of using another Chevy dealer in the future.",5.0

810,"February 23, 2014","I would consider myself an educated and experienced car buyer. I know how the process works and I know what to expect to deal with (shuffling money between financing/sales prices/trade in, add ons, high pressure tactics, ""I have to ask my boss"", ""sorry, not on THAT vehicle"", etc) when a dealer is involved. Despite that, I chose a dealer when looking for my used truck because I was willing to put up with the process to get a pre-owned warranty (and the peace of mind it entails). I have to say that my (low) expectations were NOT met at Don Hewlett Chevrolet... actually the purchase process there completely changed my idea of what a car purchase from a dealer can be like.
Wayne Erickson is an excellent employee. He was patient, knowledgeable, attentive and a great listener. He didn't focus on telling me what he wanted to sell me, he wanted to hear FROM ME what I was looking for, and why. Then we worked together to find the right vehicle for my needs. There was NO pressure to close on the deal at any time, I (the customer) chose the pace and direction of our time together. He extended our test drive to show me the truck's suspension performance on a broken road when I voiced concern about it. He explained the subtle features and details of the trucks they had in stock, and he kept talking the talk about how the Hewlett dealerships and organization are different and special. At first I assumed it was corporate boilerplate that he was trained to spout off to all potential customers... but he kept up the message and I started listening and observing it myself. I met several other salemen and a finance guy, and gently tested them to see if Wayne's message held up. Without exception, EVERY SINGLE EMPLOYEE that I came in contact with at Don Hewlett Chevrolet quietly resonated the same message...
Don Hewlett Chevrolet IS different. The difference is in the people and the way they do business. The sales and finance staff really do seem to care most about the customer's satisfaction (and not just their commission). Everyone was well informed and aligned in their corporate message, and surprisingly laid back. The used vehicle selection is quite extensive, and their new vehicle area is just filled with hundreds of vehicles. The showroom is very nicely laid out and impeccably clean. The finance department was able to significantly beat my credit union's rate, and offered me a solid warranty extension at a very reasonable price. I am thrilled with my low mileage, excellent condition used truck, and I'd recommend Don Hewlett to anyone in the market for a new or gently used vehicle.",4.8

813,"February 21, 2014","Buying a new car for me is a dreaded, labored ordeal.  I don't look forward to playing the game and dealing with the typical pushy car salesperson who continually converses with his manager for prices and deals.  To my surprise and delight, Brandon Luther did not fit any of those attributes of that salesperson I loathe.  He listened to my wants & needs and took into account the research I presented.   After spending a good deal of time talking and learning about the car I was interested in, I knew that I would buy a car from Brandon instead of my 3 other options.  Not only did he give me a very good price on my future car; the trade-in value offered on my current car was better than other quotes.   Unfortunately, Brandon was in a meeting when my husband and I returned to purchase our car.  This gave us the opportunity to work with other salespeople in his quad.  Without a doubt, Jason Luther and Mike Stephens were both as sincere as Brandon.  We also decided to finance through GMC since Buddy Shepperd presented us with a great rate.  Customer service at Don Hewlett is a high priority which I truly appreciate.  I will highly recommend buying a car through Brandon Luther or any of Don Hewlett’s salespeople.  
Thank you for making a dreaded ordeal into a very easy and friendly one.

When someone is forced to buy a new vehicle due to their vehicle being declared a total loss, or it was stolen, or they just want a new vehicle, the process of choosing a dealer and going through all the haggling can be a very traumatic experience.  In all my years of dealing with purchasing new or used vehicles, either by helping our customers or for myself, I have NEVER dealt with a dealer that is as friendly, low pressure, and honest as Don Hewlett.  Especially Jason Luther.  He kept in contact with me in a prompt manner, he answered all my questions, and shot straight with me through each step of the process.  He actually spoke with me during the process as if we had known each other for years, sharing personal stories and making general conversation that made me feel welcome in his dealership.  Even the finance portion of the process was low key and not in any way intimidating or pressuring.  This was the best buying experience I've ever had and I would recommend anyone try Hewlett first if they're looking to buy a Chevrolet or Buick.  I bought another vehicle from another Chevy dealer in the Austin area and the Hewlett experience couldn't have been more different.

I totally recommend Phillip if you are in the market to make a change in vehicles, or are looking to purchase a new one.   
Phillip goes out of his way to make you feel comfortable with the process, while he works hard to locate the exact vehicle 
you are looking for.  My husband and I always feel like Phillip cares when we walk into the dealership, or even when we 
call with any questions.   

We recommend Phillip to everyone, and we also recommend the Don Hewlett Company as well.  

We both love our new Sonic and are so pleased that Phillip was able to find me just the perfect little RED car to work in my
business.  (I actually let my husband drive it for a while... )  This Sonic has wonderful access to both the back seat, with the 4 
doors and with the hatch, which is very important in my Ceramic Teaching business for carrying my supplies and projects 
across the country as I travel teach.  

Our experience with the entire process of purchasing our Sonic was great from the sales, to the insurance, to the financing, 
everyone was very friendly and helpful.  Our previous experience, with the Service Department, with our other vehicles, was 
just as pleasant.  The folks in those departments also made us feel like they were concerned about our vehicles when 
we came in with either of our other two vehicles for anything.  We do not hesitate bringing our vehicles back here.

Logically I decided the best thing to do would be to take it into the shop seeing as I have an extended warranty. I dropped my car off and a day later a service technician called me and advised they could find no issues with my car, they recommended a fuel injector cleaning which is part of preventative maintenance. It being Christmas time I reluctantly agreed. A day later the foreman of the shop called to let us know that it was actually the Transmission going out they had to completely rebuild my transmission. Now it’s Christmas Eve and I got stuck flipping a 150.00 of preventative maintenance that was not really necessary at this time.

We found through their internet inventory one which was a comparable replacement for my trade-in, also a price which was fair to the dealer, along with me.  Jason probably gave us more of his time than was necessary, and I really appreciate it.  Thanks again Jason for your time and efforts.

851,"December 11, 2013","My first visit to Don Hewlett was in October 2012.  I had my car taken to the collision center which at the time was still in the smaller shop.  The visit went really smooth and the management was more than helpful and courteous.  
I ended up in another not at fault accident in October 2013 and had no hesitation to take my vehicle to Don Hewlett.  My experience at the new collision center was a huge disappointment.  I called to let the shop know I needed work done and that State Farm would be taking care of it.  The shop told me to come in for a quote so I took off work early and went.  The person didn’t even look at the vehicle but gave me a day to bring my vehicle in (I could have heard that on the phone).  
They called to tell me my vehicle was done so I take off early again. When picking up my vehicle my husband noticed the tire that the insurance paid for to be replaced was not replaced.  So the shop tells me they will try to have it done the next day because they did not have time to replace it.  I called 4 times the next day and kept being told I would be called back by my adjuster at the shop.  At 3 o’clock in the afternoon I finally heard that my car would be ready.  I had to take off early again.  This was ridiculous customer service.  Not to mention the wreck actually caused wear in both front tires and the pictures prove the same wear was taking place.  The adjuster at Don Hewlett didn’t care to fight for the customer and denied the tire replacement.
I had at that moment decided I wouldn’t be going back to Don Hewlett for anything.  In November, it just happened my vehicle had a recall and needed to go to a dealership for replacement. Instead of finding a new dealership I decided to give Don Hewlett one more try since it would now be at the service center.  I also had a nail in a tire that needed to be replaced.  I scheduled both for a Friday morning so both could get taken care of.  The recall was taking care of but the warranty department was closed for the holiday so it would have to wait.  I told Steve, the customer agent, to have a tire in stock and I would make an appointment for Monday or Tuesday.  
I called Monday to make an appointment for Tuesday afternoon after verifying they had a tire in stock.  I took off work early to take care of it.  I get to the dealership and my car stays in the parking lot for over 30 minutes while I’m in the waiting room.  Steve finally comes to tell me what the warranty decided to pay and I approve it.  (why couldn’t he have had this done before my appointment because the car never moved since I pulled up, I have been waiting since Friday to have this done.)  I still wait another hour for my car just to have a tire changed.  I had to rush him to get it done because I have kids in daycare that have to be picked up by a certain time. What’s the point in making an appointment if they keep putting you off? 
I called Steve the next day to make sure they are faxing over the warranty paperwork for the tire reimbursement.  He was real rude about the whole situation and kept trying to argue with me.  I ask to speak to his manager who finally calls me back the next day.  The paperwork was faxed over and he apologizes for Steve’s ‘dry personality’ he called it.  
I am truly disappointed in Don Hewlett’s overall business.  I never gave the sales department a chance but based off all other departments they won’t get one.  I will make sure everyone I know hears about my experiences so they will not waste their time either.

854,"December 09, 2013","Don Hewlett received the lowest customer service rating because my 70 year old father purchased a new Chevy Equinox from Brandon Luther at Don Hewlett.  Mr. Luther made his follow-up call and ask my father how the car was working out.  My father explained he absolutely hated this car.  The Equinox was very uncomfortable and is not a good fit for him.  Mr.Luther's reply was short and simple, ""Now you're upside down, nothing I can do about it.""

At this time it's been less than three weeks.  At the time of the call it was less than two weeks since the purchase.  If you're going to ask a rhetorical question, why even call or follow up at all? It appears to me that Mr. Luther could have cared less how the new car was working out.  This is not customer service.  This is following your checklist and not really caring about the customer and their satisfaction.

I think it would be easy for you to take back the car and allow him to find a better fitting vehicle in your lot.  It's the right thing to do.   A car purchase is not a small thing. Especially for a senior citizen on a fixed income.

I can't really say I could recommend anyone purchase a car from Don Hewlett Chevrolet.

So we either wanted to either trade in our truck for a Suburban, or just buy a Suburban and live with three vehicles.  But we didn't really like the idea of dealing with three cars and the insurance and upkeep that comes with them.  So we decided to wait until next year and think about it.

Then Aric Reil from Don Hewlett Chevrolet called, just out of the blue!  He told us that someone was interested in buying our exact truck with our exact mileage and he could make us a great deal on a new vehicle.  We thought that was extremely strange considering we had been thinking and talking about a new Suburban.  Deciding that it was fate, or that Aric was an incredible mind-reader, or both, we brought in the truck and talked to Aric about a new Suburban.  Aric was extremely flexible about our crazy work schedules, worked with every detail, and really listened to what we were looking for -- he listened so well, that the Suburban he picked out for us to test drive met our needs exactly down to the color -- and that was the Suburban we ultimately purchased.

We had previously purchased my 2005 Chevy Silverado from Don Hewlett Chevrolet and were looking for another Chevy or Buick model. We pulled in and Scott introduced himself with a genuinely pleasant attitude. We told him the types of vehicles we were interested in looking at. He showed us several models and was very knowledgeable about all of the pros and cons based on our needs. After the first test drive in one of the Camaros though,  I knew what we were going to buy. After 20 years of driving the kids around in the mom class vehicles, my wife deserved a convertible Camaro. 

Only they didn't have any in stock that matched all of the options we wanted. Scott was able to quickly find the nearest dealership that matched everything we wanted and told us he would get it to us. We left the dealership and by the next morning he had worked with the great finance team at Don Hewlett and had all of the paperwork ready. He just had to find a driver that could get the car from 100 miles away to the lot by 5pm on Friday so the pre-delivery inspection could be done for pickup the next morning. He kept us informed the whole time and told us if he didn't find a driver he would go pick it up himself, knowing that my wife was bouncing around like a kid on Christmas Eve. 

He found the driver and called early the next morning to tell us the car was being prepped and we could come down to sign the paperwork.

I was especially impressed with my salesperson, Jeff Sawisch.  He is by far the best with whom I have ever dealt with in purchasing an automobile.  I cannot say enough great things about him!  Jeff is an honest, down to earth guy who went above and beyond to make my car buying experience worth it.  Aside from being very knowledgeable and professional, Jeff was patient with answering all my questions and even went through ever feature of my new SUV after the purchase.  I am so thankful I finally found a wonderful sales guy.  Five stars in my book!

Overall, I am one happy customer.

905,"September 26, 2013","Brandon responded quickly to my on-line inquiry regarding a vehicle I identified through the inventory search capabilities of Edmunds.com.  That particular vehicle had already been sold, so I stopped considering buying from Don Hewitt at that point.  However, Brandon kept in contact with me via phone and email messages in a way that communicated that he was interested in serving my needs.  I did not feel like I was being ""stalked"" as I have felt with other sales personnel.  As I started considered slightly nicer vehicles and couldn't find exactly what I wanted in the Dallas area, I considered broadening my search to include Don Hewitt due to my positive contacts with Brandon.

He consistently responded to my stated wishes and needs, and did not attempt to push a solution that did not fit.  As a result, I decided to rent a car (one-way) and come to Georgetown, 95% certain I'd close the deal once there.  Brandon came in on his day off and stayed in contact with me as I drove down, agreeing to assist me to get the rental car to the nearest Hertz office (in Roundrock).  Brandon personally made certain the car was spotless before delivery; completing a final bit of the clean-up, himself, so I wouldn't have to wait for other personnel.  This was particularly helpful, as I was eager to close the deal and get back north for an evening commitment.  When I asked if a soft drink was available, Brandon bought one for me from the machine.

Brandon helped me understand how the controls and features worked on my Sonic, including assisting me to link my iPhone to the MyLink radio.  I'm 60 years old and not as facile with the electronics as younger customers, I suspect.  Therefore, I appreciated the time Brandon took to understand how to execute the functions most relevant to me.  Finally, Brandon led me to the Hertz office in Roundrock.  I would not have found it easily, alone.  Overall, this purchase was easier and less stressful than any vehicle purchase in several decades; and I've had more than a few in those years.  I can usually sense the values of the owner(s) and/or top management of an organization by the way the staff treats its customers.  Everyone with whom I had contact at Don Hewitt (receptionist, other sales staff, Karl and, of course, Brandon) clearly represented values from ""the top"" that clearly stated, ""We take care of our neighbors!""  

I'm a little unusual in that I'll travel a bit to get exactly what I want.  Nonetheless, I will recommend Brandon and the Don Hewitt dealership whenever I have the opportunity.

907,"September 18, 2013","My husband chose Don Hewlett because of the car pro and I am so grateful he did.  Originally, my husband sent an e-mail with inquiries and not only did a sales representative respond, but the general manager did as well.  I showed up to the dealership around 5 pm and was quickly greeted by Donnie, who was fabulous.  He listened to my concerns and waited patiently for my husband to arrive.  I had my two year old with me and he offered for her to sit on the golf cart so she would be out of the sun.  Our dealings with Donnie didn't last long because my husband had already been talking to Lee and I was unaware of that.  Donnie was fabulous for the first five minutes and I know if he had been our main sales representative, we would have been just as happy.  I cannot say enough about Lee and the service he provided!  He was patient, understanding, helpful, and kind.  He listened attentively as we told him our wants, budget, and issues with cars we had previously test drove.  Not only did he search new inventory for us, but also the used.  My husband test drove a car and then we came back in to regroup because the first car just wasn't going to work for me.  Then the storm came and he did everything with a smile as he went into the rain to get a different car for us.  He sat with us for 3 hours along with our two year old who he treated with as much respect as he did us.  He adored her and he enjoyed having her there and that made the experience even more special.  I apologized multiple times for keeping him for so long and his attitude about working so long with us was great.  Not in a I'm trying to make a sale great, but a genuine I'm here for you and to help you find what is best for you and your family.  Not only did we have a chance to talk business, but the personal chit-chat was fabulous.  Lee is the exact type of customer we are and we know that he treated us the same way he would want to be treated.  Lee was there to answer questions, but also gave us the space to talk when we needed to have a family talk.  After making the deal, we headed over to the finance department...the place where people tend to not enjoy.  BUT Karl was fabulous!  He looked for the best interest rate and was up front about all decisions we needed to make.  Once again, I found myself apologizing for keeping them from their families, and Karl had the same attitude as Lee.  All he wanted was to help us and get what we needed.  Beverages were offered multiple times throughout our visit and even crayons and a coloring book for our two year old!  I cannot say enough about the kindness and generosity that was shown to my family and I during the car buying experience from all members of the Don Hewlett team, especially with our two year old!",5.0

In fact, I moved to Houston two years ago and passed many dealerships on the way to Georgetown to buy my new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado. On Saturday, I was in and out of the dealership within an hour and a half with a smile on my face and a new truck to drive home in. 

Thanks to Lee and the Don Hewlett team, my family and I are customers for life.

910,"September 16, 2013","Lee Dickie and the Don Hewlett team were wonderful to work with. After considering my Avalanche purchase for several months, and spending a significant amount of time researching pricing, I found that Don Hewlett's price beat all others by far. I live in San Antonio, which is 85 miles from the dealership, however after contacting the dealership and working with Lee on both the new vehicle purchase and my trade in, I made the decision to make the trip and buy the truck. The first time I met Lee in person was the day I bought my Avalanche, but I felt like I already knew him well from all the emails we had exchanged. He was wonderful to work with, was very considerate of my time at the dealership, and worked to get me out quickly so I could get back home. I did not feel rushed at any time, instead Lee took time to explain everything to me, answered any questions I had, and did a great job of going over the vehicle with me and all of it's features. This is the first Chevy I've owned, and afer this experience I know it will not be the last. Even though it's a long drive, I would not hesitate to come back to see Lee again the next time I'm in the market for a new car. There are at least 6 or 7 Chevy dealerships in the San Antonio area, but Don Hewlett will be my first choice for my next Chevy. ",5.0

With that said, let me tell you the Lee will always treat you like a person without the dollar signs flashing in front of him.  He will always take care of you and treat you with the utmost respect. We all complain about bad service but rarely give credit to the good.  I will always go to Lee to buy my vehicle's, new or used. Lee is more than a car salesman to us, he is a friend.

Right off the bat, they made me very comfortable and I felt like part of the family or a long time friend.  Phil was patient as we looked at several vehicles he explained my options and the process.  He was diligent about making sure that I was satisfied and fully informed on every detail, to help me feel at ease.  I was very specific about my payment needs, and Phil was determined to get me into the exact vehicle that I wanted, within my budget.

He was very friendly and knowledgable. We felt so comfortable at this time, I even helped another sales man out with his paper when he found out I was teacher. The bad part of it comes in after we had a few negogiations back and forth when we realized that no matter what we did the sales price never changed. We come to find out from our honest sales man that there was another side deal going on with the same car we had just drove and fell in love with. We then talked with Tommy (manager) who was very disrespectful and rude! We found out that there was a previous couple that had come in and looked at the same vehicle earlier, they had made a verbal commitment to come back tomorrow with a down payment.

944,"July 25, 2013","I want to write this review today and express my overwhelming satisfaction with my outstanding experience with Aric Reil on Friday July 12th 2013.  I had received a call from Aric, who was very personable and was very casually able to establish a relationship over the phone before I met him.  He told me what his position was and that he would like to buy my truck back form me and find something I could enjoy just as much.  Please note, I loved my 2008  Chevrolet Crew Cab Z71 that I bought used form Don Hewlett several years ago and so I was quite reluctant to give it up.  I explained to Aric from the beginning that it would be very difficult for him to win my truck away from me as I had put many miles on it and had never had any issue other than general ware and tare (tires, breaks, battery etc.).  My truck had never let me down, not once, and Aric was going to have to work! HE accepted the challenge willingly and the meeting was set!

Upon walking into the dealership I met Aric and we did some basic paperwork to establish exactly what I was looking for.  We test drove a 4X4 truck that I liked very much but I mentioned to him that I saw there was a clearance event taking place on the 2013 Silverado Crew Cabs and inquired about those.  Still very skeptical that I would give up my beloved truck.  They had several trucks available but all in an Extended Cab type.  I am the very proud owner of a 120 lbs. Great Dane and knew that he would not fit in anything less than a Crew Cab, comfortably.  Aric was very knowledgeable and remembered that the dealership's finance manager was demo-ing a 2013 Crew Cab Z71.  All that was left was the price.  We ran the numbers and Aric was very dutiful about getting the price to where I wanted for the down payment and monthly contributions.  I was given an outstanding value for my trade in and the deal was done! 

I am now the very proud owner of a new truck at a price other dealerships couldn't even come close to.  I can honestly say there was ABSOLUTELY NO COMPROMISING I had to do and I have not once regretted my decision!  I love my new truck and my experience with Don Hewlett could not have been better!

The entire credit for this experience goes to Aric. Period. His outstanding ability to make a connection with a less than potential buyer into such a relationship that I would recommend my friends to him when they are looking for a car or truck in the future is to be commended.  He made what could have been an in and out ""No Thank You!"" on my part, into and experience that was pleasant and non stressful.  At no time was I pressured into giving up my beloved truck and at no time was I pressured into making any kind of decision other than what I thought was best for me.

In conclusion, if you are so lucky as to get a call from Aric asking for your vehicle, give him a chance and I have no doubt he will work tirelessly to win your business, like a true car salesman should! Further, you will walk away with a whole new outlook on the type of experience car buying should be! 

Thanks Aric!",5.0

Arrived without warning to look at it and after a few minutes were greeted by sales 'consultant' Brandon Luther. From that point on we were able to talk frankly about our needs and, within a short period of time, our needs were fulfilled. No pressure, no flash, no endless chatter about how great the dealership, service dept, whatever, is. Just a straightforward business agreement on our terms. Negotiation was reasonable. We don't feel like we 'stole' the vehicle, nor did we get soaked - we bought the car at the right price with a fair down payment. (The down payment in our credit score range - and in most credit score ranges - should roughly equal taxes, tags, doc fees, commissions and, of course, dealer profit). Even though this dealership in urban, it is operated similarly to an old-fashioned 'country dealership' (which it probably once was). No obtrusive 'systems' and no unexpected games. Experience with the finance office was similarly low key and respectful of the buyer's intelligence. I would recommend the dealership and Brandon Luther without reservation.

Despite me getting there about an hour before closing the night before the 4th of July, they never rushed me and the entire buying process went smoothly.  I started out at a dealership in San Antonio which had the truck I wanted but they insisted on playing games which I was clearly not going to win.  If I want to play games where I have no chance of winning I'll go to a rodeo carnival or Las Vegas.  Cory Reedy and the crew at Don Hewlett do not play games and we negotiated a very fair deal for all.",5.0

959,"June 03, 2013","I had a bad experience with another dealership so I elected to contact Don Hewlett Chevrolet to explore my options.  The receptionist was nice, she transferred me to Jason Luther.  I already knew what car I wanted, we then immediately talked about financing.  Even though I couldn't get approved through their in-house financing, Jason pointed me in the right direction for a car loan through a credit union.  Long story short, eventually everything was approved on my end & immediately purchased the car that very day.  I was super impressed with Jason's customer service ability, and most importantly, he was ALWAYS available when I had called for questions.  I don't think the phone ever went to voicemail, to me, that is just amazing!  

My perception of the car buying process was way off from the reality Jason at Don Hewlett created.  Everything was done amicably, there were a few speed bumps (mainly due to me), but because their wisdom & experience, they were able to make everything go smoothly.  I have already recommended this dealership to a number of friends, thank you guys for all your help!

960,"June 01, 2013","I hate shopping for cars since most car sales folks tend to not know their products, are pushy, and yet can't do anything without checking in with the Manager.

What I found with Don Hewlett and with my salesman Jeff Sawisch was just the opposite.  He knew the product inside out, took all the time I needed, actually searched other dealer inventories for the color combination I wanted, and was able to present a deal with a minimum of confusion and ""mother may I"" theatrics.  While I said I needed to think it over, Jeff was completely understanding and even offered to let me drive home a like vehicle to check out.  Needless to say, I purchased the vehicle the next day and the dealer arranged for it to be shipped in from another dealer.

When it came time for delivery, Jeff came in on his day off and spent considerable time helping me setup things on the car (like blue tooth phone connections, and On Star).   He also took plenty of time to show me how to work the various switches and gadgets.

I honestly have to say this was the best buying experience I have had in my 40 years of buying cars.

972,"April 26, 2013","After being unable to find anyone in my hometown of Austin, Texas, that was willing or qualified to install an OEM gas cap door on my 2007 Hummer H3, I contacted the Service Department at Don Hewlett Chevrolet/Buick in Georgetown, Texas. Without hesitation, I was told that I could get the part installed and I scheduled an appointment. I was fortunate enough to once again be assigned Service Consultant, Mari Auston. I dealt with Mari before, and she was great. I arrived for my appointment too early, for fear of being late due to traffic. The Service Department was 10 minutes shy of opening, but that didn't prevent Mr. Jim Kramer, from giving me a warm welcome and pointing me towards a location where I could change out of my work clothes and into something more comfortable. When I returned from changing, Mr. Kramer had notified Mari that I had arrived and was ready to take possession of my keys to drive my vehicle in to the shop. Mari greeted me with a smile and remembered me from my last visit. While I was at Don Hewlett, I witnessed numerous encounters between the staff and customers, where the staff remembered guests by face and name. A lot different from the majority of car dealerships in Austin. The Service Department was undergoing construction upgrades, so Mari personally escorted me to a comfortable, spacious waiting area next door. When my installation had been completed, Mari came to get me and explained my costs. Mari apologized for the length of time needed to perform the installation; explaining that she wanted a particular Service Technician to perform the installation due to his experience. Let me tell you, I'm so happy with her decision and the excellent, flawless install done by the Service Technician, Dan. I bought the gas door to keep people from siphoning my gas; but it's already brought me a few compliments for it's appearance. Mari offered me a complimentary car wash, which I declined. After that, my vehicle was quickly brought around by the quiet, but courteous and professional, Howard. I've already been singing the praises of Don Hewlett Chevrolet/Buick in Georgetown to anyone who would listen and after another great visit, I will continue to do so. As I was leaving, Mr. Kramer gave me an impromptu consumer review of a car I had been curious about; the Chevy Volt. Mr. Kramer was a very happy Volt owner and definitely gave me some food for thought for my next vehicle purchase.

978,"April 15, 2013","I do not want to jeopardize anyone's job. But a few things happened that bothered me. First, I found it unprofessional that two people made disparaging remarks about other Chevrolet dealers in the area.There were also disparaging remarks made about a vehicle I mentioned I was considering buying that was not a GM product. I did feel somewhat pressured to purchase the vehicle right away  because of the way the ""deal"" was presented to me. I was led to believe that if i didn't accept the deal right then and there, that it would be forever lost and i would lose my opportunity to buy the vehicle. While my sales person was dealing with me, he kept looking at his cell phone and trying to answer personal calls and texts. I felt like I did not have his full attention. There were several times he had to reenter the information I had given him repeatedly because he forgot to fill that in.  
I traded in a very nice vehicle (Camaro) that I dearly loved and it was a very difficult decision. I was repeatedly asked ""Aren't you excited?"" when referring to my new vehicle. I think every person's experience is very personal and should be treated as such. I think overall that this is a good dealership and I will recommend it others. But perhaps a word of instruction on professionalism and not pressuring people.

979,"April 13, 2013","I started my dealings with Don Hewlett Chevrolet/Buick of Georgetown, Texas, online, with a man named Mike Cummings. When my wife and I showed up at the dealership, Mike was not available. We were passed off to a man named Donnie Bordelon. Thank God! Donnie is such a polite, professional and personable fellow; I couldn't have imagined someone in the car business being so genuine and nice. Donnie is a good man; especially since he kind of inherited us because Mike Cummings was not available. We had an extremely long wait to get in to see the man in Finance. When we got there, a man named Jeff Grazioplene, told us it had taken so long because he was battling to get us the best deal. Sounded like a line of bull at first; but ""Graz"" proved he is a principled, dynamic, hard working, honorable professional. About a week after we had our truck, Mr. Grazioplene called me at home and at work and told me right after we had signed our deal, another lender had come through with a lower interest rate. ""Graz"" told me he would not feel right letting the existing deal stand when there was a chance to get us a lower monthly payment. Who does this? Jeff Grazioplene, that's who! That story will be told till my dying day; and everyone I have told, is blown away by his integrity. The night before we were to meet with Mr. Grazioplene to sign our new deal, my water pump went out.
I called first thing in the morning and spoke with a lady named, Mari Auston. Mari told me if I could get there by 10 AM, she could get me in to fix the water pump. When I arrived at the Service Department, Mari remembered our conversation and provided me with the most courteous and stress free experience I have ever witnessed our been a part of when it comes to getting a car dealership to honor their warranty agreement; and I work at a car dealership! Before I fully realized what was going on, I was directed to a gentleman named Cedric. (Sorry, I don't remember his last name.) Like everyone else in the Service Dept., Cedric was courteous, efficient and professional. I provided Cedric with my driver's license and proof of insurance when asked, and before I knew it, he was preparing me to take custody of a beautiful, Chevy Silverado pickup. I did not expect to receive a loaner vehicle and I did not ask for one. I couldn't believe my good fortune and the excellent customer service I was receiving! I had worked a graveyard shift, the night before; and I was dreading the thought of being stranded for hours while my car was being repaired. I live over 40 miles from this Don Hewlett dealership and I was exhausted. I was so tired, I slept in the courtesey vehicle in the parking lot instead of driving it home. My water pump was replaced by 4 PM and it was washed before it was returned to me. I had been a little upset when I first bought my vehicle, because it was not delivered with a full tank of gas. When I let that be known to Donnie Bordelon, I received a Shell, gasoline gift card from Lowe's; courtesey of Mike Cummings. Wow! What more can a person ask for regarding customer satisfaction?  When my wife gets ready to part with her Silverado pickup; I know where we are going to get our next one. I highly recommend this dealership.

We have some family in Austin and he was able to research some vehicles up state for us and got in contact with Jason.

We drove up there one weekend and went to Don Hewlett and spoke directly with Jason, who was very busy that Saturday. He let us test drive the Cruze and gave a great comparison between the Sonic and the Cruze. He answered all of our questions and made sure that we were comfortabe with the whole situation before we signed anything. He went out of his way to make sure that we went home with our new Cruze. Jason made the whole trip up to Georgetown worth it. We were terrified that we would have to come back to the RGV without a new vehicle, but he made sure that we got our car. He was very friendly, approachable and very confident in answering our questions.  After all the documents were signed, he waited outside with our new car and walked me through setting up our new Cruze. He took the time to show me all the features that it had, programed my phone with the car and even took the time to make sure our daughter had her very own XM radio station programed to listen to when she is in the car.

985,"March 19, 2013","I had the most wonderful vehicle buying experience ever!  Thanks to Cory Reedy.  I used a car buying service to help me find a pick-up truck that met my needs.  Many dealers either texted me or sent me an email that they are waiting for me to contact them with a vehicle. Cory was the only one who personally called me to verify what I wanted and after that he did all the work looking for something that met those requirements.  Other dealers said they had what I wanted.  Everyone missed the mark as they tried to sell me a 2 wheel drive as my main reason for buying a pickup was for the 4 wheel drive.  At this point, I had already become frustrated with the dealers as I felt they were only interested at making a quick sale.  I had already been pre-approved and had a price guarantee certificate from the car buying service I was using.  Then came Cory Reedy.  He called me up and said he found what I was looking for.  He worked around my schedule in order for me to come and visit.  He treated my wife and I like we were family.  Had everything lined up so as not to take alot of time.  We went for a test drive and I instantly fell in love with my new truck.  Okay now for the negotiating!  I was surprised that there was no negotiating hassle.  No pass back to the finance manager, or anything like that.  After the paperwork was done, Cory took me outside and walked me through the entire vehicle setting up favorite radio stations, Onstar, and all the extra gadgets that I needed to know.  His excitement was as if he just bought a new vehicle for himself.  He not only sold me a vehicle that I am totally excited about, but he also checked in on me to make sure I didn't have any questions or needed something.

992,"March 03, 2013","I would like to let the world know that the sterotype of the car salesman has changed. At least at Don Hewlett it has. I think this story may be able to prove that. I live 80 miles from the Hewlett dealership and was doing my car shopping on line. After researching new cars in the price range I was looking for. And comparing the things that come standard on the Chevy Cruz verses things that are optional or unavailable on other vehicles in the same price range. Well it was a no brainer the Cruz was the car for me. Then I searched within 100 miles from my small town and by far Don Hewlett had the lowest prices on the Cruz. So low in fact that I thought it had to be a scam. Some kinda bait as the stero typical car salesman might use. So I began having on line conversations with several different dealerships. And has they all hounded me relentlessly wanting to make the sale. Sending me email after email, wanting to get my phone number JASON LUTHER at Don Hewlett simply answered my questions and waited for me to be sure that this was the right car and dealership for me. Then the coolest thing happened, I told Jason through email that I really wanted the car at his dealership. I also told him that the vehicle I was currently driving was an in town only kind of car. I really wasn't sure if it would make it all the way to Georgtown and back since I planned on keeping it. So Jason offered to drive the 160 miles to come and pick us up and take us to our new car. I could not believe it. Jason really went out of his way for us. That is dedication. That is true customer service. I had such a wonderful experience at the family owned and run dealership. And such wonderful conversation with Jason on our journey to Georgetown. I am even planning on making the trip to Georgetown for all my service needs on my new Cruz. I trust them and would like to say hello to my new friend Jason. I never thought the car buying experience would be so wonderful. And the best part is I have no regret. I got a great car at a great price!!! Thank you Jason, and thank you Don Hewlett for impowering your salespeople to make the choice of providing great customer service over high pressure sales tactics.

993,"March 02, 2013","Our 2013 Silverado is the fifth in an unbroken line of new vehicles my wife and I bought from Hewlett's since 1995.  Lee Dickie was fabulous to work with in what was again a very pleasant experience.  It's not just price alone that brought us to Hewlett’s each time.  It was the genuine personal attention to us a customers that seems to getting so rare today.   Lee may be working for the high-volume dealer that Hewlett's is, but he treated us like we were long-term neighbors who came to our local small-town dealership to buy from him.  Very pleasant and will we be repeat customers again in the future?  Yes!  Will we buy again from Lee?  Most definitely!

Donnie was extremely professional and courteous.  Not only did he go out of his way to ensure all my needs were met, but he did not put me on the B.S. track and try to milk every dime out of my trade-in.  I got what I asked for on my trade and got what I wanted for the new Torch Red corvette.  While I have no intentions of buying another car soon, Don Hewlett and Donnie will be my choice for the Chevy Volt that will eventually replace my wife's Chrysler 200.  I could not have asked for better personal service than what I received at Don Hewlett with Donnie.  I will be buying here again.",4.8

1000,"February 15, 2013","This is our second vehicle that we have bought from Hewlett Chevrolet in Georgetown....we live about 60 miles away and it is well worth the drive!  From the moment you pull on the lot it is a very enjoyable experience!  Ronnie Bradford sold us our first vehicle and we requested him the second time too...he makes the whole process very painless.  He listens to what you want and does not try to pressure you into anything else.  He makes you feel comfortable and at home! The whole staff at Hewlett is very friendly and helpful!  

Let me add from past experience I nearly had a phobia about buying a vehicle...hated it, and was like my least favorite thing to do!!!  Ronnie Bradford has cured that problem, now I don't dread it at all! 

We highly recommend going to Hewlett Chevrolet for all your car buying needs, they are very competitive and appreciate your business!!!

I went to see Jeff Sawisch to purchase a new Colorado pickup and he helped as he had always helped me in the past at a previous dealerhip he had worked at. I have bought numerous vehicle from both Jeff and also from the Hewlett dealershiip. I was very pleased when I found out that Jeff had partnered up with the Hewlett dealership.

1003,"February 08, 2013","The initial purpose for our visit to the Don Hewlett business on Jan. 28, 2013 was to have our 2002 Buick LeSabre serviced as we have done since we bought the car at Don Hewlett in 2002.  We had recently talked about looking into a new vehicle.  So while there we went into the sales floor to pick up a couple of brochures on vehicles in which we were interested.  We ended up speaking with Phillip Davis who proceeded to talk with us.  After telling him what we were interested in, he took us around the lot to see what we could find.  We looked at several vehicles.  We had some specific desires, i.e., black interior, either silver or similar exterior color (not white, no sunroof).  Couldn't find one on the lot, but after returning to Phillip's office, he reviewed his computer inventory.  Well, he was delighted when discovered a vehicle which met our requests.  The only thing wrong was that it was stationed in Sun City at that time as one of the vehicles Don Hewlett displays in Sun City for viewing.  Well, after negotiating on the price, we finally decided we would buy the 2013 Chevy Traverse.   By now, it is getting late into the afternoon and Phillip needed to retrieve the vehicle so we could see it.  We told him we would return the next day at 10:00 AM.  

The next day we arrived at Don Hewlett's in Georgetown at 10:00 AM and Phillip had the vehicle waiting and ready to go.  All that was left was the paperwork.  

Phillip spent a considerable amount of time with us helping us find the right vehicle and throughout the negotiation process he was patient,  We appreciate his patience and professionalism.

So far, we are happy with the Traverse.

1004,"February 06, 2013","This is the 3rd car we have purchased from Don Hewlett and the buying experience has been exceptional each time. Cory Reedy helped me with the purchase of my new Avalanche. He was friendly, professional and very helpful. I was trading in a 2009 Avalanche so I was very familiar with a lot of the features, but Cory made sure I new about the new and upgraded ones that I was receiving. He answered all my questions and did not give me any pushy sales pitches or high pressure tactics. The other Hewlett employees I encountered were also very friendly and created a warm environment inside the dealership. I was in and out in 2 hours and they even made accommodations so that my husband could stop by and sign his part later in the evening (yes ladies- you too can buy a car all on your own! That's how great Don Hewlett is!) The follow up after my purchase has also been appreciated. Cory has touched base with me several times to ensure I was still happy and to see if I had any other questions. I even stopped by to pick up my plates and he came out to install them for me.

1005,"February 06, 2013","When we drove to Don Hewlett Chevrolet that late Saturday afternoon, we were only there to replace a gas filler cap on our ‘07 LS Tahoe, We are from California and didnt know where the part department was and we asked a salesman where it was located and he pointed it out with a gentle smile and friendly way, we first talked to the parts department and they were more than friendly then trying to deal with a dealership from California. We bought the part and I installed it right there, then on the way out, I asked my wife if we could look at the trucks, We drove up and started to talk to Scott Nowling, I informed him that we wanted a “3500HD, Dura-Max Diesel, Crew Cab, Long Bed and one more thing….a 4x4”, Scott replied with a smile, “We have a couple” Scott jumped into his golf cart and said “Follow me, Young Man”  So we did. We really had no idea that we would find the truck that we both liked, but we did. We informed Scott that we were short on time and going to dinner and that we would return the next day.  When we return the following day, Scott was already running all over the place with different customers, but that did not stop him from helping them and us at the same time. Scott asked if we were ready to take the truck for a test drive, we said “ Oh Yeah!” he asked for our information and gave us the key and said “There You Go, Young Man” I stated that we would be back in a few, Scott stated that a few is not good enough for a test drive, he stated the make sure we take it for a “Test Drive” (The only thing that came into my mind was the Chevrolet commercial, where the guy gets the new truck full of mud). Well as the story goes, Scott answered all of our questions. He was never pushy or aggressive. He was always smiling and had a laugh to share. We also feel that Scott and Don Hewlett went well beyond by delivering our new 3500HD plus giving us a great price for our trade in. We would highly recommend Scott and the Don Hewlett dealership to any of our friends. It was a great car buying experience. We cannot be more satisfied by the way we were treated.

1006,"February 04, 2013","Jeff is a straight shooter, he's honest, and really wants you to be in the car you want but will tell you if you ought to look at something else.  I was really just going to the dealership to check out some cars I had been looking at online, the Buick GS and Chevy Camaro.  Jeff found me looking at the GS, unlocked it and told me about a feature on the GS that I had not read on the internet.  I mentioned that the GS seat felt small on me, and at that point he did not recommend the car for me because an uncomfortable seat will make you regret buying the car.  He didn't think the Camaro seat would be any better, but it fit me just fine, much more comfortable than the GS, well it's just plain comfortable to me.  

I had read about a certain camaro package, the 1LE, but didn't find any on the internet in the austin area... but Don Hewlett had one.  I guess I got to it before they could put the info out.  I knew as soon as I saw it that it's what I wanted, it looked better than any I had seen on the internet, fully loaded and with a sunroof.  Yeah I wanted it bad, didn't really want to say or drool too much, but I knew it was over my anticipated budget, and plus I was just there to look after all, but I asked to see what kind of deal could be had and Jeff got the ball rolling and we talked about ordering a cheaper one if I needed to (I really thought I was going down that path).  However, the dealership has some real pull with the institutions they deal with, and so I went from ""there's no way I can afford this"" to ""let's do it"" after about 5 hours.  They were very patient with me, it took me a while to think/consider a lot of things because I really didn't expect to be haggle over a car that day, but I knew I wanted that particular car.

Two days later, no regrets, I can't believe it took me so long to pull the trigger.  Again, they were very patient and I never felt rushed.  Yeah, I felt pressure, but it was on myself.  I'm happy, they're happy, even saw Jeff today to drop off keys and pick up my CDs that I forgot, and had a nice chat with him talking about motorcycles and how well the 1LE handles.  I think that as long as Don Hewlett has Jeff, they've got me as a customer.  He's a good guy.  I'm still sort of learning the 1LE's gears, but I'm already loving it, and Jeff certainly helped make having the car a reality.  Kudos to him and the finance guys who also had to work with me... all very patient and friendly.",5.0

Finally, as I told Mr. Hewlett, it was nice to know that no one was trying to take advantage of me as Ancira-Winton (San Antonio) did by trying to slip a $1495 warranty by me in the paperwork. I will definitely recommend to my friends Hewlett as a great place to buy a Chevrolet...

1017,"January 16, 2013","I spent several weeks looking for a very specific Camaro all over Austin, and Houston TX.  I finally found precisely what I wanted, and it was at Don Hewlett.  I went in through the website, and called Mike.  He found the car, assured me it was there, and we handled a lot of our business via the site, and over the phone.  Very convenient not to have to do everything once I got to the dealership. 

Once I arrived, Mike and the Managers and I came to a price very quickly, and with very little haggle from either party.  Trade value was good, and price was fair.  90 minutes after signing the deal, I was in a freshly detailed Camaro SS, and down the road.

Could not have gone much more smoothly, and overall, a great buying experience.  Especially since they basically knew they had me based on the car I wanted.

1018,"January 14, 2013","Could not be more pleased with this dealership or our sales rep, Cory Reedy.  

Buying a vehicle is a huge purchase and one that is filled with a lot of stress, it is by far one of my least favorite things to do.  The initial buying experience was pleasant and without incident, but what put them over the top with me was after my purchase.  I settled on a vehicle color that I normally would not have because the price was cheaper than others in the same class and I thought I could adjust and learn to like it.  I did not adjust.  As soon as I drove off the lot I felt a huge sense of error on my part for the choice I made and it continued to intensify over the next day.  I sent an email to my sales rep, asking if there was any way I could bring it back and exchange it for another color that would suit me better.  Though I anticipated getting a ""sorry, no can do"", I figured nothing ventured, nothing gained.  To my absolute amazement, they were more than happy to accommodate me and allowed me to bring it back to redo my purchase.   There was no sense of irritation or annoyance, only a willingness to make me happy with my purchase.  And that they did.

For any future vehicle purchases, Don Hewlette will always be my first choice and I would recommend them to any one and every one.

Thanks to all involved for making a huge purchase as pleasant as it could have possibly been.

1019,"January 11, 2013","Dear Mr. Hewlett,
    
     I am giving Jason Luther and the Don Hewlett Chevy Family the highest ratings possible. Jason and the DHC Family has once again exceeded our expectations by providing excellent service to my family and the experience has actually brought my wife and I back full circle to the Chevrolet Family. 
     This is my 4th vehicle purchased from Don Hewlett Chevrolet within the last 15 years and during that time my wife and I have been to several dealers. We have never before had such a pleasant experience as this last purchase of the 2013 Camaro. I must say that if you ever lose Jason Luther you will probably lose any of my future business. We feel very comfortable with his technique of no pressure sales. Comfortable enough to use the technology of text messaging to complete the deal without worrying about my personal information being mishandled. 
    In short, sir, my wife is extremly pleased with the Camaro. It has the muscle car look and feel that will make your jaw drop as it passes by, as it did during the muscle car era.

1025,"January 04, 2013","There are other reviews that have the same type of symptoms.  This dealer is awesome at selling you a car.  Their problems are in problem solving and customer satisfaction in dealing with those problems after the sale.  In August of this year I preordered a restricted model of the 2013 camaro. I had a written price agreement and ended up picking up the car the weekend before Thanksgiving. I found a footlong dent in the driver side door later that day and returned the vehicle to the dealership. The option from the dealer was to fix or they could order me another vehicle. I chose another order instead of having a new vehicle with body/paint work already done.  This was only done after I proved I didn't put the dent in the door with pics the dealer sent me days before i took delivery. The order was put in but the dealer held onto my refund check for the car until i called and spoke with the ordering manager on 11/29. I had already attempted to contact the salesman (Cory Reedy) several times with no response. That is when I contacted the ordering manager John Weldon and discussed the issue with him. The plates for my old car arrived three days after Cory said they were mailing both overnight. After talking with the ordering manager my check showed up the next afternoon. Also as part of that conversation I reiterated the fact that i wanted to have the same type of written agreement and was unsatisfied with the level of service i was being provided. The order manager was going to look into providing a free tint and possible financial reimbursement for the additional hassle and get back with my within the week. After a week I again contacted Cory and asked for him to follow up with John to get the information he promised to me. He acknowledged but I never received the written agreement. I did receive an email from the customer support representative at Hewlett. She wanted to let me know that I would soon be receiving a survey about the dealership and to make sure I selected the checkbox at the start of the survey stating that i no longer owned the vehicle ""so i would not receive mailers for it"". When i received the survey, I found that by selecting that check box you were opted out of taking the survey. I re-entered the survey and took it without selecting the checkbox. My answers accurately reflected the level of service i was being provided up to that moment. During this time I also contacted corporate GM customer service to let them know about the ordeal (primarily the damage that resulted in transport - not dealer complaints). As the resulting lack of communication from the dealer persisted I brought these issues up with GM corporate. They began to look into the issue. I also was contacted by GM corporate in response to my survey on 12/10. They were quite concerned about the level of service I was provided and were going to contact the salesman and ordering manager to discuss. On 12/11 I received a buyers order from Cory for the 2nd order purchase which included the tint and agreed price for my trade in that was settled in the first agreement. At this point I believed everything was settled, but on the morning of 12/12 I received a text from Cory stating ""this is Cory at Hewlett. The title to your Mustang is in the mail back to you. We are no longer interested in selling you a car. John Weldon said you can call him direct if you would like. His number is (512) 681-3002."" I called John moments after this and left him a voicemail to call me back. I have yet to receive a response.  I bought the car from another dealer that knows how to handle a problem and can call you back.  They also re-listed my first car that had to have body and paint work done as a new vehicle on their site - with no mention of the damage.  ",1.6

I now have a real dilemma, Henna or Hewlett. It looks like I will have to switch allegiance now.  Vehicle shopping to me is like going to the dentist and having a tooth pulled with no Novocaine; however, when we walked in the front door of Hewlett Chevrolet I felt like I was more with friends than salesmen. The clincher was working Lee Dickie. Both my wife and I were just taken back by how down to earth he is, his knowledge of the Traverse and its workings, and his all around approach to the buying/selling experience. Lee is just a great guy. 

Your finance guy, Jeff is a trip.  His straight forward approach and his apparent vast knowledge of the financing and closing of vehicle sales is impressive.

Finally, meeting Mr Hewlett was a distinct honor and pleasure.

1053,"November 17, 2012","SALES - 5/5
Stellar! Don Hewlett was my last stop in a long hunt for a fair price on my new Camaro SS. I visited multiple dealers in Houston, San Antonio, and Austin before meeting Lee at Don Hewlett. The prices were honest, negotiations short (i.e. 5 minutes), and the interactions respectful. 

TRADE-IN - 4/5
Fair value and honest prices. I was happy with the offer for the trade-in, but probably could've gotten more if I'd brought in written offers from other dealers. 

FINANCING - 4/5 
They were a little pushy when it came to the extended warranty. Besides that, the financing was a fairly simple process. They handled the paperwork and details very professionally.

SERVICE - 5/5
Professional and painless. Oil change was honestly priced, team was knowledgeable, and service was quick. I will continue to bring my vehicle here for future service (this is pretty big as I live in Houston).

I knew what I wanted exactly and was seeking a difficult to obtain car model (a Camaro ZL1).  I had been looking for 2-3 months.  Several dealers were charging crazy over-sticker premiums for this car model because it was in such limited supply - but Don Hewlett Chevrolet Buick offered it at a fair price.  Jason answered my first internet inquiry within an hour.  We conducted the whole transaction (excluding picking up the car) in two phone calls and a few emails (I didn't require more interaction than that).

Everything was handled exactly as committed, promptly and professionally.

On the day we picked up our car, Jason met us with a detailed car, full of gas and walked us through all the features of the car.  He synced our phones and set up the car's computer to our preferences.  Again  - the documentation process was as simple as it could be.

I will make sure to go over and beyond to get his name out and pray every one will have the opportunity I did in purchasing their next vehicle. Sometimes I feel people get caught up in sales and forget the importance of customer service WELL NOT HERE and definetley not with JASON LUTHER. Thank you Jason I just can't say enough in words how honored I was to have been able to work with you keep up the amazing work..

We would like to thank Mike Stephens for a job well done.  Our first contact with the Don Hewlett dealership was on the internet.  We knew the SUV we wanted was a Chevrolet Traverse and we sent out a request to the local dealers.

Mike was quick to respond with two offers on the SUV we were looking for, plus a few others at various prices and options.  It was obvious Mike wanted our business and he wanted to deal.

Everyone we met was great to work with including Paul Conrad, Karl Hoehn and Mr. Don Hewlett.  I know we will have a long relationship with Mike Stephens and with Don Hewlett. We highly recommend this dealership.",5.0
1102,"September 15, 2012","I have heard so much about the Don Hewlitt dealership, and the wonderful service, both sales and repair, its staff provides to Hewlitts's customers.  I chose to travel nearly an hour from my city to Round Rock, TX to purchase my new 2012 vehicle, a Buick LaCrosse.  I can attest to all the wonderful things I have heard about this dealership.  From reception until I was handed the keys to my new car, my sales rep rushed from office to office to get things done in the minumum of time.  I also had my executive assistant with me who can also attest to this.  From qualification (my desires), to selection of specific vehicles for showing, showing, test driving, and finally finding the vehicle that fit my desires, and pocketbook,  I made a purchase.  Then, without delay, papers were processed, and of course checks written.  Without a doubt, my sales rep: Mr. Mike Stephens, was right there with me every step of the way.  Before my departure in my new car, Mike devoted over an hour of his time to show me the bells, and whistles on the inside of that car.  What a pleasure it has been showing this car off.  All who have seen it are truly proud of the decision I made on buying this car.  The other staff members at Hewlsitt's were courteous, and greeted me when passing by Mike's office.  I am truly impressed with Hewlitt's facilites.  So spacious and clean.  Thank you Mike, and thank you Mr. Don Hewlitt.  Clem Nadeau    ",5.0

After putting some numbers together and talking to his manager about my trade in value, Jason asked me if I ever consider purchasing 2012 Buick Verano. At first, I was like no, Buicks are for older people and I am in my mid-20s'. After I made the comment, Jason pointed out a red Buick in the dealership and asked me what do I think about the red car. I told him it looks really nice and I can see myself driving the vehicle. I looked inside the car and around him and to my surprise it was 2012 Buick Verano. I was so surprise because Buick normally make big and overside vehicle. We went on a test drive in the Buick and it drove smoother than the Equinox. The next day, I took my first brand name vehicle home. Everyone in the dearlership was so nice and friendly. They introduce themselve and repeatedly asking if it was anything they can do for me. I am so glad I purchased my vehicle at this dealership because I went to three other dealership looking for a new vehicle and they all seem to busy to listen or go out their way to make me feel welcome.",5.0

The salesmen I have worked with have been far from desireable.  So, I was pleasantly surprised to have the professional, yet personable, service I received from Dave Jimenez.  He was quick to answer my calls and kept me informed of current specials and inventory. I felt like he had my back.  Dave was easy to talk to and helped make me feel comfortable with the entire purchasing process.   He was helpful without being overbearing.

1108,"September 10, 2012","We could not have been more satisfied with every aspect of our purchase.  Brian Birdsall made our entire experience painless.  He had every option available to us spelled out with ease so that we could make the right choice for our family.  It truly felt like royal treatment, and your organization should be proud to have him as part of your team.  I hope he remains there for years to come as I want to do business with him again, and again.  Jeff Grazioplene worked up the final financing paperwork, and I would like to commend him on being very informative about warranties & gap insurance.  Jeff also went the extra mile by filling in our repetitive information on all of the forms that had to be signed, thus getting us out the door and into our new/used Suburban & heading home to get the kiddos ready for school the next day in a timely matter.  Last but certainly not least, Mr. Tom Cooremans who handles the extra accessories.  We didn't have the pleasure to meet with him face to face because of the late hour we arrived on Wednesday, but Brian had him on the phone setting up our requests to order a roof mount DVD player & four extra headphones.  When I called yesterday to get an ETA for the installation, Tom opened up another line to the supplier/installer and asked me then and there how today looked for us.  I asked him if he was kidding, and he giggled with that tone of knowing he wasn't because your entire organization is the best, and works with the best.  I was thrilled and told him I needed to see how my wife's schedule looked on getting back up there, and he immediately followed with ""where do you live""?  I laughed and said the opposite end of the world from yall, we live at Slaughter Lane & Manchaca in deep south Austin.  With your vendor still on the other line he then asked if we would like to have the installation completed at our home.  Seriously?!  Apparently your vendor had another job on the south end of town, and apparently that is just how yall do business.  We really are blown away by the whole experience.  You will have my business, next year you may very well have my fleet business for my land surveying firm, and hands down I will recommend Hewlett to everyone in the market for a new or used vehicle.

Donnie helped me find a truck that met my individual needs.  I told him what I wanted and he brought me several options that met my criteria.  I settled on a new Z71 and we made a deal that day.  After Donnie closed the deal, he introduced me to the people in the finance department who did a very good job at explaining to me what was what and why or why not I should take advantage of this or that offer (warranties...etc).  I was very pleased with the way I was treated from the time I got there to the time I drove off in my new truck.  I highly recommend Donnie at Don Hewlett and WILL by another vehicle from Don Hewlett again.

1155,"July 06, 2012","Dave Jimenez was honestly the best car dealer I've worked with.  He was open and honest with me about prices, fees, and how financing works.  This was my first new car and I was very hesitant about walking into a dealership alone.  I didn't understand a lot about how financing works, but Dave explained step by step to ease me through the sale.  

I am happy to say that Dave Jimenez was the only dealer that stuck with me for about 2 1/2 weeks while I was still deciding what I really wanted.  The reason I chose to continue to come back to Don Hewlett was because Dave was the only car dealer that kept calling and texting me to help me through to the sale.  He went above and beyond what he could have and I appreciate what he did for me.  

I love my new car and am happy that I went to Don Hewlett.  

Thank you!

1156,"June 26, 2012","Aric was an excellent salesman. This was our first stop in a line of car dealerships.  After several stops, we had no doubt that we needed to return to Don Hewlett for a car.  The prices of the used car section and the selection of used cars was great, but the customer service that Aric gave us on our first stop was the deal breaker.  He had extensive knowledge on the vehicles on the used car lot, which was important to us since we were changing the make of our current vehicle.  He also stayed within the boundaries we gave him in regards to our price.  He did not make us feel like there was any pressure to buy, but was extremely accommodating to us.  We had two children with us on two visits to the dealership and anyone with children knows the difficulties that this can present.  We would highly recommend him to our friends if they are interested in a making a change in vehicles or need to get a new car.

One day I was searching the web and there it was, the dealership name was Don Hewlett, I call and talk to Jason Luther.  I told him I was interested in a Honda Element but wanted to see more pictures, within 15 minutes He emailed me the pictures.  Called Jason up and made the deal on the phone, all in took was about 5 minutes to get it done.  The next day I drove to Georgetown, OH I live in Corpus Christi, Texas now that a 4 hour drive.  Jason had the element detailed and ready to go.  LOVED IT!!! Made the deal that quick and that easy. I have never had such a pleasant experience as I did with Jason Luther and the Don Hewlett Dealership.  I will be looking to buy a car for my doughter, and I will be going back.  

Thank You Jason Luther, and thank you Don Hewlett for having such a great Dealership.

And, he was an expert with all the systems associated with the vehicle as well as the latest technology. He did not rush the demonstration, but rather helped us with each of the components and personal settings. What is even more impressive about that, is he did it after closing and when he should have been on his way home. One of the things that I find to be the most refreshing feeling after a few days have passed now, is that there has been no regrets.

Phillip was very agreeable to let us take it out for a drive then we left to stop at one more place before deciding on the one we bought. We returned that evening and put a deposit down on the SUV and drove it home for the weekend. We returned on Memorial Day to complete the transaction after we were given our financing options. 

I was very impressed at how professional all of the sales counselors looked with embroidered shirts and name tags. I felt more confident working with someone that has several years experience selling cars and was proud of where he worked. Phillip has followed up immediately with a thank you card and phone call to make sure that we were pleased with the car and our experience at the dealership.

1174,"May 16, 2012","I contacted Don Hewlett Chevrolet along with four other Chevy dealers via email to get quotes. Not only did they have the lowest price of any of the dealerships, but they were also the nicest to work with. One of the other dealers not only tried to sell me a car that was different than I was looking for, but he also called me multiple times when it should have been clear that I wished to converse via email. Luckily when I told the other dealer the quote I was given from Don Hewlett Chevrolet he never bothered contacting me again. Brian Birdsall was my salesperson through the whole process and when I emailed him for more information he was prompt with giving me all the information I needed and would wait a day before emailing me again to make sure I got the information and to see if I had any further questions.

Though I have to say my experience once I got to the dealership was better that I could have possibly hoped for. Every person I met at Don Hewlett Chevrolet was super friendly, but because of Brian I felt like I was being treated like a neighbor instead of a sales number. I also felt as if he actually listened to me answers to questions instead of just asking them as part of a routine. I said I had already done my research and knew which car I wanted to look at, so we went to look at the car and he didn't try to up sell me or ""just show"" me other models. Now before I drove the car we test drove I hadn't driven a manual transmission vehicle in over a decade. In fact I was looking to buy a manual transmission not only for the fuel efficiency, but also to get over my fear. Brian was helpful and encouraging the whole time, and gave me the pointers I needed in order to get my confidence with the vehicle.

Now to top off all other other aspects of this purchase, when Brian was figuring out the financial aspects he asked me if I was thinking about purchasing the car that day, because if I was then he will just grab some extra info to make it easier to fill out the forms if I do decide to purchase the vehicle that day. I was shocked because he had already been so accommodating that I assumed that he assumed I was there to buy the vehicle that day.

In terms of price, not only did he give me a price lower than any other dealer, but it was lower than I could get it from the employee purchase program(gmfamilyfirst.com). On top of that he worked with me on my trade in and got me a good deal on the 12 year old vehicle I was trading in.

Overall the entire experience was great. After I purchased the car he walked me through all of the features and made sure I was familiar with every aspect. He did all of this even though it was now after closing time, and didn't rush through any of it. He even game me a few more pointers on how to better my manual transmission driving.

The words that really resonate with me, probably because of how sincere I believe they were, is when Brian said, ""I don't want to sell you a car if you aren't going to be completely happy with it."" I love my new car, and the experience I had purchasing it was phenomenal.",5.0

He shook hands with my sons and my 3 year old diva and actually LISTENED to what we were looking for, even though my boys informed him that we were looking for a stick shift with buttons on the steering wheel! He immediately grabbed a golf cart and took us to all three lots to make sure we had a chance to look over all the 2012 inventory just in case I hadn't found what I was looking for in the main lot. He never once tried to steer my interest towards a higher priced car.  He never once made any type of statement just to get the sale.  He was honest and up front the entire process and made sure I knew that he would do everything possible and within reason to help me get the car at the price I wanted. 

My favorite piece is that I had the car I wanted and the papers drawn up in about an hour and a half.  When we came to pick it up, he sat with me to activate OnStar, sync my cell phone, and go over every piece of equipment inside and out. He even offered to be my own human cliffsnotes in the future with any detail of the car I couldn't figure out on my own.  Since my early 20s I have managed to buy 8 cars from 4 different dealers.

I live in San Antonio, but contacted Hewlett Chevrolet on the internet since I could not find the truck here that I wanted. Jason Luther and I worked out our deal on the internet, and Friday I made the trip to Georgetown to complete the transaction. They told me to look for the big blue roof from I35 and as I was approaching the dealership I was amazed at the inventory of vehicles they stock...way more than any dealer in San Antonio. Can you say ""stock 'em deep and sell 'em cheap?"" 

I don't think I've ever had an easier truck purchase than with this dealership. Jason went the extra mile to get the truck and the deal I wanted. In addition they gave me a loaner while my truck was in make-ready and accessories that I selected were installed. The following Tuesday Jason brought the new truck to my home in San Antonio. How cool is that?! Jason, you made a friend for life.

This dealership is all about service and getting you the deal so sweet that you can't refuse. I work in a private school whose culture is family oriented, and this dealership has that same culture. I felt right at home.

1214,"March 14, 2012","To Whom it May Concern:

My wife and I recently stopped in at Don Hewlett Chevorlet while comparing small sedans for my daughters 16th birthday. We we're greeted by salesman Jason Luther. We informed Jason that we were merely comparing brands of vehicles and were not prepared to buy at that time. With that knowledge Jason still gladly showed us the Sonic and Cruz while answering any questions we had. Jason's demonstration and explanation of the vehicles very informative and entertaining. 

Jason's professionalism and courtesy along with features and quality of the vehicles had us nearly sold on Chevorlet although we have had never owned a Chevy nor were we don with our comparison shopping. However, after taking a few extra days to shop other vehicles we decided on the Sonic LT. We contacted Jason and informed him that we intended to purchase from him for our daughters birthday which was quickly approaching. Jason not only made the buying process very easy he went the extra mile by setting up the vehicle on the show room floor with ribbons, balloons and a birthday cake. My daughters reaction was priceless when she saw the set up. She later commented that all the salesmen were ""so nice"" because several of them came by and wished her a happy birthday.

Chevorlet and Jason has definitely earned my future business!

1221,"March 09, 2012","This is a Service after the sale review.

I finished writing a (5 out of 5 stars) review for this salesman and dealership on the purchase of a truck. I will say before I begin with the second review, I stand behind the purchase of a vehicle from Don Hewlett A+. However, next time when I write a review, I will wait till there is a problem, then see how they (Dealership) respond with service.
So, I am going to revise my review and rate as a whole--Sales and Service.

When I had a problem with a ""warranty"" issue please read below-I have posted on Knapp Chevrolet-Houston. 

This review is for both Knapp Chevrolet and Don Hewlett (Georgetown). I will post on Don Hewlett as well. Purchased a 2009 HD2500 Z71 4x4 LTZ approximately 6 weeks ago--End of January 2012--from Don Hewlett. 
On March 8, 2012 was driving down a neighborhood street and crossed a road hump doing approximately 10 mph. A loud pop occurred on drivers front side and truck was lowered down-appeared to be a flat tire. After taking a look found no flat tire, but could not see under truck due to being to low to ground. Called wrecker and towed me to Knapp Chevrolet (Houston), where I was told the following--""It appears that who ever performed the last alignment didn't tighten the nuts on the cam bushings"" ""Will"" then asked where did I put the new tires on--I commented that I had not touched the truck and that those tires were on on the truck when purchased. Well of course the parts were not covered under the 12 month/12,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty. After a few more minutes trying to convince Will i didn't put those tires on the truck-he said I would have to pay for a new alignment--$119.00. I called my salesman at Don Hewlett--Sam Evans and repeated the story. He said he would take care of it the next day that it should be under the bumper to bumper warranty and they would call Knapp. Friday morning i got a call from Will-Knapp of course stating that the torsion bar was damaged and needed replacing-$286.00-kind of saw that coming-never as simple as they say. Informed Sam with Don Hewlett and then received a call back informing me that Don Hewlett won't cover the parts/labor because not even the standard warranty covers the front suspension. After much discussion back and forth about what does ""Certified Chevrolet"" mean they still won't cover the problem. Sam commented that they checked the alignment and took tires off, but didn't check all the nuts and bolts. Sam stated that if the truck was at there location they could cover or at the very least just have me pay for parts alone. Sam commented that he (Don Hewlett) and his service manager can't be certain that Will at Knapp is telling the whole truth about the problem. If I would of broke down by there dealership it would have been taken care of. Had i taken this truck off road or through the mud I might could understand me having to pay, but I had put only highway miles on this truck. 
The reason ""Will"" with Knapp Chevrolet is getting a bad review is that there is no communication between the dealerships and that ""Will"" didn't believe that Don Hewlett had put the tires on the truck. He insinuated that I was not truthful in the tire/alignment issue. 
I see that Service after the sale is non-existent mostly within two months after the sale of truck. Certified - Well, Obviously means ""limited and and what breaks will ""most"" likely not covered under the warranty"". 

I'm more disappointed in Don Hewlett being that is where I purchased the vehicle. 

Will post on all Car related websites.

Aric immediately made me feel welcome and valued.  He was never pushy but did a great job of supporting me as I learned about the cars and decided what I wanted.  His shared excitement in the process was really cool.  I ended up having some very specific requests for the car I purchased (2012 Camaro SS).  Aric was tenacious and located the vehicle, had it available in just a couple of days, at a very VERY good price.  I had visited 5 Chevy dealerships in Austin, Aric and Hewlett made the best impression on me BY FAR.  They lived up to this throughout the entire sale.  Even the dreaded finance step was a cake walk, with ZERO shenanigans!  Got the rate I wanted, no high pressure to accept stuff I didn't want (though I was presented those options had I wanted them.) Buddy did a great job on this very important final step and I was out of there in like 15 minutes.  So, I'm now an ardent fan of Hewlett Chevrolet... and will push anyone I know to buy from Aric specifically.",5.0
1225,"March 08, 2012","I found the experience to be very good.  Aric was very helpful with assisting me with my needs and answered my questions all along the process.  Aric was very accommodating by coming to my place of employment to take my vehicle to have it appraised for me when my schedule didn't allow for me to do this process.  I would highly recommend Aric if purchasing a new vehicle.

The finance person was outstanding in the way he assisted me and the information he provided to me.  He was very good to work with and made my experience overall very good.  

I had talks with Rick Jehl and he went out of his way to assist me with my purchase.  Clearly, he is a manager that is truly concerned with meeting/addressing the needs of his customer.  

Overall, my experience at Don Hewlett was outstanding and I would/will recommend this Dealership to my family and friends.

The salesman seemed to be pleasant at first when I told him what I was looking for.  After test driving 2 different cars, I choose a car and went to the office, I told him where I wanted my payments to be for the car I wanted but he was unable to get them down to where I needed them for a Black 2011 Honda CRV with less than 15,000 miles on it and was dealer printed value priced at $21,095 (as indicated on the paperwork that was attached to the vehicle), so then he looked through the inventory and he showed me a White 08 Chevy Equinox with a little over 39,000 miles on it, that was really nice and was dealer printed value priced at $18,995, however since he knew that I had financing he didn't want to back down on the price and later brought me a paper on Don Hewlett header that stated the car was actually worth $20,000 something (even though that was not indicated anywhere on the paperwork attached to the vehicle at all); since he didn't want to budge and he acted really rude when I told him to take my offer to the manager, he came back moments after and told me that the car was worth more than the printed paper value on the vehicle and bla blah blah....then told me if there was anything else that I wanted to look at (with an attitude, and a smug look) I told him no and he was like fine leave.  I guess that he thought that I would come crawling back and say that I would go for the car at asking price, but he was sadly mistaken. I'm not sure how they expect to make a sale with that attitude. He was really awful, after he knew how much I could pay per month he wanted me to pay about $16.00 dollars less per month than the 2011 that I originally wanted...for an 08 really, I don't think so...the value of both vehicles is completely different...He was definitely in it to make money and didn’t have any regard for the consumer…I would not recommend this dealership to my worst enemy.

Cory gave us hope from day one when Luis showed up at the dealer one night five min to eight, he still took the time to get most of our information and showed Luis some vehicles.  As promised he called us the next day and our journey began.

We truly want to Thank all of you for all of your hard work and patience. We know that our situation was not easy and took a lot of time. Carl Thank you for talking to the banks to make this deal happen and to get such a great interest rate!

Cory and Buddy thank you for waiting for us to close the deal, even after closing hours and taking your time to explain all the paper work and extra added features of our new 2010 Chevy Malibu. Be assured that we will recommend Don Hewlett to all of our friends and family.

Sincerely,

1259,"January 23, 2012","My experience with Lee and the dealership was very positive. Lee was knowledgeable about the particular car in which I had an interest (2012 Chevy Volt) and able to aptly demonstrate its features and capabilities. Considering the newness of the model and its technology, that is not a given. If he didn't have an immediate answer to any of my questions, he would research the issue and quickly get back to me. Of particular importance to me was that he handled the relationship in a friendly yet professional, non-pressure manner. I felt he offered a fair price for the car I purchased and gave me a reasonable trade-in value for the one I surrendered. Once the buying decision was made, the transaction was closed quickly and professionally by the dealership's business manager, Karl Hoehn, with excellent financing terms provided.",4.8

Mr. Blank was helpful and made the process much less stressful.  The one thing I liked the most was that I dealt with one person until we agreed on a price.  Not one time did Mr. Blank have to leave his office to talk with some sales manager.  Maybe he did it electronically from his computer, but that's OK.  I have walked on salesmen for leaving me at their desk too long.  I will definitely go back next time I buy a GM.",5.0

1264,"January 18, 2012","I have to admit, I don't usually deal with car dealerships when purchasing cars or motorcycles. I often go with private owners. I find the actual owners to be easier to deal with. I don't care for pressure to buy. I did research on the car I wanted and then did a search on autotrader.com. I found 8 cars that matched my search. I narrowed it down to two. Both were dealers. One was Don Hewlett Chevrolet which is how I met Mike Stevens. He was extremely helpful early on answering all my questions. I had a budget for this car and he respected that. We were able to make a deal. He was just as helpful in person as he was on the internet. It was a great experience from start to finish. I recommend Don Hewlett Chevrolet and more importantly I recommend my salesman, Mike Stevens to handle all of your automobile needs. You won't regret it.

I would receive an email from him from time to time, but he gave me the space needed to get it together.  Mike stayed connected.  This week, I still had the same very old car to trade, but I also had a down payment.  It was finally doable for me.  Mike was great at returning calls, emails, and answering all questions.

1276,"January 09, 2012","We have purchased two new cars in the past two years.  Working with Cory Reedy of Don Hewlett Chevrolet was by far the best experience we've ever had with a car salesman.  Cory's friendly manner was very engaging and helpful.  He was never pushy or overbearing.  He asked a few questions and immediately understood what we wanted even though we were not so sure ourselves.  He helped clarify the final decision immensely, as the inventory of vehicles is somewhat daunting to a couple of country bumpkins like us.  He seemed to know everything about every truck we tried or showed any interest in. He was very knowledgeable about the performance, engines, accessories, and more. 

We were first acquainted with Cory via the internet as we were researching vehicles and comparing prices on your website.  He called within a few minutes of my husband entering our information, surprisingly at 8 PM.  We drove over to meet him the next day.  That says a lot about his telephone personality.  That his voice would reflect friendliness without scaring us off with a high pitched sales dialogue, which I assure you, would have turned us off and we would never have made the trip to Georgetown.

We love our new Avalanche and look forward to many years of service from this vehicle.  And, we know where we will go and who we'll ask for if we ever decide to buy another vehicle:  Cory Reedy at Don Hewlett.

1279,"January 06, 2012","I bought a 2012 Chevy Equinox from Don Hewlett Chevrolet and found it to be a great experience.  When I came in for a test drive, everyone was busy, so a manager in another department, Tommy Cooremans, stepped in and took us out so we didn't have to wait.  My sales rep, Jason Luther, was very friendly and professional.  I had done a ton of online research and knew exactly what I wanted. When I was ready, I engaged him through their Internet sales office. I found him to be the most responsive of all dealers I reached out to. He kept in constant contact with me during the buying process, keeping me abreast of the progress all along the way.  

The Equinox model I wanted wasn't available here and Jason looked all over the state to find it for me and then worked to get it here as quickly as possible, even over a holiday weekend.  Jason was great at managing all the tasks so that we weren't sitting around wasting time while we waited for the car to arrive. For example, he got my trade in evaluated (at double what I thought I'd get), drew up the initial paperwork, and ordered the add on items I wanted... while we waited on the delivery.  He also went above and beyond on other things. I'd left some personal things in my traded in car and he retrieved them for me and he was flexible on my getting him some paperwork on the trade in, saving me an extra trip home and back to the dealership.  

When I worked with Karl in finance, it was the easiest process I've ever had on the finance side. We had a negotiated rate so the numbers were pretty straight forward. But Karl went above and beyond and got me an even better interest rate than I'd been pre-approved for through my bank. He had me in and out in less than 30 minutes and was professional enough to offer me some of the add on products (like a warranty) without being pushy or condescending, which has been my past experience when buying a car. 

Everyone at the dealership was friendly and helpful and I am thrilled with my purchase.  I would definitely recommend Don Hewlett in Georgetown, Tx. if you are in the market for a new car.  And you guys and gals in Ft. Hood... take the drive. They offer some incentives for the military! ",5.0

I knew what I wanted, and after several months of contemplating buying a new truck; I saw a TV commercial for Don Hewlitt in Georgetown.  The advertised price made me a bit skeptical, until I saw Capital Chevrolet offer that same truck for the same price.  I decided I would give Hewlitt a try since I saw them first; but said to myself. ""If I get pressured or ""pushed"" in any way to make a move now before the prices go up....I was out of there.""   THAT DID NOT HAPPEN.  I told Jason what I was looking for.  And he showed me some that were NOT within my price range...but not his fault...since I had not told him what I could afford.  After viewing a couple of extremely nice trucks...and realizing that there was no way I could afford the ""loaded"" bigger models (which I didn't really want anyway)  I told him what I saw on the TV commercial and price.  Said to him....Show me one of those (TV Ad)  He did, and explained the various differences but with still a lot of great features that I really enjoy.  And from then it was a done deal with him.  He was very courteous, caring and effecient.   The next thing I know I am signing papers and it is mine.

1299,"December 17, 2011","I was shopping for a low milage used Traverse and walked away from another Chevrolet Dealership at signing, after being disappointed with their lack of service.  I went to Hewlett after speaking with Brian Birdsall on the phone.  They had several cars fitting my needs.  The dealership operates both new and used sales from the same building and all their sales associates are familiar with new and used inventories.   Brian met us at the appointed time, and was both friendly and professional.  He knew the location of the cars we were interested in and located them easily.  He pointed out features in the Traverse that I was not previously aware, even though I was ready to buy at the previous mentioned dealership.  The vehicles I looked at and drove were sparkling clean and undistinguishable from a brand new car!  I selected a great vehicle and Brian and I worked together to get a fair deal for a well used trade- in, a great interest rate and a reduced price of the vehicle.  A true Win-Win deal.

while we waited, we learned that every Saturday during college football season they order pizza for all to enjoy.  We were also introduced to the ""accessories"" manager for any extras we might be interested in.  While waiting for Jeff, the business manager, I enjoyed the display and information posted about the history of Texas flags throughout the years.  Jeff was another quality man, like Brian, personable and professional. I inquired about extended warranties and he was able to point out the pros and cons and what would best fit my needs.  As I was presented papers to sign, each was explained and I was given time to read through them at my pace without feeling rushed.  After the deal was finalized, the car was presented and Brian set up the Bluetooth feature, Onstar and Xm radio.  He went through all the operation features of the car until I was able to operate them, and assured me he was just a phone call away for further assistance.

Hewlett Chevorlet earned my business and valued me as a customer.  They had the inventory I was looking for and the knowledge about the vehicles features.  Every employee was friendly and the time spent in the showroom was like sitting around a comfortable family room.  The facility was sparkling clean, coffee, bottled water, pizza and soda, and popcorn.  I mention that to illustrate the length they go to make their customers comfortable.

1313,"September 04, 2011","To Whom it may concern

   Don Hewlett Chevrolet is one of the best dealerships I have had the pleasure to work with when it comes to buying a truck. The thing that made it special was the salesman that my family and I got to work with on the deal. Mr.Steve Simik is the standard for what a salesman is and should be. Mr. Simik puts the customer and in this case my family first in everything that he did for us. Mr. Simik would be putting in all the information that was required for making the purchase of my truck in his computer and when we had a question of any kind he would stop what he was doing on his computer and answer the question. He put us first then went back to the computer only after he made sure we were take care of. Even when our 12 year old daughter needed directions and questions answered, Mr. Simik would stop look us in the eye and made sure all of our issues were taken care of first. Mr. Simik displays the example of what a salesman should be by putting people first. Knowing and understanding exactly what they want and making sure that when the customer shows up he is ready, the vehicle is in a specific location and no one has to go running after the vehicle and what is more important to me is the Trck was prepared just as if it was already sold waiting for delivery. Mr. Simik does what it takes to make sure that my family and I understand how a Truck such as the Silverado LTZ operates, not just put a key in and drive but every feature was explaned in detail what it does and how the features work. 
   There are always awards and bonuses for jobs well done. Let me tell you this was a prime example of a job very well done.If I were CEO of General Motors Corp. for a day I would made sure that the name of Mr. Steve Simik was on the top of the list for any bonuses and/or awards given at the headquarters of the General Motors Corp. I have always been a Chevy Truck owner and I have just bought the best truck that I will ever have. That is because of the quality service that my family and I recieved from Mr. Simik.
NOTE: Please make sure that Mr. Simik gets a copy of thas for his files.

1318,"August 08, 2011","After a bad experience I had with Connell Chevrolet I said I would not buy another GM product again. Not because the product was that bad, it was because of the lack of customer service. My wife had an accident with her 1999 Tahoe, the vehicle was totaled and she walked away without a scratch, soft tissue damage but nothing serious. She had to have another Tahoe. we seen a Tahoe at a good price at Allan Samuels in Waco, made arrangements to test drive it and possible buy it but when we went there to take a test drive the had sold that vehicle and tried to sell me a new on at thousands more than the first Tahoe was listed at. After being suckered to Waco I told my wife she was not getting another GM vehicle and we almost purchased a Volvo XC90. The XC90 did not meet our needs and the only SUV the wife really liked was the Tahoe. I was dealing with Don Ringler for a Tahoe and then I seen you had a pretty good discount on them so I contacted Don Hewlett via your web site and eventually was called by Cory Reedy and set up an appointment to view the vehicle. I have bought a few vehicles but I must say this is one of the best experiences. We felt no pressure from Cory, I told him the interior and exterior colors we liked and the ones that were out of the question and the options we wanted. Cory took us out to the lot and showed us a couple of vehicles that met our criteria. We liked one of them but Cory suggested we go to the other lot to see if there was one over there we might like. We ended up with two vehicles we liked and Cory took the time to park them side by side so we could get a better idea of what they looked like together. We decided on one and while we were going thru the paperwork we asked Cory if we could go back and see them again. We ended up changing our mind and bought the other one. Cory was very helpful and did not try and rush us thru the process. The paperwork process was pretty quick and smooth and the only thing that that was bothersome was the time spent waiting on the financing department. Even though we were not financing the vehicle the wait time was a little longer than I would of liked. While we were waiting Cory continued to check on us, he did not treat us like the sale was done so his part was over. To sum it up because of the experience I had with Cory and Don Hewlett Chevrolet, GM may have won a customer back.",4.8
1319,"August 05, 2011","Don Hewlett Chevrolet Buick was very highly recommended to me by friends and I was not disappointed. 

Brian Birdsall was my salesman and he was by far the best salesman I have ever come into contact with during my car shopping experience. He was friendly (but in a sincere way, not in a ""smoozy car salesman"" way) he spent a lot of time with me explaining the features of the new vehicle, test driving, discussing the package options and so forth. He helped me find the best model to match my exact needs. When I told him I wanted to some time to make a decision, he was understanding and not at all pushy or aggressive, as other dealership salesmen tend to be at that time. When I did return the next day (because I absolutely loved the vehicle) ready to discuss purchase further, he took time with me and patiently went over all the options and worked with me on my trade in, until we reached a fair conclusion. I was treated very fairly and with respect during the entire conversation, which is very important to me. It says a lot about Brian that he never made me feel like he was just ""trying to make a sale"". 

The most impressive part however, was after the sale. Once I signed the contract, Brian was still available and there to help. He sat with me in my new car and explained all the new features and how to use them (he even helped me register my OnStar!) making sure I was comfortable and that all of my questions were answered. When I drove off the lot, I had a beautiful shiny, new Chevrolet Equinox and a huge smile on my face. 

I have alway selected my car purchases not only based upon the vehicle itself, but the dealership and the way in which I am treated. I feel very secure and confident in Don Hewlett Chevrolet Buick. I know that they will continue to take good care of me as a customer throughout my ownership. I have already further recommended them to several friends as THE place to go to purchase their next vehicle.

He was not the typical pushy salesperson... he kept moving the process forward at my speed answering all of my questions until I was satisfied.  He sold 5 vehicles the day I bought my truck, and I never felt like I wasn't his primary focus.  That takes much interpersonal skill and professionalism.  I came to Don Hewlett after working for nearly 3 weeks with another dealership in the area.  I was highly disappointed in that dealership's unwillingness to honor their promises and agreements.

Truthfully, I was somewhat dreading the process of dealing with a  salesperson who would string me along while I wasted hours just trying to find out if this SUV was priced within our comfort zone.  Luckily, I sent an email inquiry to your dealership and Phillip Davis responded.  I received an email back almost immediately (it was late night).  The next morning Phillip called me and left a message.   His follow-up was impeccable.  He then proceeded to quote me a fair and reasonable price via email without haggling and wasting time.  No other dealership (I contacted four via email that night) followed up with me other than an email auto reply. Phillip and I  corresponded for most of the day and my husband and I bought our Tahoe from him that evening.  

I want you to know how pleased we are with our new Tahoe.  I also wanted to let you know that Phillip was the best car salesman we have ever worked with.  He was honest and informative and did not waste our time.  I really did not believe that a car purchase could go this smoothly.  You should also know that we purchased this car on a Saturday night when Phillip was scheduled to leave at 6:00pm.  Unfortunately, we were unavoidably delayed but he stayed late to help us anyway.  He also assured us that he was happy to do so.  I want everyone to know what a pleasure it was to work with Phillip and that I will recommend him to all my family and friends!

Until i came across the listing for our now really nice 2007 Ford Focus SE listed on the Internet by Don Hewlett Chevrolet in Georgetown Texas I had not found anything that i was really interested in. This car is very clean inside and out and gets great mpg. This car has a lot of extras.
 
I e-mailed an inquiry and Eric Reil-Internet Sales contacted me shortly about my inquiry. He was very courteous, friendly and answered all my questions. I made an appointment for the next Wednesday. When i arrived at the dealership all that i came in contact with were very courteous. The receptionist paged Aric and he came right out to greet me. He was very courteous and friendly. He showed me what i came to see and test drive. The test drive was really great. I really wanted this car! I told Aric what I would pay for this car. I really did not think it would happen since they were already quit a bit below Kelly Blue Book. Aric said that he would take it to management and see if a deal could be made. Not long after he left he came back and told me,with an extended hand, that we had a deal. From there it was basic paper work. I can not express enough how friendly, courteous and professional everyone i came in contact with was. It was a great and memorable experience.

After walking the lot, I choose two that really interested me, a Chevrolet&Ford. While still on the lot, he walked me through the pros&cons of both vehicles.

Cory Reedy, our salesman, was prompt, courteous, friendly, knowledgeable, and gave us a good deal on a quality automobile that was just what we wanted and needed.  He followed up the sale with a phone call and researched and found an answer to a question we had about the auto.  We will definitely be using them for all of our vehicle needs.  Thanks, again.

After the test drive we went in and started doing the paperwork, and even though I already secured a loan, he said let's try to see if we can get a better rate.  Because of Phillip, I not only saved an enormous amount on the car itself, I was approved even with not so good credit for a better rate than I had been guaranteed with the loan I had already secured.  He showed me that Don Hewlett's reputation with finance companies can go a long way to help get the best deal on a car.

1379,"May 23, 2011","Cory Reedy at Don Hewlett in Georgetown did a fantastic job facilitating the purchase of our new Suburban. Cory's work-ethic and dedication to his customers was like none I've seen before.

I researched dozens of vehicles and dealerships, and sent online inquiries to various dealers. Cory not only responded the same evening I sent my questions, but no dealer put half the effort into their reply. I couldn't believe how thorough it was - he'd obviously put time and thought into finding a truck that would be right for us, based on the information I'd submitted. He not only provided the most applicable vehicle choices, but went even further to extrapolate from my criteria...and what else might meet our needs. This brought my attention to features and optional packages I wasn't aware of or hadn't previously considered. 
And I hadn't even come in for a test drive yet.

Mr. Reedy was professional, supportive, considerate and incredibly patient while I contemplated the vehicle and features I wanted. He maintained constant contact - determined to find a truck best suited to us, without being pushy or aggressive.

Additionally, the dealer's reputation, professionalism, quality of sales and service departments, efficiency and long-term customer satisfaction in the community was critical as well. Don Hewlett - from sales, finance, and service has been exceptional.

I want to thank Cory, for his belief in his products, his respect for our needs, and his confidence that he could make those two come together. I can't recommend Don Hewlett Chevrolet and Mr. Reedy highly enough. We love our new truck!

follow up: Later I took my truck to the dealership when some install material was left behind after upgrading the tires. No one was available to clean it on that busy Friday, so Cory took it to the back and detailed the exterior of the Suburban himself. In nice clothes - on his lunch hour. I was shocked!!. Thank you!!

I was provided a round about no bull price by the search engine. Then the emails from the dealerships began to flood in.

In steps PHILLIP DAVIS with Don Hewlett Chevy...Holy cow the man was on it. He understood exactly what I wanted and understood that he was dealing with a military man that does'nt take too kindly to slow responses and lack of ATTENTION TO DETAIL. The man listened to what I wanted, delivered an unbeatable price, and sealed the deal within 5 working days. He understood my situation and made himself available even on his off time. He understood that I knew what I wanted and did'nt try to pull the wool over my eyes.

1391,"May 06, 2011","I had my own mechanic fix my headache rack..The right light which I waited an extra hour for a bulb for yesterday was broken as well as the entire wiring harness was not wired correctly and had to be rewired…

The cost to me was $53.06.  I would like to get credit from Hewlett on that bill since I have zero faith in the ability to procure or install accessories correctly and on-time.  I had to go with someone I trust and unfortunately it is not my dealer.

I am done with Don Hewlett for awhile.  I would still buy and recommend buying a vehicle from Lee but I would not recommend the purchase of accessories with a new vehicle or after market.  I have spent over $5K on additional products for my vehicle and have remained a loyal customer throughout my accessories experience.  I am exactly the customer profile that you want to come into your dealership to purchase a vehicle (Good income, solid credit history, willing to upgrade if it meets my needs and most importantly the ability to recommend your products and services to others).

My intent is to call out the process here and not individuals.  Here is my accessories story that I hope you share as a process improvement opportunity for everyone involving retaining “great customers”.

Wrong Tires on my truck that I purchased from the dealer (My own mechanic called out the issue and I had to go back to the 3rd party tire dealer to get the right tires) – Total 4 Hours
Bumper Installation – 2 trips (Wrong Rear Bumper ordered) – Was not made aware of the issue until I arrived for installation and had to make an additional appointment to complete  installation – Total 6 Hours
Head-Ache Rack Installation – Arrived for installation and waited but was informed part was not delivered after I was told everything was ready to go  – Total 3 Hours
Head-Ache Rack Installation – ½ day to install rack and was not wired correctly and had a faulty light when I was told and waited an additional hour that it was fixed – Total 4 Hours
Head-Ache Rack Installation – Had my own mechanic fix the light and wiring – Total of 1 Hour ($53.06 cost to me for parts/labor)

If this type of service happened to me on accessories, I am very concerned about bringing in my both of my vehicles which I purchased from Hewlett for warranty service that I also purchased in the future.

Thanks for listening, and as a long time Georgetown resident keeping our business local has always been a priority for us.  We are just very disappointed involving this entire experience with our local dealer and I felt the need to finally let someone at the dealership know about it.

However, your Finance team took care of it without skipping a beat. Jason even followed me back to the airport so that I could return my rental and then gave me a ride back to the dealership.  Jason then went through the process of assisting me with the set-up of OnStar and XM.

The process of ordering the Volt and following the car's progress through production was clear and unfolded just as he explained.  I had email responses from Brian regularly to all my questions which made the buying experience much easier and much less nerve-racking.  During the process when it became clear that the dealership would be receiving a new Volt identical to the one I had ordered, Brian got approval to change my order so that I could get the Volt that arrived sooner, which I picked up yesterday.  The experience at the dealership was the best I have ever had.  There was no pressure to buy anything ""extra"", and there were no changes or surprises from what I had been told during the time I was waiting for the car.  My trade-in was valued at exactly what I was told and the estimate of my final price was perfectly accurate.  All in all, you cannot ask for more from a car-buying experience.

1407,"April 21, 2011","  I found you dealership through USAA auto site.  Lee was the first response I received. I also received responses from Connell and Don Ringler.  
  I first went to Connell because they are located here in Killeen.  It was not a good experience, and I would never consider buying a vehicle from them.  If anyone were to ask, I would tell them the Connell has an ""attitude"" like they're doing you a favor to talk to you.  Since then I have talked to a few people that feel the same way.
  I then went to Don Ringler, and it was a totally different experience.  I was treated very well, and made to feel comfortable being there.  I probably would have purchase an Equinox from them if they had one I wanted in stock.
  This covered a 3 or 4 day period.  During this time I either received a phone call or email from Lee.  I didn't feel as though he was bothering me, because he was never really pushy.  I didn't want to go to your dealership because of the distance and the waste of time if the price was to high or you were like Connell.
  However, on Saturday I gave Lee a call to say I'd coming down if he had any Equinox in stock that had a sun roof, that my time was limited, that I had my own financing, that I didn't want to be ""jacked around"", and that he felt he could meet or beat a price I already had. He said he felt he could accommodate me.  When my wife and I arrived, Lee a an Equinox waiting for us to look at under the canopy (which was a great help because my wife was on crutches).  Because of our time schedule, as he was showing us the vehicle he was having our trade-in appraised to save time.  When he was notified the appraisal was completed he went in to get us a price.  When he came back with the price I felt the trip was a waste of our time.  You were even higher than Connell.  I told him that you were way lower on trade-in, so he went back in and came back with a price $79.00 less than Ringler.  So we said we'd take it, but we were in a hurry.  Lee did everything in his power to make sure we were able to meet our schedule, and he did.  Lee, and everyone else at your dealership involved with our purchase, was most accommodating.
  When it comes time to purchase another vehicle, Lee and Don Hewlett will be our first call, not our last.  Lee and everyone else we dealt with there were respectful, friendly, and accommodating.  Never pushy or hard sell.  Since the purchase I email Lee with a couple of questions, and he was quick to respond with the answers.
  The reason I gave pricing a 4 rather than a 5 was because I always feel a dealership can do a little better on pricing.

They appraised our trade in and then came back with a number for us to look at.  I was not too tickled with it and made my first and last counter offer.  Aric took the  figures to the manager i guess.  At this point i figured, ""here we go""  a few minutes later he came back and the counter offer was dead on.  we shook and sealed the deal right then and there.  while we were doing the paperwork with Jeff, Aric had the car detailed, filled with gas.  We had made arrangements for some add ons like all glass tinted, all weather mats, and mud flaps (molded).  Then Aric took a great deal of time showing all the bells and whistles and how they worked,  He was very patient and made sure the wife understood it all, (its her car).  While at the dealership he made sure we were comfortable, had sodas or water.  He made arrangements for us to bring it back to have the items installed.  I was geared up for a tooth and nail fight, but it never happened.  I would highly recommend this dealership and Aric to anyone thinking a new veh.    It was worth the drive to Georgetown for this fantastic experience.  Again, thanks to Arick and the dealership to make this a painless new car purchase.  I was more than pleasantly surprised.

Brian didn't put any pressure on us to commit because he knew it was not the car we wanted.  He continued to keep us updated on new inventory and over the past 5 months has worked with us numerous times as we came out to test drive vehicles.  We did not find a car until now, but each time Brian went out of his way to take time to show us around.  I doubt we would have continued to come back if it weren't for Brian.  We finally saw an Audi which was the car we wanted, it was on a back lot and when we went to test drive it we where told by the VW dealership that a salesman had taken it to the car wash and would be right back, after 3 hours and much tenacity from Brian the car was finally brought back to the dealership for us to drive, and good thing it did because we bought it.  I cant say enough about Brian and the time he spent with us we will definitely recommend him in the future.  The only suggestion I have is to talk with whoever was giving us the run around at the VW dealership, it was very frustrating waiting around to drive a car that a salesman was joy riding in.  Even though this was going on Brian never showed frustration and kept calling the sales manager to get us a test drive.  Brian has earned our business and we will definitely be back next time we need a vehicle.

My first step was to send an email to the internet sales address for each of four Austin Texas area Chevrolet dealers. One ignored two emails. Another sent a robo-form but did not follow-up. The third sent a slightly more customized response but then he called several times in rapid succession, did not answer when I called back, and then dropped the matter.

I first got a generic response from Don Hewlett as well. But soon thereafter, Phillip Davis sent a more comprehensive response with relevant information.

Phillip was there when I needed him and out of my face when I didn't.

Then we went inside and Jason came out to show us some cars.  He did a great job and was very knowledgeable.  The next day I went online via chat to get a quote on a Traverse, and Karina came online.  We chatted and she said she'd email me to confirm the price and to confirm a time for me to come test drive the vehicle.  She didn't get me a price, and didn't EVER respond back to me.  She had my phone number and email.  So I drove up to the dealership and Brian took us for a test drive.  He was nice and helpful.  We determined that we wanted to make an offer on the car, and worked to negotiate the price.  We ended up leaving to think more about it and to compare prices for comparable vehicles.  Ultimately, we came back the next day and worked with Jason to get the car.  We were pleased that it was cleaned and ready to go when we arrived.  Finance was backed up so we spent 2 hours waiting to be seen.  We loved our finance guy - can't remember his name but he was great!  Then Brian went over last details about the car and told us that this dealer review would be coming.  He mentioned that folks would only get their big ""payouts"" if all answers above were 5's.  I'm in sales myself, selling software with a TCV of $100K-$3M, and this was very tacky.  If you do your job well, you earn the 5's.  Karina and the chat were the biggest let down of Don Hewlett.

Aric C Reil called us back promptly and scheduled a time for us to visit the dealership. Our overall experience with Aric was very satisfactory. Aric was extremely friendly, knowledgeable and professional. Even though we went home without a truck on our first meeting with Aric, the experience was extremely hassle-free.  What made us return to the dealership was Aric's honesty, professionalism and outstanding customer service. Aric was also very friendly and personable. We are a very satisfied and happy customer and want to thank Aric for the great experience at Don Hewlett. We will definitely return to Don Hewlett for any future purchases and highly recommend Aric and Don Hewlett to our family and friends. ",5.0

1444,"February 24, 2011","We contacted Hewlett Chevrolet by the internet looking for a new Chev Traverse. Phillip Davis is internet sales, so he responded with sample vehicles we might be interested in. When we went to the dealership, we asked for Phillip, who is very friendly and outgoing. He asked us what we wanted, not what he wanted to sell, which is refreshing for a car dealership. The entire deal was not high pressure, which is not the way I like to buy something as important aa a new car. We found a Traverse that we liked, and we purchased it the same day and drove it home. Everyone we have met was very friendly and helpful. I would definetly recommend Hewlett and Phillip Davis if you are looking for anew Chevrolet or Buick. ",5.0

The purchase was completed without any drama. We walked in with our own financing. 

I was impressed to see Phillip take the time (almost 3 hours) giving us details of the car. This was similar to have seen at luxury car dealers. He helped us set up the Onstar system. 

After driving the volt for two days, I can say now that GM is finally building cars that can compete with foreign cars, I hope that other dealers follow Don Hewlett's lead - and provide customer service that will bring back customers.

I have to say, my husband is a bottom line, no nonsense kind of guy who has no problem walking away from anyone he feels is not being straight with him.  Phillip Davis went the extra mile for us, being very patient, and working very hard to make this deal happen.  He never gave up on us and treated us with respect and care at every turn without pressuring us. At one point we were close to walking away from this deal, after being there for quite some time.  We were getting tired and I knew my husbands patience was becoming limited.  Then Phillip Davis straight up asked my husband what he could do to make this deal happen right then, right there, and right now.  We told him what we needed and he found a way to make it happen.  Mr. Davis also went so far as to acquire a Chevrolet hat my husband had commented on earlier in the day.  It was a nice personal touch.

Jeff made buying a new vehicle hassle free and simple. I would give Jeff Sawisch an overall rating of excellent.

I first went to the dealership back in September 2010, while out on the lot   Jeff approached me to see if he could offer any assistance. At this point not want to waste Jeff’s time I informed him I was not ready to purchase a vehicle at this point.  I advised Jeff I was comparing the Traverse and the Enclave. Jeff allowed me to drive both vehicles. While test driving the two crossovers Jeff’s knowledge of both vehicles was outstanding. After driving the two vehicles, Jeff offered to see if he could locate an Enclave with the options and colors I wanted. It became very clear that it was going to be hard to find an Enclave I wanted. Jeff suggested I order an Enclave. I thanked Jeff for his time and left the dealership. Jeff was never pushy, or annoying

A few days later I got a post card in the mail from Jeff. The post card just said I enjoyed meeting you and daughter and would like to earn your business when your ready to purchase an Enclave. 

I ordered my new Enclave in November 2010 Jeff  keep me advised every step along the way and the car arrived about 4 weeks ahead of the schedule.. 

I feel that respect is earned and not given and Jeff  Sawisch has earned my respect. I would highly recommend Jeff Sawisch of Don Hewlett Chevrolet in Georgetown, Texas to my friends and family.

1495,"November 20, 2010","Don Hewlett Chevrolet Buick has long been known in this area for being a reputable dealership, and for community involvement (including sponsoring the Longhorn Corvette Club, of which I am a member). I chose their store to visit 11/16 for a replacement Remote Transmitter for one of my older Corvettes.

I was pleasantly surprised by the friendliness and courtesy shown by all employees to me and to other customers, particularly  by Shann Grantham's cooperation in scheduling my car to program the device.  As I was awaiting the completion of that process 11/17, I visited the used car facility to view any late model Corvettes in stock.  I was greeting by Barry Harting, who demonstrated the same courtesy I had experienced thus far.  After he took the time to listen to my criteria, he showed an in depth knowledge of the product and of enthusiasts who drive Corvettes. 

After determining that other dealers in the area either knew little about the product or were less than interested in my criteria, I contacted Barry Harting and he informed me that a Corvette just traded might be of interest.  I returned to Don Hewlett Cheverolet Buick 11/19, inspected and drove both the car I had viewed on 11/17 and the car just in, discussed both vehicles at length and decided on the most recent trade in.  The actual purchase process was likely the best such experience in memory.

As Phillip pursued another career for a short time, Ronnie Bradford took the reins to help me out in his absence, by keeping in touch and guiding me on the right time to buy a new vehicle based on the equity on my Kia Sorento.  I appreciate the honesty in which they work, and the comfort level I feel when I do business with them.  I can guarantee that in the passed prior to Phillip, comfort was not the word that I would have used to describe buying a vehicle.  Both gentlemen take in considertion my best interest, and my needs vs. my wants.  To try to find me a vehicle that I am happy with and can afford.  I also met with Mitchell Sowa, and he did a wonderful job by taking extra time to discuss my credit situation and give me advice on how to improve my score, and kudos on what I had done right.  All in all, they made my experience virtually painless and certainly pleasurable.  I also got a kick out of Larry Bingham, who chose to help me and entertain me the day prior to the sale, when my preferred salesmen where with other customers.  Thank you Hewlett for the great service, I will certainly spread the good word on your behalf!

Worth, and traded one of theirs and had it driven to their dealership in just a couple of days.  I've had horrible car buying experiences in the past, but working with Barry was quite the opposite- by far the best experience I've had.  No haggling over price, no hard sale to upgrade or spend more than we wanted.  Just very informative and very friendly.  Our two little girls loved Barry, also.

At all times he conducted himself in a forthright manner that left no doubt as to his integrity and genuine caring for the customer. Phillip stood in sharp contrast contrast to the representatives of the competing dealerships.

Misty Blakeley is very friendly and highly-efficient. Her performance in arranging the installation of a bedliner, tool-box and floor-mats in my truck was outstanding. The installation process was fast and seamless.

I have never had a better experience in financing the purchase of a vehicle than I did a Hewlett. The process was positive, respectful and genuinely friendly. It was also amazingly fast.

The representatives of other dealerships were amazed at the price Hewlett offered me on my truck. It was conveneint that I visited Hewlett last in my search to buy a vehicle. I was made welcome at 10 minutes before closing on a Friday night and returned the next morning to complete the purchase. There was no need to look futher after the first visit.

I was lucky enough to get Barry Harting to help me with the vehicle, giving me the complete history, maint. etc. Since I had a '98 Toyota 4-Runner as a trade in, he made sure that I received the maximum amount possible toward my Tahoe. He knew what my budget was and tried to work with us. Being a breast cancer survivor, he knew that this was my gift to myself and was going to make it happen for me. Barry and his wonderful team did just that. He showed me all the bells and whistles on the car and gave us his cell number if we had any further questions. We spent around 5 hours making the deal happen and not once, did we feel pushed for time or anything else. Our experience was wonderful and my husband will be needing a new truck pretty soon and we most definately will go back to Barry for another vehicle. I am looking forward to working with their top-notch service department and a long relationship with Barry and his crew.  Thank you Don Hewlett for my beautiful Tahoe which I am enjoying so much. You are definately 5 stars to me.

He allowed me to look at as many vehicles as I needed before making a final decision. In the end he knew the right questions to ask me in order to find out what kind of truck I really needed. He didn’t try to sell me the highest priced truck just get a good commission but was more interested in making sure that I found the truck I would be happy with. The day I was there the computers were not working correctly. Jeff went out of his way to find a computer that was functional so that he could run the deal through. Throughout the whole process Jeff made me feel like I was the most important person in the dealership. I would definitely recommend Don Hewlett to anyone and will send him or her to Jeff. 
Karl Hoehn was the best finance person I have dealt with in any dealership. He didn’t try to strong-arm me into anything I didn’t want. He simply told me the pros and cons of each of his sales pitches and let me decide what I wanted. Additionally, Karl was very considerate when I had to come back the next day to bring in my wife as a co signer and he took us in right away so that we didn’t have to wait once we got there. 
Your staff at the dealership is truly (At least the gentlemen I had the pleasure dealing with) the most professional and down to earth individuals that I have had the pleasure of meeting. 
This is truly the first time that I have purchased a vehicle where I was COMPLETELY satisfied and didn’t have buyers remorse when the sale was complete, and it was all due to the extra attention Jeff gave to make sure I had the right truck. Karl added to the buying experience by being respectful and allowing me to make my own decisions while going through the finance process.
Thanks for everything and thanks for being great people! 
Extremely satisfied,

Mike has helped me try to locate the same vehicle and has helped me track the one I have on order! The salesman I bought the vehicle from does not know how to track vehicles and has not been helpful at all! If I had not already sold my Suburban (I'm renting a vehicle now) and had not already been waiting  seven weeks for the 2011 Equinox I have on order; I would have just gone ahead and bought one from Mike. Mike has been a gentleman from the beginning and I cannot say enough about how much I appreciate him going out of his way for the last month to help me during this whole process and especially since I did not purchase a vehicle from him. I will highly recommend Mike Stephens and Hewlett Chevy to all of my colleagues and customers that come in to the Body and Frame shop I am employed at.

These guys are not there to sell cars. They are there to help people make a good choice and facilitate the process. Im guessing they sell lots of cars. It would also make sense that they sleep well at night as they must certainly feel good about the way they conduct themselves.

I would think it would be common courtesy to at least offer to shuttle us back to the dealership. Then once we got into the finance office the payment and the terms were different than we were quoted. The funny thing was he said that was the best he could do and as I began to walk away from the deal he magically got the numbers in check. And last, he chose to argue with me about the GMPP stating that it could only be bought from a dealership wrong again, I have dealt with GM directly on a GMPP over the phone.

I understand that this is probably standard operating procedure, but I'm sure that there are exceptions to the rule.

1543,"September 03, 2010","   I went to Don Hewlett to look at the Chevy trucks and I was wanting the Silverado 1500 Z71 4X4, but figured the price would be out of range.  I sat down and talk with one of the sales men, Chris Nations, and not only did I leave with my dream truck but he ended up making the payments just what I wanted.  A few months later my best friend was wanting to get a new Camero, and was on leave from the Army with only a short period of time, and was needing a car ""yesterday.""  Chris understood my friends need for urgency and got him in the car he wanted the next day from a car that they had just gotten on the lot and hadn't even completely put into the system yet. Needless to say Chris knows his stuff and I will and have recommended him to anyone interested in a new Chevy. 
   I also love the way Don Hewlett has the dealership set up with all the Texas flags in the showroom, the cleanness of the building, and how nice everyone was through out the whole process of both mine and my friends experience.

Our salesperson, Lee Dickie asked us questions about our wants and needs in a professional way, not like he had just read them out of a sales 101 training manual.  We all joked and kidded each other through the whole experience.  Our finance guy Jeff Grazioplene, was the same way, very professional yet personable.  Misty Blakeley 
described our options for step rails and made suggestions because of our new truck color.  

As a local business owner for over 23 years, these are the qualities in which I try to instill in my employees.  We are a Piano sales and education company in Austin.  Our goal, as well as Hewlett's is to make our customers feel almost part of our staff.  

The only small thing was after washing our new truck in make ready, they dried it off with a dirty rag.  Not a big deal, but was noticeable because of all the rest of their stellar service.  

I would go back to Hewlett again as well as recommend them to friends and family.

Our neighbor recommended Jonathan Blank at Don Hewlett Chevrolet.  We went to see him and he was amazing.  He was not only very encouraging in the trauma we had just faced, but helped us get an amazing truck for my wife.  The entire staff was extremely friendly and supportive.

When my old car came up for repairs, we knew right away that we would want to deal with Jonathan again.  Sure enough, our visit with Jonathan put me in a great 2010 Chevy Mallibu.  Once again, the service that we got from Jonathan just floored us.  I've always hated buying cars in my life, but with Jonathan it is a very enjoyable experience.  No pressure, very friendly advice/encouragement, and extreme understanding of their cars are all great attributes of Jonathan.

I am so impressed with him and the dealership that I am encouraging my mother to come from FL to TX in the next year JUST to buy a car from them.

The whole atmosphere at Don Hewlett is amazing.  I have talked to several people up there and all of them have been incredible.  I imagine that they have earned my business for a long time.

We have already advised Brandon's mom to bring her car here when she is ready to trade.  Buick fan.  She can definitely be converted!

I started my search over the internet.  Steven called me the next morning after my inquirey the night before.  He asked me the specifics of what I was looking for and how much I wanted to spend.  He quickly found me the truck that met my criteria.  No more, no less and the price range I wanted.  I was very skeptical that I was getting the deal that he was offering.  I checked other dealerships to see what they were offering.  All said that they could beat the deal and none lived up to it.  They all came back $3,000-4,000 above the original quote.  When I told Steven that I was very discouraged, he reassured me that we would be getting the deal he quoted!  Amazing!  He was patient and honest and took the time to walk us through the whole process.  Jeff G. in finance did his job of trying to sell us the extra warrenties and insurance.  He was always polite, and only offered us what he thought was the right thing to do, but never made us feel uncomfortable with the ridiculous hard sell.  Jeff and Steven were both gentlemen and everyone at the dealership was friendly and helpful.  100% I would recommend that you give them your business.

1576,"June 29, 2010"," A few years ago we were led to Hewlett by a trusted friend and I was thankful for the experience but in another instance at a much later date things were not to my liking so we went to Covert in Hutto. Blissful ignorance kept me coming back for three more new vehicles but on this last trip we discovered what a  shark feeding frenzy we had participated in. At this point we decided to check the internet out for a dealer. Fortunately for us we met Jeff Sawisch online and right away he impressed me with 1.His immediate response 2. His openness 3. His knowledge of the product 4. The way he started our initial meeting interview. 5.His understanding of our financial situation and his input to said situation. At all times I felt as if it was not a contest to see how much can I take from this couple but rather how can I help them. Realizing he did his job well and made money for his company and himself is great as far as we are concerned. My only concern at this point is that when we do return ( and this is definitely where we will go first)   Jeff may be promoted and not be our salesperson. We do not feel Jeff is a salesperson, he is our new friend. 

Now this brings me to our next Hewlett representative, Jeff ( in finance). No way can I spell his name but he most assuredly will remain in my memory as one of the most straight forward people I have ever met at a production auto dealership. Again it was more like dealing with a trusted friend than some other of his counterparts from other dealerships. A lot of conversation about multiple items lead me to this impression and final conclusion. Several instructions from Jeff gave me an insight into not only finance but how the whole of Hewlett seems to now operate. 

As a whole if I could rate the whole operation we both agree it was an excellence we have not found elsewhere in over 40 years.",5.0

Lee Dickie, Internet Sales contacted me quickly with a vehicle that was very close to what I was looking for and a very competitive price (based on research on-line).

He excelled in all of functions as our sales repersentitive.  He tried to get us a lower price, but could not.

1602,"May 12, 2010","I had to seperate my rating for this dealer into 2 parts due to the extreme difference of service that I received.  This is the second part of the sale when the extended warranty sale started. Mitchell, from finance, started out ok with the usual grip and grin.  He then started to go through our paperwork, he explained the GAP insurance and we agreed to purchase.  He then tried to fly to though the part that he had already selected a warranty for us and had added it to the sale.  We asked him to back up and explain the warranty, which he then did.  We were purchasing a certified pre-owned with 63k miles, because it was certified it came with a 12k bumper to bumper warranty.  The warranty he was selling was a 93k warranty which would only cover 18k of milage not covered by the previous warranty.  I analyze risk/service contracts for a living, so I was trying to get as much information on this as possible.  Note: we never got upset while this was going on, if this was worth it I would want the warranty.  He told us that with the warranty and added intrest it would be under $2250, but when I asked him to show me the payment with out the warranty it was $40 cheaper.  Over 72 months that is $2800, that is a lot of money for 18000 miles worth of warranty on a unit that already had 100k of power train warranty.  I politely declined the warranty, this were you could tell he took it personnel.  He made several comments how he was once a mechanic and would never bet on a car.  He was very short from that point on and was slinging papers in front of us saying ""sign here"" and not explaining what we were signing.  We had to stop him tell him that atour jobs we would never ask him to sign something we didn't explain first.  He remained rude for the rest of the sale and ended up degrading what was going to be a great rating for the dealership.  Use the dealership, but avoid Mitchell in Finance.",1.8

All of my interaction with the sales team was positive and Scott was fantastic in taking care of everything to make the sale go smoothly.  My only concern with this dealer is their consistent attempts to offer you the very lowest possible trade in value compared to what other dealers will offer.  THeir offers on the two occasions I have had the opportunity to deal with them was at least $2000 lower than anyone else.  IN cases where you are trying to trade for a hot commodity vehicle, like the recent Camaro, they will refuse to budge on trade in value trying to squeeze every dollar out of you knowing you want the vehicle bad enough and being a large dealer they tend to have the biggest stock.  I purchase a new vehicle every two to three years and am not sure I want that hassle every time. ",4.5

I have found Lee to be very easy to work with.  He is fair and honest and I have never been dissapointed with anything he sold me.  For my last purchase, I called him on the phone and explained what I was looking for.  I made it to the dealership about a half hour later and he had three or four choices ready for me to look at and decide on.  He kept within my price range and was fair on the final sale price.

Lee also worked directly with the finance person, whom I believe is named Carl.  Finance went through easily and I was explained each part of the contract.

My daughter is 17, and it was her first car buying experience and her comment was ""Why do people make such a big deal out of it. This was easy.""  Obviously, she hasn't had to go through the haggleing and ""let me talk to the sales manger"" part of it before. 

Lastly, Hewlett has been more than helpful in locating the exact car I wanted, whether a particular color or an extra option.  I have really appreciated that since I am somewhat picky when I buy a car.

Although I have not yet purchased a vehicle (waiting for cash-back incentives to get the vehicle to my price-point)...my dealings with Scott have been very professional.  

I had been corresponding with a few other dealers in the area and in Houston, but none of them were as respsonsive and professional as Scott.  Scott is very proactive at giving my updates as incentives change, vehicles that I might be interested...but I have NEVER felt pressured, or pushed by him.  He simply has tried to build a relationship with his customer, and it will certainly be remembered if/when I am finally ready to purchase.  Most salesman would probably just blow off a customer who has been waiting for a year to purchase and waiting for that best price/best fit vehicle...but Scott has kept me in his contact list and gives me periodic updates and checks in from time to time. 

I would definitely recommend dealing with him, and look forward to finalizing our sale in 2010.

It took us approximately 45 minutes to arrive at the dealership and we were well taken care of from the onset.  Lee was helping another customer, however, he arranged for another salesman to start the transaction and take us for a test drive.

1674,"November 02, 2009","We came for the ""Cash for Clunkers"" program.  Mike quoted me an Internet price that was $500 below the ""Supplier Pricing"" that GM was offering on a Traverse, which every other dealership claimed that they could not go below.  Not only did he honor the price with no bait/switch etc., but we were also surprised to find out that we were entitled to an additional ""scrap value"" that no other dealership mentioned.
Mike was quick and efficient and yet took the time to go over all the features of the vehicle as well as onstar.
When it came time to purchase we decided to go with an extended bumper-to-bumper warranty that we believed had no deductable.  After getting home, I found out there was a deductible for each incident.  I called and spoke with the finance person expressing that this was not the plan we wanted and although the 0 deductible was higher, they accepted the cost difference as their mistake and gave me the correct plan.
So far, I have only had 1 service appt and after scheduling on a Saturday, they brought in an additional mechanic just to make sure someone could check out my problem.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this dealership.",5.0
