2,"June 01, 2020","I have purchased several vehicles through Brian Toliver Ford and there is a reason I keep returning.  They are very easy to work with and do a great job putting you in the vehicle you want.  If you do ever require service or just get your maintenance done there, they are also great in that department.  ",5.0

7,"April 01, 2019",Top notch customer service...I took my brand new jeep to them on Monday to have it repaired for hail damage. Lloyd in Body repair went above and beyond to take care of me. Enterprise rental didn't have any cars available due to the hail storm so Lloyd provided me with a loaner car. The next day I made arrangements for Enterprise to pick me up at the car dealership and they forgot to so Lloyd had one of his employees take me to go pick up my rental car. I picked up my Jeep this afternoon and it looks great!!!  If you need any repair work done I highly recommend them!,5.0
8,"September 19, 2017","Great until they get paid! As soon as I drove my 2014 used truck home I found the parking sonar dummy light stating see dealer. Sales manager Bryan advised me my sale was As Is! Buyer beware! He states that is what the extended warranty is for! I believe a warranty is for items that break after the truck is purchased Not for items that were inop prior to purchase! Not a big deal I got this! At the end of the day all you have is your reputation!
