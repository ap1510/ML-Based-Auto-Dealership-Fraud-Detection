Our sales consultant, Lewis Byrd, was wonderful in that he was very thorough in explaining the many features, especially the electronics, on the vehicle. He took his time with us and was very knowledgeable and more than willing to answer all our questions. Understanding the electronics was definitely made easier because of his willingness to be sure we were well informed. He was very patient and understanding and we never felt rushed in anyway. As we were leaving in the new car he even told us to write down any questions we have when we got the car home and to bring them back and he would answer them. He was an awesome salesman.

We purchased a Subaru Forester here in June. the salesman Ivan told us that they had inspected the car and that the car had also gone to the neighboring Gillman Subaru dealership to be looked at as well because they didn‚Äôt always know how to look at Subarus and the Subaru would bring Hondas over to their dealership for them to look at. My wife is a school teacher and she drives very little. In the 5 months we have had the car she has only driven it 3500 miles. She had mentioned a few times after longer drives that the car had a burning smell. There were a few little things we had to fix along the way such as replacing the battery and we had some lights come on for some random sensors. No big deal we are reasonable its a used car we knew we would have to put some money in the car from time to time. When we brought it in for the first oil change the car was a quart and a half low on oil. this was a bit alarming. Our regular mechanic didn‚Äôt know what the issue was. I did a little research and found a Subaru specialist in the area. When they looked at it they found multiple serious internal issues with the motor. They believe that the motor had been replaced with a used ‚Äújunk yard‚Äù motor. This motor is in such bad shape that it needs to be replaced or have a serious over haul. We took it to another shop that scoped the motor and found that even worse than it just being a used motor some one had worked on the internals, didn‚Äôt know what they were doing and just closed it up. Everything was wrong values, lifters, rings‚Ä¶ All wrong. The conclusion is that the motor is shot and needs to be replaced after only 3500 miles. I decided it was time to bring this to the attention of Honda of Spring, being ‚ÄúHoustons most trusted Honda dealership‚Äù(according the their website) I figured they would want to make this right. When I arrived I saw our salesperson Ivan and he brought us over his sales manager Alonzo Allen. I asked how they could have possibly had Gillman Subaru check this car out and not find any of the things wrong with it that we had. Immediately Ivan denied having said that they had the car checked out there. In short, they told us we bought the car as is and they weren‚Äôt going to do anything even though the sales person had lied to us. It didn‚Äôt seem to me that this was the outcome that the dealership would want so I decided to schedule a conversation with the General Manager Jason Jackson at a later time. When I spoke with Jason he said ‚ÄúHow do I know that you didn‚Äôt do these things to this car?‚Äù Seriously, My wife drives this car very conservatively. I‚Äôm a reasonable person, giving them the benefit of the doubt that this was just a fluke I offered to trade for another car.

In shopping around we have had the car apprised and not one dealer has offered us less that $7500 on trade.

123,"March 04, 2018","Most businesses really try to put on a show that they are hospitable and that they truly care about the customer.  But when it comes to a hiccup in the process,  the niceness can easily go away.   My trip to Honda of Spring was to trade in two cars, my own 2015 Chrysler 200C and my mom's 2012 Honda Accord.   I was going only to help my mom out, she needed to get rid of the car and I didn't mind getting an upgrade.   I was immediately taken care of by Kiani.  This man truly knows how to make you feel at home, he is genuine in everything that he does.  My neighbor recommended me to this particular dealership because of the amazing manager, Jason.  I end up finding a beautiful 2017 Honda Accord Sport Sedan and ask for my car to be appraised as well as my mom's.   Turns out that I had made a bad deal on my car.  It was incredibly upside down and to top it off, my credit wasn't right where it needed to be.  All the plans had to change but what amazed me is that there was no rush from Kiani and Jason.  They weren't upset nor were they pushy. They both did everything in their power to help me out.   Because of the negative equity of my car, my only option now was a brand new car.  But neither Jason nor Kiani were forcing this option on me.   But you could tell just from the look in Jason's eyes that he genuinely cared for my safety in the Chrysler.  He understood that this was not plan A for me to invest in a brand new car and that the payment would not be my first option.   I obviously ended up buying a 2018 Honda Accord LX.  They made the entire process so easy and Kiani made sure you entertain me with conversation the whole time.   I've been at dealerships before where something goes wrong on my end and that's when the niceness goes away.   In this case, it did not.  The entire team at Honda of Spring went out of their way to help me.  Neil in the finance department was incredibly sweet and understanding.   I can honestly say that this was hands down the best car buying experience I've ever had.   Trust me,  Kiana, Jason and Neil have converted me.  I'm now a lifelong Honda customer.   Thank y'all for your kindness and genuine hospitality.  ",5.0
124,"February 28, 2018","I purchased a used 4 year old SUV from Pedro which looked and test drove great. I did not buy a warranty, just as-is because I am pretty good with mechanics. However within a day of driving it I detected what I suspected was a large problem with the engine. I called and Pedro advised to take it to Alex in maintenance. Alex said they'd take a look and if there was a problem and gave me a rental in the meantime. I was nervous I'd receive a large invoice, as I figured although the problem must have existed when I bought it, I did buy it as-is. After several days I got a call from Jason the Sales Manager. He said that they had disassembled the engine and that there was a problem that required significant work to fix. He said they had not been able to detect that problem before the sale, which is fair comment - it probably manifests after time. He was very sorry that I had bought a vehicle with a significant problem. He said the problem was not mine, and they would sort it out for me. He asked if I was wedded to that particular SUV and wanted to wait for it to be fixed, or would be happy to trade for another. I said I was flexible so we agreed to meet the next day. When I arrived Pedro, Jason and Alex were all very helpful. I found another SUV that I really liked, and Jason traded it for the other one giving me a really good deal in the process. Neil one of the directors also checked to see if the problem was fully resolved, as he had heard of the problem. This time I did buy a drivetrain warranty! Overall very very happy with the integrity and service. I think the team did far more than they were legally required to do, and  a week after driving my new (used) SUV I am very happy with it.",5.0

127,"January 30, 2018","We went to this dealership to buy an Odyssey Touring. We did a test drive and finally got to the point of negotiating price. For the whole negotiation, we were talking about out of the door (OTD) price without any trade-in or anything. In addition, we never mentioned about how much we wanted to put down for down payment. We got the the OTD price of $43,000. Then we go to finance office. Everything went fine up until the point we signed the payment paper. We agreed to put down $10,000 as our down payment which means that we will finance $33,000. But NO, on the paper, the amount we needed to finance was $35,000. Turned out, from the beginning, they had put $2,000 as my down payment without my knowledge. Basically, their PRICE WAS $45,000, not $43,000 which I was led to believe. This came at a surprise to my salesman too because as I said, we negotiated the car‚Äôs price without any down payment in mind. Moreover, when presenting the finance paper to us, instead of showing, explaining, and checking everything on it (ex: interest rate, down payment, amount finance‚Ä¶), the finance guy just went straight up to the monthly amount and tell us to put initial on it, trying to rush through the paper. If we haven‚Äôt caught that, we would of buy that car for $45,000 and thinking it was only $43,000. The final straw that make me writing this is when the finance guy told me that that was never his fault, that $2,000 was on the paper from the beginning and I did not read it (my thought: even your staff did not see this, and you still had to courage to blame it on me????). I understand that dealerships need to make their money somewhere, either car price, finance, extended warranties, or accessories; which is totally acceptable; but what I cannot tolerate is when they are trying to SCAM their customers. Yes, I used the word ‚ÄúSCAM.‚Äù Their way of doing business is highly UNETHICAL. After reading my review and you still want to give this dealership a try, by all means, be my guess. At least, keeping my experience in mind and I hope you get a good deal from them. My final warning: EXTREMELY CAREFUL WITH THIS DEALERSHIP!!!!

Hearing my situation and realizing the negative equity I had, Sean expressed every option to me so I could fix my current horrible situation and leave the dealership with a Honda. A two day process to make sure I was taken care of, Honda of Spring was going above and beyond for me.  Could have easily told me they couldn't help me because of my situation but never once even mentioned giving up on me. From Sean setting the deal up I was passed along to Director of Finances Neil Pratt and let me tell you, Neil is one of those people we all wish there were more of in the world. Neil explained everything to me, from my payments all the way to my options at the end of my lease. I was nearly brought to tears when me and Neil finished talking. When he asked me did I have any questions at the end I only asked ""Where were you three years ago when I got my first car?""

144,"November 05, 2017","My Honda Civic had flood damage.The independent business who performed flood repair did not know how to fix electrical,electronics,sensor issues.so I went to the PROS to fix the remaining.Engine,SKID,Airbag, TPMS lights keep staying on.The parts replaced were SRS unit,HFT unit,Evap canister,Vent Valve,Sensor.The existing TPMS module was reprogrammed.The lights are still on.I was told to replace ECM&Fuse box but I did not agree.Next day I was told that ECM&Fuse box does not need replacement but VSA module does.I had already spent $2495 here so I did not dare for further repairs.They were not sure in the fist place what parts need replacement;then I was told that flood damage autos are not guaranteed anything even those with their new parts.I agreed but just fix those lights first then let worry about guarantees.If they knew they can not fix or guarantee anything then why started the job. Even if once the job was accepted why not try to fix it.If diagnostics were not perfect then I should have been told and I should not have gone for any repair at all.",2.4

They sold us a Honda Odyssey that within a month the engine and transmission light came on. We feared any red light or stop sign because the car will just turn off every time and sometimes it would take so long for it to turn back on!!! It's been 1 year now and we've had to take it 4 times to the service center and the problem KEEPS HAPPENING!! And they keep charging me to fix it when they're the ones not fixing the problem in the first place. Waste of money every time!! Not sure why it's not covered in the warranty when it's their problem for selling me a bad car. I REGRET buying from them. ",1.0

Robert was a real professional that knows his product line, and he responded very quickly with a good internet price.  It was a joy to meet him when we arrived to test drive a car, and there was never an ounce of pressure to make a purchase.  We liked the car, but said we wanted to think about it overnight, and he agreed without a minute's hesitation.  I texted him the next day, said I'd like to get the car, and wanted the window's tinted and another item or two.  Never a moments hesitation in his professional demeanor and when we arrived at the designated time we said we'd come by to pick it up, the car was done and sitting in the delivery area with a big red bow on it for our daughter! 

After we did the paperwork, Robert went over the car with our daughter the second time, showing her everything from how to check the oil to how to set up her phone.

When I asked Honda of Spring to check it out they stated they were unable to get the hatch to not work for them.  Repeatedly when I would get my oil changed I would ask them to try to diagnose the problem.  I eventually spoke with the Service Manager to ask how to handle the issue since eventually the car would be out of warranty but they couldn't seem to diagnose the issue.  She stated not to worry that they made a note in my file and whenever they could figure out the problem they would fix it.  The problem just got worse and worse and finally on one recent visit they were able to diagnose it as the lift motor for the hatch.  The service manager I talked to no longer works there but the dealer acknowledges there is a note in my file from when the car was under warranty.  But since now the car is no longer under warranty, the dealer will not honor their previous promise and only offered to pay for the part, meaning I would still be paying $300 for a repair that should have happened under warranty.  I elevated this to every level I could including American Honda corporate and still nothing.

232,"November 07, 2016","My wife and I recently purchased our third Honda (two new, one used) from Honda of Spring.  There has never been any hassle, pressure, or ""Harry Hardsell buy it now"" tactics of any kind, ever.  

We find pricing at Honda of Spring to be competitive to very competitive compared to other dealerships we've visited.  

Our Salesman, Lewis Byrd has always provided an outstanding, #10, first class, and quality sales/purchase experience before, during, and after our purchases.  

We have referred five of our family and friends to Lewis Byrd at Honda of Spring.  Each one purchased the car, or van, they were looking for from Lewis.  One of them has been back to Lewis for a second purchase.  I have never heard any negative feedback about Lewis, the rest of the Honda of Spring team, or about the cars and vans they've purchased.  We have no complaints either.

234,"November 03, 2016","I decided to purchase a new Honda Odyssey at this dealership because  I have serviced my other to vehicles through their service center for the last 3 years and I have worked with Samir when I needed some maintainence on my 2007 Honda Odyssey. He provided great service and he always find coupons that would discount my repairs tremendously. So I initially called last evening on Saturday, 10/29/2016 after feeling frustrated and exhausted looking at other dealerships to find a van that would match with my current van. Mr. Lewis Byrd answered the phone and asked a few questions and asked when would be a good time for me to come in and find a vehicle that would fit my needs and be comfortable with the monthly payments. I said I would be there in a few minutes because I lived 2 exits away from the dealership. Mr. Byrd took some information down from me and I was ready to trade in my old Odyssey immediately, after test driving a new 2016 Odyssey.  Mr. Byrd came with some great and good news. He didn't say much, but he kept it short and sweet. Then, he passed my file to Mr. Neil Pratt. At this point I was still skeptical. He brought me into his office and ran the information and details and told me that he would find a way to get me into the Odyssey I just test drove, but just give me 48 business hours to get the deal done. I tried patiently waiting for a phone call from them on Monday, 10/31/16, but I drove to the dealership and Mr. Pratt said I am working on your file and I will have an approval on Wednesday, 11/02/16. I got the long awaited phone call in the afternoon and asked me how soon can I come to the dealership and close the deal, I said will be there within 30 minutes. I was anxious and excited at the same time as we sat in Mr. Pratt'a office while he explained the details of the financing by Honda! I was estounded that Honda would take the chance on me to be part of their family officially and continue to make the connection for a lifetime! Mr. Pratt explained how this will be a beneficial factor in my credit and build a strong relationship not only with the dealership, service center, but including Honda financing! Mr. Pratt is truly number 1 and top notch Finance Director! He has strong connections throughout the business of closing the deals on vehicles at Honda of Spring along the side with Lewis Byrd! They are the super hero team working hand in hand throughout the entire process from beginning to the signing the loan and setting up pairing my cell phone to my new Odyessy. Mr. Lewis Byrd is not all talk, he works along with Mr. Neil Pratt to keep you updated regardless he is busy with another customer or picking up his son from school and returning to the dealership to continue helping customers. This dealership is one of a kind it begins with a greeting and it grows into a family connection that will carry on to the lifetime of reunions throughout the services of the vehicle or purchasing another vehicle through this awesome team! We exchange stories throughout the whole purchasing process and we have a stronger bond as a family should be! I will definitely make it a point to say hello as I get my cars serviced each month and share stories or wave at their window from time to time. They are truly a God send and they have truly made a believer in this specific dealership who will continue to take care of me and my family! Thank you Honda of Spring and to my awesome Honda family of Spring! Thank you again Mr. Neil Pratt and Mr. Lewis Byrd! You kept your word and close the deal for me!

Once at the dealership, she was very helpful, kind, and not pushy or in a rush to sell me the car. When test driving the car she was helpful in teaching me the Honda Sensing safety features, kindly showing me how to use it and answering any questions I had. It was nice to have an extended test drive up to The Woodlands, allowing me to fully experience the car. The negotiating process was pretty smooth. They came down slightly on an already great base price for the car and threw in a couple of accessories in for free to sweeten the deal as I was buying several additional features. Bottom line, there was a general understanding that there was a give-and-take on both sides which made it a pleasant experience; I did not run into a brick wall of dealer stubbornness. Irshad was good as well, the financing process went quite smoothly. They installed my accessories while I was out at lunch and my car was ready not too much after that, which was really great for a busy Saturday. Overall, my experience was hassle-free and pleasant.

 I initially went in for my youngest daughter she was in search for a dealership that would work with her being that she had no credit and very little down.

They both were very helpful and honest and put my baby girl in a car that was perfect for her. Neil impressed me in the way he asked her question and explain to detail to make sure she knew what she was getting into knowing this was a big responsibility for a young lady.

265,"June 30, 2016","I am still in disbelief! When my father passed away from cancer, the last thing he left me was his 95 Geo Prizm. It was in decent condition overall but under the hood, problems started to arise and the cost to fix her was not possible. I was in need of a safe car FAST! My first choice was a Honda Civic. That's the car I had my eyes on, but I knew I would need to keep my options open and talk to different dealerships(Ford, Chevy, VW, etc.). With my situation, I had zero credit, I was a first-time buyer, only $2,000 down and no cosigner. I was beginning to lose hope that with my situation, I wouldn't be able to buy a new car. 
By a blessing, Mohammed Ali called me back after denying me the first time to check up on how the search was going. I explained it just wasn't possible without a co-signer because I had no credit history. I was a ghost! Mr. Ali immediately talked with Neil Pratt and Neil began his search for the right financing for me. Mr. Ali called me back the next day and said come in to take a look at the cars and pick your color, we are just waiting for the official approval.
Upon arrival, the staff was generous and helpful. The staff made it feel comfortable and that they weren't here to ""shark"" you. They genuinely care about their customers and insist on making sure the car will be affordable, reliable and less stressful for you by the time you sign the documents. 
Neil Pratt is an angel! He was humble and answered all questions honestly and in detail, gave me time to read over the documents and make sure this is what I wanted. Not to mention, he worked hard to have the bank approve me given my situation and all around he was the most helpful financing gentlemen I had spoken with. I drove off the lot in a 2016 Honda Civic because Honda of Spring allowed my dream become a reality.

Joe was right there to greet us in a positive way and was not putting any pressure on us to buy right there on the spot. I wanted time to see the newer CR-V model and Joe gave us all the time we needed and he was able to answer our questions. We knew from the beginning that he was in training and his mentor was nearby if there were any concerns on answering our questions. Joe was very understanding that we were taking our time since we needed to put special devices on our car due to a disability. Joe and his mentor walked us through the process of what we needed to do on our side to make this all happen. We did not walk out with the car that day because the car had to be transported to another place to install the devices. Joe and his co-worker went out of their way to transport the car plus bring it back ready for us to take. Neil Pratt walked us through the whole process of purchasing the car and made that part less stressful on us.

288,"February 02, 2016","My recent transaction with Honda of Spring was an experience that embodied teamwork and integrity.  I purchased a 2015 Honda Civic for my daughter in Spring 2015.  Neil Pratt was my Finance Manager during this time.  One of our goals in the transaction was to establish her credit since she was a first time buyer.  Neil spoke specifically to my daughter on the steps she needed to take in order to establish her credit.  She followed them to the ""T"", by ensuring that her payment was always on time and she established other smaller lines of credit.  The challenge was in managing a payment with an interest rate of 18%. Within 10 months of this transaction, Neil was true to his word.  He was able to reevaluate her current loan, and reduce her interest rate to 1.9%.  What a significant turnaround in a short amount of time.  Our Sales Associate Adam Sadiqui was also courteous and helpful in our transaction.  Thanks to the entire team at Honda of Spring, for the professional manner in which they choose to operate.  ",5.0

We ask to speak with the manager, and was rudely informed by Jason that even though he was aware that we had an appointment, the dealership policy is that if you do not put a deposit on a car before coming, they must sale the vehicle to anyone that would buy it first! He said that the vehicle was loaned to another customer to take to their mechanic and if they don't buy the car we could come back and purchase the car! I told him that we drove over 2 hours to come and buy this car for my daughter and he just look at us with discuss. I even told him that we could go down the street to Carmax and buy a car and he just looked at us as if  he was ready for us to walk out, and as we began to leave he just walked back to his desk area. The manner of disrespect and lack of any compassion for our time or money by this general manager Jason, was one of the most unprofessional and worst treatment I had to encountered in a long time, but especially in front of my family!!! .

The entire time we were in the dealership, we were nervous about someone trying to steal the shirts off our backs because of such a horrible experience at another Houston area Honda dealership earlier in the day.  Happy to say we walked out absolutely glowing.  I would come back here 10 times out of 10 and will recommend this dealership to everyone who mentions looking for a new car.

Prior to coming in, I had talked to Asif Sanee over the phone, and then Jason Jackson through email, where we agreed to an out-the-door car price.  When we came into the dealership, we worked with Asif, who had the car we were interested in waiting outside the door (unlike the other dealership where we were led around the back lot for 30 minutes to eventually look at a new car whose color was indistinguishable because of the amount of dirt caked on it).  I'm embarrassed to say every time Asif came back we were expecting him to deliver bad news or pull one over on us (too many horror stories of car buying perhaps), but it never happened.  Asif was one of my favorite salespeople I've ever had the pleasure of working with.  He was polite, patient, and helpful, and his explanations of what were going on were always clear as he walked us through the process.  After agreeing to the purchase, he passed us over to Sean Johnson in the finance department who was also just fantastic and amiable, despite the late hour on a Friday.  We ultimately walked out with the car at the price we had previously agreed to.

In the end, I can't say enough how happy I am I ended up at Honda of Spring.  Unfortunately, we first had to learn the hard way after experiencing the kind of sales tactics that give car dealers a bad name at another dealership.  I only hope I can send enough friends their way to repay the dealership for how great it treated my wife and I!  Thanks again to Asif, Sean, and Jason!",5.0

At no point did he try to talk us into a higher priced vehicle or pressure us into buying when we were not ready.  His approach was whatever we needed it to be......there if we wanted him......gone if we did not.  Irshad in the finance department worked with us to get the APR and terms that we needed.  He explained the options and warranties so we could make the decision that was best for us (again, no pressure).  We would definitely recommend both gentlemen to anyone looking for a new Honda.

357,"May 01, 2015","My wife and I appreciate the smooth process of buying a car through Honda of Spring.  The website is well laid out and easy to navigate. From the time that I expressed interest in a car, through the quote process, the emails were quick and concise.  Nothing was hidden, and was nothing missing.  I really appreciate your dealership not having bogus overpriced add-ons already installed on the cars. The ease of negotiating through email is not to be under rated. 

The arrival at the dealer ship and greeting by Denise was casual and comfortable.  We were quickly met by the sales manager, Jason, and introduced to our sales man Brad.  The test drive and vehicle presentation was laid back and easy going.  Brad was knowledgeable about the car and answered all questions. He told us to take our time on test drive and go further if we needed to. He did not talk too much and let us listen to the car perform. We were not rushed at all.  

Jason had already drew up the paper work and processed our credit application that we had filled out from a link he emailed us.  Finance was a breeze. Irshad (finance consultant) was easy spoken and personable.  Irshad, my wife, and I spoke of living in Texas and of our children; we each have three, as he laid out our options for extra warranty, insurances, and accessories.  He told us he would explain each of them and if we wanted them fine, if we didn't fine and that is exactly how he did it.  We were not pressured in the least.  He had competitive prices and good products.  

After we signed our contract, the sales man and sales manager met us on the way to delivery and handed us off to Denise for the final delivery.  She was congenial and thorough. She taught us how to use Smart Entry and explained how the keys worked. She synced my wife's phone, and showed us how to use each radio feature.  She even helped us preset our normal stations on the radio.  It took a while for delivery, we had so many questions and she knew every feature and fact.  

Buying a car from Honda of Spring is like sitting down with a helpful friend and chatting over coffee. The whole process from drive up to drive off took about 1 hour and 45 minutes.  It did not seem long and we never waited, or had a wasted moment.  They worked behind the scenes to have every step of the process ready before we got there.

I would recommend them to anyone and we will be back here to shop again in a few years.

Honda of Spring helped me get an excellent value for my trade in and also gave me a great deal on a 2013 Honda CRV. My first contact was with Zia Kiani by email and then phone. I told him I was coming to test drive the new car. He had plans but decided to cancel them for me!! YAY! Zia is not working here to make money, he truly loves working with people and it shows. He was so friendly to my mom and I and he got to know us. Next we were introduced to Neil Pratt in finance. I almost didn't hear a word he said because I was fascinated by his Australian accent.

367,"March 26, 2015","I went to their website and found it easy to navigate and use.  I was able to pre-approve for financing as well as schedule a test drive for the next day.  Ronn Steptoe called and emailed me to confirm my appointment, and to let me know that he would not be available.  He instructed me to contact Lewis Byrd when I arrived, in order to do the test drive and continue with a purchase.  

The next day I was contacted by Irshad Hussain, who went over basic questions about financial information (amount of down payment, etc.) and to confirm the model and style of Civic I wanted to test drive.

Later that evening when I arrived for the test drive, Lewis was prepared for me.  He knew me by name and had the car ready to go.  After the test drive, I told him I was ready to purchase, and he informed me that the car that I had test drove would be the car I would be taking home.  He then spent the next 15 minutes or so going over features and pairing my phone up to the car.  We filled the gas tank up and left the car in the area to be prepped for driving off the lot.

Lewis and Irshad both had forms for me to fill out, and they were both knowledgeable and efficient in this part of the process.  After signing the handful of forms, I waited perhaps 5 minutes before being brought back to Irshad's office.  He explained all financial information in detail, and answered all questions with confidence.  He assessed my use of the Civic I wished to purchase, and recommended a few additional add-ons.  I at no time felt pressured by him, I felt that he knew his job well and what would naturally be beneficial to my purchase.  Because of him I purchased gap insurance, and an extended electrical warranty.  With that, we filled out the rest of the paperwork quickly, and I was put in contact with Lewis once again.  He was prepared with the keys, and was ready for any and all questions I had.

The experience was extremely fast, with just over 2 hours of time spent at the dealership - from test drive to drive off lot.

Price was pretty good and the service they've provided was a total satisfaction to all of us. These guys are great assets of Honda of Spring. With such professionalism they've shown plus their friendliness, welcoming and accommodating personalities they provide made us felt Honda of Spring is our extended family.

Neil Pratt who did our financing was beyond anybody's wish guy. ""He is the Man"" as what my son said. He did what he supposed to do and that is to provide ease and convenience for buyers on their payments. We're too afraid to purchase a car due to our low credit score but Mr. Neil pulled it all and made everything happened. With that being said, we made another transactions by purchasing an Accord few months after.

Nobody can beat this dealership. We were there and we're a living witness.

394,"December 02, 2014","2 years ago I walked into Honda of Spring. I had non existent credit a single woman at the of 51   and had never owned a NEW car.. My expectations were very low and expected to be turned away.  My son suggested that I speak with Lewis, he sold my son his Civic SI.  So I decided on a 2012 Civic with 6 miles on it.  I was shuffled around for a bit and finally returned home to wait. On the 4th day Lewis called me and said come in and get your car, I was so  excited.  When I arrived I was told I would be speaking with Neil in the finance dept.  I sat in Neil's office and he reminded me that I had no credit and no credit was sometimes worse then bad credit, he could get me the car but financing would be 16.8%, I said thank you but NO..   Then the MAGIC, Neil asked me to give him some time.. He came back and said that they were willing to give me a shot. 2.9% I was ecstatic!

I have recently taken a different position at work which will require a lot of driving, so I got to thinking about the 38,000 miles already have on my car, and what it may be at the end of the loan UGH.  So I decided to go and ask some questions about lease and other options, again with low expectations.  Lewis took time with me showing me the lot and some options, and when he came out of the finance office the numbers were NOT in my budget, I said thank you for his time and for giving me the opportunity 2 years ago.

I received a call from Lewis and he told me to come in the next day to speak with Neil.. MAGIC!! Neil as always was straight forward with me and told me thank you for taking care of my business for the last 2 years, I smiled pridefully.

An hour after walking into Neil's office, we called Lewis into the office so I could tell him was the proud owner of MY BRAND NEW 2015 CIVIC, no money down, and .9% financing...

Being extremely stressed at the time (due to a variety of factors) I authorized the repairs over the phone.  When I went on the website to locate the dealership to pick up my vehicle I noticed there were numerous service specials listed on-line.  The majority of the repairs on my vehicle had corresponding specials.  When I went to pick up the vehicle I asked if an the specials had already been included and was told they had to be presented up front.  (Hurray for fine print)  I wouldn't mind this so much, if not for the fact that they prompted me for the repairs!  I guess I was expected to hang up, look on-line for deals and then call back?

406,"September 04, 2014","This is my ninth Honda in thirty years.  The years themselves have had their ups and downs, not the least of which was the ""Great Recession"" of '08-'09.  I recently returned to Honda of Spring to see about obtaining another vehicle, but as I expected, my financial reversals and credit score had pretty much excluded me from any program or offer.  Neil Pratt said to me as I walked out, ""listen, just give me about three days, and let's see how we can help you"", but by that time, I had resigned myself to ride-sharing for the next couple of years until things got better financially.   In exactly three days, Stewart Steele called and said ""I think we have a way to help"".   In two hours I was in my ninth Honda with payments I could actually afford!!!  
These people are true professionals who put the customer's needs first, and go to great lengths to not only work with you, but to actually HELP.  No wonder they are rated among the top dealers!

419,"June 21, 2014","In advance of my first visit to Honda of Spring, I already had decided to purchase a Pilot, and I brought along a short list of non-negotiable items.  Specifically, I insisted upon the colour (white), trailer hitch mount, cruise control, fog lamps, large wheels (18-inch), full-size spare, and Michelin tires (including a matching spare).


I discovered that, with the sole exception of the spare, everything on my list was standard on the Pilot EX.  And before price was discussed, two salesmen and two sales managers each in turn looked over the list, and each of them said ""We can do that.""


Alloy wheels are standard on the EX, but the dealer told me that the full-size spare would be mounted on a steel wheel; I anticipated this, and it was agreeable to me.


I was given a price for a 2014 Pilot EX, but none of the right colour happened to be in stock.  A few days later, I drove out to formalize the order, so that the dealer could start searching for a white Pilot EX from another dealer.  While a salesman was answering my questions concerning features of the Pilot, a manager drove up in a white 2015 Pilot, which he said had been unloaded just a few minutes before.  He said that he could give me the 2015 for very little more than I had agreed to pay for the 2014.  He came up with an attractive price, and I agreed to purchase the 2015.


When I drove out a few days later to pick up my new Pilot, the dealer told me that a full-size spare was on order, but would not come in for a few more days yet.  When I returned a few days later to pick up the full-size spare, I noticed as the mechanic was rolling out the mounted tire that the steel wheel was 17-inch, and that the tire mounted on the wheel was a Continental.


Without hesitation, the dealer said that he would replace the Continental with a Michelin; but he told me that Honda does not make 18-inch steel wheels.  Thus, even with a Michelin tire, the spare would differ in both size and tread from the other tires on the car.


My specification that the spare be full-size and that the tire on the spare match the other tires on the car appears to be an unusual request.  Of course, had I purchased the LX instead of the EX, there would be no mismatch, because 17-inch steel wheels are standard on the LX.


I then asked whether the spare tire well could accommodate the standard EX tire mounted on an EX alloy wheel; the mechanic said that the standard EX wheel would fit into the well.  Inasmuch as I had agreed on a steel wheel for the spare, I proposed to pay the difference in price between an 18-inch alloy wheel and the 17-inch steel wheel.


While the parts department was checking price and availability of an 18-inch alloy wheel, a manager came over and told me that I was going to receive at no charge not only a matching Michelin tire, but also a matching 18-inch alloy wheel, thus making the spare an exact match for the other wheels and tires.  


I am reminded of the words of Psalm 15, in which divine blessing is pronounced upon the man who ""swears to his own hurt, and changes not"", which is to say, a man who honours his word even when doing so incurs unanticipated cost.


The dealer pointed out that there is a minor downside to a full-size spare, namely, that the rotation scheme is complicated a bit: ideally, the spare should be included in the rotation, so that tread wear is kept about the same for all tires.  This being my first experience with a front-wheel-drive vehicle, that factor did not occur to me; mismatch typically is of little consequence with conventional rear-wheel drive.


With each of my several visits to Honda of Spring, I have left with the impression that I have been visiting a cordial family in its home.  Each of the personnel I encountered has been courteous, and each was willing to get involved, working as part of a team, in order to answer a question or solve a problem.  The team spirit is very evident, and is refreshing.


The architecture of the facility deserves comment, for it contributes to a good experience for the customer.  The layout of the complex is remarkable: the architect has managed to create a very comfortable environment, largely because there are no sharp lines of demarcation between parking lot, showroom, service waiting area, parts counter, and service shop.  Instead of being confined to a tiny waiting room with an obnoxious, blaring television set, the customer is free to move back and forth between the various areas of the dealership.  The facility is spacious, with high ceilings, good illumination, air-conditioning, and plenty of glass.  The service area is clean, spacious, well-illuminated, and well-organized.  Particularly nice is the service-writing area, which is a large covered portal with high ceiling, good illumination, and a number of wide lanes.


In summary, everything -- facility, personnel, and policy -- combines to make a visit to Honda of Spring a good experience.

It was extra pleasant for my wife and I because we are now coming out of a huge loss in our retirement money investments and if it wasn't for Neil and his advice to help us go in the right direction with our money we still have, we would not have been going to Honda of Spring this time to make a  deal, we would have been going to turn in our CR V because we could no longer pay our lease note.  As it turned out, Neil worked our a deal for us to lease a new Accord for 36 months and then be able to refinance it at the end of the 36 month period.and purchase it and continue to enjoy our new car.  Lewis was just as large in our deal making today by his showing us several new Accords for us to choose from.  After the deal was made, Lewis helped us swap things from our CR V to the new Honda Accord and then explain all the new equipment on our Accord.  THANK YOU NEIL AND LEWIS FOR ALL YOUR HONESTY AND HARD WORK IN HELPING ME AND MY WIFE.  That is why Honda of Spring is the best  dealership we have ever tried to do business with.

Tu  Doan, was a great rep for Honda of Spring and for the manufacture. The Finance manager, Neil Pratt, was so polished and presented a great deal with all my costs up front and gave us options both that would benefit him and me. The price was very completive and the car was awesome.  In fact, even with some credit challenges and my upside down financial situation on my trade in, our payment was very good and within our budget.  I then turned loose my wife on Neil, she is my Negotiator.  After dealing with a big ford dealer (Planet Ford) , a big Chevrolet dealer ( Mac Haik) and being jerked around by there all too familiar sales tactics, bait and switch, selling by the payment etc, she worked a deal with Neil and Honda of Spring that was fair for us and them.  She is a tiger when negotiating but Neil put her at ease. 

My wife got a great deal for a 2014 Honda Accord Ex. She was almost in tears it made her so happy.  Score for me, now my secondary plan, find one for me.  After driving a mustang and getting sticker shock, Neil said to go pick one out!   So I bought a  2014 Civic, souped up and sport edition off the showroom floor. I drove it and could not stop smiling both at my cunningness and the sheer fun of driving this car!

Normally after buying a car I need a 4 year rest before im would submit myself to more punishment, However I was floored at the ease of buying there.   I

Im 50 now and we all know buying a car is like going to have a tooth pulled!   However Neil and Tu made it so easy to by a car and make it comfortable.

That was my mistake but Lewis remained professional about my mishap. Throughout the entire process, he made me feel at ease and didn't overwhelm with so many details about the Honda Fit I test drove.

434,"October 25, 2013","I had my 2007 Honda power steering fluid flushed. They broke my high pressure hose and then wanted me to pay for it. $600 . It wasn't leaking when I brought the car in. They waited until they were all finished with all the service work and then called me and told me that power steering fluid was squirting all over the place. I went down there to see for myself and it was NOT. There was a small leak they pointed to and then admitted that it was not leaking before they serviced it.  They are responsible for the leak because they used too much pressure in the flush and they caused the leak.  They refuse to do anything. At the very least, they should split the cost of the new hose if they can't determine that it was there before they serviced the vehicle.

Another time, I had my oil changed and wondered why I had been waiting for three hours when my Honda pulls up with two female employees from the service department who get out with sacks of food from Burger King telling me that they just took my car for a test ride.

Yeah, right. So, how did it go thru the drive-in at Burger King?  Pretty smooth or what?

The financial guys are great as well.  Irshad spelled out all the details of my lease - and never having had a lease before, this was greatly appreciated!  He made sure I understood everything about the paperwork and helped to streamline the process.

All in all, I would most definitely recommend this dealership!  The experience was easy and convenient - and two days later, I drove away in my new car!  Very happy here :)",5.0

439,"August 27, 2013","Richard Sapp is, in my opinion, the quintessential sales rep and I would recommend him to anyone who is considering purchasing a vehicle. My recent experience (in July) turned out to be both enjoyable and virtually hassle-free - and I owe this to Richard. 2 days later I drove away VERY happy & satisfied with a new CR-V. Richard is a ""real guy"". He is friendly, warm, engaging and extremely knowledgeable about not only the Honda brand & inventory, but other makes as well.  

I set out looking to buy a USED vehicle, and was not particularly interested in Honda. My girlfriend accompanied me during my car hunting journey, and we visited a few dealerships in the north Houston area, with Honda of Spring being the third or fourth visit. Richard Sapp was our first contact, on the Pre-Owned lot, and that was it. After that we never even considered another brand or dealer!  Richard was not at all pushy or aggressive, asked us a few questions, then said he would be available if we needed any help. This alone was a huge departure in the car buying experience. As a result, we were able to relax, take our time looking at the inventory & then get Richard's assistance when we were ready. We drove one used CR-V, and after some discussion about pricing, financing and models, we decided to stroll over to the new lot. We found a new model (2013) which exactly fit my needs, but decided to sleep on it. Richard was very accomodating, and did not even try to pin us down for contact information nor a conditional committment. 

Again, because of his approach & consideration, we went back to Honda of Spring the next day, and from that point Richard guided us through the purchase process with tremendous care, thoughtfulness and professionalism. Because Richard is primarily on the Pre-owned side, he offered to introduce me to a sales rep on the New lot who could take over the process - but I insisted that I only wanted Richard to take care of me. I even was willing to wait for Richard to help his other customers on the Pre-owned side. Once it was time to sit down and discuss price, Richard had his hands full dealing with both me and my girlfriend (she's an accountant)!  We were very specific in our budget and needs, and we kept Richard running & on his toes. Despite all that, he never stopped smiling, understood our conditions and he enthusiastically (and respectfully) went the distance with us. This includes spending the time with us after the purchase (it was getting late) going through the various options, accesspories and bells & whistles. In short, once I found a new vehicle which I liked, my entire decision to purchase from Honda of Spring was because of Richard Sapp. Thank you Honda of Spring, and especially, thank you Richard Sapp!",5.0

Richard also arranged for my $500 deposit on his CR-V to be refundable and arranged for it to be refunded a day later.  Richard Sapp is a credit to the automotive industry and represented Honda of Spring superbly in his dealings with me, which had to be conducted largely by phone since I live in Colorado‚Ä¶

All Im going to say is after buying 2 BMWs from two separate dealers, 2 Mercedes from two separate dealers, a Lexus and a Hyundai from dealers, I am definitely a regular at car shopping. But the service i received from Sean Burtt and his general sales manager was exceptionally outstanding! They understood what i was looking for, followed up with me from time to time to find the Honda i needed for a daily use, recommended me with the car i was leaning towards anyways, and DID EVERYTHING POSSIBLE to get me a great deal for my great new car. I was treated with great courtesy, respect and timely service. For once, choosing the car took the longest for me, after that it was all an easy buying process. They did not waste my time at all with the general BS sales tactics salesman use to frustrate the customer. That was the amazing part! Every dealership i went to prior to this and every salesman i dealt with prior to this frustrated me in some way, but these guys did not give me even a single reason to complain. Everything was handled in a professional manner, and with respect to my time and sanity. My car was made ready while i signed the papers, and i hardly had a 5 min wait time between the process. I walked into the dealership to buy the car after a previous visit, two hours i was done buying the car, and i left the lot with a brand spanking new Honda Accord Coupe with a full tank of gas. The CUSTOMER SERVICE was outstanding, the general sales manager personally came to thank me and appreciated my business. I shopped other Honda dealers in the area, before making my final decision, but i will tell you this... Sean and his general manager provided me with the best deal by a long shot and the best service i have ever seen in a car dealership.

The vehicle test drove great, and Richard and the dealership went to the extent of taking care of a few issues regarding the condition of the vehicle. We were provided a loaner from the pre-owned department, took care of us on filling up our vehicle (for the second time) with gas, and handled everything about as good as I could have asked for. Aaron in financing was very easy to work with, found a great rate at a credit union, and the process was taken care of extremely efficiently.

456,"April 01, 2013","After my husband who is 6'9"" became disabled due to hospital errors we had to rethink our transportation needs. Went shopping SUVs last year and finding the needed room lacking we walked away.  This year we discovered Mini Vans by accident while attending the Houston Rodeo in February when that was the handicapped transportation furnished from the remote parking lot to the rodeo grounds. 

Being shocked at the room, ride and options available in the van used at the rodeo area I started researching and soon discovered we had to go with either a Odyssey or Sienna. First I went and looked at both in 2010 and 2011 models (I don't buy New for a reason) and decided the Honda was the way to go I then dragged my husband to see the Odyssey. We were more than impressed! I started looking at dealer, salesman and finance manager ratings to narrow down where to shop here on this site.

Found a great deal on a 2010 Odyssey Touring with less than 25000 miles and if you can believe this after talking with the top rated salesman the deal got better so I bought the van sight unseen and traded the Grand Marquis sight unseen.

Your not going to believe this but not only did we buy sight unseen but the salesman and finance manager worked this deal by email and phone and we never visited their lot!  Being the good people they are they brought the van and paperwork to our house more than 45 minutes from the dealership to allow us to avoid having my husband sit for hours in a wheelchair at the dealership.

Our Odyssey Touring is immaculate and looks like it came off the showroom floor and we can't be happier. If your in the market Honda of Spring 17350 North Fwy Houston, TX 77090 - Deal with Richard Sapp in sales and Neil Pratt in finance I will do business with them again and again, it was a pleasure to work with people who not only listened to our needs but went above and beyond to exceed our expectations!",4.8

He understood that I wanted something I could feel comfortable driving. He was very efficient when I decided to buy the vehicle. He helped clean the car himself so that we could get out of there as soon as possible. It was late on Saturday night and he was so kind to stand outside with us and wait while everything was going through. I enjoyed talking to him about his life and family. He wasn't overly talkative though. He was a great person to buy a car from. I thought he handled the whole afternoon/evening with great customer service and treated me like a person. not just a sale.

From the time I drove in the lot I only had to wait maybe about a minute or so. The staff was very friendly, knowledgeable and courteous. The waiting area was nice and clean, free popcorn and coffee along with a movie. The service was over very quickly and the associate walk me to the desk for check out. No one made me feel like I had to buy or purchase more than I needed and it was just an Overall Great Experience. Thank you! ",5.0

496,"July 13, 2011","Being a young father of 3 I had always looked for the ""best deal"" when it came to auto service.  The thing you don't get when going to those places is the technical expertise of your vehicle and usually professional customer service.  Since recently moving to Spring, I found that the closest Honda dealership was a bit of a drive for me, so I stayed away for my oil changes.  With a recent problem that I thought would be under warranty, I made the trek to Honda of Spring.  I was completley impressed with the quality of quality service that Sarah Willis (service advisor) gave in explaining everything and keeping me informed throughout the process.  Couple that with the reasonable price that I didn't think a dealer would offer and they've got a customer for life!  Sarah was great and the technician working on my vehicle (who I met) was wonderful as well.  Very happy with my visit and I look forward to taking my vehicle ""to the dealership"" for my service knowing it's the best option for me.",5.0

He also gave me some ballpark financing numbers to take home to my husband.  My husband and I came back in that weekend to look at the car.  Richard was awesome!  He patiently answered all of my husband's questions.  He then went above and beyond and gave me and my husband over half an hour to discuss our finances by ourselves.  We never felt pressured.  My husband even made the comment that Richard made him feel like an actual person, not just a wallet.  I really feel that the level of customer service we received sealed the deal.  Chris Williams was our financial consultant.  He also answered all of our questions.  Both Richard and Chris stayed late on a Saturday night to get the job done.

They both respected my budget, concerns about the fit and finish of the vehicle I test drove (and ended up buying), and my time.  My only 2 relatively minor complaints were that phone calls always felt rushed and impersonal.  Perhaps this can't be helped though.  Dealership employees are often multi-tasking working several deals simultaneously.  Additionally, a few surface scratches were left without touch up.  Again, this is a relatively minor complaint since noone should expect a used vehicle to look exactly like it's a new vehicle.",4.8

536,"November 18, 2009"," I should have know better than to try and buy a car from Goodson because a week earlier they sold my friends a ""new"" car and when they went to pick the car up Goodson told them that they had let the pilots for the air show in Galveston drive it and it would be back on Wednesday with around 200 miles on it.  But even after this I gave the the benefit of the doubt.  I am a recent grad with no real credit history and I don't have a co-signer and I am a first time buyer.  I called them before I even went in because I didn't want to waste my time.  I told them my credit score and the lack of my credit history and no co-signer and the sales man Mike Carver told me he could help me for sure.  So I went down there and test drove a civic and CR-V.  When pricing time came he came back with a really high price for the CR-V.  I told him about a special they were having on the CR-V that I had seen on their web-site and the he magically remembered it and went and adjusted the price.  Once we had settled on a price I told him I needed to think about it over-night. He told me to take the CR-V I wanted home to drive for the next day.  I told him this was not necessary but he insisted.  I agreed to take it home for the night and bring it back the next day.  He then brought in a piece of paper that he said I needed to sign so that I would be covered under their insurance in case anything happened.  I directly asked him if this had anything to do with buying a car and he said NO.  I took the car home and the next day came back to sign the lease.  I traded in my car and gave them my down payment and signed all of the leasing agreements and drove off in my new car.  Then 5 days later I get a phone call from Neil the finance guy saying that I needed to bring the car back because I hadn't gotten financed. I said no I said all of the paperwork and you told me I was good to go.  You need to fix this.  He said he would try and would call me back.  A week later when I hadn't heard from them I assumed that everything had been figured out.  However, then next day, almost 2 weeks after I had signed all of the paper work, I got a call from Neil saying I needed to bring the car back and I was being charged $20 a day and $.20 a mile every mile over 20 a day I drove.  I didn't understand how legally they could do this. So I went to the dealership where they showed me the ""insurance"" paper I signed the night I took the car to test drive.  In that document it had a blanket statement that said they could take the car back for numerous reasons, one being no financing.  So while legally they can take my care back it is crappy way to do business and horrible costumer service.  Because I also found out that they knew the day I took the car home to test drive that I had been declined.  So when I brought it back they thought I would magically be able to get a co-signer.
