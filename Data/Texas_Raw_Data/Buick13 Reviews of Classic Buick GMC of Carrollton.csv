2,"September 13, 2019","Follow though, punctuality , attention to detail, active listeners, and integrity. These characteristics I’d use to describe the feel or working with the used car team at Classic of Carrollton.  I purposely made it tough on them, with a last minute appt, suspect credit to say the least, and short on time. To get it done it took a team effort. Lawrence took my initial call, set the appt, and made me feel great about coming to the lot. During the call he mentioned the car would be pulled up front so that we could see it right as we arrived - that was a big win! Mom couldn’t take her eyes off of it - she was smitten like a kitten!  I had to pry her into the office.. From that point we worked with a super knowledgeable, and friendly sales associate, Alex. He was superb. Finally we entered the dreaded Finance office:). Right away Jay connected with us and we were laughing and cutting up in no time!  I give Jay “Boss Man” Wilson my highest straight-shooter  seal of approval. He made it easy by beating the competitors rate, an affordable payment, and bumper to bumper coverage and Gap - which helps mom sleep at night. Many thanks for a phenomenal experience and one of the least painless car buying experiences I’ve had to date. Count on us to refer family and friends and I’ll be back for a new GMC truck very soon!  Lawrence, Alex, and Jay - keep being car rock stars - don't change a thing!  Happy Friday and have a great weekend!

4,"June 30, 2017","made two visits in the same day to show the sales guy my interest in the truck,at the first visit gave all my info to get the app process started, he told me if i came back 6 hrs latter it would be in and out process and i told him if he needed any additional info he can call me on my cell.
 the commute to the dealership took 45min one way (made that commute 4 times that day) upon arrival he indicated he was tied up so he couldnt work on it , he started scrambling to get the paper work going by the time it was all said and done he handed over my paper work to finance in the next building me and my co-worker sat at the lobby for 45min with no one in site arrived before 4pm decided to leave  close to 6.This is what takes the cake he called me and yelled at me for going home.

5,"April 02, 2015","My husband and I found our car online then followed the posting to Classic in Carrollton. We were connected with Rodney and he took such great care of us! He was able to get us the car we wanted within the budget we had.  He always treated us with respect and followed through with everything he said he would do to take care of us and getting us on the road with our car. We had to have our car in soon after buying to fix a part and Rodney made all the arrangements for us, gave me a great car to borrow, and communicated really well through the process. Rodney truly cares about his customers and works hard to meet their needs. Every person we worked with and encountered with Classic was a true class act!",4.8
6,"January 23, 2015","After shopping around at several other dealerships, I received a referral from a friend to use BJ in sales at Classic Buick GMC in Carrolton. I contacted BJ over the phone and from that point on, the process of purchasing a 2015 Yukon Denali was exceptional.  Very easy.  Very informative.  Very nice.  And very fair. Classic gave me fair market value on my trade in.  They, especially BJ, made the whole process of purchasing a car very easy, and stress free.  I will absolutely be returning to that dealership for service as well as my future purchases.  ",5.0
7,"August 01, 2012","James Dion at D&M Leasing in Dallas did a fantastic job helping me get my new Denali last year and was amazing with follow up and some help I needed after it was delivered.  I have recommended him to several friends and associates and look to use him again with the lease of my daughters new car and he will be my agent for life.

Had a good experience with Classic as well twice taking my Denali in for a repair and again for service.  Nice people that did a good job and good work and were great at communicating with me about pick up times, etc.",3.8
8,"May 24, 2012","Called dealer about an auto I saw online. He told me that vehicle was sold, and would call me back about other options. 15 minutes later, he called back and told me he had another vehichle, same year and a little less money than the one I called about. I explained that I live over an hour away and didnt have much time, so he said he would have it ready for me to see. When I arrived, he couldnt find the auto....after about 20 minutes, he said it was sold, but we have another one like only it was 7000.00 more. To top it all off, when he presented the deal to me on the other auto, they didn't come off the price a dime. What a wasted 3 hours of my life. ",1.7

10,"February 01, 2012","The internet salesman, Donnie, was very prompt and friendly when I expressed interest in ordering a new truck. He kept me updated on the progress and the delivery was smooth and painless. Thanks, Classic of Carrollton!",5.0
11,"January 26, 2012","Contacted the dealership about a new GMC Yukon XL via email.  After a few days, was contacted by the internet manager and told me to come by.  First visit was scattered, disorganized and made me feel like I had just dropped in.  After asking some questions about the car, it was clear that they did not know their facts about the car.  My second visit was worse, when they put an ""insulting"" number on my trade in.  I should have seen that they were not interested in doing business.  I left and never went or called back.  I sold my car for $9500 more than their trade in number, and am now driving a beautiful 2012 Yukon XL Denali from a competing dealership. Everything works out in the end. ",1.3
12,"September 26, 2011","I went to their website twice and did the online chat session to get more information from them.  They never contacted me, so I corresponded with Gateway and they were very helpful.",1.0
