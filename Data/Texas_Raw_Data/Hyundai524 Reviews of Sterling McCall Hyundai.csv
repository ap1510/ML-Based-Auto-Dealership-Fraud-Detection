1,"February 19, 2020","I had the worst buying experience at this dealership, it was a total waste of my time and an insult to me and my family. I went over there after finding a vehicle online trying to avoid hours of waiting, I told them exactly what I was looking for and where I needed to be numbers wise, after 3 hours there they called me to the finance office and the finance manager Victor  Told me “You are approved for $0 down and a monthly payment of $352 but is late and I want to call a couple other banks tomorrow morning to see if I can get you a better APR” so I asked him 3 times: so I am already approved for $352 correct? And he said “Yes, that’s a fact, it’s a done deal, let’s go get your new car and you can come back tomorrow to finish with the paperwork “ we came back home with the car after the finance manager told me it was a done deal. Two days after they called me to go and finish the paperwork, but surprise!! When the guy came with some numbers completely different and saying that because it was late the bank gave him a number and they change it later.... what the h is that supposed to mean??? He showed me the numbers, had me sign the agreement and then he was trying to tell me that I needed to purchase a brand new vehicle instead of an used one in order to be in that payment range, to me that is a just trying to sell something more expensive by lying to your customers, so after 3 more hours of stupidity I had to take my old car back. The only 2 people that really tried to work with me and really helped me where the sales guy Michael Stewart and his manager. So if you want to have a nice experience don’t you ever go to this dealership, they are going to lie to you in your face just to try to make you purchase something completely different and way more expensive and out of your budget than what you had in mind.",1.0
2,"December 22, 2019","DO NOT STEP FOOT ON THIS PROPERTY!
They are lying, unethical and down right rude! I placed a deposit down on a vehicle, they in turn kept showing it to others and then sold it as I was on my way to pay cash, in full! They could not have cared less either. The “manager” Josue “Josh” Camago was a degrading, rude, undignified specimen of a being. They made it difficult to even get the deposit back, luckily after a few days, they credited my card. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THESE PEOPLE! There are so many other dealerships and ETHICAL sales people out there – go see them! 
If you want to get ripped off, go see them! If you want a good laugh as to why people use the term “used car salesman”, go see them! 
The best part of this whole scenario – I did NOT purchase a used vehicle from them, I did purchase a NEW vehicle from somewhere else, I didn’t get jacked around and am way happier than I would have been with these fools. ",1.0
3,"July 08, 2019","Great experience, was greeted as soon as I walked through the door. Mr. Johnny Maldonado did an outstanding job explained in detail what was needed and the price. My visit  was just exceptional overall! ",5.0
4,"July 02, 2019","Not only were my requested repairs made, but the dealership spotted a few other deficiencies and took it upon themselves to address these items at no cost to me.  So, I left the dealership with my car in ""Tip Top Shape"", and currently my older car is now performing as if it were a ""Brand New One""!

I commend the staff at this location for making a very difficult situation for not only me the customer, but also for them, as we all had to work around ""HYUNDAI's timetable"", into an overall ""Great Experience"" at the end of the day.

They provided me with a ""Free Rental Car"" while my vehicle was waiting for the parts that were needed to transform my car back into the fine running machine it once was.  

A special ""Thank You"" to Aubrey Cook, Joe in the parts department, and my service advisor Kelly!

5,"January 31, 2019","I have been bringing my vehicle here for over a year. So far, I have had nothing but excellent service! Mayka, the service coordinator has been very helpful. Sean the service manager has been very accommodating to all the needs my vehicle needed! ",5.0
6,"December 26, 2018","I would leave negative stars if I could.  Do not get your car serviced here.  Will never go back.  Had an appointment for 9am today for check engine light and then state inspection, dropped car off at 8:15am, and before the shuttle took me to work I saw them pull my car in.  Got no response or updates on my car, called them and was on hold for 30 mins, finally got through on my 4th call, lady took down a message and had the service guy call me back.  He called me back at 3:40pm and said my car was next in line.  Why schedule an appointment if nothing was done to my car?  What were they doing all day?  Got off work and went to the see the status of my car at 6pm, they still didn't look at it yet.  For check engine light don't you just connect to the computer and see what's wrong?  I picked up my car and taking somewhere else.  This happened to when I took my car for the airbag light.  They said they had to order parts and would call me when the parts arrived.  This was in September.  I took my car to Texans Hyundai and they fixed it in 1 hour.  Wasted a whole day and other reviews I've read it's happened to other people before and the GM just replies for them to contact him.  If I was a GM I would reach out myself to see who dropped the ball.  Do not get your car serviced here unless you can wait for a few days and don't need your car.  I wouldn't even take my car back there if they offered to pay for everything and a loaner car.  Horrible service.",1.0
7,"October 30, 2018","Made an appointment online around midnight the night before.  Lo and behold they were ready for me at the appointed time.   Quick walkaround and off we go.  Serviced in record time, courteous, friendly and thorough.",5.0
8,"August 31, 2018","This is the worst place to get your car serviced! I waited for 2 whole days and was on hold for over 30 mins in numerous instances to receive an update on the status of my car and never received one. 
I wonder how they get away with treating paying customers so poorly...
I had my 30,000 mile service done a month ago and paid close to $1000, and it was good; however, I needed to get my catalytic converter looked into and nobody would get back to me for 2 days and I kept getting the run around.",1.0
9,"August 10, 2018","KEEP DRIVING!  Right past this dealership to another Hyundai dealership for SERVICE. Was there three months ago.  Pulled in 9:15am with appointment.  Told to wait for service advisor in the ""customer lounge"". Not another soul waiting on a car.  90 minutes later, the service advisor approaches me for the first time.  Totally unacceptable and no way to run a business.  They completed the work on my car quickly, and I left.  I have had good service here in the past, so when approached for a ""great review"", I did not review at all.  After all, if you can't say something nice, don't say anything.  Brought my car in today for 9:15 appointment for an oil change only, and I made the appointment checking the box that I would be waiting. Upon entering, the waiting area was full. At 9:40, Isaac Barrios approaches and tells me that along with the oil change they will do a 40 point inspection, car wash, and the car will be ready in THREE hours!!!  I asked him, what does an appointment mean at this dealership?  His answer:  an appointment to talk to me.  I then asked, what does it mean when a customer schedules an appointment and checks the box that says the customer will wait?  He shrugs his shoulders. I asked him for my car back.  The customer waiting next to me asked, did he just say three hours for an oil change?  I said yes, that is terrible customer service and I left.  WHEN A DEALERSHIP HAS NO RESPECT FOR ITS CUSTOMERS, IT IS TIME TO FIND A BETTER SERVICE DEPARTMENT!!!!!  KEEP DRIVING!  One star was overly generous.",2.0
10,"June 18, 2018","Verbally confirmed over the phone that car was there and was ready to test drive...Got there 25 mins later...car desired to test drive was just magically 'sold', no evidence of the sale given, but of course similar care were there and available to buy.  Complete waste of time.  3 days have now passed and this car is still online and listed as available but now has even more pictures listed!  Probably a fake car fax as well.  Sleeze bags work here!",1.0
11,"June 05, 2018",Guys! I can’t thank them enough! Absolutely amazing. Jacob has been more than accommodating. He made sure it’s was smooth and I couldn’t be happier with my car. My GT is the best purchase I’ve made in awhile. From start to finish- it was flawless. I definitely recommend getting your next car from here! Thank you for the best service! See you for my first oil change!,5.0
12,"January 18, 2018",Krar and Douglas did a fine job of finding a car.  They were committed to earning my business and followed through on their promises.  They responded to all my questions quickly and thoroughly.  I am very pleased with the service received and will begin my future car shopping at this dealership.  ,5.0
13,"January 16, 2018","If you’re looking for a new or used car go to Sterling McCall Hyundai and ask for Rewis.  By far the best car sales associate I’ve ever worked with.  It was a pleasure working with him!  

I went in on Saturday to look at potential cars I was considering and my mother and I were greeted with a handshake and a smile by Rewis in the parking lot.  I let him know I had seen a 2014 Lexus GS on the website and I was interested in seeing it in person.  We were invited into his office and offered coffee and drinks.  As we sat Rewis returned and let us know that he car was waiting for us outside.  When we walked outside to see the car the hood was popped, doors were open, and Rewis walked us around showing us under the hood, the all the details and features. 
We test drove the car and retured to the dealership to talk about price.  The negotiating part of car buying is by far the worst and most dreadful part about car buying for anyone.  At least I think so.  However, Rewis did it with a smile the whole time and made me and my mom comfortable throughout the process.  He was honest and let me know what was, and was not possible, and didn’t let it interfere with his customer service skills. 

He took the entire Saturday going over every detail of the car I was looking at.  He truly went  above and beyond anything I ever expected. Rewis was professional, knowledgeable, and clearly understands customer service. 

What was truly even more impressive is Monday morning, Rewis called me and asked me how I was liking the car.  Honestly I personally have never had follow up like that after buying a car, new or used. 

I stopped by on Monday and expressed my gratitude to the General Manager for Rewis Anne making my new purchase an absolute seamless and pleasant one! 

My family and I will 100% be back to Sterling McCall Hyundai!",4.8

29,"December 24, 2017","Both salespersons were great and professional. My original salesman (Iloyd) kept in touch and returned my calls. He wasn't able to be there when I picked up my car, but the woman (I think Cathy?) that helped me was amazing. Finance department personnel were friendly, although when they had a question they waited for me to call rather than taking the initiative to call me.. I was upset over the extra three thousand dollars but really needed the car. I was also not too happy about the discrepancy in the official mileage reading and the actual. There were 500 extra miles on the car they did not disclose. No one has called me back to talk about this.",4.6
30,"December 23, 2017"," My 2013 Genesis had electrical problems manifested by radio and dash lights flickering. We took it in the first time to Sterling Mc Call Hyundai and the service advisor started the car, left it running, replaced a fuse and said it was was fixed and never drove it. A week later we returned and the second advisor said it was done, couldn’t find anything. He said he would be there but when we arrived he was gone. After demanding to see someone who knew what he was doing, Sean, shop foreman, came to our rescue. His electric serviceman located the short.. To complete the repair required 3 trips, one service advisor lying that he checked the car, another assuring us he would be there and disappearing and finally someone who knew what he was doing. And 3 trips. I gave them 3 stars only because of Sean. ",3.2

She got me in the car I wanted at the right price . Everything was upfront and no games played throughout the process. Great experience!,5.0
36,"December 13, 2017","DON'T GO HERE unless critical (ex: car stalls or shuts down). This place gives you the runaround and is not transparent upfront.  Quick to get you in and out without thoroughly inspecting your vehicle for potential issues. As a result, you don't know what your vehicle needs until something goes wrong. For example, I took my car in for an oil change 2 months ago . My engine light came on soon after. Went back and had to get another oil change. Had to spend $300 dollars to get the engine cleaned from oil deposits and buildup since no one told me this on my last visit. Waited over 3 hours for nothing. I waited an hour and a half AFTER they were done working on my vehicle since no one bothered to come tell me.  After I paid, they didn't give me the keys. I had to ask 3 different service advisors where my keys were since no one knew or cared to find out. Finally got my keys 5 minutes later.",1.6

39,"December 12, 2017",Each time I come here I have a great experience. Everyone is so nice and helpful makes you feel very special. And each time I go they clean my car up better than the carwash lol. I absolutely love this place.,5.0

41,"December 09, 2017","Had my 2017 Hyundai Tucson serviced for oil change and tires nail/pressure check. Service was prompt and less than an hour as estimated by service advisor William Moore. Nail removed and it had not penetrated the tire - excellent  and no charge for tire check. Car wash added too at no extra charge 

In addition, and to rate the customer experience well above great - it was raining and I got los looking for the car in the service lot given the rain and similar cars around.  Then, service advisor Michael Hopki noticed what was going on and he stepped out of his desk and asked me to stay at the office while he went out and kindly brought the car to me - so kind

I immediately used the wipers to clean it for better view and  after to try wash it , guss what ???? there in NO fluid in the wash reservoir tank !!!!!!! they forgot or not willing to top off the fluid of the windshield washer reservoir tank !!!!!! and because of that neglect of service section , I was almost involved in car accident and then I did pull over and cleaned the windshield at nearest gas station . Seriously,  the fluids top off should be done and always done even at small shop free of charger and the one gallon of windshield liquid is about $1.30 at Walmart , however the service guy was trying to digging in the car to find problem so they can charge me a lot for it , for example they said the licinced plate bulb is out and trying to charge me almost $50 bucks to fix it however I did fix it my self with $5 bucks of new bulb from autozone, I am very dissatisfied.

I wanted to make sure that this paint job would be durable, and he promised that only hitting a curb or an acid bath would damage it. The paint job ended up being flaky, so they repainted it, and then it was as soft as a fingernail. The salesman said I'd have to sell the wheels on the aftermarket and buy new ones on my own. When I took this up with the general manager of the dealership, he acted shocked and appalled. But when I drove down to the dealership again, this manager was half an hour late showing up, then completely dismissed my claims, raising his voice at me, and then showing me the same paint job on his Range Rover (yes, he doesn't drive a Hyundai). His paint job was a year and a half old and was covered in pit marks. He said the best he could do was send me a quote for new wheels but I'd have to sell my ""old"" wheels on the aftermarket. He never sent anything.",1.6

This is my first experience with a car lease, so the only initial surprise for me was the additional amount included for car protection, depreciation, etc. added to the monthly lease amount. I am not sure if the Sales staff knows these specific costs that the Finance staff encourages including for lease agreements? ... or if they are optional?

The finance guy over the phone said ""OK, otherwise we would take the car back."" I was thinking to myself xxx, didn't I just say I was going to go in and sign it?

Most importantly, she gave us upfront pricing and spent a lot of time on the phone answering all of our questions.

I answered above that I would not likely use this dealership for maintenance because it is quite a distance from my home, nothing more.

They pulled the site up on there desktop and they even reflected the $8,990 price. They told me to ignore that, that it was just a mistake that would be fixed. I told them that since that vehicle is being advertised for that price, that is the price I should receive. They refused this completely, only offering me $300.00 off the sticker price.  We had several discussions about this, the sales manager got involved, and they told me clearly that they could not honor their internet advertised price.",1.0

I have never had such a friendly and straightforward car buying experience.",5.0
308,"December 04, 2016","I would like to share this most frustrating and confidence-destroying experience that I have had at Sterling McCall Hyundai in Houston, TX. 
When I planned to have a new car, I did my online research and decided to entrust the future safety of my family and reliability of my travels to Hyundai. With two Hyundai dealers in Houston, I called both South Loop and Sterling McCall. South Loop gave me a quote by phone and I called Sterling McCall to compare. I was greeted by Mr. Stephen Alum, who assured me that Sterling McCall owned South Loop and that it was impossible that they could offer me anything better. I later found out (after my purchase) that that was not true and that neither had power over the other. Regardless, Stephen offered me a price by phone and I drove over to make it happen. There, he showed me the 2 cars (2017 Sonata Sport) that he would offer to me at that price. Mid-deal, we experienced a salesperson change, which was odd. After we decided which one we wanted, the new salesperson told me that Stephen made a mistake and that the price was $2,500 more than what he promised us!!! That should have been our red light to walk out, but we thought mistakes happen (though it would be the honorable thing to pay for your own mistakes rather than making the customer pay). So we stuck with our budget and they downgraded us to the SE. 
A few days after driving it, we start to realize that the AC was not functioning properly; in neutral, it was very hot and we needed to turn it up to maximum power to get any cooling at all. We were shocked as at the time of purchase, we were told that Hyundai boasts the best AC in the industry! We called and a technician told us that that’s how it’s supposed to be??!!  “Hyundai has the best AC system in the industry” immediately changed to “Everyone says they have the best AC in the industry and it doesn’t really mean anything!! (straight from the tech’s mouth)” We then took it to South Loop (closer to my residence) to get it checked. With an AC thermometer, they determined that it was blowing air in excess of 100 degrees F in neutral!! They immediately confirmed that this was a defect, however, they stated that we would need to take it to Sterling McCall to switch out with another car since they could not fix it easily. This is where things get really unpleasant! Sterling McCall tells us that that’s normal in all SE models (100+ degree air in neutral is normal) and that to get room temperature air in neutral, we would need to upgrade to sport!! They then proceeded to show us our options, neglecting to tell us something of paramount importance: they would consider our car, driven lightly for only a few days, as a used trade-in!!  It was as if we simply changed our minds and would have to suffer a $2,500+ value loss in only a few days because it was our fault we wanted to change models!! I reminded them vigorously that it was their fault for selling us an obviously defective car and that’s why we were here. It was their mistake and they need to make amends for it; not the other way around. No avail; they asked for $8,000 to make up for the difference between an SE and a Sport, a price that I found ridiculous! After long negotiations, they dropped it to $3,000 (which indicates to me once again that they play big games with the price and start you off at nowhere near what they need to sell for seeing whether or not they can rip a big chunk out of someone who wasn’t keen on the situation). I was not happy to have my wallet strung along all for their mistakes. The entire time, the new general manager, “Sam” made it very clear that he was too important to deal with his customers, preferring to play human telephone (relaying messages) through his sales clerk instead. In the end, he basically told us that that’s how it is and if we didn’t like the AC, we could complain to Hyundai! He washed his hands of the matter because he didn’t build the car! Make no mistake, once your money is in their hands, you no longer exist to them. Their after-sales motto is “Take your car and get out; if you have any problems, go talk to Hyundai!”
	One of the main reasons we selected Hyundai in a mind-bogglingly competitive field was because we thought that with Hyundai’s 10 year, 100K mile powertrain warranty, their customer service would be as dependable as it sounds.  Clearly, we’ve made the wrong choice and were fooled with promises that could not materialize as well as a new car that was defective within a few days. Our confidence in Hyundai has been completely shattered by Sterling McCall’s team under “Sam” and we are disappointed not only in our experience but also in ourselves for making the wrong choice.

The vehicle wasn't immediately available at Sterling McCall, so Antonio arranged for the vehicle to be brought over from another Houston-area dealership.  We agreed on a price over the phone.

I paid for a new vehicle and everything on that new vehicle should be new, current or up to date. I shouldn't have to beg for a current GPS map version on a new vehicle. At the time of purchase my map should at least be current. I really shouldn't have to ask for a current map on a vehicle I bought new. I shouldn't be referred to MnSoft to purchase a current map on a vehicle I just bought new where I am essentially paying twice for a current map version. That is piss poor customer service and is a pure money grab. I will not ever buy from this dealership again and it will be a major consideration on my next vehicle purchase as to what brand I will buy. I should add that the vehicle I traded in had a newer map version then the one in the new purchase.

He agreed to repair the car only partly which was not acceptable. We didn't even drive the car out of his parking lot.

We were treated very badly with derogatory remarks when asked for cancellation form by a person who claimed to be GM.

376,"June 10, 2016","My initial visit to Hyundai was to have the service department take a look at my wife's 2007 Tuscon as the check engine light was on.  This was due to a flow valve issue which took far too long to diagnose.  The car was delivered on Wednesday and we had to chase the service manager down on Friday and Saturday and eventually go in on Monday (Memorial Day) to find out what was taking so long.  However, while we were waiting on the Service Manager, we took a look at the Genesis and decided to take a test drive.  Lisa Priest was the Sales Lady who took us out and was VERY knowledgeable about the vehicle and walked through all of the features.  The car handled like a dream and my wife fell in love with the car.  After the test drive we were told that the service department would get all of the costs together for the Tuscon and get in touch with us the following day so we went home.  I secretly returned to Hyundai the following day and re-connected with Lisa who put some figures together for me and got the cost down to where it was affordable for me through the lease option, I traded the Tuscon in and closed the deal on the Genesis.  The look on my wife's face was priceless when she saw her car sitting in the driveway!    In closing... I must say that Lisa was the best Salesperson that I have ever dealt with!  Lisa was not the stereotypical ""pushy salesperson"" that many dealerships have.  She spoke to us like we had known her for years.  The only thing that prevented my survey to be a 10 out of 10 is that the car came with a passenger front floor mat that has one hole on the left side to fit the notch but was missing the right side hole for the right side notch so the floor mat sticks up on the right side.  This is not acceptable for a brand new $50K car!  Lisa also told my wife that she would download the apple software for the car to be compatible with her phone once they had it in but when my wife called her to find out if they had received the software yet, Lisa told my wife to find the app and she could download it herself.  Not too happy about that.  regarding the floor mat... we have taken time out of our busy schedules to contact Hyundai corp. ourselves to try and resolve the issue since Sterling McCall does not want to help us.

391,"May 06, 2016","On 4-23-2016 I purchased two used cars from Sterling McCall Hyundai.  On 4-25-2016 one of them died, I called Sterling McCall Hyundai and spoke to Gabriel (the salesman that sold me the car) and was told too bad so sad.  Sterling McCall will not honor it.  I called the service department and was on hold for 32 minutes and finally someone answered the phone and said “hold on”.  I hung up and immediately called the corporate office.  I spoke to Junior and told him everything that was wrong with the cars.
•	One car died and had to be tolled to my house.  The battery was no good.
•	No 2nd key for either car
•	One car had mats when I purchased it however when it came back from being detailed the mats were missing.
•	No manual in one car
Junior told me he would contact the dealership and get everything fixed.  He told me someone from the dealership would call me back that day.
On 4-26-2016 I called corporate back and spoke to Joe.  He read my case and told me he would contact the dealership and someone will call me back.
On 5-3-2016 I called corporate back and spoke to Yvonne.  She read my case and told me it was closed.  I asked why she said she didn’t know but would reopen the case and would contact the dealership and someone will call me back.
On 5-5-2016 I called the dealership myself and spoke to Tim (Service Manager), Tim said to get someone to jump my car and bring it in and they would take care of it.  I told him I would bring it in the next morning.  
On 5-6-2016 I got a jump and brought the car in.  Libby checked the car out and could not get it to start up.  She tested the battery and YES it was dead.  Sterling McCall Hyundai Used Car Director, Sam Elhalaby said they would not honor it, he said he gave me a discount when I purchased two cars so he’s not replacing the dead battery.  Sam went on to tell me to get a lawyer and try to get my money back, then he gave me the two finger piece sign and walked back into his office and locked the door.   

I rate them a neg ten.  ",1.2

415,"March 02, 2016","I went to the dealership based on the online advertised price.  I made contact with a salesperson who was okay via phone but did not have a clue what I wanted when I drove 5 hours to get to the dealership.  I was interested in the Genesis and he offered an Eleantra.  The car that I was interested in had a $15,829 dealer discount and still had the additional $500 military discount according to the website.  That was not the case; the salesperson stated that the dealer options add-on package was more expensive than the others (normally $2100 that was not advertised online either) on that particular car.  I asked why and he answered that he was not sure the reason for it.  They also wanted to really give me a very low trade-in value for my car.  Overall, terrible experience that really makes you think that dealerships are dishonest and only care about making money.  It is a business to make money but the least they can do is tell the truth to the customer and have knowledgeable salesperson at all times.  If the customer knows more about the car than the salesperson, there is definitely a problem.  ",1.0

505,"July 07, 2015","When I first went into Sterling McCall, it was very busy. I was greeted by a very nice foreign man named Eugene. My wife and I had never bought a car before, and were not sure we were getting the best deal. We were purchasing a new 2016 Elantra.

Without verifying actual numbers, we weren't sure that the offer was obtained was legitimate. We had come expecting a car with 0% APR for 60 months at a little over 200. We ended up leaving that first day, which was a Saturday. We obtained a call asking where we went, and we let them know that we had to leave early to volunteer, which was true. 

We returned the following Monday, when it was relatively empty. However, there are not a ton of finance members, so expect to wait an hour or two to buy your car. I assure you, though. Sterling McCall is giving you the best deal.

We got the jitters, played on our smart phones, and continued obsessing over whether or not we were getting the best deal, when we saw that Ron Carter Hyundai reportedly beats any competitor by 1,100$. Guaranteed. We obtained our offer, and went to Ron Carter, who had lied. They told us that they could not beat Sterling McCall's price, and that because our offer wasn't signed or (probably never would be) detailed enough, they would not uphold their guarantee. We were prepared to trust Ron Carter, when their power went off. We called Sterling McCall, but no one had answered. We took this a sign that Sterling's deal was too good to be true. 

Because of the power outage at Ron Carter, we could not sign contracts, and went back home until the next day, when we would obtain the car. An itch I had made me call McCall one more time, to verify the deal was in fact 0 APR with the number they gave us, which Ron Carter said would never happen in a million years. Ron Carter, the #3 Hyundai dealer in North America. Sterling McCall verified. We showed up 5 minutes after closing, and the finance department, our salesman Eugene, and managers stayed another 2 hours helping us close this deal that Ron Carter boasted they would never do because of the way Hyundai Dealerships work, loss of money, etc.

In the end, Sterling McCall is not perfect. It needs a few more finance members, a little more clarity, and to show more print offs of official numbers a little sooner. But all in all, the staff was friendly, helpful, and honestly wanted us to be happy with our purchase with the most benefit to both parties. When you go to buy a car, it isn't about free lunch on Saturdays, price guarantees that don't uphold, or how long you waited. It's about getting the best price for the car you desire with the least amount of headache. And Sterling McCall delivered. They deserve the #3 spot to me!

Also, Mauricio in the finance department is a badass. He is very friendly, tells you how it is, and tries to help you out in the best way he can without giving you any fluff.",4.8

510,"June 04, 2014","On  the morning of  5.27.2014 I called in about a part that I needed.  The ignition lock cylinder  in my 2007 Hyundai Azera  was bad and had to be replace.  I talked to one of the part guys and told him what I needed.  He asked me for the VIN  # and I gave it to him along with my car details. He told me that part will be $150. I said okay let me go ahead and place an order.  He then told me they don't have it in stock that it need  to be special order and will come in about 4 business days. I said that's  fine I would like to place the order.  Then he told me  that I had to come in to place the order because they don't do orders over the phone. I understand  and  told him okay I will be there.

I took off on my lunch break to come by  Sterling McCall Hyundai on 59.  I had to wait in the part department for over 30 mins for him to come out  to ask what is it that I need.  His name was Dwayne.  I gave him the VIN number to my car so he can look up that part. He then came  back about 10 mins later and told me that the  part will be $350. I was like WHAT?!?!? A $200 different from what he told me over the phone about 2 hours ago.  He then  went on and says ...""the reason why this is so expensive that this  car was the first year that the keys are diamond cut and ALL the dealership prices are the same"".  I knew this guy was FULL of it! I went there and waited for 40 mins for nothing. Please don't lie to the customers we are not stupid. 

So I left and called around to the other Hyundai dealerships. All of them give me a lot lower price for the exact same part.  I wonder  what else they do to their customers that don't know much about cars or don't check up on things like I do. I hope the CEO of this dealership see this and see  whats going on behind close doors. 

My girlfriend, coworkers  and I all own Hyundai.  I told all of them about my experiences with Sterling McCall Hyundai on 59.

Keisha, the service advisor always gave me sound advice and never felt like they were out there to get more money from me. They clearly told me what services i actually needed. They provide shuttle service if you need to drop off your car and if it was an inconvenience like if you had to bring your car in a few times - they would put you in a rental.

513,"March 13, 2013","This was my fifth car purchased from a dealership and I can honestly say this tops them all. As a new parent on a budget and my car approaching its last miles I couldn’t imagine I’d be a proud owner of a 2013 Hyundai Sonata. Thanks to the team at Sterling McCall Hyundai I almost enjoy my 45 minute commute each morning. Below is the reason I rated them at the top of their class:

Customer Service- Out of 10 inquiries to local dealers they were the first to contact me and offer their assistance in any way possible. Bill respected my time and was very patient with my specific needs (budget and time constraints). Without an appointment he welcomed me and although he had another client he set me up with a test drive right off so I would have to wait around.	

Quality of Work- For me efficiency is a big deal. Time is important and they did a great job managing mine. The whole process took all of two lunch breaks. Bill’s “four piece puzzle” approach laid everything out for me to be able to make a final decision.

Friendliness- All of the staff involved made me feel comfortable and made the process enjoyable. There was a lot of joking around with each other in the building that made for a great environment. You could tell the people that worked there enjoyed what they do which was reflected in their work.

Price- Leaving the dealership I felt great but a couple days later I received a phone call about a down-payment I was unaware of. I should have looked over the paperwork closer and this would have never happened but I simply missed it. I truly feel negligence isn’t an excuse for anything but it definitely threw me off guard since I didn’t have the money. Prepared to return the car they once more worked something out to fix my dilemma. 

Overall Experience- Overall I felt like a valued customer that was taken excellent care of. I will be purchasing from Sterling McCall Hyundai in the future. When you know what you want but don’t know how to make it happen this is the place to go.

Personal thanks to Anthony Val Verde, Bill (William) Lasar, and John Juarez.

In June of this year, same problem, I've taken my Tuscon 3 times and still the problem is not corrected.  The first time I specifically told Rose Corbitt that my check engine light pops on and it would not pass state inspection.  So there wonderful mechanic said it was the exhaust pipe had a small leak and it was replaced with a $426.00 bill, i said ok paid it and not 2 days later, check engine pops back on. so i took it back again to the dealership and told Rose it happened again.  so she said will put her mechanic back on the car and see where the problem was, So the genious mechanic wanted to replace the O2 sensor in which i had purchased thru another dealer to save alittle money, since 2 days earlier. i had to ditch out $426.00.  i got the part # and paid for that,had it hand delivered to Rose to give to the wonderful mechanic to put the part to my car, he first said it was the wrong part it didnt fit and we reordered the part again and again took it back to them. and now they said that this O2 sensor was not a dealership part that they needed to put on one of their O2 sensor, so inwhich i lost $ there, and that they needed to replace another hose .in which they did and drove it and put miles on it and got the inspection sticker.  this bill came out to $120.00. i said ok, drove it back home and again 2 days later. check engine light popped back on.  I called Rose and told her the situation again said would put the foreman mechanic on this problem.  i said ok. left a message for Darby THeilen and told him i was upset not satisfied and that this problem still continue and i had just spent $600.00. he said he was going to work on this closely with the foreman from the shop and dont worry about the $ we will discuss that later. lets get the problem fixed and i said ok. well car was sitting in their shop i get a call from ROse and told me it could be up to 3 times , the catalyst, or manifest something, or another sensor. and that Mr. Darby had an emergency out of town will not be back until the following Monday.

522,"April 21, 2011","After my Santa Fe died while on I-59, I had it towed to Sterling McCall Hyundai which was only two exits away. While it was there, I decided to get the a/c fixed too since it hadn't worked for 6 months. The price to get the vehicle running again was under $400. However, after adding the a/c repair costs, it pushed the final costs to $1,315. I was told that the a/c compressor was bad so they had to replace it. On the 2nd day, William called me and told me that it was fixed and was blowing ""ice cold"". I picked it up on a Friday 15 minutes before they closed and paid $1,315 for the repairs. While driving home it never even started trying to blow cold. Blew warm the entire 25 minute trip. I called during the trip and reached a guy in the Parts Dept but those in the Service Dept had already left for the day. 

I took it back in on Monday and they said that the new compressor was bad (covered by warranty) and that a hose was clogged but could be fixed for $300 more. We agreed to $150 more. Out of curiosity, I asked William how it blew ""ice cold"" for him when he tested it on Friday if the hose had been clogged all along and he stuttered, stammered, and basically tried to BS his way through the follow-up questions until finally giving an ""I'm not sure why it did"" answer.


I picked it up on Wednesday, paid the $150 more, and by Thursday the a/c was blowing hot yet again! Called them once more and they said that it may be the evaporator coil and if so will cost another $630 to repair it.


They are either incompetent or intentionally bilking their customers by doing unnecessary work in order to run up the repair bill. Either way, it is not good for the customers. There has to be better options available in the Houston area for Hyundai owners that need service work done to their vehicles.  To say that I would NOT recommend this dealership for repair work would be an understatement.  Avoid them like the plague would be more accurate advice.
