0,"June 13, 2020","My wife and I came to look at a used Acura RDX. We are fairly experienced car buyers and had already done a lot of our own research. We worked with Santos Chapa, and we were very pleased with his sales style; very low pressure, was able to fill in any gaps in our knowledge and eager to help without being pushy. We were very pleased with the service we received there and would be happy to recommend to others. ",5.0
1,"February 07, 2019","*Updated from 1 star to 3 stars on 2-19-19.  The service manager was able to resolve this to my satisfaction.  Had the same solution been offered at the time I was there, and not after having left a bad review and calling VW of America, this would be a 5 star review.

This used to be THE place in the Austin metro to buy a VW. Between my wife and I, we’ve purchased three there. Not anymore. Go to Maund or Onion Creek. My experience was pretty bad, when trying to get help with service. They sold me a car with a bad alignment. It was a brand new 2019 Jetta. In 8400 miles, it had completely worn out the front tires. Brand new car, and the alignment was WAY off. They could have made the decision to help me out and take care of me, but no. I asked that they cover the alignment and meet me halfway on new tires. They gave me zero assistance. It cost me $99.95 for the alignment and then they wanted to charge me over $300 for two tires... Brett, my service advisor, said they’d submit a request to VW asking that they cover the cost of the alignment as a goodwill gesture, and that they’d call me with the verdict in 24-48 hours. Guess what? It’s been a week now and no call. I seriously wonder if they even bothered to submit it. Seriously, just stay away. I won’t ever be back here and will be submitting a complaint to VW of America about their terrible service.",3.2
2,"July 05, 2018","We came in relatively uninformed (especially compared to other manufacturers that we considered) and somewhat unprepared. Ivan was very helpful and patient while we worked through our understanding of the vehicle, a 2018 Atlas. I'm very appreciative about the features of the waiting area. Part of being unprepared is that we had two young children in tow. The play area is a nice touch and gave me comfort about any future visits for service. The whole staff worked quickly and was flexible to my family's needs. Great experience.",5.0

4,"October 15, 2017","After relocating to Austin, my 2016 VW Jetta needed the 30,000 mile service and Hewlett VW was the closest dealership to me. From booking the service appointment to checking out after the service was done, my initial experience was 100% positive. Friendly Service Advisor that kept me updated, clean and well stocked waiting room, and my car was returned to me spotless clean like it had never been touched. All of this in less than a hour. I can definitely recommend Hewlett VW for your service needs.",5.0
5,"January 31, 2017","I was prepared to buy a VW Golf,  a car I have wanted for a very long time. I had to pretty much push the salesman to take me on a test drive, and when we returned, he made me pull up to the front door. He immediately jumped out and told me he would get me a brochure. I went inside and he gave me a brochure and a card. He told me some perks of the VW, but was hurrying me along, so I left. He had a friendly tone of  voice, but it was completely obvious he was not wanting to spend any time than he had to and had no interest in helping me. I went back outside almost in tears, and I started doing my own walk around on the car, because I really wanted the car. I was so sad to leave the car there, but I felt very unwelcome. I wasn't sure what to do. I wanted to go back in and tell a different salesman I wanted the car, but at that point I felt so unwelcome and it would just be so awkward.  I thought about going South and buying there, but I knew I was going to have to get service in Georgetown since that was so much closer. I couldn't step another foot in that dealership. I decided to go with a different hatchback, which I am enjoying, but I thought I was finally going to get my Golf. I am so disappointed.",1.8
6,"August 03, 2016","After contacting the dealership about looking to test-drive some different models, I had a great experience working with Jay Wilson. He was very informative on the various models and packages available and never badgered us or made us feel pressured (unlike other area dealers). We ended up test driving a number of different models and Jay was timely thereafter in helping us choose which financing plan was going to be a good fit for us. Once we finally decided on a model and package, Larry Chabert was very helpful in taking us through the necessary paperwork and provided a wealth of knowledge",5.0
7,"May 07, 2016","Bought my first VW from Hewlett VW today and can't recommend them enough!  I first contacted Debbie Benson and she helped me determine the dealer's pricing on a new car.  I later worked with Pat McGarry as my salesman.  My wife and I couldn't be happier with the service we received both via electronic communication and during our visit today.  Very professional staff who streamlined the buying process and met all of our expectations.  Make this your first dealer stop and I guarantee you will not be disappointed.  I reached out to dealers from San Antonio, Austin, and Houston.  This group was the absolute best of them all!  Best car-buying experience my wife and I have ever received, hands down.  We drove all the way from San Antonio to buy a car from them and would do it again without hesitation.  A big thank you to everyone who helped us today!",4.8
8,"March 01, 2016",Jay Wilson was very friendly and did not pressure us to buy. He gave us an informative test drive. Told us a lot about the Jetta Sport and gave us an experience of the performance as well. We were sold on this model. The car was not on the lot but in transient. We came back finished some paper work with Larry Chabert. Larry was patient and kind answering all our questions about pricing and extended warranties.  And thank you Debbie Benson for a warm welcome and having a car ready for us to test drive with our name on it - reserved for us! How nice is that!! Made us feel like VIP. The car came straight off the transport truck...talk about brand new.,5.0
9,"December 24, 2015","I brought my Golf Mk7 TDI in to Hewlett VW for three reasons:

1. to validate the VW Goodwill cards.

2. to diagnose and rectify a noise which turned out to be caused by a faulty recirculation flap motor.

3. to determine whether the radio module is compatible with a VW backup camera and to get a quote for the cost of installing it.

All three issues were taken care of cordially and expeditiously.",5.0
10,"December 05, 2015",I bought a Volkswagen Tiguan and the service I received at Hewlett was outstanding.  Everyone was so nice and courteous.  I would recommend them to my family and friends.,5.0
11,"November 24, 2015","I have had a fantastic experience up to this point with VW.  VERY frustrated at this point because they are using the diesel controversy to raise their prices.  I was quoted with a price increase of more than $200/ month when my lease ended ON THE SAME CAR.  To make matters worse, I was told I had negative equity on my current VW lease due to a few scratches and door dings.  I was told the price would go down significantly if I got it fixed.  I spent over $1000 getting those dings fixed (by Hewlett) only to return the car and be told I still have the same amount of negative equity.  Even with repairs, being under 15k on my mileage, I was told that there was nothing more they could do for me because of ""one man's terrible mistake"".  My car isn't even a diesel and I don't know how this effects my particular car.  SERIOUSLY!  I have leased 3 VW in a row and have never felt more scammed.  Extremely disappointed and will be taking my business.  ",1.4
12,"September 16, 2015","The staff at Hewlett Volkswagen is truly amazing.  I am new to Volkwagen having driven Fords for 35 years and had trouble figuring out which car was best for my needs.  The staff bent over backwards and did not rest until they were sure I was happy.  I have never seen a dealership go above and beyond like Hewlett did.

Thanks!",5.0
13,"September 12, 2015","We worked with both Jay Wilson and Bob Grimes for the sale of a 2016 Tiguan S. Both sales consultants were very informative and professional in representing Hewlett Volkswagen and providing us with the information we needed to make an informed decision in purchasing a 2016 Tiguan S. The specific vehicle that we wanted was not on the lot, but within 24 hours they had located one 125 miles away and had it transported to their lot.  Jonathan Blank processed the loan application through VW Financing and he did outstanding job in securing a loan product that was very competitive with what we had been quoted from our local bank. They're nice guys at Hewlett Volkswagen and It was worth the ride up to Georgetown, Texas to have a very productive and pleasant car buying experience.  

Thanks,

14,"August 31, 2015","This is our second car with Hewlett VW-- my wife had a terrible accident in the first car, a Hyundai, just last week but was unhurt. The sales process both times has been hassle and haggle free. I've walked out feeling like I got a good deal both times, and the process was painless. Hewlett and it's staff were extremely accommodating and willing to work with me even after hours to make sure my wife would be able to get to work even after the accident. I've been so pleased with both the used and the new car buying process at Hewlett VW that I've preordered our third car from the dealership, a Golf R. You have a customer for life. ",4.8
15,"August 27, 2015","Bekka brought the right car to my attention, love at first sight....
She's very professional and took the time to explain all my questions.
Gabriel explained in every detail which coverage would be the best one for me.
Very pleased that when I left the Agency.

16,"August 27, 2015","I went into Hewlett VW in Georgetown because I knew I needed a new car as mine was failing me.  I had he pleasure of getting Bekka Kotzur as my automediator.  You know, the person that matches you with the right car.  She was busy, so Bekka allowed me to take my mom for a ride.  We both immediately knew Volkswagen was the way to go.  Next, Bekka brought mom a different car, one that she pulled just for her and I had her drive that one.  She was in total awe of how it handled.  We've been Toyota people for decades and now we made the switch to German ingenuity and decided to get rid of both cars.  So Bekka worked her magic and when we left Hewlett that afternoon, we didn't leave with one, but two VW's.

17,"August 27, 2015",I bought a 2016 GTI from Jay Wilson.  Great car buying experience.  Jay  emailed me to let me know the car was available and had it available to drive promptly when I arrived.  Jay was extremely knowledgeable about the great in car technology new for this year in the GTI.  They were very fair with evaluating my trade in and gave me a very reasonable price on my GTI.  Car was extremely clean upon delivery.  A first for any new car I have ever purchased.,5.0
18,"August 13, 2015",Bekka Kotzur spent time showing what was on the lot and the difference between the 2015 TDI Passat models. She gave me a test drive and when I expressed interest gave me one to take home for the night to show wife. Brought it back next day and bought one. She has been available for me then and now (1month later). I brought it back to add the tinting. I felt no pressure and price was in line with USAA figures. She is perfect sales person for everyone.,5.0
19,"August 12, 2015","On Monday of this week I expressed interest in a vehicle via Hewlett VW's website.  I was contacted shortly there after by Debbie following up on my inquiry.  

She was very helpful with making sure the vehicle was still available by going as far as to take photos of it from their lot in this Texas heat(Did she have a flame retardant suite on?) and sending me as much info as she could about it. 

I was unable to make it over to the dealership until Wednesday evening, but in the days between I received phone calls and text messages from Debbie checking that I was fine and that I was still interested.  

When I arrived on Wednesday around 7pm I was met almost before I could exit my vehicle by Jay Wilson(I think he may be telepathic, watch out), who Debbie had said was going to be my salesperson.  We exchanged handshakes and warm greetings as he lead me to my potentially new vehicle.  We did the normal walk around, overview and test drive.  

I did not have many questions upon returning to the dealership so we started the numbers process with Jonathan Blank(sales manager). Jonathan and Jay both helped me through this painless process with great ease. After discussing ""the numbers"" and coming to an agreeable term it was time for Jonathan to put his powers to work and get me financed.  

I then met Larry Chabert the finance manager who took me(the last customer of the evening also 9pm)to his office and finalized all that Jay and Jonathan had set up.  After about 10 or so minutes I became the owner of my vehicle.

I could not be happier with Hewlett VW.  This is the Second VW I have purchased from this location and I will buy from them again. 
Thank you to all who have helped me this week in finding my next VW family member.

21,"May 25, 2015",Purchased a 2013 certified pre-owned Tiguan with 100k extended warranty & protection package. Our salesman Jay Wilson was very attentive to our needs as to the type of vehicle to meet our needs & our finances. To have someone treat you with that kind of courtesy and respect made our Hewlett experience extremely gratifying. Jay saved us a ton of money over buying a new vehicle (which we came in thinking we were going to buy). We never felt hurried or pressured; Jay didn't come across a someone trying to make a quick sale but rather as a knowledgeable guide serving us. We are so pleased with our Tiguan and how Jay helped us to meet our specific needs. Likewise Gabriel when it came to the extended warranty & service packages was very friendly and thorough in his explanations. He made each easy to understand. I think the extended warranty & paint/interior protection package Hewlett offers  are great added values. We absolutely will be repeat customers and will be recommending our friends to visit Jay Wilson at Hewlett VW!  ,5.0
22,"May 19, 2015","We own a 2011 Jetta Sportwagen bought from this dealership.  In 2015, it started behaving oddly - lights were flickering and would come on/off with the car off.   We returned it to the dealership.  They found that a windshield installed in 2012 by an aftermarket company had leaked  - they were able to document root cause of the leak, worked with us to get it inspected by the company that did the work, and provided us a written document on what was damaged by the leak.  Lots of back and forth was required and Robin Branham was excellent at communicating status and helping us sort out the situation.

The windshield was re-sealed.  VW insisted on verifing that we'd have no further leaks before doing any electrical repairs and tested the car for further leaks.  After, they repaired it and it's back running as good as new.

Did I mention that they provided a loaner?",4.8
23,"May 16, 2015",Best service I've ever received anywhere! Everyone was helpful and making sure I was being helped. They went beyond normal to help me with car and with getting stuff in and out of cars. My grandson loves your toy room-which really helps too. I have already told everyone I have seen that if I ever need another car-it will be from this dealership. Thank you guys for hiring people that appear to be sincere in helping customers beyond what is expected.,5.0
24,"May 01, 2015","We were ""walk-ins"" into the Dealership and were greeted by Barry. I just wanted to show the Touareg to my wife because we talked about it on our way down from Dallas. Barry showed us the car and told us he had a great CPO model. After a test-drive we were hooked on the car. Absolutely no pressure or other sales tactics were used which is something unheard off at least for us. We have gained a new friend that day.
For the next few days we were visiting all Dealerships in the area which had Touaregs for comparison shopping purposes. Besides the fact that none had an acceptable unit we were appalled on how some other dealers conduct business, especially the one in South Austin.
I called Barry and we settled on the final terms of the deal. 
We picked up our Treg two days ago and the whole process was a breeze and very pleasurable even the paperwork with Gabriel.
I can only praise this dealership and it will be our first and only destination next time we need a car. 
Thanks so much for restoring the image of car dealerships ! We are impressed.",5.0
25,"April 09, 2015","My daughter is commuting to Texas State University and I wasn't comfortable with her having to drive the 90 mile round trip in one of our old cars.  Since 1986 I've only purchased GM products but my daughter was tired of the GM cars we normally own.  Instead, she wanted a VW Jetta.  The cost of a college education was already giving me severe sticker shock, so I planned to buy a Certified Pre-Owned VW and at least keep some of my costs in the realm of the reasonable.  Jay Flores at Hewlett VW could have just sold us the used car we asked for, but instead he took a chance and presented us with a new vehicle option.  I was apprehensive at first, but Jay showed us how easy it is to choose and finance a brand new VW for a lot less money than I was expecting.  That completely changed our plans for the better and we are much happier with our VW decision.  Buying a new car used to be so stressful that I couldn't sleep for dreading it.  Like a bad relative I avoided it as long as I could.  Well, Hewlett VW in Georgetown has changed all that.  We were approved, closed, and ready to drive away in 30 minutes!  That was easy!  Jay Flores spent an hour with my daughter to demonstrate the car and provided her with a thorough explanation of all the controls and safety features.  He even set up the Bluetooth options so the car would work with her phone before leaving the lot.  I didn't have to do anything but sign, which is mostly my Dad job now that my beautiful sweetie-pie has grown up.  But I can rest easier knowing she is driving to school in a safe and reliable new VW car.",5.0
26,"March 20, 2015",Purchased a new 2015 Jetta TDI from Pat.  The most pleasant car buying experience I have ever had.  Gabriel in finance was equally as pleasant.  I will absolutely do business again and refer anyone and everyone!,5.0
27,"December 16, 2014","This is my second purchase from Hewlett Volkswagen and specifically Tom Worsham. I gave Tom a call and let him know I was in the market for another VW. He said to come on over when it was convenient for me, but to call first to ensure that he could give me his undivided attention. Well that has never been an issue because Tom is all about the customer. Tom is one of the most straight forward guys I have ever done business with. His no nonsense approach is epic. Just love him! Now let me tell you just a bit more so you get the big picture. I came in, within 10 minutes of talking about the inventory he had me in the car I would deal on. You see he knows the customer and listens to your needs, just priceless customer service. I also had a really good run with Bret Hill the Finance Manager as well. These guys are a hoot, but let me assure you that you will get the very best deal and have lots of fun at the same time. I would highly recommend Hewlett Volkswagen and specifically Tom Worsham to anyone looking for the ""best"" car buying experience ever. ",5.0
28,"October 25, 2014","I bought a 2011 VW Jetta from Hewlett Volkswagen and boy am I glad I did. This was hands down the BEST car buying experience imaginable. I not only got the price I wanted for my trade I also got the price I wanted for the car. Doris and Gabriel were literally jumping through hoops for my wife and I. We have never had that ever. Now, here's the best part, not only did they beat the pre-approval I walked in there with, Gabriel called me two days AFTER the sale was finalized to get me a better rate, because he felt the original rate wasn't good enough for us. That's right, he called AFTER the sale was complete and demanded a better rate for us on our behalf. Are you serious? That is ridiculous awesome for us! We cannot wait to be in a position to go back and buy another car. No one has ever treated us this good! Oh, and they have in house Allstate insurance there and slashed in half our current insurance WITH better coverage. Thank you Cindy! Hands down BEST car-buying experience EVER!",5.0
29,"October 18, 2014","We started looking at a red Sportswagen about a month ago after my Subaru was totaled in an accident a week later we bought a Passat. I wanted a diesel so it was either VW or MB. VW won the toss to go first. I think we drove 5 or 6 different TDI's including the Golf, Jetta and the Passat.  The TDI mileage was  a deciding factor in our buying decision. While we looking a new Passat, I asked about a CPO Passat on the floor. The Passat had what I wanted on it plus a CPO it had an additional 2 yr 24 mo warranty at a substantial savings. We negotiated a fair price that was $500 under BB on the car. The service manager showed me the service history on the car. No surprises there. Got a good deal on the financing and warranty. The Passat was spotless inside and out. There were a couple of things that Doris could have explained better like the CPO Warranty roadside service and some other benefits and made it an easier sell. Hewlett dealership is clean, well lit and staffed by professional courteous employees. The dealership took my feedback very seriously. No complaints about the car, the sales or service folks, the deal, the dealership, service department, Car was washed twice in 3 days! We have been delighted with our first service and the folks at Hewlett. I would recommend these folks without hesitation.

30,"October 15, 2014","I love that I can make an appointment to get my car serviced.  I also appreciate that they keep me informed of the scheduled maintenance for my vehicle.  While I was there, they noticed I was almost due for an oil change.  Within 15 minutes, they had my oil changed and I was on my way. Also I must mention that I love how they take me home and pick me up, so I am not sitting around waiting for my car repair.  Great service and friendly people!!!",5.0
31,"September 24, 2014","On a day that I went in only for a service appointment, the showroom of Hewlett VW caught my eye so I tippy toed over to the new car sales and ask the receptionist that I had questions on a vehicle but did not want a sales person to be ""dinged"" by a no sale as I only had questions on the difference between the CC and Passat AND the Audi used vehicle that was outside.  The team assured me that all would be ok and I was introduced to Pat McG.  Pat was patience and very informative and showed a personal approach to the overall picture of my family, life situation and put the puzzle together of what would really work for the sake of myself and my sons.  Very patient and responded to all my calls immediately to include my emails.  It takes a team to make a sale and by gosh - Pat and the team won me.  I now am the owner of a new Passat which works for my life needs.  I loved my CC and I love Hewlett therefore I turned to Hewlett again and I truly feel comfortable in my experience and new car.

32,"September 02, 2014","Rick Roberts has been very patient and helpful with me over these last few months. After having corresponded with him back and forth over several different trims and colors I decided to stop by yesterday, just to see what they had.  As I was on my way to my parent's house I decided to stop in and take a look at some inventory on the lot.  As I was peering through the windows of the new Golf, Rick popped up behind me and asked if he could help me with anything. That's when I let him know that we had been talking for a while now...and he asked me if wanted to take it for a test drive. There was no hesitation for me, I said sure.  Needless to say, I loved the way the car drove, felt inside and just the pleasant experience all together.  Rick and Brett were both really helpful in getting me into the car I wanted.  I had originally thought about getting the SE but they SEL was soo nice that I couldn't pass it up.  Even though they were super busy yesterday, everyone was still very helpful and eager to work with me. I didn't feel rushed or pressured, overall it was  a good buying experience.  I chose this dealership because I had my '06 Jetta serviced there for several years and I had never had any problems or issues with how they treated me and I wanted to continue that experience with a brand new Golf.

Although car fax did not show this vehicle having been in an accident i later found out it had. it has taken several months and additional expense to bring the Rabbit back up to standard thanks to Hewlett VW and Jason in the service department.

34,"June 09, 2014","Set up an appointment for 7:30 AM. Was told by the service advisor that the automatic transmission maintenance would take 3to4 hours. When I got to Hewlett VW on Monday morning at 7:15AM, I was told again that the service would be 3to4 hours. I was given a ride home and during the approximately 30 minute ride (others to drop off also), I asked to be picked up at roughly 11AM and return to the dealership. I was told they could not do that, but to call the service advisor Robin Branham for the car shuttle back to the dealer.  I called at 11:07am and was told by Mr. Branham that he would send the shuttle.  An hour later I called again(twice) and asked Mr. Branham about the shuttle.  He indicated that the shuttle was having weather or traffic problems but would find out where it was and would call me back.  He did not call back, but the driver did about 20 minutes later saying he was just leaving the dealership.  I was picked up 1 hour and 35 minutes after my initial call.  When I got to the Hewlett facilities Mr. Branham did not want to talk to me, he shuffled me off to another individual that just wanted me to pay, but I waited and asked directly what the problem could have been. Mr. Branham said he had no idea at all.  Previously when I dropped off the vehicle I indicated that I would like to speak to the service tech on what he observed during the maintenance.  All Hewlett wanted was for me to pay and move on, first response was the tech was test driving, then 10 minutes later he was at lunch, but Branham called during his lunch and got my questions answered.  Would you go back to this dealer profit center??

36,"December 02, 2013","I bought a Demo 2013 Volkswagen Passat with 5,400 miles. It was sold as a new car. My car has a 35,000mile/3 year warranty. I was told that my warranty would start at 12 miles, not the 5,400 miles that were already on the car. (This was after already agreeing on a negotiated price and just going through the paperwork). I explained that I had bought an '08 Jetta Demo with 3,000 miles and that my warranty picked up at the 3,000 mile mark. Hewlett told me that ""special rule"" ended in '09. (I bought my car in '09). Hewlett said it was out of their control, so I explained I would be contacting Volkswagen America to resolve the warranty issue. I contacted Volkswagen America and they said it was up to each individual franchise dealership whether or not to start the warranty at zero mils or at the miles driven off the lot by the new owner. I also found out through Volkswagen America that my warranty began October of 2012, not September, 2013, when I bought the car. I was not explained this when signing papers. That date is on my papers and I know it is my fault, but I was trusting the salesman when he told me this says ""........"", sign here. Bottom line, Hewlett could have and should have started my warranty at 5,400 miles and at Sep., 2013. I could go out right now and buy a certified used Volkswagen with low miles and be given an additional 20,000 mile warranty. It does not make sense they would not make this adjustment on the warranty. They lied about the ""special rule,"" as they could have started my warranty at 5,400 miles and they were not up front about my warranty starting in 2012, instead of 2013.",1.2

I always bring my girl Dixie in to you guys for service.  Dixie of course is my 2009 White VW Jetta..she's named after Dixie McCall, that amazing nurse from EMERGENCY! (that show from the 70's about firefighter paramedics)...and Lauren always does a great job of getting us in and out.

Oil changes are actually cheaper with you than if I did them myself...and with you doing them...they're done right...and with no risk of me driving over the oil drip pan (yeah, that happened once).

42,"August 06, 2013","Upon arriving at the Hewlett dealership,we were met by salesperson Mike DeLeon, who spent the next 2 hours with us. we asked Mike numerous questions about different models and the comparisons between them. Mike was well versed with the models, not having to ""look up"" the the answers, not one time.Mike let us talk and didn't over pressure us with needless small talk. Mike was very pofessional while being quite personable.He stayed patient with us while showing us his inventory and letting us determine what was a good choice for us. Mike is difinitely an asset to the Hewlett family and the Volkswagen brand. The only disappointment was with the 3/36000 mile warranty.it doesn't speak well for German engineering and technology.

The sales lady was less than satisfactory and after exchanging a few emails I gave up on her. Last Thursday we gave my wife's car to my daughter. I immediately began looking online for a Passat. I found cars at four different dealerships but the reviews from buyers convinced me Hewlett was the preferred choice. I took my wife to Hewlett the next day and met John Hairgrove. John was very patient and knowledgeable. My wife picked out a silver TDI SE with sunroof and nav. We drove it, made a no haggle deal and drove off with a new car in time for her birthday the next day. I highly recommend Hewlett and John Hairgrove if you are in the market for a new VW!

After stating multiple times that I would get a great deal  since it was the last day of the month, I got $500 over ""TruPricing"" because I used their financing.  I accepted this - knowing full well that this wasn't a great end of the month deal.

I went to get the car turned it on and it had 1700 miles on it, then i was told it was a demo.  That was the first time I was told it was a demo.

Deceptive, no great deals even at the end of the month.

After writing a review they contacted me to let me know I didn't understand their pricing, with no regrets for having deceived me.   Not acknowledging  that they were essentially trying to sell me a used car as a new car - with no deal.

It's just dishonest, if you still go - watch your back, realize you will not get a good deal, and make sure to check the odometer.

49,"January 04, 2013","My wife and I purchased a new Beetle in January 2012 with the full extended warranty.  One year later the cheap pot metal ring at the top of electronic key broke off as the service person told me happens often(Planned obsolescence through poor engineering?) rendering the key unable to be kept on a key ring with my other keys.  I called the service writer 1-4-13 who immediately stated it was not covered.  I asked him to check and verify that my warranty or his Hewlett Volkswagan dealer would not make good on such a poorly engineered and manufactured part.  I also learned a new key would be over $300 to replace.  That’s right,,,,,,,a key that I now can not attach to my key ring.   It’s a pain.  The service representative returned my phone call promptly and stated the warranty provider and the dealer could not and would not do anything for me other than take my order for a new key, yes, over $300.  This dealer is a 140 mile round trip for me to purchase the new vehicle and to get it serviced.  I bought the extended warranty.  Now when “cheap” rises to the surface and presents itself in the form of a very inconvenient and unsecure means of carrying a key or keys around, I am basically told German engineering failed not only me but other consumers for this issue and to deal with it…….Come on Hewlett/VW, own your failures, make it right and above all else after a consumer invest in your new vehicles, make your customer happy when such a minor issue presents itself.

50,"October 23, 2012","By far the best purchase experience at a dealership. Sales Specialist Tom Worsham was attentive, polite and very helpful and accommodating. Shopping for a car with a newborn and a toddler isn't easy, so the dealership went out of their way to make sure we got the car we wanted along with the best deal available in the shortest possible time. I would highly recommend him for the purchase of your next car.  Thanks Tom.

Finance Manager Ilia Pauloo was very kind and courteous in that he rushed us through the finance process and did not make it seem like the usual drawn out scenario. Our two kids were whiney and hungry and he made sure we got the extras we actually wanted. What usually gets a customers blood boiling ended up being a breeze as we already knew what we wanted and were getting into. Thanks Ilia.

My wife who usually detests the car buying process was pleasantly surprised at the promptness and is still actually in shock at how smoothly it went. I have yet to experience  the service department.

63,"May 28, 2011","I will preface this review by saying two things: 1. I have been through the vehicle purchasing process 4 times now in the last 12 years. 2. A month prior to my purchase at Hewlett VW, I had a traumatizing experience with a Toyota Dealership in Arlington. (ok, ok...""traumatizing"" may be an excessive term, but if you only knew my story, I promise you would agree.)
 
With those two things being said, I have to admit I was apprehensive to walk through another set of dealership doors. After reading customer reviews of Hewlett VW, I decided I would take a chance. I am glad I did. My salesperson, Ken Shipp, was by far the best car salesperson I have ever encountered. He was respectful, patient, and kind. He took the time to answer every single question I had, and to say I had ""a lot of questions"" would be an understatement. He was also more than willing to show me every car/option I asked to see. He even took the time to demonstrate all of the options, ie: navigation, bluetooth, intellikey, etc. My favorite part about dealing with Ken, and all of the others I encountered at Hewlett, was that I never once felt an ounce of pressure. If they offered me something and I said I did not want it--that was it. No pressure, and they never made me feel guilty about saying, ""No"". Better yet...no guilty feeling for saying, ""YES"" to my 2011 Jetta--for once, I purchased a vehicle with no pressure.  
 
I must also give kudos to Scott Morgan, Sales Manager; and Mark Eggleston, Finance Manager. Both made me feel like I was a valued customer--not like they were doing me some sort of favor (like all other dealership sales managers/finance managers I have encountered). Guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. 
 
If you are looking for a pleasant buying experience, Hewlett VW is the way to go. Ask for Ken--he won't disappoint. You may even be asking him for a hug instead of a handshake at the end of your transaction, like I did. :) 
 
Many thanks again to all who took part in making my experience top notch. You guys rock!

71,"February 28, 2011","We needed an alignment on our VW, so after a less than stellar experience with our nearby VW dealer, we decided it was worth it to travel to Hewlett in Georgetown. Made an appt online since it was off hours, and I got a response with an appt in the timeframe I requested with a quote and an offer to schedule their shuttle to take me home after drop-off.

Dropped the car off at the appointed time (10:30am) and got a shuttle back to Austin immediately upon asking for it (nice driver). Very convenient! Also, if you had a short job, the waiting area had wireless, two internet stations, and a nice coffee/tea bar (and bottled water). Confortable seating, reading materials, too.

Unfortunately, my car wasn't ready to go until closing that day. That's my one complaint. I'd been told an alignment should be a 2- to 4-hour job and I expected to have the car in my possession the same day. We had to be somewhere at 7pm (so picking the car up from Georgetown at 6pm wasn't going to work). Instead, I arranged for their shuttle to pick me up in Austin the next morning. A different shuttle driver (Sean, also very nice), took me up to Hewlett. I paid the bill and a guy in the cashier area explained the alignment before-and-after information on the receipt to me. I was on my way out of there very quickly and efficiently. The car was also washed and vacuumed. 

Samantha Gomez was the service rep I dealt with. She was prompt, thorough, and friendly. The shuttle drivers were professional and friendly, too. In fact, everyone I crossed paths with were friendly and offered to help.

The car drives straight now, so I'd have to say they did a good job with the alignment!

Really, the salespeople don't need to sell the vehicle, test driving one told me that I had to have a VW.  They drive different than other cars.  They drive... classy.

From the Turbo Engine, to the way it hugs the road, I wouldn't trade my Tiguan for any other vehicle of comperable size or price.  I love it.  And working with the salespeople at Hewlett VW was not nearly as stressful as it was at the last dealership.  They weren't crying, or begging, they simply countered our offers, we countered back, we went back and forth all very professional and businesslike, until all parties were satisfied with the end result.

About an hour later she followed up with me by email because she noticed that the price of the 60K mile maintenance was a bit expensive (higher than my normal visit) and actually took the time to scan the scheduled maintenance page showing the work to be done and the projected cost just to make sure I wasn't going to have a problem.

We were especially glad to know that we were doing business with someone who genuinely cared about our happiness and exceeded our expectations in many ways. One of the things that we appreciated the most is that Russell and Hewlett VW were pleased to back up their product and service. We couldn't be happier with our first car buying experience and will definitely be returning customers in the future. ,4.8

I met Rick Roberts the next day at the VW dealership test drove the car I wanted and then he found me exactly the TDI Jetta I wanted and then I proceeded to trade in my 2010 Dodge Grand Caravan and the paper work and talk was done in a short time and I was owning the 2010 Black TDI Jetta in no time. It all happend so quickly and well mannered and very over all professionally.
It was the easiest car sales and un stressfull that I have ever had out of the three vehicles that I have purchased in the last 12 months.
I will give good possiitive feedback about the Georgetown VW Dealership and trust me good word gets around FAST ! I would recommend my friends and family to Rick Roberts in the future or anyone that I may come acrossed in the future. Rick Roberts was a great sales person and I did not find him pushy at all. What I liked the most is Rick Roberts got me into the VW TDI Jetta that I wanted at my price that I can afford.
Thank You VW Jetta for making this happen and Thank You Rick Roberts for helping me get just the vehicle that I wanted and I should have bought a 2010 VW TDI Jetta to start with. I LOVE MY TDI Jetta & The money I'm going to save on fuel. OMG !
I'm truly excited and I love how it drives and it has power that Im not used to and this VW TDI Jetta acts like and sounds like a sport car. I feel like I'm in a good safe and reliable vehicle and thats all that matters to me. 
Thanks VW

100,"May 29, 2010","I almost didn't buy a VW because of my experience at Charles Maund VW in Austin. My husband encouraged me to try Hewlett VW in Georgetown, TX since I really did like the 2010 Jetta Sportwagen TDI. I read reviews on many sites and Russell Blackstone stood out as a wonderful salesman in all of them. I called to make an appointment to meet him and told him of my other experience. He apologized and promised me that Hewlett VW was different. Russell was friendly, efficient, and professional during my entire experience - he is the reason I purchased a VW. He took the time to show me all the features of the car - the big things and the little ones - and it's clear he knew this vehicle inside and out. He did not have the exact car I wanted on the lot, but he was able to get it in a reasonable amount of time. He kept in touch with me and gave me appropriate status updates. Everyone at Hewlett VW has been very friendly and helpful - including the receptionist and Edward in the parts dept. (I decided I couldn't live without the base carrier bars & luggage rack). They have a nice, clean waiting area there with 2 computers you can use, wi-fi for my MacBook, and free bottled water. I went to pick up my new car and Russell exceeded my expectations making this experience perfect. He took a picture of me next to my new VW and sent me that with a personalized letter thanking me for adopting my Jetta from him at Hewlett VW. His follow through has been amazing and I'm happy to say he has far exceeded my expectations.

So now I need to tell the other side of this which was a nightmare. I originally went to Charles Maund VW in Austin, TX and worked with Gordon Spencer. He did not have the 2010 Jetta Sportwagen TDI I wanted on the lot, so he got it in from another dealer. I went in to pick up the car - it was Gordon's day off, so Ken helped me. I walked around the car to check it out & saw a huge scratch on the driver's side near the front of the car. I touched it & said, ""there's a scratch on my new car"", then Ken touched it and said, ""no, it's a dent."" Ken said they would pound it out, then buff it and it would be like new. I was so excited to be getting this new car and it really took the wind out of me when I saw this and Ken's response didn't help. I felt like he thought I was being ridiculous in my reaction. He said they were going to fix this car either way & if I didn't want it, they could easily sell it to someone else. I told him I'd think about it overnight and he agreed they would try to get me another car if I decided this one wouldn't work. 

Gordon called & spoke with my husband the next day. Gordon thought it was silly that I didn't want this car - as 'it's only a dent & we can fix it'. My husband backed me and said 'she knows about it & it will drive her crazy to have that car now'. So Gordon finally agreed to find another car for me.

I was not happy with my experience and sent the following email to Gordon on Saturday:

Hi Gordon,   I'm really disappointed that the car had a dent on it when we went to pick it up on Thursday.  I was expecting a perfect car from Volkswagen and it fell far below my expectations with the dent.  I've given this a lot of thought and if I take this car, I'm always going to know there was a dent on it before I got it and it got fixed.  I'm Not okay with that.  Buying a new car is supposed to be a great experience - especially when it's a Volkswagen - and it was until I saw the dent.  I understand that was the only one in Texas like it, but I don't want a car that had a dent fixed on it.  After driving the 17"" tires and the 16"" tires on Thursday, I can't tell that much of a difference.  I remember you said it opens up a lot more cars if we go with the 16"" tires.  So let's go with the 16"" tires.  I put the requirements I have below.  I'm flying out early Sunday morning and should be back on Friday around noon or so.  If you can get the car in anytime next weekend, that would be great.  Feel free to call the house at *** and leave a message once you have located the car.  If we have another experience like this, I'm not sure I will want to go with a Volkswagen, as it is I'm a little leery now.   Thanks, Laura

Gordon wrote me back the following Thursday at 4:15pm and said, ""Laura,   I have your white/black diesel Sportwagen due in tomorrow.  The new VIN is ***.   Gordon""

There was no empathy in his email, nothing saying I'm sorry about your experience and we'll make it better from here, nothing. My expectations were not even close to met from this email and that is when I made the final decision not to buy the car from Charles Maund. The only reason I even tried Hewlett was because I liked the car. I wish I would have went there first. If the sales guys do this poorly when you're a prospect, I don't think you can expect much more when it comes to service as an owner. I will never go to Charles Maund again. ",5.0
101,"May 26, 2010","I'm generally not very fond of going to car dealerships.  The high pressure sales pitch and the sneaky numbers game never makes for a pleasant experience.  I was surprised to have quite the opposite experience at Hewlett VW.  I exchanged emails with Rick for several days before stopping in to say hello.  Rick is completely the opposite of the usual sales consultant.  It is easy to tell that he not only believes in the VW product line, but he truly enjoys his job.  He is enthusiastic about showing what makes VW a different car manufacturer.

Truth be told, I left the dealership empty handed as I wanted to visit another local VW dealer to see what they had available.  The experience at the other dealership was so horrible I couldn't wait to go back to Hewlett VW.  The very next day I was driving off in my new VW!

I firmly believe it was worth driving the extra miles. Rick was a pleasure to work with. Overall, my experience with Rick and all others I dealt with at Hewlett VW was flawless.

121,"January 19, 2010","I have a 2008 Jetta.  A little over a month ago, I noticed that my rear brakes were squealing really bad so when I scheduled my oil change for a week later, I asked the service rep to have the brakes checked.  When he returned my car to me almost two hours later, he assured me that my brakes were just fine and that they were probably squealing from some mud or something getting caught on the rotar. I thought that was a little strange but who am I to question him.  Three weeks later, my rear brakes started to grind.  Rather than taking my car in to Hewlett, I took it to a local mechanic of excellent reputation.  Come to find out, my brake pads were completely gone and the squealing I heard was the warning that they were wearing out and needed replacing.  Since I didn't know and didn't get them replaced, the non-existant brake pads caused damage to the rotars which meant they also needed to be replaced.  My car only has 25000 miles (almost all highway miles as I commute an hour to work one way which means very little brake usage) and should not in any way need my brakes replaced already.  Had the service guy at Hewlett actually had my brakes checked like I asked, they would have noticed that they were indeed going bad and should be replaced sparing me the cost of new rotars.  I remember that Hewlett was not overly busy that day (a weekday in the morning) so I can't think of any reason why they wouldn't check my brakes when I asked.  So...

123,"January 01, 2010","Sales: I recently purchased my second VW Passat from Hewlett VW and was very pleased with the entire experience. The salesperson I worked with was Pat McGarry. I was extremely impressed with his product knowledge and no hassle approach. At no point did I feel pressured or that he was taking advantage of me. I later found out that Hewlett does not tolerate sleazy salespeople - they hire and train their staff to be honest, straight-forward and customer-oriented. My experience with another dealer in town (Charles Maund) was not so good because I caught the salesperson changing his original quote to me - I think he thought I would not notice and call him on it. Additionally, when the color Passat I wanted was not on the lot, he did not offer to either order the color I wanted or get one from another dealer. Pat Mcgarry at Hewlett VW said this would be no problem.

Service Department: My loyalty to VW Hewlett has a lot to do with their service department, which is where I took my first Passat for scheduled maintenance and a few repairs (which there weren't many during the ten years I had my first Passat). Hewlett VW's service department also treats it customers with honesty. At one point, I needed a $500 repair; however the service consultant (Matt) suggested a different approach that only cost me $60. Additionally, Hewlett VW has a shuttle that takes people to work and picks them up at the end of the day. Finally, their hours make it easy for working people, as most customers are, to get their vehicles taken care of. There is nothing worse than having to take a vacation day to get one's vehicle in for scheduled maintenance.

Finance: I dealt with Mark E. when it came to financing my Passat. Again, I did not feel pressued and there weren't any hidden fees. Mark E. got me a really good deal from A+ Credit Union which surprised me, because I shopped around for financing contacting two banks and two credit unions. Mark E. even contacted my insurance company to get the appropriate coverage - I didn't have to do this.

Little Things That Mean A Lot: (1) My new Passat came with a full tank of gas. (2) Hewlett VW's facilities are clean, inside and out. (3) Pat McGarry helped me move stuff from my old Passat into my new Passat. (4) Everyone said ""hello, have you been helped?"" (5) What I heard from Pat McGarry about a six cylender Passat versus a turbo-charged four cylinder fit all the research and recommendations I read on the internet.

Rick Roberts was a nice salesperson to work with via email. I had a trade and a price in mind for it and the new SportWagen. Plus I knew what options I wanted so I might be a little different than most shoppers. Rick recognized my needs and met them. 

Of course, I did feel a little pressured at times with typical rush tactics, like ""we have others here to see it"", etc (without the pressure this dealer gets a 5 for overall experience). But that is to be expected. And the price was just OK – if they were dealing they'd get a 5 here, too.

But Rick was cordial, fun to talk with and really accommodating. He knows VW's in and out and has a great grasp on history. He (and other folks in the dealership) even stuck around after closing time to ensure delivery took place. I've got young kids and was unable to make it in before closing.

Alex Blair at Hewlett is completely different! He is knowledgeable, patient, HONEST, and a gentleman car salesman. Before coming to Hewlett, I thought those adjectives were not allowed in the same sentence as ""car salesman."" He stays in constant communication with us, remembers us each time we come in and aims to make us happy (not just make a quick sale). I cannot stress enough how extraordinary the car-buying experience has been at Hewlett.

I think you guys should add some excitement when someone buys a car.  It was very low fanfare and the experience was like
buying groceries.  Not everyday does someone spend $30K and so it would be great for customers to receive a group hand clap or bell ringing to congratulate the customer on their purchase.",5.0
130,"October 22, 2009","I'd like to thank Hewlett VW for the outstanding experience and service provided during my recent new car purchase. Everything was flawless, from the first contact with my internet sales associate, Russell Blackstone, to the welcoming environment of the show room and service staff. I would never have guessed that one of my life's best customer experiences would come from a car dealership! I would recommend Hewlett VW in a heart beat. I will definitely insist that they try and work with Mr. Blackwell. And yes, I love my 2010 Jetta Sportwagon.

131,"October 20, 2009",I met Paul while looking at a 2009 Volkswagen GTI. I was more interested in the new 2010 model and he continued to stay in touch until the model shipped.  He alerted me to the status of the first model available to the dealership and continued to update me until its arrival.  The buying process was very smooth and quick and I felt very fair. I was out of the dealership in my new car within an hour.   I would certainly buy from this dealership again and will recommend friends and family to them.,5.0
132,"October 13, 2009","Russell Blackstone at Hewlett VW Georgetown was a delight to work with when purchasing our new 2010 VW Jetta Sportwagen TDI.  From our initial contact via the Hewlett VW website, Russell did a fantastic job of answering all of my questions regarding the car's availability, features and pricing.  Along the way he would send me status of my car as it was built, shipped, and arrived in port.  To my surprise, the car actually arrived early and the team at Hewlett was quick to prep the car for delivery.  Upon arrival to get the car, Russell had all the paperwork ready to go and the finance team lined up to finalize the purchase.  With the car washed and gas tank full, Russell spend a good half hour showing us all of the features and benefits of our new Sportwagen.  Additionally he assisted in pairing up our phones to the bluetooth system and testing a phonecall.  If you are looking for a VW, I highly recommend giving Russell Blackstone at Hewlett VW Georgetown a call.",4.8
133,"October 12, 2009","We began our search for a new minivan online and found the Hewlett VW online sales website very helpful.  The manager, Russell, was very helpful in providing me with all the info I could want on the various Routans they had in stock.  He was courteous, but never pushy. We decided to test drive the Routan and we were helped by Rick, who is also part of the internet sales team.  Rick was very informed on the ins and outs of the Routan vs other models/brands of minivans.  We ended up coming back for another test drive - each time Rick treated us very well!  We finally decided to purchase from them and the whole process was smooth and easy.  Josh helped us find even better financing than we had lined up! I've also since been in for maintenance work and everyone I've spoken with in that department has been very nice and helpful. I have not encountered one surly person yet...what an unexpected benefit!

Thanks to the Hewlett team for a great car-buying experience!",5.0
134,"October 02, 2009",Top notch sales and service. Everyone involved with our transaction was professional. I highly recommend Alex as a salesperson due to his attention to detail on delivery. Even though we were buying a used vehicle we were treated not different than if we were buying new. Alex made sure we were well aquainted with our new Beetle. Wonderful Experience!,5.0

136,"September 19, 2009","We have purchased three cars from Russell Blackstone at Hewlett VW, because of the excellent customer service we have received. After having a very insulting experience at another dealership, we truly appreciate Russell's no-hassel business style, and we realize because of that the Hewlett dealerships stand out in the field. Russell really listened to our needs and approached us from that point, which is really refreshing. It was a really individualized visit and we appreciated his openness about the whole process (talking with us about our credit scores, explaining which warranties would be most valuable to our family, telling us which features are more lifestyle upgrades, etc.).

All the staff at the dealership were friendly and helpful. You don't get that sterotypical car dealship experience where you feel like they are trying to ""pull something over on you."" Even with a one year old in tow who was climbing up stairs and making his own havoc, we were greeted with smiles and courteous offers, rather than eye-rolls and sighs.

Honestly, we love Volkswagens, but we keep returning to Russell at Hewlett VW because we know we will be treated with respect and honesty…and that is worth our business and the drive to Georgetown.

138,"September 15, 2009","I can't say enough good things about my experience with Russell Blackstone and Hewlett VW.  I had some previous credit issues so getting a loan for me in this economic climate was not easy. Russell never gave up and kept working until he got me a loan.  In our various conversations, he was extremely patient and professional. He answered every one of my questions and kept me informed throughout the process. When I went out to pick up my car he demonstrated every feature and we took it for a drive to make sure I was comfortable with my decision. At no time did I feel pressured, everything just seemed very casual. 

I was very happy with the job Russell did for me and he'll do a great job for you. If we're both in Austin, TX and he's in the auto business, when I'm ready for a car, he knows who I'll be calling. ",5.0

140,"September 11, 2009","Alex was extremely conscientious about getting me the car that was right for me.  Purchasing a car was a very overwhelming choice for me and Alex sat down and walked me through the entire process.  He wanted to be sure that the car would work for me now and in the future.  We began looking at the Tiguan and were very interested but I realized it was too big for me. I am short in stature and we were both concerned that I be comfortable in the car.  I was very frustrated upon discovering that the Tiguan was ""not the one."" Alex immediately sensed that and engaged me in a conversation about what my ""hopes and dreams"" were for my car. It wasn't until then that even I began to realize what I wanted my next car to be.  I think the most admirable thing about Alex was that he had my well being and interests in mind, whether that meant buying a volkswagen or not.  I made many visits to the car dealership and test drove many cars. In end we decided on a Jetta. We dealt with Alex for about a month and never did he lose patience with us or treat us as if we were not his top priority.  Alex has made this experience a memorable one. I absolutely love my 2010 Jetta more than any car I have ever owned. It fits me perfectly and it has all the options I wanted and looked for. Alex continues to follow up with me about the vehicle and offer his support in transitioning to this new vehicle. I am thankful that Alex was our salesperson and will forever be indebted to him for the patience and understanding he showed me during my car buying experience.",5.0

I was at the dealership to purchase, providing the promised Costco discount was indeed offered and agreed to.  Rick was very truthful and explained the Costco process and price to me.  As you can see he was good at his job because I purchased the Jetta TDI

146,"August 27, 2009","From the start of our new car purchase experience with Jennifer on the Live Chat, to the telephone discussions with Rick Roberts, to meeting Rick in person on Saturday morning, we are very pleased.  We were made to feel right at home by Rick and his knowledge of our new Jetta was superior.
Josh was courteous to deal with in the Finance Department.  We do wish the process of purchasing extended warranty coverage was not the buy now or pay more to purchase later.  I did find the explanation of which county (the dealership's or our home county) to process the paperwork through to be a bit difficult to follow.  
We are truly enjoying driving our ""sweet new ride"" as Mark refers to the Jetta.  My only complaint is the lack of detail in cleaning the inside of the windshield and rear window.  The glare caused by the smearing is hard on my eyes and I unfortuantely did not have time to clean them again just yet.
I will recommend Hewlett to family, friends, anyone who I know is in the market for a new or pre-loved vehicle.  I believe we will return as repeat car buyers at sometime in the future!  ",4.8

We were not pressured into anything we did not want, but received all the assistance and information we could ask for.  Once we decided on the Sportwagen Russell worked with us to find the right car with all the features we wanted.  We very much enjoyed working with him and he made the car buying process very easy and enjoyable for us. We found the experience of going over all the car’s features with him very helpful as well. We also appreciated the follow up phone calls and emails after we purchased the vehicle to makre sure everything was going well.

After driving our new Sportwagen I can say with confidence that we are satisfied customers!  I am loving zipping around town in my new car, love the way it drives and am very happy with our choice.  I think this car will be a perfect fit for our growing family.

148,"August 21, 2009","I, Arturo Santoya and my wife Joni were very satisfied with our experience at Hewlett VW.  Paul Cano was very professional and a down to earth guy which made my wife and I very comfortable.  The sales persons were not at all pushy or in a rush to sell a car.  They are very calm and passive.  My wife and I were surprised that they worked with us even though we live in San Antonio.  We were actually going to buy a Kia Sorento from a Volvo dealership, but they were to eager to get us in and out the door.  We drove all the way to Georgetown which was 1 1/2 hours away.  But at the end it was worth it.  We paid $1000.00 more but our used car came with new tires and brakes and is power everything.  Even a moon roof.  I highly recommend that everyone drops in before you go anywhere else.  Its worth the drive and our salesman Paul Cano even took us to lunch while our car was being washed and detailed.  I have never met anyone as professional as the sales persons at Hewlett VW.  Not even when I bought my Scion xB in Savannah, GA were they this good.  Definetly drop in and don't be taken advantaged of somewhere. ",5.0
149,"August 20, 2009","On our second visit to the showroom, we were able to narrow down our search to the exact car.  I told the salesman we would be back the next morning with our trade in, and to please have the car we selected cleaned and ready to go.  When we arrived the next morning (after driving an hour to get there) the car had not been touched, it was dirty and the plastic wrap still in place.  Needless to say, we finally left the dealership in disgust after 4 hours of geting our chains jerked about the car, them telling us we were going to have to pay MSRP pricing and their refusal to even wash the car before we got there or while we were there. When I pressed them about the car, they FINALLY told me we would have to wait another day or possibly even two to get the car. 

We ended up driving 50 miles to another dealership, arrived at the other dealership at 4 pm, and were able to drive off with the car we wanted that evening - at a better price, plus we got 20% more for our trade in....  Hewlett VW acted like they were doing us a favor to even let us sit in the lobby and wait on THEM.... just damned condescending and disrespectful.

He obviously loves the company and product as it is evident in his passion for the sale.  He went above and beyond and I appreciate the focus he provided at every stage.

Russell had us sit down and describe what we were looking for.  I told him we were mostly interested in driving a Jetta and a Passat to decide which we liked better, and not really ready to buy.  He helped us pick out the two from inventory that were closest to our interest then he brought them up for us to look at and test drive.  He gave great insight to the two cars, how best to compare them and test them.  I was impressed.  He asked if I wanted to discuss price, I said yes, for the Passat.  We bought it.  Awesome.

And he knew his product from A-Z. The Hewlett dealership couldn't be more perfect . . . attractive, convenient, customer focus and clean.

157,"June 26, 2009","Well let me start by thanking Russell & Brett for helping me find the car I wanted. This experience started while I was deployed to Iraq and I inquired about a 2009 Jetta GLI, Russell wrote me back letting me know he was the email manager for Hewlett VW. Read his email and contacted him back explaining my situation and he understood where I was coming from. I also contacted other dealers you know looking for the better deal. But I i constantly got hounded by the other dealers and Russell was more suttle he gave me information about the vehicle I was inquireing about and provided videos via email which I loved. After all that I redeployed back to Ft Drum, NY and went on leave and made it a point to go and see Russell. When I got there Russell was busy helping a couple make there dreams come true. This is when i meet Brett and i told him what i was looking for and he brought a Black GLI around so i could test drive, I feel in love with the car even more. I explained what I wanted and not what i would settle for and Brett and Russell looked around and found the car that was right for me. I think everyone deserves the service that is displayed at Hewlett VW, the professionalism is outstanding. These two guys should give siminars on how to treat and help people on buying what they want and not try to get them to settle. I really enjoyed Working with them and will always think of Hewlett VW whenever someone ask what kind of car they should get or where they should go to get a new car. Thank you again guys.

- Returned several months later (now in crunch time to find a car) and nearly/should have walked out

- He also kept asked what other cars I was considering (after telling him I would rather not say) and seemingly tried to be creative with his wording and trick me into revealing more information than I was comfortable with
- Toward the end of my visit, I was pressed for time (had another appointment) and aftering informing him of such, he just kept talking and gave me his business card, which I promptly tore up
- If I decide to buy a Jetta, it will not be from Hewlett thanks to an abrasive and intrusive sales person, who told me ""it's not [his] job to sell me a car"", but rather, to consult me about the car (how naive does he think potential buyers are?)",1.3

163,"January 27, 2004","This dealership managed to make a car buying experience as frustrating as it could possibly be. Sales and financing staff that drive a hard bargain are tough enough, but these people portrayed themselves in a way I can only conclude was deceitful. I walked in and found a used 2000 Passat, VW certified (supposedly) to lease. I went through all the dealing with Ron to the payment I wanted and a CD player thrown in, luckily I asked him to write it down. It was going to take 2 days to get ready so I left and came back in 2 days later to sign the paperwork after leaving a refundable $500 deposit. When I get there, I sit in the car and sure enough, no CD player. I tell Ron this and he doesn't remember that was part of the deal. After he looks at his own writing to this effect, he finally agrees. He says it will be added and 'shoos' me off to the finance person to sign the deal. She sits there for 10 minutes printing and gathering the paperwork and when it comes out, it's the original lease price they asked for before negotiation. I told her the price we have decided on, she gets huffy but spends another 10 minutes doing the paperwork. When I get it again, she casually says, ""Oh, I got it within a few dollars over your agreed payment, that's should be fine."" I told her, ""No"", the agreed payment is the agreed payment, if she wanted to make it just a few dollars under, I'm OK with that though. She gets REALLY huffy now. Types up the paperwork again and it's OK. Now I ask about my warranty info (VW Certified). Suddenly everyone starts looking perplexed and saying, ""It's a standard 2 years etc., don't worry about it"". I said no problem, just let me see where it indicates in my paperwork I am purchasing a VW Certified car. She couldn't find anything. I insisted and finally she leaves and goes to the manager’s office (beside me). I can actually hear her in the next room saying ""Can we just get this guy out of here?” She comes back with some cards and registration for VW Certified cars and starts filling them out for me. Hmmm, if it were VW Certified and inspected car, shouldn't that have been done already? Finally this gets done and I ask for the $500 deposit back. She indicates this was part of the down payment. That's when I stood up and said I was going to be leaving, ""Didn't you bother to ask Ron what the deal we made was?” She stops me and quickly gives me the payment back. I don't know why I stayed there, except that I knew I was getting a good deal if I stuck to my guns and if it were VW Certified, I could take it anywhere for service. I don't know if it was Ron thinking I would forget the deal, her trying to get more money out of me or a deliberate act on the part of the dealer to go back on a good deal. I suspect the latter. And with the struggle they put up, many buyers could have been worn down and conceded some things. It was a great car, I love VW's, just this dealer was horrible. I disturbs me that such a wonderfully designed vehicle could have such deplorable representation. I mentioned this in numerous surveys but received no response. When it was unfortunately totaled in an accident, I bought an Audi because I could not stand the thought of going back there. When I respond to an Audi survey with anything less than 100%, my dealer calls me and asks me what she needs to do to make me happy. Guess who I'm sticking with? And, as far as I am concerned, none of us should have to settle for anything less.",1.8
