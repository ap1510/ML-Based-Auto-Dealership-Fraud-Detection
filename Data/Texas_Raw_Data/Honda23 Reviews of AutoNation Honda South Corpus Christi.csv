0,"February 12, 2020","A salesman by the name of Mark Santos came out to greet me. I was interested in a particular Honda Civic I saw online. Mark had no clue on which vehicle I was talking about and asked if I was at the right dealership. He then proceeded to locate the vehicle, leaving me and my kids outside for over half an hour.  He had no clue what he was talking about and said I would have a better chance purchasing the vehicle I want elsewhere. I have been getting my service done here for past 4 years but will not be returning due to Mark. ",1.0

2,"July 18, 2019","Very pleased with Auto Nation Honda South Corpus Christi. Salesman Trevon Wright was professional, pleasant, no-pressure and an excellent listener. He provided everything I requested and on schedule. He and sales manager Tom Gainan provided a stress-free shopping experience AND a very good price. I shopped other dealers, but recommend this dealership.
Purchased 2019 CRV in July 2019

3,"April 25, 2019","I had been searching for a dealer to purchase my Honda lease car from and until I came across Autonation I had not found one that excelled in customer service. We went in 3-days in a roll until we finally made the purchase complete. Everyone was patient with helping me thru the process and  with family members that accompanied me. They were very attentive to the concerns I voiced with previous experiences with the lease financier (Honda Financial Services) and they worked VERY hard to keep my family as customers. I would highly recommend this dealership. You'd love working with Ms. Judy, Scott, Paloma and Cosmo. ",5.0
4,"July 21, 2017","This franchise does not care about customer satisfaction, the service that was provided for me did not meet my expectations and I highly recommend to get your vehicle serviced elsewhere. More specifically, I go to get my air conditioning diagnosed and they tell me that they need to replace the evaporator core and expansion valve which was about $1,000.00. I get the vehicle back and it is still not blowing cold air, the fact that they released the vehicle to me knowing that it was not fixed is a huge embarrassment to the Honda name and this Autonation franchise. I take it back and they say, ""oh it is the relay switch"" and they replace it, still not working correctly when they release it to me. The service technicians are not very skilled if they misdiagnosed my car 3 times, and it would seem that the labor and parts that i paid for was not the cause at all and that they were actually in good working order. The service representatives were not helpful either, very quick to hand me quotes on more parts and labor. I paid loads of money for this fix, and it is not fixed, that is not how Honda should treat their customers. I can't help but feel like this dealership has robbed me of hard-earned money. Be weary about getting your vehicle serviced there, their lack of knowledge and expertise is very evident when talking to these service representatives. In fact, they also tried to tell me that my radiator fans were not operating correctly, however, one fan kicks on when the A/C does and the other when the vehicle's engine exceeds 255 degrees and that's how radiator fans properly work. These service technicians and representatives will just tell you anything to get more money or for you to leave. This was my experience at Autonation Honda. ",1.0
5,"May 31, 2017","After 20 years of being a Honda advocate and owner of at least seven Honda vehicles, the dealership in Corpus Christi has lost my respect and patronage.  I was promised a suitable trailer hitch as part of my trade for a new vehicle to support my aluminum hitch mount cargo basket. They also called to say my licence plates and hitch were in. After six and one half hours, I find a hitch that is half the size of the one on my Honda trade in and still dealer plates on my new car.  If there was any communication within the dealership or between the service department and their customers, this mess could have been avoided. Victoria Honda, hope you can offer this new Honda owner the service you have in past years. Autonation Honda, you have lost a faithful customer.",1.0
6,"April 02, 2017","these guys are thorough professionals. i was getting jerked around and nickeled and dimed by houston dealers and found the car i wanted with autonation honda corpus christi online. they made the whole deal transparent via email on the cpo that i purchased and even gave me extra for my trade in based on a couple minor details i found lacking on the cpo. they didn't try to push ""loan packing"" like the houston dealer. it was a clean process all the way. thank you stephan vaughn and ben lederman for making my long drive worthwhile.

7,"June 30, 2016","I took my Honda Prelude in to have the door handle repaired. I was charged 125 dollars for a new handle. Two days later I couldn't open the door with the handle. I took it back in and was told, that had nothing to do with what they did.  I guess they do think all Black people are stupid.  If you installed a new door handle and my door will not open using the handle, it has everything to do with the handle you put on.   I will never take my car there and would tell everyone else not to deal with them. The service department is horrible.",1.0
8,"June 14, 2016","Don't buy a car at autonation honda. The service department is horrible they will give the runaround for weeks now even 2 months ,if you purchase a warranty at dealership you expect them to honor the warrant, but they don't, they will magically somehow have no record of you calling showing up taking your car in ,we have proof of two documents indicating we were but some how the problem didn't get fixed or looked at even though say they did,but they didn't write notes bout it hmm.  Yes it's bout the a/c on the 2011 Volkswagen  Robert Ibarra  customer service manager and John service advisor and general manager Stan ruprenski of autonation honda. About 12 calls of the runaround amd in person 7 times still these people manage to beat around the Bush made a complaint to the bbb.org I'm corpus that just made them more upset more beating around the saying several already they will call back and several times saying it has been approved and even saying yes go ahead and bring it the next day but then there's another excuse after after another excuse after another excuse, yeah everybody frustrated and nothing resolved ,autonation honda  good !!!!! Don't buy a car any car here people cause the service department will not honor the warranty or take forever with more and more runaround excuses. ... good luck people buy elsewhere  bbb.org is aware of situation but don't think autonation honda is going to fix things anyways ",1.0
9,"November 19, 2015","This dealership is by far the best one to buy your vehicle from. I wouldn't go anywhere else. This was my 3rd car purchased from them and the 5th car purchased there by my family. The salesmen and sales manager go above and beyond to work with you and help you in any way that they can. Thank you to Ean (salesman), Justin (salesman), and Cosmo (sales manager) for doing all that you did for me! A++",5.0
10,"June 13, 2015","Took my girls 2003 CRV in to service department because battery was not charging. They said it was the Alternator and Battery and quoted me a price of $1300.00 to fix. both items.  Together these items can be purchased for $250 dollars. Anyway, I decided to have it towed to PepBoys and  they informed me nothing was wrong with the battery and only the alternator needed to be replaced.  Repairs were made for $350.00. Unsavory business practices I would advise anyone to stay away. ",1.0
11,"December 14, 2014","I felt that with the great customer service I received from Autonation Honda Corpus Chisti that I should write a review.

I did do some research on dealers in the area after going to different dealers and just being pressed into buying something I was not really interested in or didn't really like. Seeing Autonation has quite a bit of positive feedback and being frustrated at this point with other dealers, I thought I would give them a try and see what kind of deal I can get from them and see if my questions could be answered.

Jonah French is the employee that helped me out. I couldn't be more pleased with my purchase. Jonah was very informative and was able to answer all of my questions and concerns. Jonah kept everything at a stress-free and professional level of customer service. After going back and forth with decision making on what I wanted for my next brand new car. Jonah helped me decide and weigh my pros and cons. Finally was able to get a really great deal on the car that I wanted.

Just want to say thanks to Jonah French @ Honda Autonation of Corpus Christi, You have a great employee that works for you and Would gladly do business again.",5.0
12,"November 22, 2014","Because of this man, I have a great car, great monthly payment and more! He helped me when nobody else could or would, this team is great! Thank you to the guys that helped me get into my first vehicle under my name. This car wasn't just affordable but the mileage is great and I have no regrets. The customer service was fantastic and I appreciate all that he was able to do and more. I went in and came out with a car of my choice! Thank you and I strongly recommend if you go with any salesman, its Jacob! He wouldn't take no for a answer and that's what makes customer service go round! Thank you again for everything!",5.0
13,"October 28, 2014","I have been a long time supporter of Honda.  I purchased a new Civic from the Corpus Christi Honda dealer several years ago and the experience was wonderful.  I have always taken my vehicle to Honda for service maintenance because I trust the folks and they always take time to explain issues and treat me as a valuable customer.  I have also sent numerous people to Honda to purchase their own new cars.  Naturally, I decided to purchase my new car at Honda.  Jerry, our salesman, was minimally informed on various vehicle features and, based on my own research, we decided to purchase a new CRV mainly because of the remote start feature that was not offered on a comparable Nissan.  The dealership didn't have the model we wanted, so it was ordered from another city.  At this point, Jerry did not discuss any additional features, add-ons, etc.  When the vehicle arrived, there was no remote start.  When we came back to finish paperwork and discuss the concerns with Jerry, he was accusatory and blamed us for not making ourselves clear.  There was very little in the way of compassionate or caring dialogue regarding my frustrations, rather Jerry blamed us for the  miscommunication.  Because my wife wanted the car and did not want the hassle of returning the vehicle at this point, we begrudgingly finished paperwork.  The dealership offered an extremely nominal discount on a new remote start install, the same discount I could get with a 10% off coupon I routinely get in mailers.  Needless to say, I am extremely frustrated with this experience and will not recommend this dealer to any friends.  If you want to purchase a Honda, I strongly encourage you to drive to Austin or San Antonio for a better buying experience.  Major thumbs down Jerry and AutoNation Honda! ",1.8
14,"August 11, 2014","I have purchased two vehicles from this dealership in the last year and my recent experience over the weekend was just as good as the first. Jonah accommodated in every way to satisfy all of my needs. The purchasing process was smooth, quick and relaxed without any pressure whatsoever. Jonah has followed up even after the sales. Plus, I appreciate the complimentary car wash when I visit. Great job Jonah!! Keep up the great work and thanks for all your help in both sales and service!  ",5.0
15,"August 04, 2014",We purchased a CR-V at Honda from Chano Saenz.  We were very satisfied with the service that we got from the everyone that helped us in one way or another.   Chano was very informative about the vehicle and its features.,5.0
16,"April 07, 2014","My son and I were on a mission to purchase his very own first car.  He had a list of vehicles he wanted to look at prior to stopping at AutoNation Honda.  Our first and only stop was at AutoNation Honda.  As we arrived at the dealership, Jonah happened to be the person I asked where I could park.  He instantly stopped what he was doing to direct me where to park and stated he would kindly assist us in what we were interested in looking at.  Jonah was very down to earth, friendly and listened to what my son was looking for in a car.  I liked that he brought us in briefly to discuss the specifics of what we were looking for in a vehicle.  Jonah showed us numerous vehicles and was very knowledgeable.  Once Jonah showed my son the 2014 Honda Civic...he was sold.  Jonah took us to test drive the car.  As we made it back to discuss figures, Jonah was very optimistic that the Financing team could work a great deal for us.  The financing department and all the staff we came into contact that day did an awesome job and my son is one HAPPY person.  Thank you for such a GREAT experience!!!  Would like to also add the weather was not very cooperative that day but it didn't stop Jonah from helping us.  Thanks Jonah! When I'm ready for a new car I will be visiting AutoNation Honda.",5.0
17,"March 31, 2014","My parents and I recently purchased my first car from Auto-Nation Honda Corpus Christi.  I had my heart set on a Ford Escape, or at least I thought I did so I didn't think to give Auto-Nation Honda a chance.  Well, being that I was very picky and had been searching for my dream car for months now, we randomly went to Auto-Nation Honda and we were instantly greeted and assisted by  sales person, Jonah Olaes.  Jonah listened to me and my dad, taking into consideration what I ""thought"" I wanted.  Jonah was kind enough to ""drive"" me and my family around to the numerous Auto-Nation car lots, to show me what was available in a SUV.  After seeing numerous SUV's that were nice, but didn't fit my personal style, Jonah found a 2011 Kia Sportage  that was absolutely perfect.   Jonah took the time to go over every feature of the Kia and I knew it was the SUV for me.   Jonah was very knowledgeable, honest, and straight forward.  The financing department did a great job and helped Jonah make the sale.  In the end, my first time car shopping experience turned out great!  Thank you Jonah Olaes and Auto-Nation Honda for everything.",5.0

19,"September 01, 2013","I have visited twice over a 3 month period and worked with two different salesman hoping for a different result.  Both were friendly and did a great job showing us the vehicle.  When it came to working out the price the experience was very poor!  I myself don’t like to haggle over price because in the end I feel like the dealership is just trying to rip me off.  Especially when the salesman gives me excuses for what I know he can do… Example, I checked both KBB and Edmunds on what I could get a new vehicle for prior to going in.  Trying to pitch over a $1000 or more over the Edmunds price and telling me, “sorry, but until we get all the old models out (they only had 1 last years model which a base model and 2 of the new ones in for 3 total)” wasn’t going to fly.  Same went for my trade in.  When I countered for a total of 2K in savings for me they took it right away with the condition I take one of the only one on the lot that fit our desires with exception of color.  Many more in valid excuses came from the salesman so we left. 

As soon as I got home I called two dealerships in San Antonio that had the exact vehicle we wanted for the same MSRP they gave me a price less than what I countered for and there was no hassle.  I just felt like they wanted to sell me a van (and they did) and not rip me off.  I’ve purchases 2 trucks from the Chevy dealership and it’s always been straight forward no hassle… no so with the Honda Side.",2.5

21,"March 11, 2013","This is from several visits for servicing. 3 visits ago they told me the Air Filter and Cabin Filter needed to be changed and after leaving I went and changed them myself.  The next visit (2,800 miles later) they told me they needed changed again.  I asked if they even looked at them, to which they gave me an ""uhhh"" and a dumb look.  I made them go out with me and look at them to which they said ""You are right, they are good.""  I just came from them, getting a basic oil change and no tire rotation (as I just bought new tires and front end alignment at Firestone) and it took almost 2 hours, WITH an Eight O'clock appointment.  I would go elsewhere but I stupidly bought the Servicing package on purchase of the vehicle.  By the way, I have asked the dealership about the front end alignment since I bought the car and they said it was good and they said it pulled right because of the crown on the road.  Firestone said it was way out, showed me the computer readout and did the alignment and amazingly it drove perfectly straight and handled amazingly.  I love the car, a Honda Accord, but this dealership is totally sub-standard and unfit to fix anything.",2.0
22,"November 29, 2009","Drove to Corpus from Dallas for Thanksgiving early Thursday morning 11/26. 2008 Honda Odyssey was making horrible noise under the hood on our way to Corpus. Took it to Champion Honda Friday 11/27. Explained my situation to Domingo and he worked me in and had me out in no time. Staff was very knowledgeable (I was very impressed they keep up with what they call ""bulletins"" to see if the problem was related to recent complaints; which in this situation it was). Thanks for diagnosing the problem and giving us peace of mind for the trip back to Dallas!",5.0
