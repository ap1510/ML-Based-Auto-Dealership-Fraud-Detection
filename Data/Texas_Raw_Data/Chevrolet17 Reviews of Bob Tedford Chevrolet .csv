1,"August 23, 2019","This continues to be a great small town, family owned dealership. They treat their customers with honesty and respect. The sales process is quick and efficient, with no long waits like some of the large dealerships. 

This is my second purchase from them, and the second was the same as the first, AWESOME.

If you are in the DFW area, it’s worth the drive out to Farmersville. These are the guys you want to buy from!!!",5.0

4,"July 10, 2018","Bob Tedford Chevrolet is as good as it gets when it comes to car dealerships. A local family run business that cares about it’s customers. I had a great buying experience and they worked with me on every part of the deal. James, their General Manager, goes above and beyond with the sale to ensure their customers are happy. They don’t use pricing tricks online to get customers in the door like some other dealerships I visited, and I still received a great deal. In the days of to too many dishonest car dealerships, this is the one you want to shop!",5.0

15,"September 18, 2017","I've bought a lot of cars in the last 58 years.  I've had both good and bad experiences.  Dealing with James & Robbie is at the top of the list.  They go far above and beyond to make sure the customer is satisfied.  Once you walk in and meet these Guys, you become part of the family!",5.0
16,"December 01, 2008","Bob Tedford Chevrolet is far and away the very best dealership I've dealt with.  It's a small dealership in Farmersville, TX that will bend over backward to help you find the right car.  When I bought my used Malibu from them, Robbie, the owner, dealt directly with me to get me where I needed to be with my trade in and financing.  To say he is genuine and friendly is an understatement.  It's obvious he cares about his customers and will do what he can to make you feel comfortable with the deal.  I didn't once feel like I was being taken advantage of or being sold ""snake oil,"" like I've often felt at larger dealerships.  I used his service center for some warranty recall work on my car, and was equally pleased.  I recommend them to anyone looking for a new Chevrolet, or any used vehicle.  If you have a particular used car in mind, give them a chance to locate it for you.  It's a little way off the beaten path for people in DFW, but I know anyone who makes the trek will be glad they did.",4.8
