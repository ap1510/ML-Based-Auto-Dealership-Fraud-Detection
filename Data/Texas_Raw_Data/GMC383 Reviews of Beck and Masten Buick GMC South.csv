0,"September 06, 2019",I recently purchased a truck from here and they were supposed to call me to fix the tire sensors even though the salesman wrote down on the contract and still today no call and no answer also they were supposed to call me to see if I was approved by other banks since I got the truck on Labor Day and I keep calling Ricardo Garza  in finance and no answer or call back ,1.0
1,"August 08, 2019","I had my trucks transmission serviced by them besides the fact that truck sat there 6 weeks no one could ever return calls when i would call truck came out missing bolts on headlight grill was damaged had scratches that were not there, grease on steering wheel grease on keys finger prints everywhere. 

Tried reaching out too them and could never get a call back as usual. 
Please don't waist you're time with these people have made this issue a night made and a terrible experience. Given Beck n masten a bad name. 
Im sure Mr. Beck would hate too hear how y'all cant manage too return calls or clean vehicles up when finished.  ",1.2
2,"May 02, 2019",My husband was having his vehicle worked on and I went to pick the truck up after the work was completed. The man who I dealt with made inappropriate comments and made physical advances toward me that were not WELCOME!! I will never come here again! I drove away that day disgusted and needing to take a shower after dealing with that xxxxxxxx.  ,1.0
3,"April 11, 2019","Sent an inquiry in on a new GMC truck on 4/1 Monday night/Tuesday morning. Received generic email back from Emerly. I Responded to email with a question at 9:30 am on Tuesday. (Never got a response). Called in to the store and asked for Emerly , ended up leaving a message on vm. around 11am.( No call back or email response.) Called back in around 4pm asked for Emerly and it went to vm ,so this time I didn’t leave a message and went back to the operator. I asked for another internet mgr  who was not Emerly and was sent to service (I think). I got back to operator and let her know that she had sent me to service,  and asked the operator to get me to an internet manager but not Emerly this time, (she sent me back to Emerly’s voicemail.) I got back to operator and asked if I could get a manager and she immediately hung up on me.  
So I Got on to chat through their website, they were polite when I was explaining that i hadnt been contacted back and just wanted to know the answer to a question about dealer ad ons. But she couldn’t answer question and said they would bring my concerns to a manager, since i had not gotten any responses, and have them call me. (Never got a call or email from ANYONE ) Wednesday I Got on chat again later (AROUND 10 am) and chat representative said they see my previous conversation and don’t know why I haven’t received a contact back from a manager and would bring this to the attention personally. (I never got a response from ANYONE) I tried again on Friday using the chat to get the GM’s email address but the representative would not give me the email address,  but promised to get a manager involved. (I was shocked I could not get a contact email to the GM.) A couple days later I did get an email that was an automatic follow up set up in the CRM and I did respond to that - they said they ""would get a manager to call ""  (IT HAS BEEN TWO WEEKS AND  I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY CONTACT).
I do not know what else I could have done to possibly purchase a vehicle from this dealership. Completely piss poor.

5,"January 11, 2019","Rosie Hernandez, very poor customer service, no knowledge ,facts, information, and skills acquired by a person through her experience of work. She took almost a whole week to get back with me about my car. Then lost my keys to my car an wanted to charge me money when I had warranty. When I should have had a renter car they did not give me one. My car has been in the shop 3 times already in less then 2 months. From a 0-10 I would rate it a -0 from my experience.",1.0
6,"January 10, 2019","Carlos Murillo did a excellent job helping my Father and I find the right vehicle for us. He deserves 5 stars across the board. He answered every question we had and gave us useful information when it came down making our decision. My father and I ended up buying 2 gmc serria trucks. We are very happy with our purchases.

Now the Finance department is another story. Mohammed Qureshi was the Financer who did my fathers finance paperwork. He was very unprofessional and rude. At first he wouldnt let my dad put his down payment down. He tried to tell us my dad would have to finance the whole loan, and if he didnt his interest rate would be higher than 8%. 8% is already high for someone who has good credit. After arguing with Mohammed qureshi he finally talked to the manager of the finance department and the manager said it was ok to put the down payment down and that the interest rate would still be 8%. After that was settled, Mohammed qureshi attitude towards us then changed and he became very rude and didnt explain any of the paperwork he wanted my dad to sign. I had to step in and explain every peice of paper he put in front of my dad. When it came to signing the paper Mohammed qureshi would then try to pull the paper away from my dad while he was signing. I then had to lay my hand on the paper while my dad was signing that way Mohammed qureshi coildnt pull it away before he was done signing. Not to mention when putting the paper in front of my dad he slide it in front of him aggressively. After all paperwork was done, Mohammed qureshi didnt even shake my dads hand or address him. For two people buying 2 new trucks at the same time you would think Mohammed qureshi would be a little more nicer. I would not reccomend Mohammed qureshi, he is unprofessional and rude. ",3.0
7,"November 01, 2018","I started a deal with Kelsey Garland and Chris Dominguez on Monday the 29th, I had spoken to Kelsey over the weekend about what I was looking for and had given her my information and the details about my trade in. I had texted Kelsey prior to leaving my house on Monday (which I live an hour away from the dealership) I told her I was on my way and it would take me an hour to get there. I got there shortly after 12 and she wasn't there and had gone to lunch and I waited 45 minutes for her to return. When we started working the deal the price of the truck I was looking at went up 2,000 dollars than it was listed online for, it was explained to me that because I didn't have a current lease I lost 2,000 in rebates. They never took a dollar of their price of the truck I was interested in.  So I had them see what kind of interest rate I could get through them to find out my payments.  At that point I was told because I was a full time student that I couldn't be on the loan and my co-signer would be the only one on the loan. I told them I wouldn't buy the truck if I couldn't be on the loan, shockingly minutes later they called the bank and magically I was able to be on the loan with my co-signer.  While that was going on I called the General Manager at the Ford store that I used to sale cars from and asked him about this new law that supposedly was passed not allowing people with no income being able to be on the loan, he told me he had never heard of such a law existing.  I had asked for the keys to my personal vehicle back multiple times and they wouldn't give them back to me, and all I wanted to do was sit in my truck and charge my phone during my 5 hour wait time that accomplished nothing.  I ended up going home with my truck.  I called the next day to get a buyers order so I can go get my own financing from my bank.  I didn't receive the buyers order until that afternoon well after banks had closed for the day. On October 31th I had started the process to get my loan completed, but the bank was having problems with their servers and couldn't process the loan that day. November 1st I had gotten my loan done and signed everything with them and had gotten the check to purchase the truck from Beck and Masten I called Chris Dominguez and told him I was on my way to get the truck, he told me the price had changed because it was a new month. Needless to say I didn't not buy the truck from this dealership nor will I ever recommend this place to anyone or recommend either one of the sales representatives Kelsey Garland or Chris Dominguez. I was treated so unprofessionally it's unreal.  

 I'm 32 years old and have owned over 30 vehicles and this is by far the worst experience I have ever had.  I have also reported the company to the Better Business Bureau for failing to uphold their end of the deal. ",1.0

24,"March 27, 2018","The reason for my visit today was for my oil change and check engine light. 
I have visited this location on three previous ocassions and my service was not great. I came in today and was introduced to Gabby and I explained that I needed an oil change and has experienced my check engine light coming on and off. Gabby asked if I had an extended warranty and I told her I was not sure. She informed me that I did not and that she had other options available. I told her that I have mentioned in the past visits that I had concerns about my newly purchased vehicle but was blown off. Gabby gave me the attention that a service provider should provide while visiting the service department of a car dealership. Her service was amazing, she went above a d beyond and because of that I will be coming back to purchase the Platinum extended warranty. Thank You Gabby.

28,"February 26, 2018",Me n my family went to 4 different dealerships prior to going to beck n masten. All 4 of those experiences were awful and discouraging. We have always passed by beck n master and loved the inventory we seen. We decided to go and just try and see what happens. We pulled in and not even 10 yards within the driveway there was Rafael (our sales rep) waiting to help us on a golf cart. We weren't sure if we would qualify or not. Rafael went above and beyond to help us. He let us know our different options and what would be best for us. He made us feel like we were part of the beck n masten family. I would also like to extend a big thank you Carlos Contreras (financial manager) for helping us close the best deal for us. Beck n masten is truly the best. I would definitely recommend everyone to go. Thank you so much from me and my family. ,5.0

35,"February 09, 2018","I tried for 8 days to get someone from Beck & Masten to contact me back regarding a truck for my son. I called, emailed, submitted an inquiry online, sent in an offer, responded back to Crystal Soto (who sent the first response to my internet inquiry), even circled back with Crystal an additional 2 times, yet never heard from her again, responded to the generic reply the website sends when you request they contact you: nothing. Nothing at all for seven days.

I finally received an email from the internet sales manager, Nickole Kamran, asking if I’d received everything I needed. I replied and told her no, shared with her that not one person had ever circled back with me, let her know I was still interested in the truck and asked that she contact me. What did I get in return?  NOTHING.

I then reached out via the chat feature on the Beck & Masten South website and shared with the gentleman manning the chat feature that I had been unsuccessful in getting anyone to response to me in over a week. He took down my information, promised to have someone contact me, and apologized for the lack of customer service received to date. 

I waited another day and STILL never heard from anyone. At that point I emailed Crystal Soto a 4th time, and this time cc’d Nickole Kamran. My note outlined my experience with Beck & Masten to date, reiterated the absence of a response from both Crystal and Nickole, expressed my displeasure with the lack of customer service, and asked that they forward me their managers name so that I could speak with him before I shared my experience via social media. Shockingly (though really not given that now I had asked for management and advised I would take to social media), I FINALLY received a response. Sadly, it was not at all what I was hoping for. 

Nickole Kamran responded asking ME to call or text HER, and stated my email to her must have gone to spam. She then shared with me the times she would be UNAVAILABLE to assist me, (I assume so I didn’t contact her duting a time that would be inconvenient for her), and offered to check her phone periodically throughout the day. 

My response: My email going to her spam folder was HIGHLY UNLIKELY given that she emailed me and I simply replied. Additionally, it seemed awfully interesting that she somehow received my email requesting a manager, but not the previous one I sent to her. They were both sent to the same place. I closed with stating that I had no desire to chase her down throughout the day and expressed my displeasure with a member of management’s response to a dissatisfied customer who had failed to receive a response from anyone at the dealership in over a week was to ask ME to call HER, and at a time that worked for HER. Seriously?!? 

That is certainly not what customer service looks like to me. I was insulted and upset. 

Nickole responded to my reply and shared with me her General Manager’s contact information (Pete Trammell, ptrammell@beckmasten.net), discussed the automated ‘customer relations’ tool they use; presumably to send generic responses to website inquiries - which would help explain why no one ever gets a response - Beck & Masten only cares about their customers enough to let a computer system interact with them, not a live person; and said she would get with the IT department to look into things. She then apologized if her previous email came off as insensitive and offered to call me right then if I would like (Nickole, the first rule in customer service is that you cater to the client. What should have been asked is what time would be best for you to call me (so that you could be respectful of my schedule), followed by an assurance that you would make certain to reach out to me then). She closed by asking me to let her know if I would like to call her or if she should call me and stating that she would make sure the general manager, Pete Trammell, had my contact information.

I never responded. I also never heard from Nickole nor did I hear from Mr. Trammell.

My son and I discussed other trucks, reached out to several other far more responsive dealerships, and he expressed that he still really liked the truck at Beck & Masten, so at approximately 1030 pm Wednesday night I text the dealership from the website, and to my surprise, received a response. Rafael Benavides text me back...within 2 minutes...and at 10:30 at night!!! I thanked him for his responsiveness and how shocked I was to receive his text. I then shared with him the information on the truck I had been inquiring about, how much I was willing to pay for it, the small window of time I now had left to purchase it, and asked that he look into things and circle back with me in the morning if he thought he’d be able to accommodate my needs. 

Sure enough, by 8:30 the next morning he had called, text AND emailed. He got me the truck for less than I had offered to pay, took information from me over the phone so he could have the paperwork prepared in advance, and had it gassed up, washed and ready to go when I got there. 

Rafael was responsive, polite, prompt, courteous and true to his word. A joy to work with and a testament to what customer service REALLY looks like. 

While I remain disappointed and discontent with the lack of customer service, professionalism, and responsiveness I received from everyone else I’ve mentioned at Beck & Masten, I have nothing but great things to say about Rafael and the experience I had with him.

Thank you, Rafael, for helping to facilitate the purchase of my son’s first automobile, and for making him one happy recipient of a new GMC Canyon! 

I won’t recommend the dealership you work for, but I highly recommend you! 

Best of luck to you! ",2.6

40,"December 27, 2017",Took my truck in at 1130 am to get a new tire and an oil change. Said it would be 2-3 hrs because I didn’t have an appt which the first time I went a few months back “they didn’t give appts”. I show up at 230 truck is on the lift with wheels off. xxxxty tech didn’t finish my truck until 5pm. All that was needed was an oil change and a new tire. Service lady’s up front kept feeding xxxxxxxx that it would be ready soon. Terrible service I also bought there xxxx service for oil changes for 5 yrs and wheel and tire warranty for 100k miles I sure do regret that would not recommend this service shop at the south location.

She agreed of course and said yes they can come close as possible to that. It’s reasonable. So I went in. Spoke with the sales person, he was cold and never spoke with us to begin with. before we got started we also told him what I told the sales last prior to him and that’s what I wanted to even make this possible. His response was, “those are just receptionist, they will say anything to just get you in here!” So right then we knew this was xxxxxxxx. He never once asked for numbers, information, ran credit or anything, no questions about down payments, nothing. He came back with a number 200 and something over my payment I had requested to be close to. He said we “didn’t qualify” for all the incentives. He never asked us one question to even know if we got qualified, what my down payment was, what my credit score was or anything. I was in shock that a sales person could be so unprofessional. I could have cash for the Yukon but he wouldn’t of known because he never once asked. Needless to say we left.

I paid an additional $110 for the part.  The charge for the motor was $460 when all I needed was a $110 module as stated on Firestone's report I showed them. In checking GMC's website regarding repairs and symptoms the blower was never an issue because it wasn't making noises to begin with.  I tried showing the liars that report and suddenly Rosie was stuttering and inviting me to eat lunch.  Lunch which was provided to them by GMC for district sales.  I guess I'm not the only one they've cheated!!!  
I chose to wait on the vehicle; checked in around 8am was told about 2 hours wait after Rosie had to check with Manny on the part being in. I found that odd because she asked to see the diagnostic report from Firestone again and took it in to him.  I was told the part was in. I checked at 10 since I had no word on the status of their diagnostic and was told they had to order the part. I saw a part delivered around 10:45; not know if it was my part or not I waited. At 11:45 I inquired about the status but Rosie didn't have an answer. At 1pm I asked about the status and was told the part was there and they were getting to me next.

273,"July 24, 2016","Found the exact truck that I wanted at another dealer and they offered me a what I thought was a fair price. After a quick online search I see the same truck for $2000 less as a special offer. So I emailed them the listed VIN and told them I was ready to buy that truck at that price. The online guy never would email me an answer. He was at fleet, selling a lot of vehicles and hadn't had breakfast. I guess I was supposed to feel sorry for him and think I was missing out on something? So I called and he answered right away. He said hadn't had time to check email all day (this is the Internet salesman!) I said please don't waste my time, if you have the truck at that price I'll head your way. Yes we have it come right now he said. I get there with a friend (who will also be in the market for a vehicle soon) and he is too busy to meet with me so I get another guy. Nice guy and the truck was ready for a test drive when I arrived. He wanted to check my trade in which takes about an hour and it's a ridiculous offer. Then he quickly gives me a monthly payment amount. So I said I'll just buy the truck and sell my old one myself. He said I did not qualify for the discount price. I said why not and he flashed a piece of paper at me and told me I was on the ""do not call list."" At this point I thought he was joking so I said take me off and let's make a deal. He said we can't do that and offered me the same price as the first dealer. Then he kept talking about what a great price it was and how they needed to at least make a small profit. I asked once more if he would honor the website price which I showed him a printout. He said no. WOW!  I went back to the first dealer who told me from the start this would happen. Apparently they do it all the time. Thank you Beck and Maston for wasting 2 hours of my life that I can't get back. With all the regulation these days I can't believe this scam is legal.

I purchased a 2006 Corvette from them a few years back and was disappointed that they failed to honor their agreement to supply the car's solid targa top.  The previous owner still had it but my sales person Roger, assured me they would be getting it or give me one.  Unanswered calls to my sales person and the Pre Owned manager requesting an update only to finally reach the manager with the news they have no record of such an agreement.   The timing on this response was unbelievable as my sales person had left the dealership a few days prior.

He listened to what we wanted and delivered what we were looking for.  Their website is accurate, informative, and a time saver.  We did our research and knew which vehicle we wanted and the alternative just in case the primary had already been sold.  Robert showed us both vehicles and within a short amount of time we drove off in the vehicle we wanted.  We went in with a guaranteed loan that had an excellent interest rate, but they were able to beat it by half a percentage point.  The savings more than paid for the after-market add-on features we decided on purchasing.  Our return to install the after-market items was scheduled and performed as promised.  The quality of salesmanship, maintenance, and customer concern exemplified by all employees is to be commended and makes doing business with them a pleasure.

313,"January 21, 2014","For starters, The salesman barely spoke to me when I was in to look at a vehicle I had found online. I bought a Ford (not a buick/GMC) which is probably part of the reason I wasn't treated very well. The only reason I went through with the purchase (which I shouldn't have) Is because I was there for a specific vehicle. If i was just car shopping I wouldn't have stayed for longer then 10 minutes. 

When I got home with my new vehicle, I noticed the inspection was out and had been out since July (still out as I'm writing this). Looked at a CarFax report, the only two things I could find on the vehicle was the original purchase and the emmisions failure. In other words, they took the car in, failed it, then turned around and sold it. Keep in mind I did not purchase a warranty as for the Factory Warranty should be valid until 2015 (or 36K miles) (60K On the power train) although the aftermarket parts automatically voided my warranty.


Reason the car failed, the original owner had removed the Catalyc Converters (Typical in a sports car). They took care of the car and provided me with a loaner (the only good thing I got from them) and told me to drive for a few hundred miles and inspect it. So I did, failed again. Went through the process one more time and the car is still not passing. 

ALL THEY CAN TELL ME IS ""Ehhh just drive it for a few hundred miles and i'll put a little bit of gas in it next time you bring it in"". 
And i gave them a good trade in (low mile V6 mustang with aftermarket stereo, no dents/dings mint condition interior) and my car was filthy after they ""Detailed"" it. 

I would NOT recommend buying a car from this dealer. At least NOT the Pre-Owned section anyways.

Saturday morning my husband and I met up quickly at a credit union to open the acct.

326,"August 17, 2013","I can't say enough good things about the service department at Beck and Masten.  I called Jaime Ward looking for someone to help me since the dealership close to me did not want to help me.  I have a 2009 Acadia that was acting up really bad and knew something was seriously wrong but the dealership closest to me did not want to investigate the real problem since I did not have a ""check engine light"" that came on.  They had told me to ""just drive it until the check engine light comes on"" and then we can help you.  When I spoke to Jaime he was more than willing to help me and provide me with a loaner car while my car was being evaluated and worked on.  The service team gladly took my car in, got it to act up and called me to let me know what the problems were.  I had to have 3 coils replaced in addition to the main computer of my car.  They quickly ordered the parts and took car of all the problems.  The service manager Manny Escalon was so nice and made it a point to make sure I was being taken care of, the loaner car was adequate and that I was getting the service I expected.  I just could not get over how professional things were handled and how well they treated their customers.  Even though this dealership is much further away from my home, I will definitely be giving them all my business since they willing to make sure their customers are well taken care of and provide excellent service.  Thank you again to Jaime Ward for all your help.  You and your team are awesome.",5.0

We took the Tahoe home and started to notice some issues with the car and wanted to trade it back in because my wife and I usually keep our cars for 6-7 years and we didn't want a bad one.  Josh took good care of us and let us trade the car back in for what we paid for it and found us another one that we were very pleased with.... Very good customer service!!!!

When we next talked to Robert, we gave him the list of what we wanted and he proceeded to find it. While in limbo, he loaned us vehicles and kept in touch about the one they were having delivered. When we received our new Acadia, we went through an orientation session with Robert that was nothing short of amazing. This man knows his vehicles and he cares about his customers.

334,"February 13, 2013","Everything was great until the door handle broke off; Rosie Hernandez has great customer service at the repairs desk.  My wife had extended warranty so no problem. she paid the deductible and left the torrent for the repair. Soon after she got it back, I went to look at the door handle and notice the terrible paint job. The paint looked like it was just dripping off the door handle.  Clearly the handle was over sprayed and allowed to ooze and dry. No quality control at all. I told her to take it back , this is not what we expected from a dealership.  It took her like a couple of months but she finally took it back. They took a look at the paint and said ok. I just wanted an original GM handle, with a quality paint job to match the vehicles.   Her extended warrant was about to expire in two months, so I asked if the handle itself would have any coverage after the warranty expires. The answer I got was it would have a year of coverage.   Eight months go by since we got it back and the handle breaks off again. We contacted Beck n Masten only to hear it would not be covered. The coverage started when it first broke not when we took it back about the paint. They told us we could however contact the company who painted the part.  Beck n Masten dealership doesn’t paint the parts?????  Why are we taking it to the dealership, if they just hand the paint job over to high tech auto sound or collision or whatever ….  If I wanted some cheap paint job, I’d just can spray it.  So much for dealership quality. We didn’t even bother to try and see if they would do any good on their work. I’m not even sure it was a GM part anymore, why would they go through the trouble of removing the paint, priming and repainting.  It is more cost efficient for them to just get some cheap aftermarket part and just paint it. I know what you’re thinking; we must be tough on the torrent.  she is the first owner of an 07 with only 60,000 miles on it. Like really. And I didn’t know her at the time of purchase, but don’t even get me started on the interest rate she got from them. They saw her coming to say the least, it is outrageously high. ",2.6
335,"January 21, 2013","My husband and I decided (April 2012) it was time to unload our gas guzzling Yukon Denali; we visited Beck and Masten and had the MOST amazing car selling/buying experience with Robert Pfister. Within an hour, Robert offered us a great trade in, listened to what I wanted in a car, and had me in a brand new Buick Verano! I appreciated his willingness to work with us; he was never pushy, but very knowledgeable and most importantly - he CARED that we drove away pleased with our new car.
We were so pleased in fact, that we sent our son to Robert recently, to purchase a truck. Again, Robert made what sometimes is a grueling experience (shop, trade, finance, etc.) a very good one - and our son drove off in his first financed vehicle,  very happy!
I have recommended Robert Pfister at Beck & Masten to many of my friends, and next time we are in the market to buy, we will go right back to Robert.

342,"August 02, 2012","It seemed like one thing after another kept going wrong.  For instance they filled the truck up before we left and didn't put gas cap back on and then when I had to drive all the way there and say it was missing they had none in stock and I was pushed from one department to another. Also, the x- radio was never set up and we are still not using it because never set up.  Then we were told a card would come in the mail to do the review and fill it out bring it back for full tank of gas we have waited and waited then when we went to dealership they said you have to do online wow!!!  Then my husbands name was spelled wrong on all paperwork and we were told to call title office they said no call dealership crazy!!!  Our windshield wipes were broke brand new truck!!

343,"May 18, 2012","I just came from purchase at Beck & Masten South Gulf Freeway. It was a fantastic experience since the first email I got from Ricardo Garza. That day I have stopped at other Buick dealer that gave a much higher price and no incentives and good treated at all.
I sent an email to Beck and Masten and by that Saturday night I have already a confirmation that somebody from their sales staff would contact me on Monday, which happened indeed. I received an email from Ricardo Garza, asking me what were the car type and trim I was interested in. He never asked me for my phone number. Later the same day I had the first suggestion from him and the price was very attractive for the Verano Convenience trim that I decided to ask for the superior leather trim.
The next day I had a second offer from Ricardo with a car matching exactly my specifications. So, we arranged for Friday for me to stop by.
I took my corolla for them to appraise and the offer was fair. On top of that they still strove to give me a better rate than the market on the financing. 
In less than 2 hours I was driving my brand new Buick Verano back home (in Katy). So, it's worth driving there even if you live far way.

348,"March 22, 2012","I brought my car in for a recall, my wait was from 2:45 p.m. - 5:45 p.m., but I didn't mind the wait because everyone was very professional, caring and kind.  Even Mr. Beck stopped by the waiting area to see if we (the customers) had been helped and were alright. Although we weren't formally introduced, I knew it was him, because he was dressed different from the other employees and his demeanor was that of a Boss. It is very rare that you attend a business and the Owner will stop his/her busy schedule and come by the waiting room to say hello.  This make customers feel more comfortable. This dealership, has got several additives to make you feel at home, i.e., fresh coffee,water (ice cold in individual bottles) and fresh baked cookies. There was nother time that I was there and they had customer appreciation with Bar-B-Que and sides to go with it and as the customers entered into the dealership, they were told to go to the conference room and help themselves.  I been to other appreciation benefits and by the time the employees finished, there was nothing for the customers. There has only been one other car dealer that I've visited in pass years, that I had this much confidence in and it is gone out of business. There is another dealership down the way from B&M, but it doesn't come close to the personable and professional feeling you receive from B&M. My only 2 suggestions are (1) consider placing seat covers in the restrooms and a trash can near the door for soild paper towels.  Some people do not like to open the door with just washed hands, it defeats the purpose.

There simply are not enough glowing adjectives to fully describe how the folks there made me feel. I must make special note of my salesman and dealership fleet manager, Thaddeus Cartwright. Thaddeus is the exception to every rule society believes about car salesman. Honesty, integrity, impeccable manners are among the many things that come to mind. I had a speech planned to deliver in my strategy to get the best price. Not necessary with Thaddeus. He IS going to give customers the best price he can. Every, single time. Even after the deal was done, he took the time to sit with me to teach me some of the amazing things my new Regal does. I never felt rushed. I never felt like I needed to let him get back to his day. I felt like the one and only customer of his day. I have already referred several friends to Thaddeus and Beck & Masten and I will continue to do so as often as I am able.",5.0
