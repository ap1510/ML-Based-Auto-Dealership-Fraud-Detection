1,"April 01, 2020",This is the most dishonest business I have ever visited.  They have hidden fees and advertise vehicles that are not available . I drove two hours to find out the vehicle was unavailable.,1.0

3,"February 07, 2020","Very friendly, I entered the main building and was looking for pre own vehicle. Instead of sending me off with a direction to go, the gentleman that greeted us escorted us to the proper building. 
There we met Chris who would handle our business.
I had been shopping pickup trucks online and was finding the best deals went super fast, so fast that Mac Haik had a truck in my price range with no pics so I took the gamble it wasn't beat up and went in search. The truck was still very new to Mac Haik so some comedy happen(which is always fun unless you don't like comedy) Chris attempted to show us some other makes but I didn't have the heart to tell her Ford or nothing, even at a dodge dealership. So the comedy continued and the mildest of a sense of no got us out of test driving any of those other models. 
So we took a day and recieved a call from Chris that the truck I was interested in was ready for a test drive. Now I saw the truck the first day and on test drive day the truck was even better looking then first sight(repaired a scratch on bumper I noticed on day one not there next time) 
The truck was exactly what I needed. Price was near our max available but Chris worked some unicorn magic(inside joke)and got it with a acceptable price that didn't hurt(too bad) I got the service and appreciation of beyond 5 stars. I know that they went above and beyond to make sure my as-is buy was the absolute best it could be before handing it over. Thank you Chris you rock!

5,"December 28, 2019","Brian R. went the extra customer service mile on a recent visit to Mac Haik service department.  I was having difficulty trying to download a software update received from FCA for my Uconnect system.  The update was necessary to bring my Ram 1500 GPS software current and to ensure the proper function of my navigation system.  After trying to do the download myself, I drove out to the Mac Haik Dealership for help. The minute I drove in to the service department line, Brian came out to greet me and ask what he could do to help me. I told him of the problem I was having, and after asking if it was okay, he came around and joined me in the cab.  It didn't take him more than a couple of minutes to discover that I was plugging the USB update stick in to the USB charging port. He reinserted the stick in to the proper USB port, located in the arm rest, and the download began.  He told me what to expect to see from the screen during the download and about how long it would take.  I thanked him and headed home.  By the time I got home the update had successfully downloaded!  I now have a current GPS navigation system thanks to Brian's help. Another thing worth mentioning is that this was late Friday afternoon right after Christmas!",5.0

8,"July 05, 2019","Spoke to Mark Martinez about buying a new “WHITE”Jeep Sahara JLU. Spoke to Mark via phone call to make sure the Jeep was still on the lot, he assured me it was still available for sale. Mark emailed me info on three jeeps so I can have a idea what options and pricing where available in that model. Got him the info he needed to get a estimate on my trade in all was going well. I made an appointment to drive up 240 miles to make a deal on 4th if July. Mark text me with an appointment reminder for the 4th of July with there operating our 9am-8pm on the 2nd. I make the drive 240miles show up to the dealer and text Mark “ just pulled in to the dealer”. Walk in trough the front doors and get greeted by Keith not Mark, Keith tells me Mark wants me to take care of you today. I knew something was up from that moment. Keith tells me he is going to pull the Jeep up to the front so we can go for a test drive and so my trade In gets looked at. I wait by the Front of the dealer and I see Keith drive up in a. BLACK Jeep JLU Not a white one. He gives me a BS story that the Jeep was not as advertised someone dropped the ball, it was black all along not white. Always blaming someone else for there mistakes, Stay away from Mac Haik dealers  they reel you in with lies, hide and hope someone else will sell you something while you are already there. What a bunch of Cowered no integrity what so ever. ",1.0

11,"November 08, 2018","I bought a Ram truck from here and the buying process was brutal. I came fully funded and it still took hours to finalize a sale that I did not haggle with. I couldn't wait to get out of there. To make things worse on my way home with the truck I just purchased I noticed that the alignment was badly off. This was not the case during the test drive. I pulled over and saw that the back end of the truck had been damaged and the tail pipes were even crooked. This was not the case before Mak Haik took the truck to be detailed after I agreed to buy. I took it back to the dealer and showed them the damage. Their response was ""how do we know you didn't do that"". I was gone no more than 5 minutes! Thanks Mac! I will always advocate that no one buy from you! ",1.0
12,"September 02, 2018","I bought a like new vehicle from the used car lot, I asked them to give me time the salesman continuously called me, nonstop. I had to ask his manager to get him to stop. They made promises to me like free oil changes, never received any.Free Sirius for a year, didn’t happen. They told me when I picked up the car that it would be with a fresh oil change and the oil change was already to half way point, I pointed it out to my salesman and he said the oil didn’t need changing. I was told that my trade in would cover the down payment, then suddenly, it wouldn’t. I will never buy from these people again, and Reid the financial officer is a liar!!",1.0
13,"June 16, 2018","I have a bad experience with Mark sale man at Used Car Dealership. He said he will make sure the problem with my tire pressure light on will be fixed when I come back on the other day because Auto shop closed when I bought the car. I told I will wait for license plate ready to pick up I will come back to check light on if It still occur. Time is coming license plate ready for pick up, i contact him to let him know I want make sure to fix the light on problem. he refused the repair service just check it. What is that mean if just check it. I told him the problem just there on that day I bought it, not something new. He knew it then told me come back another day to fix.. Now he don't want responsible for what he said. He blamed to me that car sold for 3 weeks, but I told him that I will come back to check for warning light on when license plate ready. What happen after 3 weeks if the problem already there at the day sold? Whoever want buy a car with warning light on if he hasn't promise to fix that warning light on? I just trust the sale man service at big dealership, nut no more for this dealership. The sale man trick me with a word, he told me that he said make sure to check it not fix it. If just check it why I want to buy a car with warning light on, don't you?Use English to trick me as I'm not a native English speaker? There are millions people in this State  that are immigrants, I served in US Army for my great country.
Give me a unsatisfied and disappoint about sale man service, lied to customer after car sold. That is negative feedback for dealership service.
If anyone want take a risk is welcome give a try. Anything can happen in your case, managers will protect their staff for what ever you say to them. 
There are hundreds of dealership out there, so why we want to risk in  problems. Dealership don't care about customer after vehicles sold.
Thanks for reading my comments. ",1.4
14,"May 10, 2018","Visited dealership and left with a Buyers Order reflecting the agreed price.  Was told they would honor the pricing for 24 hours allowing me to compare finance rates at my credit union.  

12 hours later received phone call from Ben Stapleton - Mgr. stating he made a ""grave miscalculation""  that they will not honor the pricing.  

The ownership the dealership took on their mistake was dismal .  The way they cast off customer service was very disappointing.  In the end it speaks volumes for the character of the managers and this directly reflects to the dealer principles.  

I hope that you take the time and find a dealership that is truly Customer Focused and accepts responsibility for their words and actions.   As they hold us a customers responsible for that.    ",1.6
15,"January 30, 2018",Called for the cost of labor on a Egr valve replacement. Was given a price for repair. Made the appointment.  Price was nearly twice as much and valve was four times the cost of the same egr valve at the local auto parts stores. (Checked four different ones) fyi: ask for price before you sign anything. Be ready to hold on to your pants😫If you dont have the work done it will cost you a bill (100)  if you have signed for the assessment.  Was going to give up the bill because I was told they didn't or wouldn't have the part for a day or so. Called the next morning and was told it was being worked on already. They had found the part and begun the work. Was not given a call on the sudden change. Not and never again will I use them for anything!!!!  ,1.4

18,"December 06, 2017","Do Not buy a used car from Mac Hait Jeep/Chrysler in Georgetown TX. They ""Lie"" and ""Con"" you. I bought a 2010 Honda Accord for my Son, We were promised it was a great car and ""Certified"" by their mechanics! LMAO ! Very next morning when cold starting, it made a brief really loud engine clacking noise.  Took it to them and said, ""Sold as Is"" Took it to a Honda Repair dealer and it had a bad VTR on the cam shaft, cost $700 to fix it. They don't stand behind their work, nor honor and I will never buy anything new or used from them ever again. It only made the noise when first start up cold, so I know they made it nice and warm for test drives and my personal mechanic when he inspected it. All the window seals on all four windows were deteriorated and cause water to leak in side the door panels, the cost me another $321. Joke of a Dealer!",1.0
19,"August 31, 2017","Don't expect a used vehicle to be clean from here, after signing & asking twice they finally agreed to throw in a detail which consisted of a drive thru wash that broke off the antenna leaving the bottom stuck in the base. Instead of offering to fix their screw up, they gave us one from a different vehicle on the lot which does us absolutely no good since part of the old one is still in there!!! Then my husband notices one of the clamps is missing from the battery, our salesman Joe says, ""that's a driving hazard"" and to no surprise will they fix it or offer to take it to their service dept!! This place is worthless, they don't care about their customers or the families they're putting into these vehicles that are unsafe, not to mention he knew almost nothing about the truck & its functions. The only pleasant person that seemed to give a xxxx was the finance guy at the new lot. I was involved in the car business for many years, at one point owning a used car lot & I should've known better....Don't ignore these reviews!! Take your business elsewhere or you'll have nothing but regrets, a vehicle with an outrageous monthly payment, & be responsible for the repairs to their damages before you even drive it off the lot.

26,"December 06, 2016","OUR ANSWER DIRECTLY FROM THE DEALERSHIP ON A SECOND SET OF KEYS ($200+ TO REPLACE) THAT THEY ASSURED US THEY HAD AND 4 WEEKS LATER AND MULTIPLE UN RETURNED CALLS...........THIS!
Mr Summers, I understand that you want a second key, however I did not promise to give you one, I promised to look for the second key, I spent a few hours looking for that second key and could not find it. I understand my store may have misplaced that key or it could have been shipped without the second key. However I can get you a second key for what it costs my department to get one made. So if my locksmith is 200 bucks for me then I can charge you for that key. I sold you the vehicle on a huge discount so there was not money left to make a key it was sold that cheap because the store was chasing a volume goal. I can not pay for this key out of pocket and the store will not pay for it either. Im sorry for this giving you a feeling of mistrust with Mac Haik Dodge and would like to help by at least getting it done at what it costs us instead of what service charges customers.

29,"May 02, 2016","DO NOT BUY FROM HERE!  

I found a used, one owner SUV on their lot.  Spoke with Brian G. after he responded to my inquiry.  Over a couple of days we emialed, text, and spoke on the phone.  He told me how he personally looked over the car and it looked new as the previous owner must of taken very good care of it.  I informed 2 days prior to my arrival, for me to look at the car.  

I get there, the car is pulled to the front, however the first thing I see is the huge scratch down the passenger side of the car.  Brian G. insists it can be covered with touch up paint.  Not only am I extremely disturbed by his reaction, but what part of ""like new"" is this scratch.  He insisted it showed up in the pictures online, as well as his ""boss"" when he arrived later.  And once you saw the car in person and knew what you were looking at, that scratch did show in the pictures, but if you had previous knowledge before making a near 3 hour drive, I would of not been there to begin with.  Furthermore, the car only had a generic valet key, to which the make and trim level was most definetly sold with 2 keyless entry remote/key combinations.  I would know, as I have a car the same year and make as this one.  To which Brian G. tells me are not a true necessity and while that may be true in reality, does not reign true when I'm purchasing a new car.  I also checked back at the internet listing and sure enough ""Keyless Entry"" was listed.  Sure its available after you take the car bake to the Honda shop and pay $250 or more for them to make and program a new one!!!!

The interior was also dirty, as in not only did they not bother to vacuum the car out, but the back seats and the cloth arm rests in the front were thoroughly soiled!  To which the ""boss"" replies that he could have it cleaned while I wait.  Ummm, I had driven 3 hours and no intentions on ""waiting"" for anything.  Thats why I knew what I was paying and had the funds ready to go.  I was simply to take delievery of this ""one owner, like new suv"" that did not exist on their lot!",1.0
30,"April 06, 2016","If I could give a negative review I would. I was informed that I had a recall on something on my car so I called to make an appointment 2 weeks ago. I was told it would take the day to fix it . I informed them of my work hours, Robert said there was a shuttle to get me to and from work. Cool. so I set my appointment time for 720 am. got there and dropped the car off. I was told to sit in the waiting area to wait for the shuttle. at 8am someone came and asked who was waiting for the shuttle, we all went to the van and got in. The driver asked where we were all going. I was the only one going somewhere other than Georgetown, So i was informed that I would be dropped off last. I got to work 45 minutes late...I asked the driver if he would be the one picking me up @ 5:25pm? he said ""oh no we don't shuttle that late"" and that I needed to call my service advisor . I called him and he proceeded to tell me that the latest I could be picked up was 4pm.  I informed him of our conversation 2 weeks ago when I had told him of my work hours and he stated that I never said anything about my hours and if I had he would have told me that the shuttle didn't run that late. I was like you have to be kidding me!! I got off the phone and called to speak to the manager of service. 3 hrs later got a call from Brian who had Robert in his office with me on speaker. I proceeded to explain the issue, and Robert said - I've worked here for 9 years, I would never tell you that, I said "" well you did, had you told me this before hand I might have been able to make arrangements but now I'm stuck."" Brian then told me "" ma'am the shuttle is a courtesy and the latest  we could get you is 4pm."".  And all I could think was - I wonder if their boss would be OK with them coming in late to work then leaving an hour and a half early!! Probably not! but thats what they are thinking will fly with my job!?!   then he said -  you can get a taxi or uber..I told them this was deplorable customer service and then they sat there saying nothing , complete silence.. i was like. ok. thanks for the call!!  So I called the Mac Haik corporate office in Houston and was told I needed to speak to Terry Fields, I called Him and was informed that he was out but the woman , Caroll , who answered the phone gave me the name of the GM at the dealership , Eric, and stated she was emailing him to let him know that I would be calling him. I called him and left a voice mail, He called me back about 30 minutes later, I explained to him how everything went down , how I was basically called a liar and told there was nothing they could do or were willing to do for that matter, he apologized and said they were human and they make mistakes but that's not the way they conduct business. He will speak to them about it and they can learn from it and he hopes that they will be able to have my business in the future...

32,"June 04, 2015","I called and spoke to Dion (The Liar) about a 4runner I wanted to buy. I asked whether it was still available. I did not want to drag my family several towns over if there was no way to look at it. He said ""I know for a fact it is because it was just finished being detailed and were not able to show it to others while it was being worked on."" We drove to the site and asked to look at it. He looked around and dragged us to another lot finally giving up and saying ""it is locked in this building"". I told him I was unhappy, and the whole reason I called ahead was to avoid this type of situation. This I find discourteous and unprofessional but still made a point to wake up early the next day (I work nights) upon opening and here is where it gets really bad.. I arrived and spoke to another salesperson. He also said it was available and went to go retrieve it. I noticed he grabbed Dion the liar on the way out of the building and they disappeared for a while. When they got back they said they would have to find out if it was ready to be showed (this was why I had called in the first place). I was standing outside and Dion the liar came swaggering out the door saying ""I told you"" to which I cut him off and said I prefer not to work with you after you lied to me. He puffed up and got in my face and said it was my fault for not calling him back (I called once, I should not have to call back and say i am leaving now). I tried to tell him why what he did was rude and disrespectful, but instead of listening he puffed up more and acted like he was going to hit me, so I said I am done talking to you, I need to the speak with a manager. After some waiting, the ""manager"" came over and did not even want to hear what happened. He did not even let me speak before saying ""we do not want to sell you a car"". I was very taken aback. I had never been treated so rudely before and could not beleive what was happening. I can only guess that Dion once again lied, this time about what I wanted to discuss with management. I drove my car across the street to the main 'new car' dealership and asked to speak with a manager there. I explained the situation and told him I could not believe the way I was being treated. I never once lost my cool or was disrespectful to the staff. He asked me to wait in the waiting area for a minute while he made some calls.. When he called me back over, he said ""the 4runner was never available.""

Please take my warning seriously and avoid these guy's like the plague. If they seem nice and courteous they are probably lying their xxxxx off in order to take advantage of you in some way. They are discourteous liars and probably thieves too.

As of this moment I would say stay clear of this dealership. Reason being management has no issue with lying to you while looking you in the eye. Keith, a sales manager, presented with a fairly straightforward question was unable to find it in himself to be honest. When repeatedly asked who the General Manager of the dealership was (I already knew it wasnt him) he repeatedly claimed that it was himself. This conversation was recorded. I have since left him a VM giving him the chance to prove that he and is dealership can indeed be trusted. We shall see what he chooses to do. In the event that he conts down the path of zero customer service and lying to his customers, I will then post the a detailed account of my shopping experience. FYI the real General Manager's first name is Scott.

Also as of right now stay clear of Don Phillips. Sales man with no back bone or integrity. When told his text messages would be made public...proving just what kind of customer service he offers...this is his response ""I have check in to this and have the legal right to not give you permission to post my personal info and text on social media. So I am using that right to say do not post my personal info and text on social media."" Whatcha got to hide Don? First off Don, you dont have a right to tell me not to post it. You were texting in the capacity of conducting businesses. Not protected unless stated at the onset of our communication. Check your facts. Again...if in the end neither Keith nor Don decide to put the customer first and start being honest. I will then post a very detailed outline of what these two have put me and my credit through. Time will tell what kind of men they are.",1.0

35,"September 30, 2012",My husband and I were looking for a truck to pull a fifth wheel with. We did our research on trucks and knew a Dodge was right for us.  We found great inventory with Mac Haik Georgetown and went in for a test drive. We worked with James White and he was immediately friendly and helpful.  He answered all of our questions and was very knowledgeable of the 3500.  We also had help from Jose Martinez who was willing to work with us and ended up making us a great deal.  Everything ran really smoothly and everyone from the finance dept (who were great!) to the front desk were attentive and overall really welcoming.

The negotiation process was smooth, thanks to General Sales Manager Chris Carstens. The finance piece was excellent as well thanks to Pierce Brown.  I recommend buying from this dealership!! I strongly recommend you ask for Matt. Be surprised to meet a very polite, courteous young man who is eager to help! ",5.0
37,"August 22, 2012","This was the worst experience of my life. Not only did that hugely inflate my parent to throw in extras I stated I was not interested in, they tried to force me to sign. They literally would not return my car keys until I made a deal. 2 weeks after walking out on them, I found out they had sent my credit to 8 banks and created 8 new inquiries. This dropped my score 40 points! They were doing this still 2 weeks after I told them I was not buying. And when asked if there would be multiple inquiries, they bold face lied to me and said it would only be one initial credit pull and no more. They have basically ruined my credit, tried to force me to sign at a payment I can't afford, and when they realized I was no longer a sale they stopped returning phone calls. Even when I called to ask why they are still pulling my credit. They are scam artists and cheats. Oh smd their prices are massively inflated anyways. They will say they no longer have a less expensive vwhicle so they can throw you into a model 5k more expensive. Then you look on the lot and the less expensive model is there. NEVER EVER GO HERE!!!

I had been looking around for a 2012 challenger for a while and had found one in the paper at Mac Haik. When I got there it was no longer there(I know dealers only have one listed in the paper at the sales price and when its gone its gone. No big deal I get). So I was talking to the sales person about what I was wanting and at what price I need to be at. He told me that there was nothing on the lot that they could do at that price (still not big deal). I gave him my info and told him to call me if something came along. So about a week later I get a call that they have a car in at my price, unfortunately I was not able to come in due to being out of town.  2 weeks after that I get another call that they still have the car at my price and his sales manager is looking to move some cars this weekend (normal car salesmen speech). So I call and set up a time to come in. so I get there take and take the car out, get in it and the seatbelt doesn’t work nor does the entry button (stuff they can fix but still). After that we sat down to start the paper work, he hands me a piece of paper with the price and its over $4000 more than what we had agreed on (the only reason I had come in) also higher than the price listed online. I tell him that is not the price we talked about; he says “oh what price did I tell you again”. Goes and comes back with his sales manager, to tell me that there is no way that they can do that, so if I wanted the car I would have to pay more. Save yourself some time and don’t go to Mac Haik.

39,"October 14, 2011","I didn't buy a car here, but I will when I get ready to make my decision.  I told them up front that I wasn't buying a car that day, and they treated me just as well if not better than if I had a check in my hand.  I was looking at the new Jeep Grand Cherokee and my sales person, Kayla, seemed to know just about everything there was to know about them.  I was rather impressed.  She was like a talking brochure and very nice.  On my way out the manager, Mike (?), introduced himself and asked if I had gotten all of the information I needed to help me make a decision later on.  I thought that was pretty cool.  He didn't try to hard sell me anything, which I appreciated.  He asked me at the end if I had a good shopping experience to share it with the 'internet community', which I thought was neat.  I've never been much of a product or service reviewer, but since they were so nice to me, I thought I could at least write this, even though I didn't buy anything.  I will definitely be back :)",5.0
40,"June 21, 2011","Finalizing the paper work for the car went horribly wrong when i noticed the mileage on the car was not what the sales person told me. An extra 1000 miles was on the car. I was not happy and at the end of a long day at the dealership- did they really expect me to accept this? Wondering if i should sign my papers the sales lady said that she would throw in 4 free oil changes. Reluctantly and still not happy i signed the paperwork. Yes about 8pm i finally got to go home with my car. Now 2yrs later i am still mad about the whole situation since i have gone into the dealership to receive my oil changes and every time they say that i do not have credit for them. I am so angry and feel like they ripped me off again. They told me i had and expiration on the oil changes.This is not true because i was not told this at the signing of the papers. Plus, the free oil changes was a -promise- from them for lying  to me on the mileage and it was hand written into my contract.
I will never buy a car from them again. Next time I am taking my contract in to them. Now the third time -really just give me what you promised to me.I bought your car. Guess since i signed the papers and drove off the lot they do not care about keeping there word. 
The sales and repair shop guys have told me different stories every time. I do not believe it is their fault-they are always nice to me.It is the company i am mad at. Not sure what to do now. except -to tell everyone not to buy from them.",3.2
