The service department is clean and comfortable with coffee and snack for the customers enjoyment. The restrooms are clean as well. They even offer a dog park if you cannot leave your pet at home. Awesome ,5.0
1,"May 25, 2020","Buying a car here was very easy and hassle free. The sales man Floyd was very nice, he was not pushy and wanted to make sure I got everything I was looking for. It didn’t matter if I wanted to see a car again or wanted to test drive another vehicle, he made sure I was getting the perfect vehicle for me.",5.0
2,"May 14, 2020","We acquired 2 vehicles from here, 1 was a lease and 1 was purchased. They are more than cordial when it comes to money coming into their facility. Their service department lacks the same continuity. Dropped of our vehicle and was told it would be 4 hours. After over 6 hours I texted the number they gave me with no response. Figuring they may be busy i gave them another hour before I called in which time I was told it was ready and they just got the paperwork. We drove 25 minutes to the dealer and then proceeded to wait another hour because the vehicle wasn't ready and then they surprised us telling us it was 1000 dollars. They're shady business practices of doubling a price is morally reprehensible. In addition they didn't even put a hitch on the vehicle which we only found out after payment. We have never had this type of experience when service was located at north park Lincoln. We love our Subaru but this experience makes us want to leave the platform. Our business will now being going to Gillman Subaru for our service.",1.0
3,"April 24, 2020","Recently had my Subaru serviced which they completed professionally and timely and included a complementary wash and vac.  What I particularly appreciated during these Covid-19 times was that an employee was actively keeping the waiting area disinfected plus all employees we're adhering to the CDC recommendations to keep themselves and their customers safe.   North Park Subaru has always been a clean and professional place that I felt comfortable doing business with, and during this Covid-19 pandemic I still do.",5.0
4,"April 21, 2020",I wouldn't trust them. I did a test drive with them and they offered me $50 for it. Never received it.  Staff who said they were working on it wont email me back.,1.0
5,"March 26, 2020","Bob Marroquin (Former Air Force Chief)is the best salesman I have ever met. Consummate professional who respects your time and will do whatever it takes to make car buying pleasant and easy. 

The finance area needs some improvement as they did not pay attention to detail and made some mistakes on the paper work. 

Overall, this dealership is the only place to search for and purchase a Subaru! ",5.0
6,"February 13, 2020","Michael Salazar is the best. I am demanding because I need certain options for what I do, and he found me the perfect car that would tow 5000 pounds and fit dog kennels in back with a flat cargo area. He is informative as well as fun, which for me is the perfect combination. Ask for him if this is the experience you want. ",5.0
7,"February 12, 2020","The new Subaru location is very nice.  Convenient and easy to find.  It is well designed, although I think they may eventually find their very nice covered service area drop-off lanes area will be too small.  Arriving and dropping off the car was effortless and painless.  Inside there are two excellent waiting areas available.  The front one is smaller, offers coffee & TV, and is adjacent to the sales floor.  The back one is larger, has a TV, a child's play area, coffee and snacks available, and an upstairs area with a glassed wall overlooking the ridiculously spotlessly clean, environment controlled maintenance garage where one can sit  & use the bird's eye view to watch the mechanic work on your car.  What a place to work!  The employee reps were polite and communicative and kept me apprised of how much longer my wait would be.  The service was excellent.  This is a much better solution for Subaru owners than being appended to the very busy Lincoln dealership down the street.  While there, test drove a Legacy.  Very impressive!  Especially like the auto start-stop & Eyesight technology!",4.8
8,"January 27, 2020","When I bought the car, the salesman talked about some of the features, but he made a point of not overloading me with information that day. After about 10 days, I was contacted to schedule an appointment with a technology specialist. By that time, I had read through all the ""Quick Start"" guides but still had questions. At the conclusion of the appointment, I was urged to contact NP Subaru with additional questions as they come up. I appreciate the fact that North Park Subaru reached out to me to schedule a time with their technology specialist. There is so much technology that I wouldn't find on my own, but their specialist carefully walked me through it. I do still have questions, and I will take advantage of their willingness to teach me how to take full advantage of the features of my new car.",5.0
9,"January 20, 2020","I can’t say enough good things about North Park Subaru. From the sales staff, to the GM, to the finance group, to the service department. Everyone was outstanding and gave a 5 star service experience. If you want a Subaru, this is the place to go.",5.0

Brian Simpson was the Finance Manager. 
We were thankful to be in and out with good service. ",5.0
11,"October 28, 2019","I have bought new vehicles in the pass, in fact my first new car was a 1980 Subaru GLF 1800.  There was a salesman there named ""Shorty"" he has always stuck in my mind as an outstanding sales person.  However a new name comes to light.  His name is ""TIM KELLEY"", you will find him at ""North Park Subaru located on San Pedro.  He is willing to go the extra mile and very knowledgeable with the vehicles he is selling.  Now for the best part; he does not stop after the sell.  He will continue to help you after the sale.  I would have to give him a A+ in my books of ""Sales Person"".  ",4.8
12,"October 01, 2019","As pain free as a vehicle purchase can be! This was our second purchase from North Park Subaru and the excellent customer service is why we returned and will return again and again! Our salesman, Keith, was very patient and concerned about making sure we found exactly what we were looking for and kept our budget in mind. Very pleased with our experience!",5.0
13,"September 10, 2019","I never wrote a review, but even after months, I am still disgusted. Be absolutely sure that if you ask them to check ""warranty status"", that you follow up. When I took my Subaru in for a recall on the airbag, I was told I had an oil leak, of course I wanted it checked out. I had been there before with service for 60K, and had no issues. So I allowed them to work on it. It was the main seal and head gasket leaking, major work! I asked them to check my warranty, but nothing was said. So I spent $3800,  that at the time caused me a major financial hardship. The next year I had another issue and it was diagnosed as the ""valve body"" for $1600. Now this Forester only had 80K on it, not what a Subaru should be going through.  That was replaced, but I had to take it back as it did not fix the problem, then I was told it was the transmission,

After complaining online to Subaru of North America, they told me that the initial $3800 of work for the main seal and head gasket should have been covered, and I was sent a check from Subaru of North America.   I did not fix the transmission, I do not even believe that the ""valve body"" repair was the issue now. The service manager NEVER contacted me, I tried to call him and email him. No apology, nothing. The only conversation was through the service guy at the time.

I traded my Subaru in for a ford, and will NEVER recommend this dealership to anyone, rather STAY AWAY.

The worst experience I have ever had. But I am thankful that I complained enough to Subaru of North America to get someone out of the chaos.

14,"September 01, 2019",Your service adviser Trey L is the best example of how a company should handle their customers.  He is the reason we continue to buy Subrau's.  To me its about the service after purchase.  All sales people can explain the car and qualities it has but the service adviser is the one you have face to face with after purchase.  That is critical to maintain image and serviceable products regardless of the product.  Thank you Trey and service team,5.0
15,"August 27, 2019",I went to North Park Subaru to take a look at the Legacy. I ended up purchasing it. The sales man and staff were very courteous and patient and made my car buying experience fast and easy. I would definitely buy a car from them again.,5.0
16,"August 07, 2019","When an appointment for new tires wasn't available on the day I requested, Trey, my service representative, suggested that I bring the car in and he would work the service in that day whenever possible.  This was very gracious of him, and it put my mind at ease when I took a long road trip the next day..",5.0
17,"July 30, 2019","I have bought my share of new vehicles in the past and my experience with NP Subaru has been the best.  I am giving my experience a 5 star rating because of Allen Hodapp,, my sales consultant.  He was very caring and attentive.  He made me feel very comfortable and never pressured.  He also made my experience fun and enjoyable.  Allen is very knowledgeable and really cares about the customers coming in to the dealership.   Allen made sure I got the vehicle I wanted.  I love my new Subaru Forester.   I highly recommend NP Subaru and Allen Hodapp.  I also want to say thank you to Brian Simpson for all his help.

18,"July 18, 2019",Generally I have been pleased with the dealership but today I tried to contact the service department about a billing charge.  I waited twenty minutes until I hung up with no response from a human.  If you are interested in doing business with them their service department leaves a lot to be desired.,3.2

22,"March 16, 2019","Again, I was very impressed with customer service at North Park Subaru. Bobby Bustamante helped us buy a beautiful 2019 Crosstrek. Bobby found the exact car I wanted from Houston with only one phone call to him. He had it shipped to the dealer the next day. This is my second Subaru from North Park. I will continue to buy from them!",5.0
23,"February 21, 2019","I purchased my 2018 Subaru Crosstrek in July, so it was time for my first 6 month warranty service. Unfortunately, a few days before my appointment I had to have emergency eye surgery. I had to call to reschedule for a time that my husband could take the car in without missing work. I was extremely pleased that the dealership was able to accommodate us on Saturday morning, otherwise it would have been a few weeks before we could make it. My husband said there was a bit of a wait but that everyone was friendly and that everything appeared to be done as required. ",5.0
24,"December 30, 2017",Paul Avalos went above my expectations. He reached out to me when my vehicle became available after someone else attempted to buy it and their deal fell through.

28,"September 10, 2016","Robert has been very helpful in explaining to my wife and me how to use the electronics in our new 2017 Subaru Forester. In addition to the preview when we picked up the car and the two-week follow-up visit at the dealership, Robert came to our house to diagnose the reason we could not get the garage door opener buttons on the rear view mirror to connect with our garage door opener mechanisms. He went on line with his cell phone to get instructions, called Overhead Door Company to find out more information. Then he found a device connected to one of the openers that appeared to be an auxiliary receiver. Having never seen such a setup before, he used his knowledge of door openers to try something with that receiver. It worked! He even reprogrammed the openers in my wife's Prius so that it too would work with the newly-reprogrammed mechanisms. Thanks, Robert. And thanks for mailing the can of chocolate chip cookies.",5.0

30,"January 27, 2016",My sales person was Rob Parr. I decided on the Subaru Forester. Rob is not a typical salesperson. He is extremely knowledgable and passionate about Subaru and that made the experience enjoyable. He was enthusiastic the whole time and I felt like he was concerned about mine and my families needs. I've already recommended this dealership to my friends and co-workers. When I got to finance Phil Larsen handled everything smooth and efficiently. He was very pleasant also. I definitely recommend this dealership. Go see Rob Parr.,5.0
31,"January 13, 2016","Derek Setser was the most professional, helpful, knowledgeable, courteous, enthusiastic and above all kindest salesman we have ever come across.  You cannot put a price tag on outstanding customer service.  Derek was one of the main reasons we decided on the Forester.  He was such a great person to deal with.  Derek went above and beyond to make our car experience a wonderful experience.  To top things off his Finance Mgr. Philip Larson Jr, completed our experience with the same exceptional professionalism and knowledge.  North Park Subaru on San Pedro, you are employing exceptional professionals from what I can see.

33,"January 02, 2016","Let me start by stating that I believe that all dealerships have the right on regulating who and who can not drive more expensive, performance vehicles. That being said... I have never been more talked down to or disrespected like I was by a dealer from North Park Subaru. My girlfriend and I drove from Del Rio, about 2 and a half hours away, to celebrate the New Year in San Antonio. I've been looking to purchase a new WRX and trade in my 2011 Ram 1500. North Park is the closest Subaru dealership and had a great selection of WRXs so I thought to have a look. I do have the ability to buy the car but I told the dealer I'm waiting about 3 months to save up to have a larger down payment. He then asked me my age, I told him I was 22 and he told me I was too young to test drive. I asked him what the age limit was on test driving the specific vehicle and he said he would go ask his boss about it. He then came back and told me maybe if I was 24 because at 22 I probably didn't have the ability to buy a $40000 dollar vehicle... This is where things started to head south in my opinion. I explained that I wasn't looking at the STI I was just looking at the WRX premium which is considerably cheaper at $30000 and being in the military I have a steady paycheck and it would not be a problem. He then and for the rest of the time I was there continued to call me ""kid"" and ""kids"" like me. He then preceded to raise his voice in a crowded lobby and say ""I can tell this has happened to you before because you have your argument all planned out"". At this point i'm ready to walk out before he very loudly says ""Lets go finish this in my office."" So I very reluctantly follow with my girlfriend to his office so he can continue to go on and tell me all the things I did wrong by walking in there today. He started off by saying I should have lied and said I was buying right then or next week, I explained to him I'm not going to be dishonest about it and he says ""well that's the way it works"". He then suggested if I bring a parent in they could say they were buying the car and let me drive it half way through the test drive... AGAIN I had to explain to him i'm not a child and I'm buying the car for myself. At this point i'm done with the whole situation so I shake his hand and leave. Like I said in the beginning I understand why dealerships allow certain test drives and not others. North Park actually had instances where two of the same car are damaged because of idiots that just happen to be younger in age. That being said I will not be talked down to and treated like a child, I don't care if I'm 18 years old or let alone a 22 year old with a steady job in the military, a newer truck with more than enough trade-in value, and good credit. This one experience makes it so much easier to take my business to another dealership and suggest other people buying a Subaru to go somewhere else if they want to be taken seriously.",1.0
34,"December 28, 2015","My salesman, Derek Setser was awesome!  He went out of his way to make my buying experience pleasant.  He was great with my 8 year old, and kept him entertained while I signed all the paperwork.  Phil the finance guy worked to get me a good deal and packages to protect my investment.  I highly recommend this dealership.",5.0

40,"October 06, 2014","Recently I purchased a beautiful sports car from North Park Subaru.  It was as simple as finding the car, negotiating the price and driving it off the lot.  The team that I worked with was AMAZING!!!  Albert [Salesman] was not pushy at all and really truly seemed to have my best interest at heart.  He took my offer seriously and took it to Phil [Finance Manager].  It didn't take very long for us to negotiate the price, and the whole paperwork process took about half an hour.  Half an hour after the docs were signed, the car was washed and delivered for my comfort.  I have purchased over 20 vehicles [brand new and used] in my life time and this was by far the best experience I have ever had.  Thanks North Park Subaru Team, you have gained a customer for life.

Very Best,

46,"November 11, 2013","My wife and I bought a 2014 Subaru Forester Premium, and a 2014 Subaru WRX from North Park Subaru. We had a fantastic time. We arrived on the lot and were looking around when a sales consulatnant came out to greet us. He said that we could look around as much as we wanted, then checked to make sure the vehicles we were interested in were unlocked, and then let us be. We were in and out of vehicles for at least 30 minutes before we decided on what we did and did not like.

We went into the Dealership and our sales consultant asked us if we would like to take a vehicle for a test drive. We said yes. Once we were done he said if we wanted to an extended test drive some other time we could. 

We called back a week later told them that we would like to do an extended drive so that we could ensure our dogs fit in the back, and in the back seats. They were willing to give us the vehicle till Monday.

Upon being ready to make a purchase they were willing to wait as long as we wanted to get the paperwork started. During the negotiation process I didn't get what I wanted exactly for my trade ins but in the end got what I wanted.

We did end up paying more per month than I wanted but that is because I forgot about GAP insurance and did not factor that into my monthly payment plan. The also sold us an extended service plan, that may have been the best I've ever seen for the price they gave it to us for.

Great buying experience, no pressure, friendly atmosphere. We were told that they make a lot of business from return customers, and I can see why. I would return to North Park Subaru if I ever need another vehicle.

I made the mistake of not checking my bill and didn't realize the ~$30 overcharge. It took a week of daily phone calls before I finally reached Allan (who said he called me back and left a message, but I had no message). When we finally did get in touch, I still had to argue to get a check cut rather than credit. 

Moreover, I got a 'courtesy' text message that if I wasn't satisfied I should call customer service. I called twice. Left a message both times and customer service never called me back. 

Thankfully, there is another Subaru Service Company in the area. I have not been back to North Park.

51,"May 05, 2011","I started my car buying Saturday in Austin at Howdy Honda where I could not get a sales person to help me.  Left and went to Austin Subaru and they didn't have much for inventory and they also would not deal for the price for the Impreza we would have bought from them but they would not deal on the price.  I told them about the special prices that Town north had.  The sales man told me they would not have the car at that ""crazy price""

We left in a bad mood and on the way home we called North Park Subaru in San Antonio because I saw a Impreza outback sport on special on their website.  WE talked to Tim kelly on the phone and asked him if they had the car in stock that was advertised and he said yes.  We drove about 100 miles to the dealership and were greeted by Tim Kelly when we walked into the showroom. He had the Car that I called about ready to look at when we arrived. We test drove it and knew I wanted it for my daughter.

Tim was the best no pressure sales man I ever had and we got a super price.  Tim Kelly knew the answers to all of my questions which really impressed me.  We bought the car from him because the price was so good but also because he is a great person.  Three weeks later my sister in-law wanted my help in looking for a new car so she wouldn't be taken by a dealer.  We test drove a Honda then we went to Austin Subaru but the same old crap went on up there.  while she was test driving a Forrester I was calling up Tim Kelly but he was busy with sale but he had his sales manager call me.  I told him what my sister in-law wanted and he gave me a great price.  Austin Subaru would not even come close to the price give to me by North Park Subaru in fact the salesman told us that was a crazy price and to come back when we didn't get the car at that price.  WE drove on down to North park subaru and Tim Kelly had the car waiting for us and my sister in-law bought it from Tim Kelly  I would alway like to buy from Tim kelly.",5.0
