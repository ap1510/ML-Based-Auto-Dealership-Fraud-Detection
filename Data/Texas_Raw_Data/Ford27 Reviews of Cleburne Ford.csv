1,"February 26, 2020","I had researched hybrid vehicles and found that not all dealerships could sell them. Cleburne Ford is one of the authorized dealers. The buying experience was very quick with a good price.  They checked out other available colors for me. In the past I have had dealerships treat me like I did not know what I was doing, as a female and referred to my husband when I asked a question. That was not the case here. Each answer was directed to me with a clear and precise answer. Will definitely recommend Cleburne Ford to my friends.",5.0
2,"June 19, 2019","My husband and I went on Monday, with only plans to test drive vehicles to see what we were comfortable in. Jason Mickey was the sales man assisting us. he was very informative and laid back. Going to a Dealership can be a dreadful experience,  but not with Jason. We felt no pressure and he was completely understanding to what we were looking for. and we ended up coming home with an amazing 2019 Ford Edge. It was such a pleasure working with Jason. Everyone at Cleburne Ford was so nice and every person who saw us, greeted us with a smile.  Thomas Via, the finance director, was super nice and explained everything in detail. We certainly recommend Cleburne Ford. Go see Jason Mickey, he will take good care of you",5.0

4,"November 03, 2018","I went there and dealt with them for 2 hours, I was surprised how little knowledge they had. I was more informed about available financing, and rebates. I found a better deal elsewhere, but it had a rebate with farm bureau. I called and asked my sales person if my “out the door deal price” included this and was told no. I asked if it was able to be honored. The salesman (brand new guy Glenn) put me on hold and asked his manager (Thomas) and was told yes, the $1000 rebate would reduce my sale price by $1000. 

I left the dealer I was at, went back to Cleburne Ford, and after being there for an hour, they said “they made a mistake” and even though the told me it would be $1000 less, the rebate wasn’t compatible and would not apply. I asked why they wouldn’t honor their word, and they said they just can’t. They let me walk away disappointed and frustrated. 

Fortunately I have a relationship with another dealer an hour away, they got me an even lower price on the identical vehicle, and found other rebates with USAA that we’re compatible, so I got my vehicle at an even lower price. 

Shame I. Cleburne Ford, in my business when I say it’s a deal, I honor it, unfortunately Cleburne Ford will just life to try to close you, and then try to stick it to you if they can. ",1.7
5,"January 18, 2018","I visited this dealership at the recommendation of two people I work with. They both told me I would be treated well there and I would like the dealership. They were correct, I was treated very professionally and I was treated like a family friend quite honestly.  I want to thank Robert or Roberto and Mark for helping me.  I suggest you go see them.",4.8
6,"January 15, 2018","I waited a couple of days to post this review, because I wanted to make sure I articulated precisely what happened and how disappointed and offended I was after leaving Cleburne Ford on the evening of January 8, 2018.

I purchased a used car from Robert Rueda. We have bought several vehicles from him there and have been loyal to this dealership because of Robert. However I got put in the box with a finance guy that makes me want to stop doing business with them. The finance guy’s name was John and was a young, very unprofessional, and disrespectful person. After I had additional questions that he could not answer or remedy he wanted to talk to sales manager in the sales manager office. So I waited in the salesman desk (which is an open office/cube desk in front of the sales managers office(sales tower)). Within 5-10 minutes, John the F&I guy comes storming out of the sales managers office cursing and yelling.  Look, I am a US Marine veteran of a foreign war and I have experienced interacting the saltiest of people. 

However, I had my 9 year old and 5 year old daughters with me sitting in that office, and I do not speak that way to my children. He was disrespectful, and unprofessional and rude and he did not apologize not even show the slightest bit of any remorse for his actions and attitude.
 
Second, I work in the auto finance industry in and have for over a decade at Santander Consumer USA(SCUSA), CitiFinancial Auto, and HSBC Household Auto Finance.  I know the testosterone filled environment that is the dealership. It can be a high pressure job with quotas and intense sales goals requirements. You would be surprised at the candid and at times crude conversations that happened behind closed doors.  However, John in F&I does not seem to understand nor respect what is means to be in a service industry nor how you treat your clients. You do not whatsoever speak in that language, tone, nor volume in front of the customers that is unabashedly rash or inconsiderate. Ever. Period.  I never raised my voice, spoke in foul language, nor any disrespectful tone to John, but he did not have the same regard for me, my daughters, nor anyone else that was in front sales floor that day.

Another finance manager ended up came out of the sales managers office to help me finalizes my contract signing. The only reason I signed a contract with this dealership is because of the long standing professional relationship I have had with Robert Rueda. Otherwise, I would have stormed out of that place and never done business with them again. And if Cleburne Ford prides themselves of any reputation they might be able to salvage, then they need to highly consider moving this employee to a place where he cannot interact with customers or terminate him for his conduct that day. He is not someone they should be putting in front of the customers in the most pivotal point of the purchase transaction. He offended me and my children. I expect that a business that is asking for me to committee several years of investing payments towards a major purchase should subject their clientele to this sort of disrespectful verbal abuse.

10,"October 23, 2017",From the moment my wife and I walked into the dealership we had a great experience. We never felt pressured to buy nor did the salesman try to talk us into a vehicle we didnt want. I purchased the 2017 f250 that we were looking for and drove away feeling like we got a good deal. Just recently had the oil changed for the first time and all was well. Dropped it off on a busy Saturday and got it back faster than expected. ,5.0
