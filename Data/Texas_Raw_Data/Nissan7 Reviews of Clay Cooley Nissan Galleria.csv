0,"March 06, 2019","i change my cars every year or 2 years. i go through my autonavigator already approved when i walk in. the dealer had one price advertised online and everywhere but when i got there with the deal, the price was different and of course higher. i showed them the error and asked if they honor their own offer, they said no. it was only a 4k discount they needed to give me so i can walk out with the car. completely disinterested, they said plainly no after an hour. the cars i was looking at, 3, none worked and the battery was dead on all so i could not test drive them. 2018 model sitting in the parking lot for pathfinders. and still no deal for 4k.i have never encountered a finance manager like that. even in his system overnight the internet changed the price and matched what the website had and he still had to call IT in front of me to verify why.....i will never go back there for as long as i buy cars.

3,"February 03, 2019","The finance team at Clay Cooley's Nissan Galleria are misleading and dishonest. Mohammed failed to mention you must finance with Nissan to qualify for the ""pull ahead program "" . After I made this discovery, I called and talked to Brandy. I sent the info to her and she assured me that they would take care of the remaining lease balance. The worst part of the deal was when the whole group stopped taking my calls and avoided me like the plague. Apparently she lied according to Brandon. Brandon said it was my error for not knowing how the program worked. I believe it was their intent to put me off until enough time past to refinance with Nissan. If Clay Cooley's character is represented by this team of his, he has no character what so ever. I'll never be back nor will I recommend any of his dealerships to anyone.",2.0
4,"January 09, 2019","Totally agree with every one advised not to go to this place. I went with my son on 1/8/19 around 5pm to buy a 2015 Camry. The vehicle was priced the lowest in the market, which was very appealing. We met randy the sales man and Mohamed the finance manager. Both were honest, enthusiastic and straight forward. Both did everything they can to get the deal going.The vehicle was missing the left front fender liner and the engine splash shield. Went through the negotiation process which took a very long time. We were there for three hours. The reason for that another customer walked in to see the same car. The keys were taken from our table and transferred to the other customer to test drive it. They were pushing to see who will pay more. I can go to the auction and do the same thing. After agreeing to buy the car at $12K out of the door with replacing the missing pieces. They changed their story and said we only will buy the parts and will not pay for labor. They can install it but I will have to pay for the labor. I made an appointment the next day at 10 am agreeing to what they asked for to get it over with. I went their on time. I was told they keys are missing after another test drive the night before. The keys showed up at 11:10 am. I confirmed the deal again with Randy who checked with Broody the manager. Broody asked if I am paying cash or finance. I told him I will write a check. We took the vehicle to a near by mechanic to check it out. After going back, Febbie a floor manager asked my son to be a privacy notice not to release his information. I read that form it was a disclosure to release his information for marketing. After waiting for another 45 minutes nothing was ready yet. They said the reason for the delay that they were waiting for a log in to access the printer to print the needed documents. They finally showed me similar papers that my son was going to sign because I had to leave and go for a meeting. While everything seemed fine, I told my son not to sign anything before texting to me. While we were paying for the full price by check, they had on the retail purchase agreement no cash or deposit but the amount to be financed is $12K. My son caught that and refused to sign it. On the application for title and registration they had Nissan motor acceptance corp as a first lien holder with their mailing address to receive the title. Applying for and applicant type were blank, which raises more questions. He was asked to sign insurance coverage acknowledgement which is required under a finance contract not a cash contract. Again the names loss payee was Nissan motor acceptance corp to receive the insurance payment in case of a loss. If all this wasn't caught we were going to liable for the full price with interest again. I met the GM before leaving and told him we are walking out of this deal. Totally shameful. He was apologetic, but also said that this is fine he had three more customers waiting to see it.",1.2

Well, due to the pathetic customer service, lies, and just the inability to connect to clientel - this one, Clay Cooley Galleria, is bottom of the barrel. Not at all impressed, rather extremely disappointed. Check Yelp, etc reviews as well. Good Luck. üëé",1.8
6,"February 05, 2018","Buying a car from Clay Cooley Nissan has been the worst experience and if I had to do it over again I would not!!!  The finance department will screw you over and then when you call them out on it their ""customer service"" rep chimes in with not customer service whats so ever and they will drag out the process of their screwing you over so long that you won't get any of your money back!! DO NOT GO HERE...RUN DO NOT WALK AWAY FROM THIS DEALERSHIP.  Pathetic from top to bottom. Clay Cooley should be embarrassed!",1.0
