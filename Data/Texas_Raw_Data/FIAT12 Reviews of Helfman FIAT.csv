0,"May 15, 2019","I went to Helfman with 'cash in hand' knowing exactly what I wanted to buy.  I should have been the easiest customer ever for them.  However, after 30 minutes of their manager Ann Trakhman insulting me and my family I decided I would rather drive an extra 3 hours to the next closest Maserati dealership than purchase here.  This is a service-based business, and I when purchasing my first 'luxury' vehicle, I expected better service than I would receive at say, a Honda dealer.  However, I got the exact opposite from Ann.  I did, buy a new Levante from the Austin Maserati dealership and spent an extra 6 hours in the car, but at least I know Ann didn't get a cent in commission. I pray that someone above her at this store reads this and rectifies the situation there.  No matter what I will never be a customer, but maybe they can still gain some other new customers who haven't been tainted by working with her.",1.4
1,"January 29, 2018","Wish I could give them ZERO stars.  Do not under any circumstances even think about buying a car from this dealership.  Based on my experience and IMO, the sales staff is extremely inexperienced and the sales manager is providing unbelievably poor coaching to them.  Unless you drive up in a Ferrari they will treat you condescendingly and talk to you as if you are a 16 yr old kid with a minimum wage job who knows nothing about cars and has no driving experience.  Even if you actually bother to call them out on it and point out their MASSIVE mistake they still won't apologize or do ANYTHING to try and EARN your business.  Go ANYWHERE else to buy a car besides this dealership. We’re a 48 yr old couple who are very experienced high horsepower car aficionados, each have credit scores over 800, a 2 million dollar home that’s paid for, and walked in having researched the car and with the money to literally pay for it on the spot.  If they treated us this poorly then they’ll treat ANYBODY that way.
Based on my experience and IMO, the sales staff/management are both incompetent and outright condescending.  Spend your time and your money elsewhere.",1.0

3,"November 03, 2016","I walked in  only to browse,  I wasn't even expecting to walk out days later with my fiat.  I was attended by Josue Guttierrez  and he made me feel right at home,   he worked his magic and walked me through the financial steps of getting my car.   Overall the entire staff seemed very friendly and welcoming,  I can guarantee that they care about all of their customers and are very dedicated.   Despite the friendly environment, and ease of understanding what your financial life will be like in getting your car I really thought it was essential that most of their staff is bilingual.   I highly recommend them if you are looking for a car.  ",5.0

5,"January 27, 2015","I recently ordered a 2015 Fiat Abarth through Janet Brush at Helfman Fiat.  The entire transaction could not have been more easy.  She was so excited to help me get exactly what I wanted and her enthusiasm shows in everything she does.  The price was fair and the entire experience was great.  If you’re in the market for a new Fiat, I would highly recommend calling Janet.",5.0

7,"May 07, 2013",Horrible! I was just told by the Fiat service advisor that they would not fix my car they are  overwhelmed with work. Said they could only do oil change. Do not  buy a car from a dealer that can not hire enough staff to fix your car when it is broken.,1.0
8,"August 30, 2012",We came here on a friend's recommendation and couldn't be happier. My wife loves her new car and we'll definitely continue doing business with Helfman. I strongly recommend them!,5.0
9,"July 30, 2012","I knew I wanted a Fiat, and after a terrible experience at another local FIat dealership, I went to Helfman. When I walked in, I was greeted by a pleasant staff and taken care of immediately. Mike Debner, who eventually sold us the car, was wonderful. Irene Soto was also very pleasant. As a first time car buyer, the staff at Helfman Fiat made me feel very much at home. I had a wonderful experience there and would recommend anyone who's in the market for a Fiat to go there. 5/5!",5.0
10,"July 23, 2012",They cause damage to your vehicle and make you sign a statement releasing them from responsibility. Bad attitude and putting on the wrong part to your vehicle. They will wash your car at 25$ even if you had work done with them.  Never again will I do business with them.,1.2
11,"July 16, 2012","We first suspected some issues with the 'we get tons of minis in trade for the fiat' - this with NO MINIS on the lot... my husband drives a mini... an awesome mini, and there was nothing but pure trash talking in this statement.... the second was when we were closing the deal an extended warranty we had DECLINED was included in the final price and we had to have that removed. The third was when the car arrived from Dallas, it had limited damage, the forth, the driver's side front seat will not fold down and they had nothing to say but, that's not possible.. WILL NEVER USE THIS DEALERSHIP AGAIN!!!!!!
