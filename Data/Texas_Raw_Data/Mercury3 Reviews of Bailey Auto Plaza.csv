0,"November 14, 2017",This dealership is the absolute best!!!  Chris Stroud went above and beyond on this deal.  They started out $2k higher on my trade than anyone else.  Worked with me to get one car sold and the other traded in.  Searched tirelessly to find the exact vehicle I wanted and went to get it!  Put me in a loaner vehicle while they looked.  Very professional.  Very friendly.  I would absolutely recommend them to anyone and everyone.  We are customers for life!!!  BUY LOCAL!!!,5.0

2,"November 12, 2009","I flew from Central Florida to Texas to purchase a vehicle I found online from
Bailey Auto Plaza. The sales experience was great, the staff was friendly, and I felt that my business was appreciated. I wish I lived closer so I could take my vehicle back for service.",5.0
