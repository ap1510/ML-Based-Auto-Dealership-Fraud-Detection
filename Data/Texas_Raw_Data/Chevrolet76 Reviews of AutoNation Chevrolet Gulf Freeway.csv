lying ,not informing customer about problems on the car",1.4
11,"April 03, 2013",I was upset like most people get when things aren't fixed on the item they bought. Well the salesman promised me certian things he didn't follow through with. So then I spoke with Ms. Zapata who took over my problem. She took complete responsibility for something that she was never a part of but she made it right. Thank you very much Ms. Zapata. I appreciate the tremendous amount of effort that you and Mister Many took to take care of me. Mr. Many was my service advisor he too made sure that I was taken care of even though he wasn't responsible for what was promised. Thank you Champion Chevrolet for having such great people to handle the situations like my own.,5.0

59,"November 16, 2011","Excellent Customer Service & Attention To Detail All Around...
From the time we were greeted upon arrival to the time we left, this was a great experience. This was my second car to buy at this Champion Chevrolet dealer, this was by far the best time I have had buying a car. From the salesman(Roberto ""Tito""  Dominquez) who was very friendly, patient,  and thorough when explaining how all the features of the Surburban worked, not to mention all the different models he showed us.It never seemed to bother him that we changed our minds several times about what vehicile we even wanted. He happily show and explained other models. He seemed to know a lot about  Chevy features on various SUVs.He spent hours with us even through I warned him ahead of time that I would not be buying that night.(which we ended up buying that night anyway). His attitude was great the whole time and never once did we feel pressured...

Sales Manager(David Tong) for helping finalize the deal. 

Greg Leffler(Internet Sales Director / Aftermarket Manager) Very instrumental in our decision to purchase the car that night, when we had no plans to drive away in a new car that same nght.

To the Business Manager(Jose Sanchez) He was very friendly, personable and explained each step in a timely manner, did not seem to be in any hurry and welcomed all questions, which is usally not the case in finance departments.

Thanks to all of you, I will most certainly buy my next car here,

60,"November 13, 2011","I was on vacation in Texas,(which is where I was born and raised), Now I reside in California and I mentioned to a friend that I was looking into buying an Equinox. She recommended that I speak with Daniel Quintanilla over at Champion Chevrolet. I was hesitant, as I live in California. When I was there, I did get to test drive an Equinox. Daniel understood my situation and was more than helpful in working with me on the limited time I had there in Texas. He worked around my schedule and I was there to visit Family. I am back in California and Daniel has been nothing but Professional, Patient, and understanding. They have looked into the shipping for me. I have changed my mind on color and accessories and other things for this SUV and they have worked with me to locate the exact Equinox I want. I have gone to some Dealerships over here in the Bay Area and nothing but pressure, pressure pressure. That's what makes Daniel Quintanilla over at Champion Chevrolet my choice for auto buying, they truly care about the customer. Very fast responses to my emails and calls. I highly recommend checking out Daniel at Champion for your next car purchase.",5.0
61,"November 13, 2011","I was hesitant about buying a new vehicle just because of the whole experience of dealing with the sales people. But I have to say, the salesman, Duane C. Bloggs totally changed my experience when purchasing a new vehicle. He was very pleasant to deal with, did not put me on the spot to buy a vehicle. He worked with me in EVERY way so that I'd feel comfortable purchasing my 2012 Chevy Equinox. I had my 9 month old with me as well, who was becoming very fussy & I was amazed at how well he interacted with her...very impressive! Anything I wanted to know, if he didn't know the answer, he'd surely go out of his way to get the answers to my questions. I honestly felt he was doing his best to get me in a vehicle that I would be very happy with and I surey am!)He was very personable, wanting to know more about us, the customers and not just making a sale. I would highly recommend to anyone that if they were thinking about purchasing a vehicle, to ask for him! But to tell you the truth, the whole staff was very helpful & welcoming. I know paperwork usually takes soooooo long, but under the circumstances...having a little one that was getting restless, the staff was very understanding and were doing their best to get us going so that we could go home (for the baby's sake). I would have to say, this was the best experience I have had at a car dealership. Thanks to the whole staff for all their services. :)

Bottom line, I came in with two vehicles to trade, and Champion had a new camaro in stock with the trim package we were looking for.  Daniel Q did a good job of keeping the deal on track, and the process moving. There were a lot of steps to go through, but everything went smoothly.

I liked the fact that there were no surprises with the numbers when it came to the final signing. Everything was upfront, and on target. ",5.0
