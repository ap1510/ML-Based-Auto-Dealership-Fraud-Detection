0,"November 11, 2016","We traded in our car at this dealership on a new car. It took then over 2 months to pay off our old car, so we took a credit hit. Then we went in to have our second key programmed (for free) and two weeks later we get a phone call saying they should have charged us $75 to program the key. We did not pay this. Now we have a flat tire. We were told that we get 2 free sets of tires with this car. The dealership is now refusing to honor this free tire guarantee. My husband was trying to change our flat tire to the spare and upon looking in the trunk, there is no spare tire. We were told today that a spare tire is an ""option"". An option! Floor mats were apparently an option too, as our car did not come with those either. I will never use this dealership again. They are crooks and shady. They chase you through the parking lot as you are driving looking at cars too. Very much a shady, wolves in sheep' clothing type of place. I would leave zero stars it that was an option. ",1.0
1,"May 30, 2015","We picked up a piece of metal in our tire as we were driving into town on a Saturday, saw the dealership and just pulled in.  The service department was closed, but Jason was happy to help.  Realizing he could just plug the tire real quick, he did so.  After adding air and checking the plug, we were on our way in no time.  Wouldn't take payment either.  They won a customer.   If you're looking for a dealership, you'd be hard pressed to find a better one.  Thanks Jason and Faulkner Chevrolet!",5.0
