2,"February 27, 2020","I was referred by a mutual business partner and was excited about this process and salesman. Unfortunately I was sold a luxury lemon that I took back for the engine light. The salesman reassured me, but the car has been in the shop for a total of a month within the first 10 months. Completely disappointed. I woman shouldn't have to rely on a man's presence to get a reliable vehicle. ",1.0
3,"February 12, 2020","I just wanted to take a moment to recognize TC and Alyson and the service department as a whole.  
A couple of months ago I brought my truck in for repair of a water leak in the passenger compartment (thought it was the 3rd brake light) and they replaced the 3rd brake light assembly. Well it leaked again and that is when I had to bring it back.  This time they did not return my vehicle until it was fixed right.  The service department team is changing the way they take care of customers as evidenced in my return visit, professionalism from start to finish.   I will be bringing back my vehicle for required maintenance. 

Thank you,

There were even additional personal complications with paperwork requiring a lot of extra time and expense that he took on without hesitation. We are extremely happy with our purchase and will definitely be repeat customers. Highly recommend working with this gentleman.",4.4
5,"August 07, 2019","I purchased a new '19 Ram 2500 longhorn addition. first off I traded in 2 trades. one cadillace and one pickup. the trades and the new truck price had all been negotiated in advance. all I had to do was bring in the trades and sign the papers. I was there 4 plus hrs!!!!! also informed the sales man (Hunter) that I wanted to put 35 inch BF Goodrich tires on it along with a bull bar. I was promised to receive a credit for the existing tires towards the new larger ones which they sold me for almost 2 thousand dollars which I could have purchased elsewhere for 1500.00. they looked up the bull bar and sold me that for just under 1,000.00. I was told I would be put in a loaner while they ordered the tires and bull bar and I can come back once it was complete. I then was told to go ahead and take the new truck and they would call when the parts and tires came in. Almost 2 weeks later I get a phone call to bring in the truck to install tires and wheels. I took the vehicle in only to be told there is not any bull bar available as that truck is too new. (where did they get a price from then?) So they told me I would be refunded the price for the bull bar when I picked up the truck. Ok, 5 hours later (for tires) I get a call the truck is ready. I pull up to find the following new tires are not 35's they are 33""s basically the exact size they took off!! On top of that the removed tires were in the bed of the truck. When I ask about my promised credit for the existing tires I was now told they could not do that because I had driven on them. WTH? You are the people that told me to take the truck vs. a loaner. The manager then proceeds to tell me I can wait for them to reinstall the original tires while they order the 35's I had paid for. If I drive off the lot I then own 2 sets of tires! Now...the bull bar check comes and I ask about adjusting my sales contract as even though the sold me a fictional accessory and are giving me a check that number is still figured in my payment and will collect interest throughout the length of the loan. I was told they could in no way do that either. These people are crooks. I have numerous family and friends that are attorneys and you can bet I will receive some sort of resolve and it will cost them some time and money unless they contact me immediately to fix this. Stay away from this dealership at all cost!!

6,"May 31, 2019","I bought my 2011 Jeep from this location & was pretty happy with the sales experience. I recently brought the same jeep back (148,500 miles later) for service due to the 4WD and ABS lights coming on. In addition the Jeep was stuck in 4 wheel Hi. I had already taken the Jeep to an independent Jeep repair facility and they couldn't fix it and recommended me taking to a Jeep dealership so I chose this one. I was quoted $1400 to replace the transfer case module and arm. They said this ""might"" fix it but not sure. When I dropped the Jeep off I told them I didn't want to spend more than $1000 BUT I did authorize these charged in hopes that this would fix the problem. 3 weeks later I get a call that this did not fix the problem and it would take another $1600 in addition to fix it. Well I can't justify this so I asked my original parts be put back on and that I'd pay the diagnosis charge since nothing was actually fixed. My advisor, Luis, said nope I owed and authorized $1400. I said but Luis nothing was fixed. I authorized the parts so you could see if they fixed the problem. They didn't do anything. Why, if you have my old parts, paying for anything especially for something didn't fix anything? Why not give the Jeep a 4 tire rotation while you are at it and charge me for that as well since that won't fix the problem either. He said he told me this ""might or might not"" fix the problem, you authorized it, and we have to pay our technician for his work (3 weeks worth). I said so if you brought me you TV, not working, I tell you ""I think parts X and Y  may be the problem but not sure"", give you TV back not working, you're ok paying me for the parts? He said yes as I authorized the work. I said, ok no sense is going round and round about this. I'll come pay you & get my Jeep. Look I'm not saying if this legally wrong or right. I am saying it's not fixed and they can't tell me parts X will 100% fix the problem. Its a hunting expedition. I am just saying if what you did, didn't fix it why are you charging me for the parts. My brother is the service manager at Honda in Burleson so I asked him is this right and how would you address the situation. He said ""I couldn't in good faith charge you if we didn't fix it. Period."" This is advise from a service manager. I guess you sometimes you get more than expected and sometimes, like this time, you get the shaft. Well the funny thing is I was going to purchase a RAM truck but given that I'd be dealing with the same parent company I'm passing and looking at another brand. Sometimes what you do has ripple effects. And it also spurred this review.",1.6
7,"January 14, 2019","Raul Luna sold my daughter gap insurance and a warranty for $5000 on a used car that was under $13,000. He also failed to provide the bill of sale and told her to come back the next day for it. She believed she was getting the gap and warranty for much less. Luna took advantage of her lack of experience, as she relied on his advice.

Gap insurance was not needed b/c the car had already depreciated and the price charged for the warranty was excessive and dishonest.

Luna's conduct and the dollar amount of coverage he sold her was unconscionable and constitutes fraud. The situation is ripe for a lawsuit.",1.8

9,"December 19, 2018","DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.  SERVICE CENTER IS A JOKE.  ZERO STARS.

Dishonest ""advisors"", ineffective ""manager"", lame service techs.

I could write a book on what amounted to an 8 hour oil change but I'll try to keep it short and to the point.  If you don't want to read the detail, just trust me, don't waste your time at this place.  

OK, here's the shortish version:

Set up an 8am appointment for service of my 2015 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited.  Oil change, tire rotate/balance, air filter, check engine light (70K service due).  Dropped off night before so I could be first in line for service.  Vehicle checked in by Christopher at 7:41, where he tried to sell me on a couple bogus services (fuel treatment for $250, throttle body cleaning another $170).  I haven't spent much on maintaining the vehicle and he said it was part of the 70,000 mile service so I agreed.  He stated that the vehicle should be ready by about 10:30.  More than I wanted to spend but OK.

Not hearing anything back, called in at 11:00 expecting to pick up vehicle.  VEHICLE HAD NOT BEEN TOUCHED...THREE AND A HALF HOURS LATER.  After a series of lies and excuses, Chris said he would check with the tech and get back to me in 20 min.  Since he did not call me back, ONE HOUR LATER, I call him back.  This is his response, ""Oh xxxx, I completely forget, let me go check, I'll call you right back.""  Does not call back again.

ANOTHER HOUR LATER, I call back and still no update, ""tech was at lunch"".  It was clear that he had not even spoken to the tech.

I'm now irate since I had other plans and didn't expect the vehicle to be tied up all day for a simple service.  I call him back to check on progress, figure they have to have everything done by now, it's been close to 6 hours.  This time no answer.  Leave message to wrap it up, whatever they had done, I'm coming to get my vehicle.

Another hour sitting in the ""advisor"" office waiting for my Jeep.  This was interesting.  I listen to these ""advisors"" make dozens of excuses to other irate customers, hear advisors brag about sticking a guy with a new Dodge Ram with an $1800 non-warranty bill, hear an estimate for a $500-$700 estimate for a fuel tank flush that of course is not covered by warranty on a new car.  Locker-room profanity with customers in earshot (a young mom and her two kids also there waiting to pick up their car that was supposed to be ready an hour and a half ago).

In the end, oil change , tire rotation and balance and check engine was supposedly the thermostat which would be another $400-$500, I said no thanks.

So for approximately 10 hours of time including drop off and pick up, I got a $200 oil change and tire rotation that I could have gotten at discount tire for about $100 and one hour.

Best part.  ""balanced"" tires were not balanced.  Worse wobble in steering  than when I dropped it off.  Some residual mud left on wheels from last weekend (it is a Jeep after all) was not cleaned before balance.  YES, you read that right, the wheels were rebalanced with mud and reinstalled.  

Worse wobble than when I dropped it off, so I turn back around and have the pleasure of asking for a refund since there was no way they could have balanced tires in that condition .  If you cannot do the service because ther tires are dirty, fine, don't charge me for it.  After speaking with Chris again, some other senior advisor, I get to speak to the ""manager"" Joey.  Explain my concern, request a refund.  Says he can do that ""just not today, I have to submit a request"".  I literally checked out less than 5 minutes ago and they cannot process a refund?

I call BS to Joey and call him a liar to his face.  He says there is nothing he can do.  Two things, either he is a liar which is most likely, or upper management does not trust staff to manage their business and must approve every refund.  Either way, not cool.  Won't be holding my breath for that refund.

Bottom line, will never by a vehicle form an AutoNation facility or take my vehicles to service there again.  I recommend you do the same if you wish to be treated fairly.

10,"November 22, 2018","After a very negative experience at Grapevine Dodge, I found Auriel and Alexandra at AutoNation in North Fort Worth and I am SO HAPPY with my experience.  They both have been more than happy to to answer all my questions about the Challenger build I have been planning, and they are extremely responsive to text messages and emails.  As a female new-car consumer, it has been GREAT to work with Auriel and Alexandra at AutoNation North Forth Worth.  They took the time to carefully read my emails and they worked to build the exact Challenger I want.  When I had a question about a charge on the invoice, they took 10 minutes to figure it out, and readily advised me that it was an accidental double-charge and they immediately corrected the error.  When I had questions about the technical differences between the standard audio system and the Harmon Kardon upgrade option, Auriel and Alexandra found the answer.  Same thing with the wheel selection options.  Auriel made the car build process SO EASY and pleasant with no high-pressure sales techniques or attempts to sell me packages and upgrades I didn’t want. I ordered my 2019 Challenger yesterday, and I can’t wait until it arrives! Thank you Auriel and Alexandra!",5.0
11,"October 31, 2018","My husband and I own three Mopars, so we do quite a bit of maintenance on them, and know what maintenance costs. When I started hearing a grinding noise on one of my tires, I took it to the closest dealership to have them check the ABS, and unfortunately I ended up here. I requested that they check the ABS and tell me if that is the source of the noise. They said it would take three days and a $155 diagnostic fee. So I left my truck. They called me the next day to say that they did a multipoint inspection (that I never asked for), listed off ten things I don’t need, then said I needed four new brake pads and four new rotors. After coming in and arguing with them for half an hour, I left having paid $155 without ever having a diagnostic done on my ABS & with an estimate of repairs well over $1300 for brakes. I took it to another Dodge mechanic who fixed the noise AND replaced my front brake pads and rotors for less than $300. 
I told these people over and over that I knew they were lying but they stuck to their story and insisted I needed four new brake pads and four new rotors. When I looked at their recommended repairs, I noticed that they were trying to charge me $222 for a brake light – one I replaced myself for $3. They don’t care about customer service or honesty. They care about getting every penny they can out of you and not giving you what you ask for. They stole my $155 and never did the diagnostic I requested. But as a lifetime Mopar driving family who is in the market for a new Jeep, we will NEVER come back to this crooked place for anything.

12,"September 01, 2018","We stopped by AutoNation Thursday,  August 30th to look at pickups and not one sales person came out to ask if we needed help. We did come across a salesman a couple of times looking at the inventory and he barely acknowledged we were there. I also tried calling the internet sales thinking we could get some information but that was a bust as well. The gentleman I spoke with in the internet sales was almost to the rude level and didn't want to answer our questions. We are a return customer and at this time we don't plan to return to AutoNation.",1.0
13,"August 28, 2018","Absolute worst customer service I have ever dealt with. The service department is a joke. I bought a brand new Jeep Grand Cherokee from here in June of 2017. Fast forward to August 2018, my AC is broken. I called to get a service appointment on aug 6 and they let me know to bring it in on aug. 21st. When I drop the car off they told me that Chrysler will pay for a rental for 5 day but my Jeep will not be looked at for 3 days. I call to get a status update on day 3 and they let me know if would be 3 more days before a technician can ever look at it. I explained to them that I would not be paying for a rental for those day as it was out of my control on when their technician would look at it and they said, too bad it's Chrysler's policy. After arguing with Steven Scott, who is handing my service, I asked for a manager. He put me on hold for about 11 minutes and came back and said he doesn't have a manger that can talk right now but that they would pay for the rental. Okay fine. Here we are 7 days later, my car has still not been looked at and no one returns messages or calls to touch base. Awful, awful, awful, customer service. I will never buy from or service my car with this dealership again.",1.0
14,"August 07, 2018",Purchased a vehicle here on may 25th and wanted it titled in a different state. I was told it was no problem and easy for them as they do it all the time. Well July 18th..come to find out they had not even started work on it when my tags were do to expire within the week. Not only that now they have issued my title check to a department that doesnt even exist in my state and as of Aug 7th..still no title and being ignored.

15,"February 23, 2018","Was told they would do what other autonation in north Richland hills counldnt.  Well it all boils down to the bottom line... how much money can they make off of you instead of respecting and treating the customer right and gaining a lifetime customer.

16,"December 18, 2017","I used to be a car salesman myself and have worked at three differnet dealerships.. and needless to say this is the most shady and unprofessional place I have ever had to deal with. They knew going into it that I was a salesman and knew the whole process inside and out. But rather than shooting me straight like they said they would, they tried to rob me of my trade by offering $10,000 less than it's worth. They also have a ""one price"" policy which means the price of their vehicles is non-negotiable. That would be fine except for the fact that they price their vehicles at high retail and then they try to steal your vehicle from you too. It's bullshit. NEXT. After I tried walking out they finally decided to give me a reasonable amount for my trade. When we got to the financing part they tried to rip me off once again. I have a 720 transunion credit score and my co-signer has a 765 score so I know we qualify for a great interest rate. The finance manager came in the office and told me the best he could do was 7.5%. BULLSHIT YET AGAIN. At this point I'm fuming and told him I can beat that with outside financing and he still wouldn't come down. So I left. I would never recommend this place to anyone. Please don't bring your business to these assholes. They had a chance to make $3-4,000 off of my truck that I traded in and I know they were making at least $2,000 on their truck. It disgusts me how greedy these people are",1.0
17,"August 04, 2017","I brought my vehicle in for a recall in late June. I picked it up the next day and went home to find out they left the radiator cap off and they hacked away at my bumper to remove my old trailer hitch and install a different one (without telling me). This was supposed to be an airbag recall. They damaged the EVAP system, wiring around the fuel tank, as well as cut my headlight wiring on purpose. Regardless, the vehicle was there for the better part of July and now I keep getting engine codes. I'm scared that there will be more vandalism if I bring the vehicle back.. and AutoNation doesn't care. ",1.0

Once he completed his conversation, he took down my information and treated me as a total inconvenience. He assured me that my car would be available mid afternoon on Tuesday. At 4pm on Tuesday, I still didn't hear from the service department, so I called.

I then learned that the truck sold last night as Demarcus was calling me to confirm my purchase (and did I have any questions?). No one bothered to call me back to tell me the truck had sold Friday night.

23,"February 23, 2016","I bought a 2007 Jeep Commander new and have been going for maintenance/services ever since. I’ve never been thrilled with the service but it was manageable. But I’m done now. On average, I spend a couple of thousand dollars a year at the dealer. This time, I asked for specific items to be completed and some diagnostics. The vehicle has about 120K miles and I love it. I’ve gotten used to no one calling me back but this time it was really bad. Multiple calls were needed to get status on my car. I usually don’t get charged a diagnostic fee if I spend money on repairs. This time I was charged the $129 charge even though I spent $1400. I ran my own diagnostics to get any engine etc.. codes and I made requests for service based on that. For the standard TPMS codes, the technician response was “could not duplicate concern at this time”. I offered the codes from my diagnostic tool but I was told there was no software update for the system so there was nothing they could do. I asked to check a noise in the front suspension which I was told in the past was a differential busing going bad. The technician response was that if I replaced the front suspension ($7000), the noise would go away. I’ll stop there… Autonation just took over this dealership. I don’t know them and I don’t even necessarily mind the responses above but I go to a dealership because I think it’s worth the higher prices if they do a good job. I’ll be going elsewhere now. ",2.4

Even blew smoke up my butt saying the price on the sticker was the EP price. I wasn't born yesterday. Another dealership kept trying to put me in to a vehicle way more than I was wanting to spend. Putting their needs in front of mine. Then Jeremy from Allen Samuels comes thru. They worked with me to get the exact vehicle with the options and add-ons I wanted, gave me the real EP, and was up front with everything. Good news, bad news... they layed all out there.

28,"September 30, 2015","I went in this evening to test drive 3vehicles before deciding on a purchase. Coming in preappoved with USAA and a great interest rate. Going to trade in my car so they said that they have to test drive of course to get my trade in value, so I gave my keys for them to do so while I tested cars on the lot.

Awesome, attentive sales guy. Took time with me and gave great information about each car and said he would sellme whatever I wanted but felt a certain car met my needs. Everything going great...manager comes in doesn't push hard on trying to have me purchase that day, which was great. 

So I get my car back...the person that ""test drove"" my car #1 parked it next to the thorns and bushes where I can barely get in my car (so bad my sales guy offered to back it out for me so I wouldn't get all scratched up). I get in and start the engine and drive less than half a mile and my car is sputtering????? I have a 2013 Kia Soul in great condition with 37k miles on it that was running great before I arrived and now its SPUTTERING like they dogged the engine during there test drive. I am only looking for a new vehicle for more space, not because I have a crap car...my Kia is great!!!! 

I was going to go back and purchase from my sales guy but these freakin jerks either dogged my engine or did something to my car to affect the trade in value and try to get me to put money down. Soooo with that said I don't believe I'm going back because I can't trust that they are going to do the best for me...I can spend my money anywhere so that's what I will do. 

Really liked my sales guy but the dealer he works for seems a little shady. Only reason they even get stars is for my sales guy he was 5 star!!! The reason the rating so low is because of everyone else... Mainly whoever test drove my car!!! I will have an investigation done if when I take my car in for diagnostic and the say my near perfect car now has a problem.

31,"June 30, 2015","I called on a Thursday to get have two recalls corrected on my wife's 2015 Jeep.  There was also a continuously annoying squeak in the back seat that I asked them to fix.  They said the repairs needed they would need the car for the day so they told me to come in early Monday morning.  I arrived at 7:00am Monday morning and thought while it was there might was well get the oil changed.  I receive a call at 4:00pm stating the car would not be ready that day and might be done the following day.  I asked what they had done and the stated nothing as they were waiting on the guy to fix the squeak.  At 2:00pm on Tuesday i called for an update.  The guy checked with the mechanic and said it would be another couple hours.  I called back at 4:30 said the were finally working on the squeak and should be done that day and they would call me when it was ready.  I wanted to drop off my rental before they closed at six so i decided to drive up there.  I got there at 5:30 and and the service person was trying to leave for the day, fortunately i showed up or would not have been able to pick it up until the next day.  The mechanic was doing the final checks with the car so i turned in the rental car.  When i came back the service rep was gone, but my bill was with the casher.  All i had to pay for was the oil change, which fully understood, but did not expect to pay $78.00 for an oil change.  In my opinion this was a little extreme for an oil change. Due to my inconvenience i would have expected a reasonable price for the oil change or at a minimum the service rep be there and thank me for my business.  I will be in the market for a new car very soon, but i can guaranteed i wont be buying it from here.  The only reason i did not give them a one star is it appears they fixed the issues.",2.0
32,"June 27, 2015",Went in to get my oil changed and to see why my check engine light was on. I had bought the car from them and they advertised that we could just drive in and could hook it up at no cost. Not only did they want $120 to hook it up to the computer they also wanted to Keep it overnight. Because of the way that they treated me I ended up a 5 star ford and got an amazing deal with friendly customer service. I will make sure everyone I know does not go to Allen Samuels for service or anything else. ,1.0
33,"June 23, 2015",made an appt. to come and a vehicle @ 12:30...arrived & was pasded on to another salesman who informed me it was sold. why would you not call the client and let them know that you sold it instead of waiting till they arrive after an hour drive.. and then you attempt to go and find it and come back and say it's gone,1.0
34,"May 22, 2015","The worst experience with any dealership. I negotiated a deal via phone night before, drove 1.5 hours next day to finalize to find out it was sold from under me.  sales person and manager knew we were coming and no phone call.  walked in excited we were buying a truck we negotiated, but they tried to sell us a 6000 higher vehicle.  Bait and Switch?  Not one manager came in to apologize, which really shows the customer service they have.  Hundreds of vehicles in the price range they were attempting to sell me, so I would not go back to them at all.  ",1.2
35,"April 13, 2015","Absolute WORST place to buy a car from. These clowns tried to force me to pay $999 for a flashing light on the back of a Jeep Patroit to allow more of a chance of not getting rear-ended. They also tried to charge me $795 to go to another state to dealer transfer a vehicle for me. Their sales guy Alejandro couldn't even figure out my payments, he tried to tell me I would pay $143 a mth for 72 mth with zero down on a $19000 vehicle, I told him to put it in writing and I would sign immediately. Of course he came back and tried to say sorry, the payment should be $356. This poor excuse for a sales guy also tried to make me pay $4899 for prepaid service on my vehicle (oil changes, etc). What a freaking joke!!!!!

On top of all this, I was pre-approved to buy the vehicle through Chrysler Credit. These guys tried to tell me I HAD to finance the vehicle through a bank of THEIR choice (which of course was at a higher interest rate than I was already pre-approved for). I'm sure they get a kick back for that too!

I ended up buying the 2015 Jeep Patroit AT A DIFFERENT DEALERSHIP (Don Davis Jeep) in Arlington, TX. That dealer did not charge me to go get it, that dealer gave me a better interest rate than these clowns, and that dealer didn't try to tell me I HAD to buy this or that add on. They also put me through Chrysler Credit with no problems!

Shop where you want but I guarantee you can find much better prices, way better customer service, and much more qualified salesmen that what you will ever find at this Allen Samuels Alliance.

The biggest way you can ever voice your opinion is by choosing WHO and WHO NOT to spend your hard earned money with. I will NEVER spend a dime with this dealer...Good luck to you if you still choose to buy from them.",1.0
36,"March 05, 2015","I went in to trade my vehicle (KBB value $19,000 - $24,000) to buy a new Jeep Cherokee. This dealership has a lot of new salesman, a lot of which don't know their vehicles (telling me a 3.2 Liter was a 4 cyl when I knew it was a 6 cyl). I was shown several Jeep Cherokee's and was about to decide on two ($34,000 and $37,000). All the Cherokee's on the front lot (about 20 of them) were all 2014 models. I already had financing set up through my credit union (who was going to draft a check to the dealership upon agreeing on price). I was allowed to take vehicle home for a test drive and come back the following day. The next day I received an email concerning a credit alert (I do credit monitoring). This dealership, without my consent, had ran my credit. Long story short the salesman I was dealing with Larry sent two other saleman in to deal with me (I guess he wasn't man enough to face me himself). They offered me $20,000 for my vehicle ($3000 below excellent condition). Then tried to sell me the 2014 Cherokee for $34,000 (MSRP) when KBB lists that vehicle(now almost 2 years old but being sold new) as $25,000 top dollar.i did not buy but was very upset that they would actually screw me out of my vehicle and then screw me out of the new vehicle (taking a $9,000 depreciation as soon as I drove off the lot). I will NEVER go back to this dealership again and I am warning other potential customers of this. Please check KBB prices and never pay MSRP. Horrible dealership (they classified me as a valuable customer since I bought a vehicle there a year earlier). Wow!",1.0
37,"October 14, 2013","Rick and the Finance Team was so helpful in completing the showing and sale of our (mother's) 2008 Chrysler Aspen. From the sale price to the incredible warranty plan which covered our car through a wide range of qualifing Dodge dealerships, the car buying experience was more delightful then many before. I appreciate the the sales team and the finance department in the used cars division. THEM GUYS KNOW THEIR STUFF! Plan to return 2014 to purchase me a truck for myself. THANKS AGAIN... Keep up the experienced assistance, it is recognized!",5.0

I'm paying for it.  I agreed to the $600 a month, and made them HAND SIGN the agreement on my warranty.  It was SIGNED to be null at 10,000 miles.  NOT TRUE!  After I've driven my car 4,--- miles I learn my warranty was good for 60,000 miles.... WOAH WOAH WOAH. I would never purchase a vehicle that only had 12,000 miles left on its warranty!

I made small talk about getting windows tinted; the salesman offered the # of his tinter, and wheel dealer, but no calls.. no follow ups. I cannot agree more:  they will sell shit to a cow, and keep it that way.  OH! they will not budge on my warranty.... no help, no change, even tho I signed a 100,000 mile warranty.  I KNEW it was confusing, so I asked: Does this mean I am thru w/ my warranty at 60,000m or that I have 60,000m+my 40,000m on the car?  I had my salesman SIGN that it would END at 100,000m.

42,"April 08, 2004","The Salesman we delt with was very friendly and helpful, but once the sales portion was over we were forgotten.  We made the deal and were turned over to troy in thee financial department.  We had agreed to make a downpayment with some money that was coming in to us and wrote a check.  We soon learned thar the money was not going to be enough and contacted Troy, letting him know that this would not be possible and needed to make other arrangements.  He said OK he would work something out, then he blew us off, cashed the checks anyway and to this day will not return any of our calls.  We had financed two vehicles that night, over a month ago.  I still have not recieved any information on one of my trucks.  My payment is due, but I have no idea where to send my payment account # or anything.  Of course Troy will not answer or return myt phone calls.I feel like once you sign the papers you are forgotten.  He even told us when we were trying to work things out that we had signed the contract.  So I guess that means we are screwed!!!",1.0
