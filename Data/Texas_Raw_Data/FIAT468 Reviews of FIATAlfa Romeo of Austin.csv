0,"March 21, 2018","First let me say for those who buy a certified used car the lifetime warranty on the engine, and transmission is not through the brand of your car such as the guy whose mother bought the Audi, its is through Nyle Maxwell and it is his dealerships Forever Warranty. Don't take it to another dealer or they will charge you. 

Now with that out of the way I took my daughter here to buy her first car, a Fiat 500 pop, and they were kind and courteous, and when I asked for 500 more on my trade in they gave it to me without a fight. Also they got the interest rate MUCH lower than what we were expecting for my daughter's first car. 

A week later we get a call from the dealership and they need my wife and daughter to come back in because they've been able to get a better deal on the costs and my daughter's payment will be even lower than what it was originally. 

That is great service from a great little dealership. And for those wanting loaner cars? Fiats are low entry cost cars. They don't have a lot of margin built in to cover things like loaner cars, so don't be expecting the moon when you are buying the moon. ",5.0
1,"September 21, 2016","Courtney, a parts advisor, was absolutely terrible. I tried calling to get a spare key made and she was not having it. Polite as my phone voice was, Courtney's tone was pointed and rushed. I kindly asked her to reach out to the company I have paying for the key and she abruptly tells me "" I won't call them. They have to call me""... OK, first of all CHILL. I can have that done, it's literally just a phone call. I have the company call Courtney's direct phone line, but she is so unwilling to help and, although I have them contact her, there was no resolve. She didn't budge. So at this point, I'm furious. WE HAVE THE PAYMENT READY, yet Courtney is unwilling to accept it for whatever personal reason. She didn't even bother to call me back. I had to call back. I don't know where she gets being so rude from, but it's certainly not acceptable or appreciated in this field of work.

I called back and spoke to Cassandra and let her know about my dissatisfaction with Courtney. I was ready to take my business elsewhere, however Cassandra is helpful and willing to listen. She tells me that they will call the 3rd party paying for the key and get this sorted out. Courtney still had to email me my receipt and even her emails were vapid. When I arrived to pick up my key, Courtney hands me the new key and tells me that I have to pay to get it programmed. WHAT? With all the straight to the point emails she had sent me, she never once mentioned that I would also have to have it programmed for an additional fee, which meant getting my 3rd party re-involved.  All it would have taken was a simple explanation via email, but she neglects to inform me. I legit thought that after we had paid the $175 for the key we were ready, set, go! Nope. There's an addition $73 fee to program it. Whomp, whomp, whomp. The price was not the issue, but Courtney's complete lack of communication was deplorable.

This was my first experience with Fiat Austin and it truly deserved a one star review due to Courtney's salty attitude. However, I'll give credit where it's due and Cassandra shined through. Also, Craig in parts was very helpful and was able to speedily process the new payment for processing and had me on my way. If I have to get another part from this FIAT, I'll again request to work around Courtney or find another place.",1.6
2,"May 02, 2016","DO NOT buy from this greedy dealership! They have a ""promotional gift card"" when you buy that you will never actually see. I have been led around in circles with this issue and have yet to receive it. Is it that difficult to find an honest, understanding car establishment today? So sad",1.0

4,"March 29, 2016","My car has been in the service department for 3 days.  For 2 days I was told ""we don't know what the problem is.""  Keep in mind that this is a FIAT and I took it to a FIAT dealership service department.  Day 3 the plan is to change the battery and see if that works.  Oh, and there is no loaner car.  No loaner car at a car dealership..

I should have taken it to a local garage.  My thought was that a FIAT dealer would be able to work on a FIAT.",1.0
5,"March 19, 2016","My 70 year old Mother had recently purchased a nice little secondhand Audi that fit her budget, she was a bit reluctant untill the sales person told her that the vehicle she wanted came with a lifetime warranty on the engine, transmission and turbo as long as she kept record of all oil changes. That got her attention, so she purchased the vehicle. Needless to say...  my mother proudly took her Audi to the Audi dealership to have it serviced, and while she was waiting on her car she asked about a few things, one of them being that warranty that FIAT of Ausin had boasted about, and guess what!  Ya. The Audi dealership told her that there was no such thing and that no dealership would offer that kind of warranty. She was also told that the car had gone under a vigorous inspection and passed with flying colors. Guess what! $1200.00 of engine repairs had to be done! You can bet your bottom dollar that this will be going yo the BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU! So thanks for lying to my Mother, a senior citizen, I hope you are proud of yourselves  FIAT/ALPHA ROMEO of Austin...anything to make a sale, aint that right.",3.3

8,"March 10, 2016","I came down from San Angelo after talking with Gregory about purchasing a Fiat. There was a black convertible on the showroom floor that I just had to have. Gregory along with The manager put the deal together so my purchase was possible. Shortly after signing the papers I was out the door and on my way home before the storm!! I love the car and would recommend the dealer to my friends.

9,"March 07, 2016","After doing a lot of car shopping, I got the car I wanted at a good price. The dealership warranty on the engine and drive train tipped the scales away from another excellent option. I also much appreciate how everyone at Fiat/Alfa-Romeo of Austin stayed focused -- no messing around and time-consuming haggling.",5.0

11,"February 29, 2016","Many thanks to Jonathan More for his assistance with our recent purchase of a 2012 Fiat 500. Jonathan was courteous, professional, and knowledgeable about the car and the buying process. he ensured that we were interested in buying prior to having the credit process started so we wouldn't have an unnecessary credit check on our record.

12,"February 29, 2016","Not too many people can say that they enjoyed their car buying experience, but I really did. Brett was so knowledgeable about the 500X I was interested in. He showed me many of the features that I was looking for in the Lounge edition, and I was hooked!  I felt that I got a great deal on my FIAT and a really fair deal on my trade in. I look forward to many years with my car, and will be recommending this dealership to all my friends. ",5.0
13,"February 28, 2016","I love my Fiat!  Although I have had several problems with my Fiat Lounge, the service department has made all of this more than okay.

15,"February 26, 2016","I bought a used 2013 Abarth that still had factory warranty coverage. Sean and Teofil really went above and beyond for me since my purchase. They were prompt and honest with answering my questions when I took the car in to reglue the rocker panel cladding under the doors, checked out some other issue and also tested my car out when my battery went dead. One my first visit to the service department I was coming in late after work and needed a ride home. Teofil was just getting off his shift and offered me a ride back. The guys in the sales department were also top notch. Never pushy and not interested in just making a sale. They have kept in contact with me since I bought the.

17,"February 25, 2016","I could not say enough wonderful things about this dealership, my salesman Josh Esquivel, the finance department and even the service department i got to speak with. It was probably the easiest car buying experience i have hands down ever had! Josh went above and beyond in finding the perfect car for me that i was not even looking for (i was actually in the market for a used car) but he brought out the new Fiat 500x Crossover and I fell in love with it! it is such a fun car and i love driving it! When i came into sign papers for the car, Josh had them all ready and it seriously took under 10 minutes.  Everyone there was so friendly and so very accommodating. And even after i purchased the vehicle, the few questions i had about a few things i responded to immediately!. So even after you drive away, the customer service caries on. If you are in the market for a new car or even a used one, this dealership is absolutely the place to go and Please ask for Josh Esquivel! ",5.0

19,"February 23, 2016",We recently purchased our new Fiat 500X trekking model from Fiat Alfo Romeo of Austin. The service we received was exceptional. I would recommend this dealership and Johnathan to anyone. We started out not knowing anything about Fiats. Johnathan gave us the lowdown on the vehicles and the company. He knew the answer to every question we had and got excited with us every step along the way. When it came time for purchase the management and finace team team did everything in their power to get us the best deal. We didn't have the best credit so they called everyone out there for us making sure that we got a deal within our price range. They also were very helpful and gave us extra wiggle room with our trade. The staff is amazing; full of knowledge and patience. I would hands down recommend this dealership to anyone in the market for a vehicle. ,4.8

23,"February 20, 2016","Dealing with FIAT of Austin was a breeze. Very smooth process. They listened to me and knew exactly what I wanted in the car. Worked with Brett and he is more than helpful. Overall, we had a great experience buying a car from them. Trading in with them was super easy, and the finance dude got me a great interest rate. Score!!!

27,"February 18, 2016"," First off I would like to say that this review has nothing to do with the sales person that took care of my purchase he was the only good point about my  experience with this car dealership.  I purchased a 2016 Fiat 500 X which I love so it's not about the car either.. I purchased the car on 2/16/2016 drove it off the lot that night my husband wanted to check the car out and he walked around the car and found a nail in the tire - we were 2 blocks from the dealership, but since it was late we couldn't turn around... I opened up the extra key and found that there was a problem with that because I had the remote the key to get in the door was missing and yes I checked the whole envelope.. So the next morning I message my sales guy and he told me to contact his manager in which I did and was given a loaner car which was his demo, I felt uncomfortable with driving it  because it still had his personal belongings in the car  but didn't want to drive around with a nail in my tire from a car I purchased and haven't had for 24 hours... So I hear ok  here is the loaner car oh we don't have the tire in stock so we have to order it!  Please keep in mind I'm at a Fiat dealership  that I'm supposed to be able to bring my car into get it serviced but they don't have the tire  in stock!   And then I'm told they have to order my key so I have to leave my extra remote at the dealership and wait for the key which I have no problem with waiting but when you're not being informed on when you're going to receive it back  that is what concerns me! And then there's the paperwork that you sign before you drive off the lot with the car I had a cosigner that had to sign off on the paperwork to, which I understand they had to mail it to my cosigner in which that was received OK and my cosigner sent it back to the dealership  and that was received OK .  Here's the problem instead of calling me and telling me hey your paperwork is ready for you to pick up the lady that completed my paperwork dropped it in the mail sending it USPS. Yes I know the mail is slow but I should have received it by now and I haven't..  So I get told when I called the dealership oh just wait a couple more days and you should have and yet I still have nothing! So I emailed  Lisa Copeland, in which I have to say Thank You to  because that was the fastest response that I've ever received from your dealership!  I was told that I could come and pick up my paperwork the next day and I would be called or text when  it was ready to be picked up! I'm like somethings finally going right since I purchased this car in all I need now is an extra key which as of this afternoon around 6ish.  I still haven't received so by 5:30 PM I haven't heard from the dealership so I called and I was told that I was sent a text message saying that my paperwork was ready and she goes I sent the first text message   And received a response saying it was someone named Linda needless to say my name is not Linda and I never received anything from the dealership stating it was ready for me to be picked up I get to the dealership they hand me my paperwork and I missing the odometer reading for both  the car he purchased and the car I traded in..  When I asked for them I was told I didn't need them when I explained why I need them it was almost like it was a big deal for me to receive that paperwork please keep in mind they lost the original paperwork because she try to make it sound like it was a joke  and saying  she could've wrote down the address wrong.  Please keep in mind I'm still bothered by the fact they lost the original paperwork and that  I was told that the information on the paperwork is just like the information on  my drivers license that anyone could get it but it's still my personal information  along with my cosigners.  And it's being blown off by saying oh it's  not much personal information, WTH?   Right now I wished I would've never step foot in your dealership and  I could get the car I traded in back this though I love the car has been the biggest mistake I've made as far as the car purchase.  I have never been so disappointed in the way this dealership has handled this whole transaction in the wow experience that they speak of on their door,   Has been nonexistent since the  experience with the actual car salesman.  So as far as this review goes I will be contacting Nyle Maxwell  in the morning along with Lisa Copeland yet again. Good luck if you buy a car from here I hope you do not have the same experience",1.8
28,"February 15, 2016","From the time my wife and I contacted the dealership about our interest in a 2014 Jeep Cherokee, Danielle the internet sales rep, was in constant contact with us.

32,"February 06, 2016","I am writing this review after almost 10 months of buying the car but there is rationale behind it. I traded my MDX for another car to a dealer , when I came to know my car met with an accident in 2014. This was never told to me by the salesman in Fiat Of Austin and he almost charged me for the car which was clean of any damage or issues, which is definitely not acceptable.
Charge is a different thing but the sheer fact that this was hidden from me made me really upset. 
In fact , the Carfax that was given to me didn't show that either that time . I don't know who manipulated it.",1.0

36,"January 31, 2016","I went in knowing exactly what vehicle I wanted, a 2015 Chrysler C200 that they had.

48,"January 20, 2016","I have been looking for a new car for almost 8 months before I showed up at FIAT/Alfa Romeo of Austin (located off 183) I had spotted a car online that interested me so I called the dealership and asked if I could set up a test-drive. Melanie on the phone was excellent, thank you! 

They pulled the car around to the front and warmed it up for me before I got there-- when I arrived I was walking in the front door and immediately encountered Brandon who was my sales expert that day. 

The day I arrived was his 10th year anniversary with the company and everyone in the sales office threw a very nice little get-together to congratulate him (cake included!) they offered me some which I thought was nice but I refused. 

I work nights so when I go to a dealership my biggest hassle is that I'm exhausted and they take FOREVER to get anything done-- however, even with his party going on and all the action around him, Brandon was incredibly quick and so was his team and within a few hours I was finished and driving away in my new Fiat. 

I'm a first time car buyer, they made the paperwork easy to understand and quick to process. They're very willing to work with you! 

Thank you so much to the amazing team at FIAT/Alfa Romeo of Austin! Also a big THANK YOU to Brandon and congrats on 10 years, you rock!

Ultimately, he found the Perfect car for me that checked every box. Very nice guy.

52,"January 13, 2016","I cannot say enough great things about Ms. D'Amato! I purchased a hot, little Abarth from Fiat of Austin's Brandon Grebe. A situation arose months after purchase.

I went in there wanting a GMC Terrain which was sold already fell in love with a Honda Pilot but due to me having no credit at all the bank wouldn't finance it being used. Angela said your not leaving until we get you in a car today and she made it happen. I ended up getting a 2016 Fiat 500X totally opposite what I was looking at and I fell in love with it. This is my very first brand new car ever always bought used cars. So thank you Angela and Josh ya'll rock.

63,"December 18, 2015","So we fell in love with the Fiat 500L lounge and had a great experience dealing with Josh. He was not at all pushy and was knowledgeable. We were ready to sign with Josh after he found the perfect car that was ""in transit."" Our first not pleasant experience was with the finance guy, Clay. He was twitchy and complained frequently how they were ""loosing"" money on our deal. This is such an annoyance but we sat through it because we really wanted the car. Our second disappointment came when the car did not arrive as soon as expected. There was no information and after 11 days I took to emailing the manager Lisa Copeland. She brought in Brent Rayfield to also follow up on information. They responded quickly to any inquiries made and both were very nice. They assisted with the unexpected delay with providing us a loaner car. Finally our new car arrived. There was a little miscommunication when the car was ready to be picked up but we finally have it 5 weeks after purchase. To make up for the delay Brent explained that they would include the spare tire we ordered and let us do November financing. I grant that the tire was a nice compensatory thing but the financing offer was a little off putting. We could have found financing else where if we knew we had over a month to look at financing options. Anyway we got the car, tire, and financing how we wanted. The second time we worked with Jennifer in financing to do the new paperwork. She was very pleasant, informative, and not at all twitchy. I would recommend this dealership because the issues were out of their control, they tried to make it right, and the ""financial"" complaints are just what you expect when dealing with car dealerships. Josh rocks and we love the car!!! ",4.3

He is incredibly patient, honest, supportive, down to earth, and and above all, he genuinely cares.

I purchased my Abarth Saturday evening~ and had it in my possession Monday night (a rental was provided of course).

Additionally, Jennifer (our finance person) was great and upfront with us on our purchase. I appreciate a person that gives you the ""no BS"" transparent answers you're looking for.

Based on similar purchases reported online, I feel I got a pretty good deal on the car overall and would happily recommend the staff at this location. Very friendly people.

81,"November 26, 2015","In 2011 I was driving my Toyota Rav 4 on the 405 in LA.  I was rear ended and knew I would have to get a rental.  I had seen the Kia Soul and I searched everywhere to rent one.  Found one at the Long Beach Airport.  I got there and they did not have a Kia Soul.  I was furious.  But I needed a car.  They rented me some generic compact car that I knew I would hate but took it anyway.  While walking to get the car in the lot I saw a little car that I had never seen before and it was the cutest car I ever saw.  Way cuter than the Kia Soul.  I ran back in to the rental office and said can I have that other little car.  I bought them outside and pointed it out.  The girl said they had just got that car and had not rented it yet.  I said that's the one I want to drive.  She changed the paper work and off I went.  It was a 2012 Fiat 500.  Well about 10 minutes into the drive I was in love.  

The past 4 years every time I needed a car I sought out the Fiat 500.  Everyday I drove it I feel more in love.  This past July my grand daughter borrowed my Rav 4 98 (which I loved) to my grand daughter.  She had it for 3 hours and totaled it.  I had to get a rental.  I searched high and low for a Fiat 500 to rent.  Could not find one anywhere.  So I called enterprise in Bastrop and lined up a compact.  I was so depressed.  They came and got me and we drove to Enterprise.  We drove into the lot and the first thing I saw was a Red Fiat 500.  I said omg please tell me that's a rental.  The girl told me no it must belong to a customer.  I frowned and went into the office.  On a fluke I asked who owned the Fiat.  One gentleman replied ""I just returned it"". I literally started jumping for joy and screaming with excitement.  I said Its mine I'll take it as is!!  Trash and all.  I had that car for two months and was beyond depressed when I had to return it.  

Well I had to find a used car and my insurance did not pay me near what my car was worth in the market so that was even more depressing.  Then I ran across a Fiat 500 for 6500 on Craigslist.  Omg I was so excited then I found out it had a rebuilt title.  Beyond depressed I thought I would go to the Fiat dealership in Sustin.  I had spoken to Brandon there to ask about a rebuilt title.  He told me they had a couple on the lot that might be affordable.  I got there and he showed me two.  One was 8000and one was 8500.  That was still to expensive but I thought I would go ahead and check.  We looked at comparison.  The one for 8500 still had a factory warranty and they offered a lifetime warranty on the engine and transmission with and extended factory warranty that would add another 50k miles or 3 years.  I had good credit.  I would not have any money to put down for a week or so.  I got a loan on the car for very low interest with no money down.  I did they paperwork and the car was mine.  But I had no way to get the car home.  Well they delivered the car to me in Bastrop on the following Monday!!  I'm beyond excited.  While waiting on Monday morning I felt like a father in a waiting room for his new baby.  Thank you Brandin for making my dream come true!!!  I just drove to San Antonio for Thanksgiving.  It cost me 5.50 in gas to drive 100 miles.  I had to get my Mom and she is in a large wheelchair.  I got the wheelchair in the back and all of my luggage with room to spare!!

FIAT also gave me a nice 2014 FIAT 500L to drive till my car is made ready!

176,"July 02, 2015","My wife and I had been shopping for a car that would suit my mother. My mother is a senior citizen with some mobility challenges and after looking at a variety of makes and models of cars, and getting more than our share of the ""used car salesman"" experience nothing seemed to fit. Looking online the Fiat 500 consistently came up at the top of the search, in our price range with great reviews. Not knowing anything about the cars we decided to take my mother down to Fiat/Alfa Romeo of Austin to check one out. The dealership had a great selection, Lauren Bane greeted us on the lot and was not only a wealth of information about the 500, she took great care in making sure that my mother was comfortable with the car. The care didn't stop at the choice of the car, Lauren and Carolina Strong were extremely thoughtful and respectful throughout the negotiation and purchase of the car. With the high level of professionalism and an atmosphere of genuine concern for our needs, I have to say that this was absolutely the best experience I've ever had in purchasing a car. What was also pleasantly surprising to me was the fit, finish, and design of Fiat cars are very clean and sophisticated, as good if not better than euro cars priced thousands more. My wife loves the 500x, Fiat/Alfa Romeo has definitely gained us as fans of the brand and loyal customers to the dealership. Thanks for the experience and a great car!

We'd been to another dealership but not ""listening"" to what the customer wanted was disappointing. We traveled to Austin and talk about a huge DIFFERENCE. Brandon was very knowledgeable about the FIAT family and we appreciated the attentiveness, professionalism given by the staff-
I will highly recommend FIAT in Austin - Brandon's customer service skills were excellent and genuine!
Thanks again!

223,"April 29, 2015","We arrived to look at a car that was already sent to another lot but Mario got it back for us next day without requiring any commitment from us. The test drive next day was a formality since we like the brand and this dealership offers a lifetime power-train warranty. There was some waiting for paperwork but all in all we completed the entire car purchase process from driving in with the trade-in to walking out with the purchased car, all of it in under 2 hours, test drive included!

The main reasons I would recommend this dealership is the absence of high pressure sales pitches, no tiring you out by making you wait for no reason, and starting with reasonable numbers for purchase price and trade-in offer. We did not feel that we had to negotiate to get the right price.

And I am sure there were a few other nice touches along the way that added to our overall high level of satisfaction.",5.0

But wait, it took several more phone calls and several more broken promises and 24 HOURS LATER my Fiat arrived at the Fiat of Austin Dealership.
I spent much time speaking with service and was assured it would be looked at immediately.....YOU GUESSED IT, it seems the only TWO technicians miraculously got very sick and the other took a vacation.  So what happens ""it will be Monday before we can possible look at it.  How soon do you need your car?"".  ARE YOU KIDDING?!?!  It is my transportation to and from the job I have to pay for the car - what do you think?  A loaner or rental would be nice.....NO WAY, it may not be covered on your 3 year, 50K mile warranty (only owned 2 years and have 36K miles) - we must wait to see if Chrysler will approve a loaner or rental, once a technician shows up to work.

263,"March 03, 2015","After visiting several dealerships in Austin, I can safely say that FIAT/Alfa Romeo of Austin sets the standard high. 

I came in looking for a used car under $10,000 and worked with Greg and Brandon to find something that would fit my needs. Not once did they suggest something out of my budget, or pressure me to try a car they wanted off the lot. Greg was cordial, respectful, and listened to my needs down to the detail. 

After looking at a couple of used vehicles which didn't excite me, Greg suggested I try a 2012 FIAT 500 which had just been traded in ... Little did I know it would be the one! Greg showed me the Carfax, and took me for a test drive. After I decided it was the right car for me, we negotiated the loan terms and I received a great price for the vehicle. 

I worked with Carolina to sign the loan, and just like Greg and Brandon she was quick, respectful and very thorough in her explanation. Less than 2 hours later I was driving home in a new car!

Overall, I would highly recommend this dealership. If you're looking for great prices and a no pressure atmosphere, look no further.

Greg listened and was genuinely receptive to what our needs were.  He worked within our timeframe; he worked within our circumstances; and provided options that reflected our expectations of a new vehicle.  Greg even understood my wife's sadness in giving up her long time Audi. Greg could have dismissed that; instead, he acknowledged my wife's feelings and handled trading in the Audit delicately.  

With Greg's professional demeanor and customer service skills, our decision to buy became relatively simple.  There was no pressure whatsoever.  While the price of the car is a determining factor, we have walked away from good deals because staff only cared about making a sale.

As a Realtor of over 23 years who relies on her vehicle more than the average person I was pleasantly surprised to locate the car on the local Fiat website.  From the moment I communicated with Ami Groves, her integrity and diligence allowed me to make quick decisions and consummate a deal.  Ami worked with Pete (manager) to fulfill EVERY promise and exceed expectations.  They made a tremendous EFFORT to finance at the LOWEST possible rate and to deliver the vehicle in perfect condition.  I'll go out of my way to make sure that everyone I know has the opportunity to interact with such a reputable dealership.  Sounds like a canned speech but it's the absolute TRUTH.

Test driving several other cars (and dealers) I arrived at Fiat of Austin. I met Kori asked to drive a used 500 sport I saw advertised. It was fun, but not quite what I wanted. 

I came back on Saturday with my family to test drive a 500 sport turbo. While they were getting the turbo ready, Lisa the general manger came and introduced herself. We chatted about cars and Italy for quite a while. What a refreshing difference from the other dealerships I've been dealing with. 

After spending most of Saturday in the turbo, I knew that this was my car. But what color? I wanted to see the silver one, but it was at their lot in Tayor. Kori offered to pick it up and drive it to the school where I teach so I could see it during my lunch break. That's great service.     ",5.0
338,"October 24, 2013","I entered the dealership just wanting to drive the new Fiat 500L and ended up driving it home that night!  I love it!  Its everything (+more) than I ever wanted at a affordable price.  I worked with Ami from the start and she was great!  She wasn't pushy, asked appropriate questions and overall did a good job and even hugged me at the end of the process.  I bought the model that was in the showroom and drove it home but the next day noticed it was dirty inside, fingerprints all over the mirrors and windows and adhesive on the doors from where the sticker was removed. I needed to bring it back a week later for it to be tinted so Ami said they would detail it as well.  When I returned to get it tinted/detailed, Ami wasn't there but told me who to ask for.  Both people were unavailable then Pete came out and asked who I worked with and what I was there for.  It took about 30 min to finally get another Fiat to drive which made me late for my next appointment.  When I arrived to pick up my car, the adhesive was still on the doors etc.  It was tinted nicely and appeared washed on the outside but still had the same issues inside.  I ended up having to clean it myself the next day.  A few days later I started receiving calls from the dealership asking me to come back again asap to sign my title, which each one said they had. I had to tell Ami I wasn't available and to please tell the other 2 callers that I will return when I can to sign it but when I do return, who really has my title?  I do feel that everyone was really nice, respectful and pleasant to work with but the lack of communication is an issue and in my situation, I ""paid"" for it.  ",3.8

342,"August 31, 2013","I was contacted within an hour of my initial query to the dealership (in spite of the fact that it was late in the evening), and although I was not in the area yet, and wouldn't be for another month, Drew and I talked several times, discussing what my needs were, and we quickly set up an appointment to test drive the model in question.  When I arrived at the dealership a month later, Drew was ready to go, answering my questions and pointing out key features of the car during the test drive (including some things that people not familiar with a European car might not know, as FIATs are definitely different from your typical American auto).  

During the negotiations for buy/lease, Drew was very diligent in trying to get me the car I wanted at a price I could live with, being very patient with me while I messaged my wife (who hadn't joined me in Austin yet, but handles our finances) with the different options.  

After negotiations were over, Drew introduced me to Lisa, the GM, who asked about any concerns I had and wanted to make sure I was satisfied (I was).  

The next day, after I emailed Drew letting him know I was going for the lease option, I met with Katie, who explained the various options, and was able to negotiate for a discount on one option on my behalf.  She was also patient with me while I messaged my wife back and forth and made sure that the options (which we hadn't figured into the pricing) were OK.  She even offered to restart the paperwork and switch to a purchase if that turned out to be a better deal.  Ultimately, we decided to go with the lease, and 2 out of the three options (one of which they threw in for free).  

When pickup day came around, I had a tricky issue in that I had to drop off my rental car in Round Rock, and needed to get a ride to the dealer.  Drew came and picked me up at the rental office, in my new car.  Once at the dealership, he activated the navigation system, demonstrated every feature imaginable in the car, and did a walk-around with me so I could identify any minor defects (there was one).  They were unable to apply the resistall beforehand, due to the weather (a rare rainy day in Austin), so we made an appointment for me to come back and get that done (this will be tomorrow, as a matter of fact).  

All in all, my experience with FIAT of Austin, and with Drew (and to a lesser degree, Katie and Lisa) has been excellent.  Drew is a bright young guy, with a great sense of humor and an easygoing manner that quickly puts people at ease.  The reviews online for this dealership have been excellent, one of the reasons I went here in the first place, and now I can see why.  I would definitely recommend anyone looking for a car in the Austin area consider FIAT of Austin, and Drew Barker specifically.  Thanks, Drew!",5.0

345,"August 02, 2013","Brandon was super professional, and friendly.  I had my heart, and mind set on a car that wasn't a new Fiat.  The Fiat's are awesome BTW, I've just wanted a Smart car for years. 

I looked around quite a few places for the Smart car I wanted. They had the lowest price I found for a Smart that was in many cases more 'loaded' than the other places I looked. I never felt pressured to buy another car with a bigger sticker price. The idea was out there. I did get an opportunity to look around and I would recommend a new Fiat. But, I got the car I've wanted for years. 

Brandon was plain spoken and helped work out a deal I could afford.  Brandon had the vehicle I wanted placed inside on a very very hot day which I found really considerate (I'm a disabled Vet.) He thanked me for my service sincerely in a personal way that wasn't canned, or offhanded.  

I've bought several cars in my life. This dealership, and sales person was by far the most comfortable I've been buying a car. On that hot day, there nice cold water. The other people I spoke to were friendly. I didn't get any of the typical lines you expect when buying a car (ie, 'You'd look great in a ___' or 'If you like that you'd love a ___.')  I was in the driver's seat with my wants and needs (pun totally intended.)  

I feel great about my decision. I got a good deal with great payments. The financing office was eager, willing, and professional. I felt like I was personally catered to the whole time.  And now, I have the Smart I've wanted for years with a good warranty putting my mind at ease. I'm zipping all over town having a great time in my tiny car. 

(tl;dr) Bought a car I really wanted for a good price. People there are awesome. Would recommend.

348,"July 19, 2013","Recently visited Fiat of Austin to see about purchasing a vehicle for our business and quickly learned why they are the #1 Fiat store in the country---the culture at Fiat of Austin is certainly not typical of most dealerships and that 'cool culture' starts at the top.  Lisa Copeland, General Manager, was extremely helpful in giving us all the insight we needed for a business purchase and is a very visible GM--she's not just sitting in a back office dictating.  JT Copeland helped us with picking out the right unit and is very professional and helpful--the apple didn't fall far from that tree.  We also worked with both Katie and Brent with getting our paperwork completed and they were both great to work with--even when we had to re-do it because of an error on our part.

Great experience, great culture, great staff---highly recommend.

I get the feeling that Brandon saw that right away and adapted his ""sales"" appropriately.  I put ""sales"" in quotations because he didn't try to sell me a truck, he simply tried to earn my business.  No pressure.  No tactics.   I'm a car guy.  I've been in the automotive repair industry for years and have bought my share of cars with various experiences ranging from ""Get me out of here now"" to ""Thank goodness, this was simple and straightforward.""  The latter is where Brandon falls.  I get the feeling he can perceive the type of shopper you are immediately and adapts his personality appropriately.  Very professional.   I'm not there to screw the dealership, and they're not there to take me for every dollar.  I believe we both got fair deals where I'm happy with the truck and they made money on the sale.

He has already been helping me with post sales questions about my car.  He is a keeper!",5.0

She was professional, caring and competent in all aspects of the purchase.

I highly recommend her and her team to those interested in purchasing their next new car.  Nice work!",4.6
352,"July 07, 2013","Lots of cheers for Drew Barker -- he was terrific!! He was friendly, responsive, informative and anticipated my needs given that I had to purchase a vehicle basically online without having the opportunity for an ocular inspection (something I have never done before).  Drew helped me locate reputable car inspectors so that I could get reasonable assurance that the used vehicle I purchased was in good shape, and ensured that all the paperwork and procedures were done in a timely way (....thanks, too, to Katie King for her efforts on the paperwork....) so that, once I arrived in Austin, I could just pick up the car and drive out. Drew also assisted in getting me to the right car insurance person with whom I obtained insurance for the vehicle -- quickly and seamlessly.

I had hoped that the price would have been lowered a bit more meaningfully than it was -- there was only a marginal drop in price when we negotiated which I thought could have been better for a used 2012 vehicle.  But that has nothing to do with Drew -- I guess the price was set by his supervisor or manager of Fiat of Austin and I am sure that Drew tried his best to get the best discount he could.

If I purchase another vehicle, I hope to have the opportunity to deal with Drew Barker once again -- nice work, Drew!!

355,"July 02, 2013","I have wanted to get a FIAT since they first hit the American shores and two years after the FIAT Studio opened here in Austin I finally got one. I had done my research and knew the brand well and I had heard of the customer service the The Austin store was known for but to experience it first hand was a whole other thing.
 
I started shopping through USAA which automatically emailed my info to Drew Barker at FIAT. The very next day he emailed me to touch base and get some information. With the amount of hours I work it wound up being 4 days of emails back and forth before I met him in person. By then we had my trade in information done and the model I was looking for taken care of.

When I found I had time to stop by the studio I wasn't able to let Drew know so he was with a customer when I got there but he graciously introduced me to Ms. Amy Groves who answered every question, worked with me on my trade in USAA information and got me on my way. 
I have to mention by the way that because I got there at 6pm and the Studio closes at 7 both of them stayed late to make sure everything was taken care of.

Thank you both for making it such a fun and easy experience to get my new FIAT 500. I can see now why you both work at the number one dealership in North America.",5.0

He was very informative of the details on the vehicle and very pleasant to work with on the closing, so as you see he did sell me on the vehicle. He also, even after the sell helped me to find a set of important keys that I had left at the dealership that day and didn't notice till later they were missing. I text him about the problem, his response was quick in helping me with the issue, needless to say, I have my set of keys back!

That's when I met the lovely Mrs. Kristi--its one thing to calm my step-mom on the fact that we're getting the BEST deal, it's another to get me to feel comfortable with doing something that I'm already on the fence about. I can assure you I would not have bought my 500 POP had it not been for the assurance I got from Kristi by going through the process of buying my FIRST car step-by-step. At the time she was in sales, but I believe she's been promoted since, which is smart on the part of her bosses. She's great and deserves every bit of happiness and success she's earned.

This Fiat dealership is focused on customer loyality and wants you to not only enjoy a Fiat but be part of their family. When I arrived I was welcomed in a very friendly manner, and was offered water or coffee before anything. I was treated with respect and was introduced to a culture and a car I knew nothing about.

Ami worked with us the most and she was great, incredibly helpful, incredibly nice we liked working with her. When we bought our 2nd Fiat on 4/6 it went slower than we'd of liked but it was still a good experience. Brandon had a customer that ran over so had to pass us off to Amber, unfortunately Ami was out that day, we'd of loved to work with her again. Drew told us where we could go for lunch while we waited for the car to get in from the 620 location on 3/30, Omar handed me a cup of water when I started coughing on 4/8, Lisa made us feel very valued as customers. Brandon worked to find us what we were looking for and even though he couldn't spend a lot of time with us made us feel like he'd of liked too.

384,"February 12, 2013","Ciao,
I was in contact with Brandon Gebe about a pre-owned BMW 335I Convertible. My wife and I traveled from Hurst Texas, about 200 miles, spent the night in Austin and visited the dealership te next day. We talked with Brandon and took a test drive. The vehicle met all the expectations he told us about. I had arranged my own financing when I left Hurst and after visiting with Brandon and their financial team, Brent and Katy King, they worked with several institutions and provided me a lower interest rate that was very impressive, and lower than I left home with. I must say they were all very professional and when my wife and I left Austin for our drive back to Hurst, we honestly felt that we had spent the morning, about 3-31/2 hours, on a social visit with friends. They were just great to do business with and did all they could to satisfy us and leave the entire decision to us to buy the vehicle. It was truly an honest and truthful transaction. We would definitely travel to Fiat of Austin for a vehicle in the future without a doubt. A very good, enjoyable and satisfying large purchasing experience. we want to thank all of you for your advice and honesty without any pressure on all of our questions and thoughts. Looking forward to do business with all of you in the future. You guys certainly have our recommendations and support. meni, meni graziel,-- Frank & Jackie Gillest, Hurst Texas.

Omar found the exact color and style vehicle my wife and I wanted, and had it delivered and detailed the very next business day.

She guided me through the different models, and after discussing my performance needs introduced me to the new 2013 Turbo, which fit what I was looking for perfectly.

My car was delivered to my home after work, Amber went over all my controls, how the computer works & answered all my questions, never pressed or rushing. 
Over all, my Fiat experience may have been the best customer experience I have had in some time, and customer service is something that is lacking in most business these days, and something Fiat of Austin has in abundance!

When I told them that I had to wait till after the first of the year before I can get one they was still extremely helpful and never once did I feel pressured nor did I ever feel like I was ever given a cold shoulder just because I was there looking not buying - like has happened at other dealerships.
Highly recommend Fiat of Austin and especially Amber -- She is extremely knowledgeable when it comes to these cars!!! I will definitely be going back there in about 6 more weeks...counting down the time till I get my new car!!!!!!!!

404,"December 04, 2012","What an enjoyable experience it was to do business with this dealership.  This business definitely redefines the new car experience.  Amber was personable and knowledgeable about the product. She is quick to find out answers and quite attentive to the customer.  Never once did I feel pressured.  I walked in that day for a test drive and drove away with a 2013 Fiat 500 Lounge.  Since that day, I have stopped in a couple of times and received the same high level of customer service that I experienced the first time.  Everyone that I have talked to who works there owns one of these awesome cars.  I think that it says something when an employee purchases for themselves something that they sell.  The whole Fiat experience is awesome!",5.0
405,"November 30, 2012","Great dealership experience. 

They didn't attack me when I arrived but were very responsive when I came inside and looked like I wanted to talk to someone. Amber took the resposibility of helping me with what I needed and Lisa greeted me and introduced herself as well. Amber went over the product line and the differences between the models. Since this would be for my 19 year old daughter talked about budget advantages of the Fiat, including that it used regular gas,the mileage and it that needed oil changes less often. After determining what my daughter would be in the market for we went out an looked over the details and when I asked for a test drive Amber went and got a car very quickly and we drove off. She asked a few more questions of what my daughter may be looking for and how she might be using it. 

She pointed out the features of the vehicle including the ""sport"" handling button and the fact that the 5 speed manual had a ""hill assist"" feature since my daughter would be a new ""standard"" driver. After we returned she mentioned that they had their cars ""off"" the lot since the dealership was essentially in a shopping center and was willing to take me on the short drive to the lot to check out the specific color and style of the car my daughter would be interested in. 

Great job overall and she was more interested in getting me what would be the most appropriate car for my daughter for price and features rather than trying to upsell me on something we didn't really need. ",5.0

She's contagiously enthusiastic about Fiats and really cares about her customers' satisfaction. I absolutely loved my experience with Drew, my salesperson. I've walked out on literally every car salesperson I've encountered because they've been overbearing and don't seem to listen or care about what I really want. They seem to just try to talk me into what they want me to own. Drew listened and was warm and friendly with me. After just a few minutes I realized I could discuss my concerns with him and he would give me honest and open replies. I didn't feel pushed at all but felt supported and helped by him. I've never bought a car from a salesperson because of their usual pushy, pumped-up tactics, but I bought a car from Drew! He clearly and thoroughly answered every question I had and made the car buying experience seamless, stressless and quick. I think I spent a total of an hour and forty-five minutes with him including test driving. Also, Katie King the finance manager is very amiable and a real pleasure to talk to. It was important to her that I left satisfied and happy with my experience with her. She didn't try to sell, she just explained, and I bought many warranties from her, which are the best warranties I've ever seen. Overall I'm excited to have bought my car from a dealership I actually look forward to interacting with in the future. I'm definitely sending my friends and family their way! ",5.0

I was in with my old car to test drive a Fiat, and I was driving out with a super new Fiat in 2 hours.

I did not have any pre-conceived ideas on Fiat and really was not intending to buy one. I have been a Mazda fan and came in because of the promotion that the dealership was running. However, once I got there I started looking at the vehicles and Amber Barnett accompanied my wife and I on a test drive. I was impressed but still on the fence about buying a Fiat. I was impressed by the enthusiasm of Amber and all her colleagues and the Used car sales manager gave me a really good offer for my Mazda 3 Sport. To make things even more appealing, I was approved for 0% fianancing! Deal!! Katie got us on track with the paperwork quickly and courteously. Later I cam back to get my plates and Brian installed them quickly and was friendly, courteous and also was charged up about the dealership.Matt Reinhart corrected a problem with bluetooth contacts in the ""Blu and Me"" system and it works flawlessly. He is really knowlegeable about the car.

I had some issues with Ally Bank later  and Brent Rayfiled went to bat for me right away - he called Ally and called me up later. I was impressed with how he kept at it and realized that he probably had quite a few of these issues to deal with because of the high volume of vehicles.

415,"May 09, 2012","I've been a Fiat owner for a long time (I bought a 124 Sport in 1986) and have loved that car ever since I bought it. I was thrilled when Fiat's came back with the 500.  Although I had tons of great memories with my old Fiat, I traded it in on a new 500 Sport.  

From when my wife and I first walked into the dealership, we were treated great and Katie was engaged and very helpful.  She was very well spoken and not at all pushy, just very helpful.  I had to test drive a 5 speed manual because after 20+ years of driving my previous Fiat, I just couldn't do an automatic.  She lined up a test drive and from then on I was hooked.

Yeah, it was a bit sad when I drove my old faithful Fiat to the dealership but I know they will find it a good home.  Katie and the Austin Fiat crew took great care of me and my family as we got our new Fiat 500.  The entire buying experience was nothing but pleasant - no pushy upsells or add ons forced on me.  We took a bunch of pictures of the old and new Fiat and the kids said goodbye to one Fiat and hello to the other.

I've had it for about a week and a half and I've already put ~600 wonderful miles on it.  I am truly thrilled to get behind the wheel and that car never fails to impress me.  With a car this nice, it will be another 20 years before I'm ready to part with it. Of course, my 10 year old daughter is already wanting to make that her first car.

I wanted a Fiat, but I needed to make sure it drove well and was comfortable and easy to get in and out of.I would not have bought it if I did not like it.  I also would not have bought a Fiat if I was uncomfortable with the people at the dealership or if I could not have afforded the monthly payment.  The ease of entry and exit is especially important to me at my age(60).
I had an appointment at the dealership with Brandon Grebe (through the internet and phone calls), but I ended up going in a day early because of changes in my schedule.  The salesperson I met with, Clark Simensen, did not pressure me.  We went for a test drive over neighborhood streets and highways.  We then spent time talking about the features and price including my trade in.
I then met with the finance people.  Again-no pressure.  Also chatted with the dealership manager who had on fantastic shoes.
Got the car I wanted that had the features and color I wanted.  Drove home with the top down.

433,"December 20, 2011","After finding out my car was irreparable shortly before Christmas, my husband and I began our search for a used vehicle.  Within a few hours of online searches, and referrals to many places, we ran across a listing for a used PT Cruiser at Fiat of Austin.  Comparing their listing to others in the area was nearly a day and night contrast.  Fiat had, in my mind, a superior vehicle and more competitive price than any other listing we had come across in the Austin area.  Fiat even had a Carfax report available online to view, so we had piece of mind knowing that it was unlikely there were any undesirable events that occurred during the history of this vehicle.  They also have (when applicable) a limited lifetime warranty on the major engine and transmission parts.  That warranty alone left most of their competition in the dust.

We contact Fiat first via their website and reached Brandon Grebe.  We quickly from that point exchanged phone numbers and began to verify that the particular car we were looking at was still available, and started working on a test drive appointment.  Despite some scheduling conflicts, a little over 24 hours later (and even with my three year old with us) I was test driving the vehicle.  It handled well, drove great, I could sit up higher off the ground than with usual vehicles... and it even had a moon roof!  Despite my husband being unable to join me for the test drive, we had decided that if I was still happy with the vehicle after the test drive that we were going to ""go for it.""  I initially got there around 10am for my test drive, and by 12:30 (maybe earlier) I was driving away in my new-to-me used car.  

Brent Rayfield, the Finance Director and Used Car Manager, made buying the vehicle very simple and painless.  We purchased it outright, but I do not doubt if we had financed that he would have gone above and beyond to earn our business.  He offered very reasonable extended warranty options on the vehicle, and once again outlined their limited lifetime warranty.  I was very please with my experience there- and they were very accommodating even with my three year old during the process.

I ran into one vehicular problem within 48 hours of leaving the dealership, but it was a problem that could have never been foreseen and prevented.  There were cracks in my back taillight lenses, and Austin experienced an unusually high amount of rain following the purchase of the vehicle.  The rain found it's way into the cracks and shorted out the bulbs.  But after contacting Brandon, and their used vehicle service center, I was able to schedule a service and have the problem repaired and resolved quickly, and with no cost to me.  I feel they really went above and beyond their duty to make sure I was a happy and satisfied customer.  Many new car dealerships will cater to you regarding their used inventory until the point that you drive off their lot.  This was far from the truth for Fiat of Austin.  They have made me so happy- it was like a Christmas miracle for my family.  I will most definitely refer others to check out Fiat of Austin, and if I am ever in the market for a new, or used vehicle, I will check with them first next time.",5.0
434,"December 19, 2011","I did some research on the new small car I wanted.  SmartCar, Mini and FIAT. A couple people said look at the Focus and I strongly declined.  I wanted to look good in the car I drive.
Brandon was helpful since I asked him to educate me on why I should by a FIAT. and I asked him to find a color combination and drive-train that was not handy. Brandon did a good job helping me drive home in the car I liked. He also answered the many questions and got the answers to the questions he needed to ask someone else.

Lisa,(GM)insured me they would find and get me what I wanted and most important they made it work in my budget. Lisa and Brent,(GSM)really did a awesome job making me feel important and comfortable with the total package.

448,"August 27, 2011","I've never offered up a review for a car dealer before. But feel compelled to do so for FIAT of Austin, where buying my new car was actually a pleasurable, totally unstressful experience. Absolutely the best new car buying experience ever! 

Everyone at FIAT of Austin treats customers like friends & family. Really. No pressure to buy on the spot, no swarming salespeople, no nagging calls and emails, and none of that ""Gee, I'll have to check with my manager"" runaround. FIAT of Austin takes an entirely different approach that I noticed the moment I walked in to the FIAT studio. Imagine walking into a dealership and being warmly welcomed by nice, friendly people rather than feeling like you're being circled by hungry sharks. 

Everyone at FIAT of Austin is attentive, genuinely friendly, and extremely knowledgeable, and NOT pushy. They don't rush the process. What impressed me right from the start is they seem to respect and understand that buying a new car is a big deal for most people. They encourage everyone to take their time, to test drive all the models if they wish and to choose their perfect version of what I think is the best, most affordable new small car on the market: FIAT. 

I came back two or three times to test drive different models and transmission choices, and to check out the many exterior and interior color options available. I never once felt pressured to buy, and when I was ready to purchase, the experience got even better. They negotiated great financing and didn't pressure me to buy a bunch of extras I didn't want, didn't need, or couldn't afford. They didn't even rush me with the paperwork signing. Wow. Such a refreshing difference. I've already recommended this dealership to others. I love my new FIAT and I love FIAT of Austin.

I wanted to thank you and your team, specifically Katie King, for the BEST car buying experience I have ever had.  I have purchased 3 cars on my own in these past 4 years, and have always dreaded the standard dealership experience.  The last time I bought a car there were a few choice words, throwing my hands in the air, and walking out-never to buy a car from THAT dealership again.  My husband seemed to thrive on the tension, the long and exhausting price reduction arguments, and the dreaded ""car salesmen"" tactics.  As a professional sales woman, I use to walk into the dealership with my guard way up, ready for a fight.  My husband and I would strategize our angles before even entering the dealership!  How insane!?
 
This past Saturday afternoon we casually walked into Fiat of Austin to test drive the new 500C.  No intention of buying that afternoon.  The next day we talked it over and we knew, we had to have that car.  We looked at the available colors and features online and anxiously awaited the dealership opening on Monday!  We were at Fiat by 10am the next morning, ready to wheel and deal.  I said to Kevin, ""we have a 50/50 shot at getting this car.  I will only pay X per month, I need X on my trade in, I wont be pressured into the color I dont want, etc...don't get excited yet"".   
 
We are VERY happily driving our 500C with all the features we wanted and in the color we love.  The pricing was straight forward and every person we came in contact with, from Lisa to Katie to the finance guy was helpful and honest.  I have gone into the finance room with a big aggressive male sitting 3 feet above me and immediately wanted to walk out.  This finance room at Fiat of Austin was the farthest thing from intimidating and everything worked out extremely well.  We were driving off to lunch in our new car that very same day!
 
I would absolutely recommend this dealership to all of my friends, family, and associates based solely on our experience.  Even if we hadn't bought a car, I would still recommend Fiat of Austin.
 
It was an absolute pleasure and we both will not forget this experience or the pure joy we felt driving home our new convertible.  Of course, we were ecstatic about the car, but it was nice not to leave a car dealership with a bad feeling.  Not to mention, we left with our car all set up and bluetooth ready to go (thanks Katie!).  Thank you for creating this experience and expect many referrals from us!
 
Keep in touch!
 
Sincerely,

455,"June 27, 2011","Arrived for my test drive appointment, after picking a car in stock online the previous night. Brandon introduced himself and explained the car showing me the interesting buttons and what they do. The test drive was such a treat. The car handles so nicely and reminds me of when I lived in Italy. Brandon was very helpful in selling me my Fiat 500, Lisa did the negotiations and Matt the financing and all made this purchase a pleasure. The showroom was packed with people and lots of sales were in the final stages. Everyone was friendly and helpful. The showroom is clean. Their product is incredible! The purchasing process was a very good experience. Brandon followed up checking on how my Fiat 500 was doing and asking if I have any questions for him to answer. 

Neighbors and friends have been asking me about my Fiat 500 and within two days I have given out three of Brandon's cards. He helped me find the right car, I figure he can help them too.",5.0
456,"June 13, 2011","I am very pleased with the service I was provided by Fiat of Austin.  I have been in the market for a new car for months and have had some not great experiences with people in the car sales indusrty.  Both of the representatives I worked with at Fiat of Austin were polite, not pushy and very helpful.  I have no credit score so I realize that I am not a desirabel candidate for a loan, Brent worked to get me the best possible interest rate and even explained that I could refinance in 7 months.  He said if I had any issues trying to refinance to come into the dealership and he would help me.  In addition to the agreed price for my car, the finance manager went above and beyond to get information concerning my trade-in.  It is a salvaged titled car (from hail damage) and he contacted multiple people regarding getting the best price for me on if I were to trade it in.  I decided to sell myself but was told that if I had any issues getting it sold, he would be happy to provide me with the numbers of wholesalers who would certainly take care of me.  All in all, I feel very satisfied with my service, my car and the staff I dealt with during my purchase of a car from Fiat of Austin.",4.8
457,"June 03, 2011","This was NOT a regular car dealership experience. Fiat of Austin's staff is very friendly and takes customer service very serious. They care to keep you updated on what your status is and work with you to make your dream come true. 
When I picked-up my car, they were ready for me and I was in and out. The vehicle and it's feature was described to me in full length before I left the dealership. If I were to buy another car I would buy it from Fiat of Austin again!",5.0
458,"May 20, 2011","I was one of the first to get a fiat 500 from this dealership back in March, and I had a lovely experience! We all were so excited to get the shipments in, and I had to wait for everything to come into place while they sorted everything out, but everyone was so helpful and nice! Katie kept me informed every step of the way and genuinely cared about my experience and satisfaction. The store is super nice, and the car delivery party was a blast. My fiat is so much fun and I love it! Lisa even made time for me and made sure I was completely satisfied with my experience. Great place to go, and great people to work with! Everyone should go check out fiat of Austin when shopping for a small car with great personality, the customer experience is half of the process and you won't find anyone better than them at giving each customer the attention and care that they could ever want!

459,"May 19, 2011","This dealership and its staff are outstanding.  I can't say enough good things about them.  They actually made the complete process of buying and financing a new vehicle enjoyable.  They are an enthusiastic group with an incredible product.  The design consultant, Matt, was the best because he was knowledgeable about the product, eager to explain all aspects of each model, and, after the purchase, went through every feature of the vehicle with me, including syncing my cell phone with the vehicle’s hands-free technology.   Matt is a consummate professional without any of the high pressure sales pitch and I appreciate that immensely.  When it came time for financing, Brent was fantastic and answered all of my questions about financing options.  The General Manager, Lisa, was also incredible.  You can see that she sets the tone and atmosphere at this dealership.  She is a GM who is really excited about the product she and her staff sells.",5.0
460,"May 18, 2011","I went to Fiat of Austin interested in looking at and trying out a brand new Fiat 500 after I had seen a Fiat 500 in giallo (yellow) driving around the parking lot of a local grocery store.  The showroom was light and airy and I was immediately greeted at the door by the receptionist.  After a few minutes of browsing at the cars outside and inside the showroom, Melanie Lopez, one of the salespeople introduced herself and asked me if I had any questions.  After a test drive, I was sold on the unique styling in combination with the exceptional fit and finish usually found in much more expensive cars.  Before making a final decision to buy, I wanted to make sure that my electric scooter would fit in the back of the car.  Melanie offered to let me take the car home overnight, and it did!

I had a very specific Fiat 500 in mind that I wanted to take home, but  I wasn't willing to wait the 2-3 months to order one built specifically for me.  Not to worry, Melanie not only took the time to go over the list of cars that were already in route, but she even spent several hours (spread over 3 visits and working past closing time) to let me look at and test drive several cars from their fleet.  The main two things that I wanted were the colors giallo or rosso brillante (sparkling red) in a manual transmission.  Just a side note, the sparkling effect of rosso brillante is imparted by a substance termed Xirallic which is manufactured in only one factory in the world which happens to located in Japan (more on this later).  The manual transmission was particularly important to me because its 38mpg highway EPA rating was substantially better than the 34mpg highway EPA rating of the automatic. That's over 40 miles more distance per tankful than the automatic and my decision for a manual transmission was made, or so I thought.

Then, one day after having looked at several cars in their fleet the night before, Melanie called me and said that a Fiat 500 in rosso brilliante was available.  Due to the scarcity of rosso brillante (the Japanese factory temporarily shut down the production Xirallic due to damage sustained by a magnitude 9.0 earthquake) I knew that this Fiat, despite its automatic transmission, was the one I was driving home in.  Amazingly enough, I am actually getting 40+mpg on the highway when setting the cruise control right at the posted speed limit.  The best fuel economy I have achieved in this manner was 41.9mpg on a 168 mile round trip visit to family.  I was so excited that the real-world fuel economy of my Fiat 500 bested even the manual transmission's highway EPA rating of 38mpg, that I took a picture of the car's computer display and I sent it to my friend who is also interested in buying a Fiat 500.

I rate my overall buying experience with Fiat of Austin the best of any car buying experience to date.  The whole staff was friendly and readily available.  I never felt pressured to make a decision at any point in the process.  I would like to make special mention of Melanie Lopez, my salesperson, who I found to be exceptionally helpful and patient.  I would also like to make special mention of Lisa Copeland, the general manager, who was just plain fun to talk to because her genuine passion for the product.  I would gladly recommend Fiat of Austin to all of my friends and family.",5.0
461,"May 09, 2011","I recently purchased a new Fiat 500 from Fiat of Austin.  From my initail contact with them over the phone, it was a great experience.  I purchased a custom made Fiat 500 sight unseen based upon the many phone calls and emails with my salesman Mr. Brandon Grebe.  He was great throughout the entire buying experience.  His customer service has continued on even after the actual sale, and has been, very helpful with answering any questions or concerns.  I live in New York state and had many other dealers that were closer to me geographically, but based upon the customer service that I received from Fiat of Austin and Brandon, I ultimately decided to make the trip to Texas to purchase my vehicle.  The extera cost for doing this and the time it took was well worth it in the end.  Their new facility is first class and the rest of the staff was very helpful and attentive.  Considering I had many choices of dealers to pick from, my ultimate decision was made based upon the high quality of customer service that was given to me, something we dont see very often in this country any more!

462,"May 03, 2011","We had a wonderful experience here. They walked us through all of our many questions and concerns. We sat at a Houston Toyota dealership until nearly closing on a Friday and nearly left with a Yaris. Instead, we drove the next morning all the way to Austin and came home that night with our new Fiat 500! Everything was handled with the best care and attention. We felt relaxed and had fun and have recommended Fiat of Austin several times already!",5.0
463,"April 28, 2011","Lisa Copeland, General Manager Fiat of Austin, has created a very friendly, knowledgeable, and customer focused team.  The buying experience was very pleasant and more importantly their follow up and caring attitude has made all the difference.

465,"April 25, 2011","The Fiat of Austin team did a terrific job making my car buying experience pleasant (dare I say fun?).  My salesman was Brandon (with Matt as backup), Brent did the final paperwork, and Lisa (General Manager) checked in along the way.  I never did feel that the deal was the typical car-sales-confrontational-dealer-versus-consumer attitude.  They never did try to oversell me.
The entire event from test drive, to delivery went smoothly and painlessly.  I think that it's important to point out that niche vehicles like the Fiat 500 require a different approach.  Fiat of Austin succeeded in recognizing this and acting on it. ",5.0
466,"April 21, 2011",When you walk into FIAT of Austin you feel more like a friend than like live bait as is typical at most dealerships. Matt answered all of my questions and offered Lisa's demo car to take home and try out. Traded a Mercedes-Benz ML500 (15 mpg) for a black 500 Sport. So far I'm averaging 35.5 mpg and culdn't be happier. Unless I had a white Abarth...,5.0
