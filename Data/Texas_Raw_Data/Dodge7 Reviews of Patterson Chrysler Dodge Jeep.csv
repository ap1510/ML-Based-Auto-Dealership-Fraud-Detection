0,"August 06, 2018","Worst experience ever. They gave OTD price and then upped it $800 when time to sign papers. We walked. They called us to ‘make it right’ promises to fill the tank, and have a Yukon loaner while they fixed some interior issues following Monday. Didn’t fill tank until asking 3 times, gave us a tiny loaner car that smelt like cat and vomit-had to drive with windows down gagging. When they called because it was finished, it wasn’t, and I wasn’t getting back in smelly car, they offered no help or a different car when I asked for both, so I had to call for a friend to come pick me up. It was a JOKE. I was nice and civil but very clear that I’d never be stepping in a Patterson establishment ever again. I’m still disgusted. ",1.2
1,"March 23, 2018",I have always been a GM owner. I owned my first GM truck when I was 16 years old. I am now 56. I just purchased my first new RAM truck from Patterson’s because of the life time power train warranty. I could not be happier with my off road 2500 4 x 4!,5.0

5,"September 01, 2015",They charged $225 each for O2 sensors + labor and according to online estimates it should have been $135 each including parts and labor.  They also recommended a bunch of filter changes and flushes that were over priced as well.  The crowning blow was they would not do factory recall work required by Dodge if they weren't going to change the over priced O2 sensors.  Ended up with an almost $900 bill for O2 sensors and fuel filters.  They are lucky they were dealing with my son and not me.  They wouldn't have done any work if I had been there from the start.,1.0
6,"June 04, 2015","I traded in a brand new 2015 Tahoe on a piece of crap 2013 BmW that they talked me into. I've never dealt with cars before this all happend because my husband and I were going through a divorce. Once I did the trade I realized I screwed up and lost a lot of money. The motor on the BMW is messed up! I tried calling this dealership for a week and they ignored mine and my husbands call! When I finally talked to the manager RIckey he admitted that they ignored my calls I told him all I wanted was my Tahoe back and I was willing to pay more for it, but they wanted me to pay $14,000 more than what I owed on it & $6,000 more than what they gave me for it! Yeah they pulled a real good one on me! When I talked to Ricky a week later they lied to me and told me they sold my Tahoe the day before when I've been calling all week and they knew I wanted it back! It was there that same day before he claimed he sold it. Very unprofessional & rude people! I do not recommend you buy from them! This took place at the other dealership of there's the dodge one! I dealt with Cole he sold me the car & the owner did nothing! I didn't expect to pay what I owed I knew I was going to come out of pocket more but $14,000? They have lost their xxxx mind! Also they were offering me 23,000 for the BMW when I paid 29,000 & have not even put 100 miles on it! I was also trying to get a cosigner when I bought the car & they talked me out of it!",1.0
