0,"February 07, 2012","If you go anywhere but here, you can actually get a discount.  Why would a car dealer not offer to save a person a few dollars in this economy?  Missed a sale by $500.  Very smart.

MSRP is arrogance.  Good luck with your business model!  ",1.0
1,"April 28, 2011","I used to think that MINI was a great car.  I bought a 2008 Cooper S, swearing to everyone that this was the best car.  I was told I purchased every possible extended warranty, not that I would ever need it, until I did need it.  At 96,500 miles, the oil pump seized up and the timing chain snapped and the engine went Poof!   Now all the sudden, my warranty was up at 60,000 and they will not cover the motor and I am expected to pay $8,000.
Never will I ever deal with, or recommend MINI to anyone.  ",3.0
