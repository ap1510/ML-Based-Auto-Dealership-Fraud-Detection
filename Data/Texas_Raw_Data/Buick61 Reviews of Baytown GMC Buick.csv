1,"April 13, 2020","While searching for a new 2020 Acadia SLT I found Baytown GMC Buick listing pricing on Autotrader and their website. I contacted sales at the dealership through there website and began asking about the vehicle. As I live a good 2 hours from the dealership I first asked Vincent Pierre to confirm the price listed on the website is accurate. After hours of him ""calculating"" pricing he returns a price that is 5k higher than listed on there website. They claim its dealer add-ons for wheel locks, tint and paint protection. A very old school trick dealers commit to perform a bait and switch on pricing. Luckily they lost my sale without me leaving my home. ",1.0

6,"July 11, 2019","Don't buy your next vehicle here. They are not equipped to process your loan in a timely manner. We showed up at 5:15pm to sign paperwork. We were told it would be quick. 3 hours later, we were finally invited to the finance office to sign, however it was another 20 minutes before there was even anything, paperwork wise, to look at, much less anything to sign. The funny thing was that we did our loan application the night before and we had been already been approved for the loan. They are severely short staffed and under equipped. 3 1/2 hours later, still no car and about to walk out the door. We were lied to numerous times being told certain things were free, but they were not! Numerous people were disrespectful and they had so little regard for our time or comfort. This dealership doesn't deserve the 1 star I was required to give.",1.2
7,"May 08, 2019","They selling auction cars and never tells you the truth gives you clean titles and when you trying to sell the trash car you buy like new is when you discover the truth. Very bad customer service also how is this possible to exist if you go to a brand how you can get auction cars
Dont buy over there go any where else and also GM cars so bad interiors. This is my worst experience ever dont buy those trash cars can Igive you negative 0 dont deserve any stars.",1.0
8,"January 10, 2019",Was told by the service department to schedule an appointment . Made appointment for the following day at 10 AM and dropped my truck off at 0900. Checked back at 1330 and the truck still hadnt been looked at. Service department then said appointment times dont mean anything that they had vehicles from the day before sitting that had appointments as well. Before leaving without any work being done and a day wasted another gentleman came in and asked them to make sure they put all the bolts back on his skid plate since last time they didnt and it dropped  while he was driving. ,1.0

10,"November 18, 2018","I was in the market to trade my car for a SUV.  Brian James internet sales guy called and called with great offers and say we will make a deal. I told him my car is upside down in value and he said we have plenty of rebates. Upon arrival, I was introduced to an older sales guy Martin Zavala while they appraised my car.  Brian found a vehicle of choice and I gave them both the payoff of my vehicle. They were disappointed when I would not allow them to run my credit. Well that happen Nov 2, 2018 and I attempted to call them both once on Monday 11/5 and was not successful.   Today is Nov 18, 2018.  It would have been nice to receive a courtesy call or email to say ""unfortunately we ...""but they don't operate in that manner.which is great.  That disconnect with customer service pushed me to a Lexus dealer about 1 hour away from Baytown and I'm happy because the customer service was outstanding, offered me something to drink while they appraised my car, they didnt assume my credit was bad and they completed my deal the same day.   Thank you for not allowing me to be another victim to your dealership. 
Both guys were nice when they knew they had a potential sale but they will not follow up.  Just a side note Brian and Martin a new vehicle was a want, not a need so I had options. I hope you guys can start calling people back but please don't call me. Good Luck with future sales and customer service.",1.5
11,"August 31, 2018",Absolutely recommend this dealership. Everyone is friendly and kind. They all keep true and stand by their mission statement. Robert and Deanna were wonderful with us! I'm so happy and excited with my brand new 2018 purple Buick Enclave! Thank you for making this happen!,5.0

13,"June 27, 2018","I was called by the dealership to bring my truck in for recall work, the service people were not very friendly in the morning,  They didn't seem very happy and appeared to want to be somewhere else.  Now, I get endless fliers iin the mail, and unsolicited phone calls and mail requesting me to trade in my truck that is only 4 years old.  I have requested that my name, number, email and address be removed, yet they continue. Do not go here,  unless you want to be relentlessly bothered and your mailbox full for the rest of your life.",1.0
14,"April 12, 2018","Unbeleivably bad at dealing with unhappy customers. I still cannot believe they would not even let me finish speaking. Their mission statement is comical when compared to their actions. Terrible experience. I will never again be associated with this organization, and I may not even buy another GM product, due to the lack of respect for customers shown to me by the general manager.  ",1.4

18,"March 04, 2018","I verified an advertised price on Autotrader by phone and was told that there also were new rebates this month thst would cover dealer fees in the amount of  $1,500.

21,"January 05, 2018",Vincent was patient and answered all my questions and provided the information I asked for in a timely manner.  I appreciated this since I shopped on the internet.  Other dealers did not want to answer questions over the phone and wanted to come in to the dealership before giving out and details or talking price.,4.8
22,"December 15, 2017","My 2006 Buick LaCrosse had been stolen and was brought to the dealership with the steering column damaged and no key. I was very concerned that due to the age of the vehicle and the damage that the parts may not even be found.  With patience and Tim Znidarsic my service rep at Baytown GMC Buick my car was repaired with a new key and a great relief.  Tim also made sure my car was safe to drive and needed maintenance was done.  Oil change, new battery, both rear windows in my car would not stay closed and were repaired leaving me no further concern of my windows being left down.  Tim made sure the brakes were in good shape and that my car would be safe to drive on the road.  Iâ€™m grateful to Tim for understanding Without these repairs that I would not have transportation.  When Iâ€™m able I will return to purchase my next vehicle at Baytown GMC Buick because their not just a business selling and repairing cars they reach out to the needs of each individuals to see that they have transportation at an affordable rate that fits the customers income.  Thank you so very much.  Iâ€™m on the road againðŸ˜€",5.0

25,"June 10, 2017","Went in as a serious buyer, but didn't get much help with pricing of truck. They offered me another truck, but then seemed uninterested after I rejected high price offer on initial vehicle. Good customer service until you shoot them down. Probably thought i was a joke. Will go elsewhere where I know would appreciate my business and meet my price",2.4
26,"May 18, 2017","I was charged 500$ for an etching fee, which is unbelievable, should have just walked out then because you can do it by yourself for $25. They also tried to charge me $400 for something I didn't ask for and when I found it in your invoice the financial manager said ""oh let me see if I can remove that"".  You're telling me after 6 years of working here you aren't complete aware of that $400 worth of nothing you just put on my bill. I liked the car and if it wasn't the only car I ended up liking within 400 miles I wouldn't have bought it, cause they are a bunch of scam artist, reviews on every website will reflect. Not the right way to do business, I would be very careful if you plan on doing business with them. Add $500 to the price of the car for your ""etching fee"" too.",1.2

54,"December 17, 2014","I took my 2009 Acadia to have 3 recalls taken care of. While there I was told that it needed the timing chain recall done again for a second time. I asked why and was told because GM sends poor parts and I did not use synthetic oil in the car. I was never told to use that oil. After the car being there 5 days I got it back and it ran terrible. I took it back the next day and was told it needed front struts. They were so rude they would not even drive the car to understand what i was talking about. There was no problem with that before I took it in. During questioning the service manager he was very rude and told me all the problem with be car was because of me. This car only has 70,000 miles. I would never take my car back to dealership or buy another GMC product. There is no reason a car with 70,000 miles should have 5 recalls done and need major front end work. Very disappointed in this dealership.",1.0
