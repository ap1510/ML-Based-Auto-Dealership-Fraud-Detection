Tony was personable, very professional in every respect, and knowledgeable about Mercedes in general and the 400SL This was very helpful as I new to Mercedes. None of the high pressure nonsense found at some other dealerships. He also followed up with me after my visit. If you are interested in a Mercedes then go to Mercedes of Boerne and ask for Tony Osburn!",5.0
1,"March 24, 2018","I recently bought a certified vehicle from MB Boerne and it was my first MB purchase.  I was referred to the sales manager, Wayne De Laurent, who treated me as a returning buyer and exhibited enthusiasm for our specific need.  He promptly referred me to Nora Guizar-Weedman who asked the right questions to filter our search and locate multiple options for our consideration. She saved us a lot of time and frustration.  We were able to negotiate a fair price and received very favorable financing terms.  

Very pleased with all services offered by this team of dedicated and engaged professionals and will continue to use their expertise for servicing our recent purchase and return to the dealership when it;s time to consider another vehicle.

2,"July 28, 2017",Mario Cajic was outstanding. He went over and beyond to make sure I was completely satisfied. We communicated all through text (which was great) and Mario also sent videos of the car. The dealership was about 4 hours from me so Mario made sure everything was perfect before I arrived. Out of all the vehicles I have purchased Mercedes Benz of Boerne and Mario Cajic is beyond the best so far. It was was definitely worth the drive. Oh yeah and the car I purchased is amazing.,5.0

My service advisor, Pat Enriguez was exceptional - she kept me informed Through out the process in a very professional manner.  The dealership was very efficient while I got my rental car and they even helped me hook up my Bluetooth. ",5.0
6,"February 17, 2016","After buying 4 cars and stupidly leading 2 I found this dealership deceitful. I was told that because I had always been a great customer they would sell my leased vehicle to me at their cost.  (I had noticed that there weren't as many customers there in the last year, just didn't put 2 and 2 together)  I was told that they would recertify it and give me a new warranty.  I was so excited, I really liked my GL550.  They lied, when I turned it in I found out I was going to have to pay to recertify, new warranty, ttl.  No discount, after all.  The GL would have cost so much more than it was worth that I user gave it back.  It was not worth the price they were asking.
I went down to the Lexus dealership, awesome group of people, they have gone over and above helping me do a simple thing like program my garage doors and gate.  They even bought a new gate control to help program the gate.  The dealership is just hopping with people, such a busy place, they must be doing something right.",2.0
7,"March 26, 2015","The positive reviews are spot-on. I'm moving to San Antonio later this year (2015). I had read positive reviews about this dealership so visited them in March. Jeff Ramirez was my sales consultant and I closed the deal with Jeff Ahlfors the sales manager. Both of them were excellent: professional, courteous, and attentive. I placed an order on 2 GLA 250s; they beat KBB's lowest price. The level of customer service I received was outstanding. I'm looking forward to receiving my cars in a couple of months! Thank you Jeff and Jeff for your outstanding customer service, attention to detail and after sales follow up.

9,"September 14, 2014","MB Boerne, and particularly my salesperson Jamie Cox, are all about excellent service. Jamie ensured I had everything I needed to  expedite the purchase of my new E-350, and he did it while on vacation!! This guy is top notch...answers detailed questions about the car (I ask a lot of questions), provides up front information (estimates and benefits) about the car buying service through USAA, and ensures you understand why a Mercedes is all about safety and service. 
I wasn't even the market for this car but Jamie presented such awesome information about the lifetime relationship between owners and MB (keeping owners happy, and safely on the road) that my decision was made in an instant. ",5.0
10,"September 01, 2014",I went in today and test drove the SLK 250 and immediately knew that it was too small for me.  I asked my sales rep Cody Blackmon if I could test drive the E 350 coupe and knew this was the car for me as soon as I sat inside.  Cody made my experience at Mercedes an experience that I will share with everyone that I can.  It was one of the easiest buying experiences I have had.  I will be back for sure for my next car when I'm ready. ,5.0

20,"June 02, 2014","I bought my car through Mark ave it was a great experience, he went above and beyond. Not only did I get my car for a very fair price but the whole process was very friendly and nonchalant, it didn't feel like I was driving ny life away. Aside from MB of Boerne's service Mark went way above and beyond: I drove my own truck in ave couldn't have anyone come get it after buying my new car so Mark followed me home to stop my car off.

25,"May 17, 2014","Great dealership, outstanding customer service.  I found a car on their website on Friday, worked out a trade, drove 500 miles Saturday, woke up early on Sunday and completed the transaction, drove back home on Sunday.

36,"April 18, 2014","Veronica stepped up to the plate when the original salesperson we had an appointment with did not show. She was EXCELLENT!!!  She had us test drive a Mercedes diesel and the acceleration was fine. She found the E250 Bluetect in the color and options we wanted in Texas, arranged to have it delivered to Boerne the next day, and asked us if we qualified for the USAA special (which we did, but had not known they had specials with Boerne Mercedes).  

She handled the trade-in of our Jetta TDI and Infinity Q56 for the new car, had the car there in 1 day, and we were out the door by 1pm.  

We would definitely recommend Veronica to any of our friends.  She was very professional and we saved a lot of money with the USAA referral.  Thanks Veronica!!!!

What I have loved most of all is Jamie himself will hand deliver the car and spend time explaining how to use the features and answer any questions. I live in Austin, Tx and this is more than an hour drive. Jamie has many clients in Texas and will personally pick up your car and deliver the new! Last but not least!! When service is needed on the vehicle, all you have to do is call service, set an appointment and they will pick up your vehicle and deliver a loaner!! Impeccable customer service all around and VERY reasonable pricing!!

43,"April 05, 2014","For 8 years now we have been purchasing cars from the MB of Boerne. In fact, I rarely look elsewhere because the sales support and service I receive is consistently excellent. The team there is always very professional, friendly and more than helpful. Over the years we have become very trusting of the MB of Boerne and the team there. A lot of that trust comes from one of their best sales associates, Jamie Cox.  If you decide to go to this dealership ask for Jamie. He will provide you with highly competent and professional sales support. I read somewhere on the dealership floor about their motto, ""It's About Service"". MB of Boerne really does believe in this and Jamie Cox proves it every time we call or visit. 
I would rate this team as the best I have ever worked with and I am confident to recommend them to anyone.

45,"April 03, 2014","I am so happy and pleased with the professionalism, courtesy, and kindness extended to us at  Mercedes-Benz of Boerne. 

We started this car buying experience last night by an email inquiry, and received instantaneous response.

This morning, when we left for Boerne, I was already confident in choice of dealership and felt fortunate that Mr. Hatfield was our sales advisor.

At every point in the purchasing process,  Mr. Hatfield kept us well-informed and updated.

I am extremely grateful to him, because he made both, my mother and I, feel welcomed. 

My mother has sacrificed her entire life taking care of others and giving her everything,often without any return of happiness or joy.

But today, she is the proud owner of her very first new car at 65 year's old. The smile and look on her face has made my day!!

Thanks Charles....I will definitely be back and refer family and friends to Mercedes-Benz of Boerne!!

The dealership's Customer service is comparable to a 5 Star Hotel, by being very Professional, knowledgeable, informed and interested in your needs with a Goal to Exceed your expectations.  My car was delivered in a fully covered clear car carrier.  The MB product specialists, Thomas Offer, explained the differences between the 2014 and my 2010.  Thomas set up all the vehicle options, including garage door remotes, to make the transition as seamless as possible.

In addition, the dealership will pickup my MB and deliver a loaner while my MB is being serviced.  I now know why MB Boerne has been recognized by Mercedes Benz as the ""Best of the Best Dealer"" in the U.S.  I would highly recommend the short trip to Boerne, if you are interested in a buying and service experience  that is very seldom seen these days.

I would highly recommend this dealership if you are in the market for a new MB!

The sales process is not high pressure, and with us, the lowest and fair price was disclosed at the start.  We did not have to negotiate which to us, is stressful and takes away from the excitement of buying an automobile. We had shopped this dealership a year before just to learn more about the automobiles and experienced the same, down to earth approach.  Then, we were asked if we wanted a followup call which we declined.  They respected our wishes.  This added to our desire to build a relationship with the team at Boerne.

I simply loved my BMW and wanted another.  The last new car we purchased a Q56  was in Austin the dealership was great  just a pain to get to  Austin. I looked up the reviews of the Boerne Meecedes Benz and they were so positive that we were willing to  go visit.  The dealership service reputation is everything and the plesant purchase experience conveyed that the relationship had just begun.

86,"October 16, 2013","I was in the market for a new car but not looking forward to the process.  I've bought lots of cars.  Until my Mercedes purchase, I was driving 'the ultimate driving machine'.  I researched the vehicle online, did comparison shopping and was prepared with my offer and had trade-in value expectations when I drove up to Boerne.  I figured I would do all this, to make MY experience easier, shorter and straight forward.  I mean, we all know what dealerships are like.  Except, this isn't a dealership.  It's a SERVICEship. 

From the moment I arrived at the serviceship, I knew I was in for a 'different experience'.  I was greeted at the door by a friendly sales advisor, scratch the sales part... I was greeted by a friendly Advisor.  In comes Su Yim, super-cool-awesome should be his name.  Now, I knew exactly what car I was there for, which was going to make his job easy, but Mercedes Benz of Boerne has changed the car buying experience.  

Su showed me the car I was looking for.  Took me on a test drive, NO PUSHY SALES!!  He let the car speak for itself.  Su was very knowledgeable of the GL450 and shared all the features with me.  He never tried to close a sale, thank goodness.  He made me feel so comfortable, I let my guard down and enjoyed the 'looking' experience, the 'test-drive' experience and YES... ultimately, the 'BUYING' experience.  This was an amazing thing!  Believe me when I tell you, from everyone's courteous smiling faces, helpful gestures, to the coffee, to the lounge, to the tour of the facilities, they have a masseuse!!!, a shoe-shine station, a video game room..... I can't list everything.  I drank like 3 starbucks.... it didn't feel like I was buying a car, it felt like I was being catered to... and THAT is Priceless!

Congratulations MBofBoerne! 

I'll be back.

So, I contacted Guy through the Bourne website and was very pleased to have my inquiry returned within 30 minutes!

115,"January 24, 2012","After first visiting the other San Antonio area Mercedes-Benz dealership, my wife and I first visited Mercedes-Benz of Boerne back in early Fall of 2011.  After meeting and visiting with Guy Vick (salesman) we test drove a 2012 CLS550.  We were quite impressed with the CLS550.  After a few months we were ready to order the exact version of this vehicle that we wanted.

At the time of our ordering our car Guy Vick advised that the car would likely make to the dealership in the last week of December or the first week of January.  As it turned out, we picked up our new ride on Friday 12/30/2011.

Guy Vick was the perfect salesman.  He was able to provide every answer we asked.  He never pushed us (he let the car sell itself).

The day we picked up our new car we met Garrett Ethridge.  He is this dealership's guy who trains customer's how to use their new car.  Our new car has so many features that a guy like Garrett is a God send.  He was fully knowledgeable and very patient with my wife and I.

Today we went back to have an additional item installed and to have the windows tinted.   Guy Vick made all of the arrangements.  When we arrived our loaner was waiting.  The work was performed in a timely and professional manner.

119,"January 12, 2012","First let me state that my job is to conduct professional research for my government clients.  I'm not the type of person to buy anything on a whim and sometimes that annoys the hell out of my wife!  My plan was to find and buy a 2012 Mercedes-Benz (MB) E350 with certain options and within a certain price range.  This MB was going to be a surprise Christmas present for my wife of 20 years, so it had to be special.  I conducted exhaustive research for over 3 weeks and the days were counting down until Santa had to deliver!  When conducting research for a new vehicle, I not only look at the invoice price of the vehicle and all the options, but also the feedback from legitimate consumers and also how well the dealership's service department treats their customers.  This leads me to Mercedes-Benz of Boerne.  We had our previous 2008 MB C350 serviced at the Boerne dealership even though we bought it in Austin and the service department treated us like family every time we came in.  In fact, we had a unique problem that occurred right after our warranty expired and the MB of Boerne service department (Mark De La Fuente) contacted MB USA to plead our case without us even knowing about it.  In the end, MB took care of our potential expensive problem and we were all the happier for it!  That is why I could not understand the few negative comments made about this dealership.  However, if you're like me, you can read between the lines and discover why some of the negative comments were made; enough said.  The salesman I purchased from was the most professional and courteous car salesman that I've dealt with in the past 20 plus years!  Even after I spent about 3 hours of this gentlemen's time, Guy Vick never became pushy just to make a sale.  He allowed me the opportunity to come back and mull over the various E350s and never attempted to pressure me into a sale.  When I finally made the decision to purchase my wife's new E350 with the options I wanted I decided to go in and see Mr. Vick.  I sat down with him and informed him that I was willing to pay a fair price for the new E350, but nothing close to MSRP.  I also wanted a true market trade in value for my wife's 2008 C350.  We spent less than 5 minutes negotiating a price on both vehicles and I left feeling I was treated more as a family member than a person off the street wanting to buy a new car.  However, that's not the end of the story.  I then told Mr. Vick that I needed the car that evening to surprise my wife with her new car.  Guy Vick went above and beyond to ensure that Santa had a clean and polished brand new Black E350 present to deliver to his beautiful wife of 20 years!  MB of Boerne and especially Guy Vick has earned my trust and loyalty to ensure I always return!        ",5.0

123,"December 29, 2011","For a dealership's mission statement that says ""Where customer service is our passion!""... Our experience was simply horrible!  We had to drive over 2 hours to get to the dealership, and upon arriving, we were ignored and left standing on the lot long enough to have multiple other salespeople inquire whether we had been helped.  Sadly, we stayed loyal to the first salesman who greeted us!  Had we known what was to follow, we would have run for the exit!  Robert Price had obviously decided what it was that we wanted and could afford without knowing anything about us at all.  We went in specifically to drive and buy a 2012 GKL class SUV with navigation.  Mr. Price spent several minutes avoiding us and holding conversations with other employee's even after they pointed out to him that we were waiting!  This behavior was so obvious that multiple other employees of the dealership came to us and, in what I would consider a very concerned manner, asked us whether everything was alright!  This was most disturbing!  If that isn't enough, he never let us test drive the vehicle we drove all that way to see!  Instead, he put us in a somewhat unclean 2011 without many of the features we wanted - and certainly had no expectation for us to buy.  After being treated so apathetically, I wouldn't have bought a can of peaches from this guy!  To add insult to injury, while on the test drive, I was asking questions of him, and he would occasionally answer with a sarcastic tone of voice.  When we went into the office section of the dealership, Mr. Price, in his omniscience, asked us whether or not the GKL class was within our price range!  We never even got to price negotiation nor even credit scoring!  Owning a Mercedes has been my dream for quite some time, mostly because other family members are current owners.  Now, I simply don't understand why they are!  I wish we would have talked to someone else, anyone else!  There are truly concerned employees at this dealership, but sadly, we never had the opportunity to work with them.  We may try again some other time…    ",1.0
124,"December 10, 2011","Not really much of a review writer but I thought I would take a couple of secs and do it because the experience was really good. Bought an E Class and traded my in my old Peugeot.  My salesman was Jeff Ahlfors. With all the options available, picking out a car can be overwhelming. You can read and read but until you actually go out to the store and look at the cars, you can get confuzzled. Jeff was very patient. He showed me every car I had any interest in, explained the differences and understood when I didn't make a decision on my first trip. Came back the next weekend and finally picked out a car. Had it down to two that were a toss up, parked them side by side, and bought the one my dog hopped into. Haggled a little over the trade, but how much is a 150,000 mile Peugeot worth anyway? I most appreciated the service I got. If I'm spending that much on a car, I want good service as much as I want a nice car. I was greeted professionaly, listen to carefully, and they spent a lot of time with me. Jeff followed up but he wasn't obnoxious. I left my sunglasses in my trade in and even though I told him not to, Jeff drove them out to my house! I hope the service dept is as good as the sales dept. Best of all, my dog Shadow loves it!

125,"November 27, 2011","I have learned over the years that car ownership far extends past the love affair one may have with a car.  It is more than that.  It is the overall experience one has with the dealership and the most valued asset it posseses - it's people.  The relationship begins from the initial purchase, maintenance and service life cycle, and finally through the decision of what to get next.  If at any point in this journey one is unsatisfied, the overall car ownership experience will be compromised.  

Needless to say my experience to date with the Mercedes Benz of Boerne has been nothing short of exceptional.  However, a recent service experience far exceeded my expectations.  After going through 3 sets of new tires purchased from a national retailer, I had come to end of my patience with their inability to resolve the problem of my car pulling to the right.  Based on my horrific - and that is putting it mildly, past experience with my local Austin dealership, I decided to contact the people whom have yet to dissapoint me, MB of Boerne.  

Eddy Waters was an absolute hero.  In addition to resolving my primary problem, Eddy also helped me resolve a few other minor issues in need of attention.  Eddy was very prescriptive in keeping me abreast throughout the entire service process.  With the exception of a part that requires a special order from Germany, my car is running better than ever.

The absolute icing on the cake was having my car trailered from Boerne to my home in Austin within the same day of service without charge!  MB of Boerne you had me at hello.

126,"October 19, 2011","Robert Price was apathetic, sarcastic, and down right rude. His sales manager was demeanin and rude as well! I wouldn't recommend this dealership to my worst enemy! I've bought cars from various makers and dealers across Texas, never have I had the type of horrible experience I had at Mercedes Benz of Boerne located off I10 in Boerne, TX. The only reason we decided to purchase the car from them was because they had the exact type we were looking for at a reasonable price. We signed papers, got our loan approved on Saturday and it's now Wednesday and we still haven't taken the car home. They won't let us take our car home, because they're waiting for the co-signer to sign the docs but theyve gone ahead and taken my trade-in!! Most dealerships will let you take the car home even before the docs are signed as a sign of good faith, but not the MB or Boerne! They didn't care, were completely apathetic and incredibly short with us. The process was incredibly stressful and we'd NEVER recommend anyone to this dealership! The salesman Robert Price was the worst sales person I have ever seen, in and out of a car dealership!! PLEASE AVOID HIM AND HIS SALES MANAGER GIL GARCIA AT ALL COSTS!!",1.6
127,"August 02, 2011","I asked them to compare dealership to Mercedes Benz of San Antonio and their prices.  I found out that they only discount if you throw a fit and complain. The only reason I purchased 2 Mercedes Benz is my old sales professional Paul Stephens moved to Mercedes Benz from BMW in 2008.  Paul Stephens is the best by far.  He is not your typical salesman, and he really cares and goes out of his way for his clients.  Paul Stephens is no longer a Mercedes Benz or BMW . Where did he go?? He is the best and everyone at my lawfirm agrees. Please do your dealership a favor and find this guy and hire him. All the attorneys I know in the past only purchased from Paul Stephens. Hire him and watch your dealership grow
