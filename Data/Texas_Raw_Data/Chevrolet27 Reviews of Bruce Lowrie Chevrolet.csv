1,"December 28, 2018","This service department sucks.  I had my son's 2009 Chevy cobalt towed in for repairs on November 20, 2018 - engine would randomly shut off.  The 1st estimate to fix it was $1,047.  I repeatedly asked for diagnostic codes and itemized cost to repair which I never received to my satisfaction.  After that repair, car was pushed out of service shop - still not running and I was billed an additional $400 for a battery and a Ubec something or other.  Jeff Erwin -service manager - got me a $100 discount. We picked the car up 12/15/18  for the $1445.67 and within 4 hours the check engine light was on again.  I called Mr.Erwin and took it back in for diagnostics.  No real issues found - something about thermostat which controls heating and cooling- not engine shutting off.  On Sunday, 12/23/18 - engine shut off again luckily in a parking lot where he was not in a dangerous situation.  We took the car back in on 12/26.  On 12/27 - Chris in service department calls me and tells me there are 3 other problems causing shut off - new charges.  Picked car up on 12/28 w/o having the new $637.00 on repairs done.  Contacting BBB as soon as possible.  They either owe me 800 for overcharging me the 1st time I brought the car in of 637.00 in repairs free of charge.  They are not getting another dime from me and I will never own another Chevrolet.  As soon as my kid is out of college - he too will never do business there and I will see to that.  Can't drive that car back to A&M for sure.",1.4
2,"January 31, 2018","I took my truck here for a front end noise. They said they fixed it, sure enough the next day the noise is back. They kept it for several days and said before it was fixed. Then I started having s problem with exhaust. I made an appointment they 4 days before I wanted to bring it in and made sure they could look at it that day, they said yes for sure. I got off work early the day before and decided to drop it off so they had extra time. No one mentioned there is no shuttle on a Saturday which is what day my truck would be ready so I paid Lyft to take me there right before they closed. Once I get there I was informed they never even looked at my truck, but they could hurry and put a mirror on that I was going to buy separate from the exhaust issue- so here they are quick to sale me something but donâ€™t want to handle a warranty problem. They never once called Friday or Saturday and never said anything when I called to ask service about a shuttle. So basically my truck just sat there then I had to pay to pick it up. The service advisor could have cared less. I will never return to this dealer and will not ecommend them to anyone. ",1.0
3,"August 14, 2017","Don't know if it was my salesman Dennis or his boss who gave these crazy quotes on a lease for a 18 Equinox to me, but either way, they were no where near the advertised price.  I went to Moritz the next day and ended up with the Gm Family First price for a more load equinox than I was trying to get from Bruce Lowrie. Go figure. I didn't have any luck with Bruce Lowrie, but maybe the next person will! Good Luck",1.8

6,"September 09, 2015","I was looking for a dependable car for my college daughter and we were on a really tight budget.  She wanted a new Mazda cx5 however a new car was just not in the budget.  If you have ever shopped for a use car, you know how stressful it is to find a great car with an impossible budget. Bruce Lowrie had 3 cars that were close to our budget so we took our chance and looked at all three.  this was our 6th dealership in 7 hours time to go visit.  Lucky for us,this dealership had 3 for us to look at and were very understating with our budget needs and were able to meet our budget.  the car was under warranty and we noticed a noise so they gave my daughter a car to drive back to college  and took care of the issues.  This dealership treated us like  a family member and offered to drive my daughters new used/ car back to her at college.  Great customer service",5.0
7,"January 05, 2015",Cadillac dealer level of customer service at a Chevy dealer. Sales is excellent. Follow-up after sales is excellent.  They actually have a real sales department with sales people....not that corporate sales/customer rep crap!,4.8
8,"September 02, 2014","I purchased a pre-owned vehicle from Chris Amador.  Mike Daniels did the financing.  I have never experienced such a wonderful, hassle free and helpful financing and assistance in selecting my vehicle as I have had with Bruce Lowrie!  ",5.0
9,"June 29, 2012","I had an amazing experience with the guys at Bruce Lowrie Chevrolet, everyone was so friendly and seem to go above and beyond trying to make sure that my car needs were taken care of. Every question that I had was answered, these guys are very knowledgeable about Chevrolet products. The prices that were quoted were the same when I came to the dealership.  I love the way they operate, there was no harrasement, they pretty much left the decisions up to the customer and if I had any questions they were there to answer. I am going to make sure that all of my friends and family who are thinking about buying a chevrolet, to come and buy from the #1 dealership..Bruce Lowrie Chevrolet. ",5.0
10,"March 20, 2012","Normally purchasing a car is very stressful, lengthy in time and expensive. In the past I have been kept waiting and waiting, guessing at what was being put together for me.  This time I worked with Dan Davis first on the internet, then by phone and then in person.  Dan listened to what I wanted in a vehicle, what type of trade I had, the money available to put down and what I could afford monthly.  When I went into the dealership, both Dan and his manager were personalble and professional.  I never felt stressed, the car buying was done in a professional but easy manner. Randall Duff was excellent and I was in my new car before I knew it.  I would recommend these very great folks to ANYONE!",5.0
11,"March 14, 2012","Everyone, From my salesman Dan Davis,Terry Powell to Randall Duff and Mr Garza made my

12,"January 21, 2012","Bruce Lowrie service department is definitely top notch. There is no comparison to other dealerships in the area. Doug Maloney, service manager, runs a superior department and is a great asset to the dealership. I recently brought my Corvette in for work and Zach took the time to research and accomplish the task to correct an electrical problem after another local dealership could not figure it out. Prices are extremely competitive also. In addition, Tim Ivy in parts is very friendly and knowledgeable. No matter what problems you have, he can help you get it done and get your car to run.
I work for a large corporation and will continue to recommend Bruce Lowrie for new and used vehicle purchases as well as service.

15,"December 16, 2011","I bought a Certified Used Malibu 2010 from them a few months ago. After I drove it for a day I noticed it was pulling. I called my sales rep Kelly Peterson and he got the Service Manager to agree to do an alignment for free even though it's not under any type of warranty. I waited a few months before taking it in because I just don't live or work around the dealership. When I finally was able to bring it in they honored their agreement. I didn't have to re explain myself or have long conversations. I was surprised I didn't have to work for the repair. I was ready for it too. I am still shocked they didn't try to upsell me which is always annoying when someone finds mysterious problems with a car. They didn't do any of that stuff. They just fixed it. So easy. I will most likely be purchasing all my cars there from now on because good service is hard to find. People who just do the right thing and actually do more than just the right thing is even harder. 
CEO's, small business owners and motivators take note. It always starts at the top. Someone here must be encouraging this type of behavior and culture because it's not just one person. This is most likely a result of good leadership just as bad service can be a result of bad leadership. They figured out something here that works and it has earned my loyalty and trust. ",5.0
16,"November 26, 2011","Thanks to Jim Gist of Bruce Lowrie Chevrolet. I just purchased the car of my dreams 2008 Cadillac CTS! Jim Gist was very patient  w/ me stayed in constant contact even though im 500 miles away. Even when things wasn't going in my favor; he was honest,and determined to get me what I wanted.

Jim Gist is the man thats going to get you in the car you desire!! ",5.0

18,"October 27, 2011",I am a first time buyer of a car and I was searching for 2011 Tahoes. I found many dealerships and they gave me their best prices/quotes.  I actually visited the different dealerships that gave me the best quotes. When I went into Bruce Lowrie they were nothing but nice and respectful. They were very knowledgeable about everything.  They quoted me a price and they did not try to pressure me into buying that day. They even told me questions to ask other dealers and gave me different tips when buying a car.  They never once talked bad about other dealerships which I appreciated. I went to a car dealership further down I-20.  That particular car dealer quoted me a price but when it came down to it they added more money to the price of the car where I would be paying $2000 more than what was quoted.  I was so mad I got up and walked out of the door.  Then I drove back down to Bruce Lowrie to buy my car.  When I got there they were nothing but nice and so helpful.  The price they quoted me was the exact price I paid before taxes and fees.  They made the whole process so easy and not stressful.  They were very honest and up front with me.  They did not play around and give me the run around like the other ones. I will not be buying a car anywhere else now but only at Bruce Lowrie.  I recommend Bruce Lowrie to everybody. I had the best experience with them.  They are honest and they have great integrity.    ,5.0

20,"October 12, 2011",Doug Maloney went above and beyond my expectations. I had a defective console lid on my suburban and I thought any assistance from the dealer would be out of the question. Was I wrong. Mr. Maloney did not hesitate to take care of the problem and made me a customer for life. ,5.0
21,"June 28, 2011",I had a great experience at bruce Lowrie Chevrolet. The Sales represenatative Don Wells was a pleasure to work with because he was very straight forward and honest. This saved me a lot of time looking for a new car. The financing was also better than I expected. I will look at Bruce Lowrie for my next purchase.,5.0
22,"June 26, 2011",The salesman Don wells was a very wonderful suprise he was great and really cares about his customers and if I could I would buy another car from him. The dealership was really good as well. I am looking forward to dealing with them in the future.,5.0
23,"May 11, 2011","Recently bought my brand new Chevrolet from Bruce Lowrie and was delighted in the great help,knowledge and customer support I received. I love my new car and have recommended friends to go by and check them out. Thanks especially to Terry Powell and Earnest Oliver for all their help.",5.0
24,"May 04, 2011","I received wonderful service from the minute I walked in the door!  I left with total understanding of the technology and a thorough explanation of my OnStar, bluetooth, XM radio, etc. I love my Cruze AND got a great deal as I again discovered when I got home and looked up the competition.  The finance dept was extremely helpful and friendly as well as professional.  My salesman made the experience enjoyable and comfortable as well.",5.0
25,"November 23, 2009","To make a very LONG story short, after 2 weeks of going back and forth and being mislead by the internet salesman, I went to another dealership. DON DAVIS DODGE, they were great and by the 2nd day we drove off in our 2009 Dodge Ram 1500 Quad cab.  It is a beautiful truck and the interest and payment are $200 & 10% lower than what Bruce Lowrie had quoted us.  

I will NEVER go to Bruce Lowrie again and will share my horrible experience with anyone that is looking to buy from them.  ",1.5
26,"September 19, 2009",They destroyed my supercharger when they installed the GM stage kit for my Supercharged Cobalt. They did replace it under warranty. But they gave the car to me with the supercharger sounding like it had rocks rolling around in it. And I had to take it back and they installed a new supercharger the next day. The next time I took it there they gave it back to me with the check engine light on after an oil change and it was NOT on when I took the car in. It turned out to be an electrical connection that the technician had disconnected for some reason. I found the loose connection while the service rep and I looked under the hood. In fact I was certain they had taken something loose as the check engine light had never come on before. Then they ran a special on oil changes and I took it to them. Yes I know it makes me look dumb to take it back there after what they did before but I honestly thought they would maybe actually care this time. My car takes 6 quarts of Mobil 1 MAX and the invoice said 7 quarts of Mobil 1. I immediately went to the service rep and he told me my engine would take 7 quarts. It is a 2.0 Liter 4 cylinder and 6 quarts is exactly what GM says to use. Overfilling an engines sump can lead to problems including oil leaks and bearing damage from oil that has foamed because of over filling. I left vowing to never return to Bruce Lowrie Chevrolet and changed the oil myself using the right oil and the right amount. And I do not understand why they would treat any customer with that kind of disrespect and especially one that really does want to take care of their car.,2.2
