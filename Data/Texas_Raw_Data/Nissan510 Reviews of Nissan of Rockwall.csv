1,"May 16, 2020","We came to this dealership on Saturday May 9.  The receptionist at the front was very friendly and explained that it might take a little bit to see a sales rep.  Not a problem.  We didn't make an appointment and were interested in test driving a vehicle if possible.  We eventually get Drey Pryor assigned to us.  He was belligerent and rude right out of the gate.  It was very apparent he wanted a guaranteed sale before wasting his time on us.  I'll spare you the details, but needless to say, we left and didn't come back.  We closed on a vehicle a week later at Don Davis Nissan.",1.0
2,"May 10, 2020","These negatives reviews are very real. Nasty bait and switch tactic, they will say anything to get you through the door. 
Expect to pay at least 4-$5000 in additional charges On top of the car price and taxe and licensing fees,  like cleaning, recondition fee and other bs. Plenty of dealerships in the sea. Stay away from this place ",1.0
3,"May 09, 2020","We went in on 5/9/2020 to look at Nissan Rogue Sports, which were being advertised at $17,700.  I'm not naive enough to think that $17,700 is the drive-away price, but the salesman we dealt with, Drey Pryor (sp?), told us that it was going to cost $26,000.  Are you kidding??

So they pulled the classic ""bait and switch"" which, by the way, is an actionable Deceptive Trade Practice in Texas.  But whatever, no hurt feelings.  I can brush off slimy sales practices and just head somewhere else without a care in the world.

What I CANNOT abide (and the real reason for my post) is how incredibly rude Drey was toward us.  He was aggressive, patronizing, and dismissive of any questions we asked.  He spent about 5 minutes talking to us, which was mostly him lecturing us about why we were naive to think the car would actually cost anything CLOSE to the advertised price.  He lectured us about waxing, ""scotch guard"" crap, refurbishing costs, etc.  

I repeatedly asked for a statement showing the drive-away price and the charges that would go into the price but he wouldn't accommodate us.

When we said we couldn't pay what he was demanding, he stormed off without even saying goodbye.  As soon as we finished saying the price was too high, he stood up and walked off, saying ""take care"" when his back was already to us.

Nissan of Rockwall: how do you employ someone like this???  I've never encountered someone so rude at a retail store before.  Shady and dishonest?  Sure.  But at the very least I expect common courtesy and civility while I'm being screwed.

DO NOT GO TO THIS DEALERSHIP.",1.0
4,"April 19, 2020","I brought me car in for warranty repair. I wasn't super happy with my car and decided to see if I could get in to something better.

Test drove a Rogue Spot and decided to see if we could make a deal. Since I was upside down and my car was in for service they weren't able to help me much on the trade. We were having trouble coming to a deal that would work and right before I left I ask if there were any other options. That is when the sales manager suggested and the sales person agreed I could do a voluntarily repossess on my current car.

I had never heard of this and they explained that it would be a default on my current loan and inform the lender I so not intend to continue payments.  Then I could just sign a new load on the new car without the trade. I asked about credit impact. They said it would be small but I would take a hit and I'd start rebuilding credit and be fine in a couple months. I had reservations but went a head. While I was waiting for the finance person I did some quick research. Turns out a voluntary repossession is only marginally better then just stopping parents on the loan. I could have been looking at a 300 point negative impact to my credit score. For the next 7 years I would have had a really hard time securing additional credit and I would probably never get a decent apr on a car loan again. Further it might have impacted my credit card spending limits. It was a very bad idea. When the finance guy came to get me I called off the deal just in the nick of time.

There is a clear training opportunity here. When I asked if there were any other options I should have been told ""I'm sorry sir I don't think we can make it work. Please keep us in mind if your financial situation changes. Thanks for coming in today and have a nice weekend"". Instead I was almost duped into a bad financial decision just so they could move a vehicle. I get its their job to sell cars, but knowing what I know now this is bad advice to be giving customers making large purchases like a car.

I hope this behavior is confined to the two sales people that I worked with and not the overall policy of the dealership. However I don't think I'll be doing business with Rockwall Nissan again.

Brightside I was able to go to another dealership on the other side of town where we were able to come to a situation that was beneficial for both me and them. I am now in a better loan with a better car that fits my needs. it's too Bad Rockwall lost out on that opportunity. I will not be advising anyone to work with them in the future.",1.0

6,"March 24, 2020","Terrible experience with the service department here and I will never return - for service or any vehicle purchases. I made an appointment for a Sat morning explaining that my vehicle needed to be diagnosed (it was making a weird noise, but was drivable). I was told that a tech might not be able to investigate until Monday. Fine. 1 week and $100 in rental car charges later, a tech still had not looked at the vehicle. Yet, each day, I was told they were “pretty sure they can get to it tomorrow”. By Thurs, the service dept stopped returning my calls or giving any updates. When I finally showed up asking for my keys, I was told the rep handling my vehicle didn’t work there anymore. I am sympathetic to a labor shortage, but the least they could have done was keep me updated And give realistic expectations. I ended up taking the vehicle to Christian Brothers. They were, honest, communicative and had my vehicle repaired within 24 hours. I will never use this service department at Nissan of Rockwall  again.

7,"January 12, 2020",We purchased a Nissan Rogue in September and were assured the plated would be mailed. Now after not mailing and no contact our kid has been pulled over twice for expired plates. Called and internet manager told my wife it was up to her. She thought of course it is up to the customer to make sure Nissan of Rockwall does their job. She won’t shop here any more. They assured her they would be overnighted but failed again. I guess we will drive an hour an do the work for them again.,1.0
8,"September 30, 2019","Monday September 30, 2019
Let me start by saying how disappointed I am in Rockwall Nissan and how much I hate being lied to.  I called on Wednesday September 25, 2019 and spoke with a receptionist who connected me with the parts department.  I spoke with what I believe to be the manager of that department.  I advised him that I needed to find out how to update the navigation system on my 2015 Altima and was very unfamiliar with any of the systems since I drive a Ford F150.  This car was purchased for my daughter.  The manager said it was an easy process and for me to come by and he would update it for me at no cost.  So, on Monday September 30, 2019 I drove all the way from Forney Texas to Rockwall Nissan just to meet with this person.  Upon my arrival, “NO ONE” at the parts counter wanted to help me.  I stood there for 10+ minutes before I finally spoke up and asked one of the ladies for help and told them about my situation.  After another 10 minutes a bearded male came up to the counter and said it wasn’t him that I spoke with but the manager and he would ask him what I needed to do.  Within a few minutes the bearded male came back and said that the parts manager was not available to help and that I would need to go over to the service department.  Ok, so I was lied to by the parts manager, (evidentially he can’t help me after all or just doesn’t want to).  I then went to the service department and once again, had to stand around for another 10 minutes before a white male finally got tired of talking to another employee about the weather and current working conditions and he decided to see what I wanted, as if I were bothering him in some way.  When I informed him of why I was there, all he would tell me was that I needed to call this number and order a new SD card and would not help me any other way.
I say this to the owner(s) of Rockwall Nissan, I would start by conducting an investigation into the conduct of my employees and how they handle customer service.  This is the worst I have seen since the Bledsoe Dodge days.  If you have video and audio, please review it.  This started when I called and was told by the parts manager to come by and he would update it the map on the navigation system.  That was a lie!  You have to purchase an updated SD card from Nissan and have it shipped to your house at a cost of $149.00.  
I don’t appreciate being lied to or mislead in anyway and the employees did just that.  Let me go ahead and tell you that I will never come back to Rockwall Nissan for any reason.  You could have made a friend and customer by welcoming me when I first stepped through the door but instead, I was treated like a leper.   The employees lack training and accountable supervision.  Take a page from Christian Brothers Automotive.  Treat every customer the way you would want your mother or grandfather to be treated, “like family”, not like a leper.

9,"May 31, 2019","I live in Gilbert, Arizona but just bought a 2019 Frontier Pro-4X from this dealership because I actually got a much better equipped truck for less money than any dealership in the Phoenix area could offer. I would especially like to note 3 great employees who all went over and above to complete this sale. Jett Reed (manager), Mike Passaro (sales), and (finance). The truck was transported to my home and I couldn't be happier from my first phone call to my last!",5.0
10,"May 23, 2019","I bought a 2018 Nissan Rogue with 2800 miles, they labeled it as new. I took it back the next day because it has some scratches, paint chips and swirls marks. They gave me a ""We owe you"" form, promising to take care of all the details. They had the car for a week, I went to pick it up today and the car looked worst than before. I asked to speak with the general manager, he was rude and disrespectful He asked the sale person to open the door, that they were done with me. He told me and my wife to take the car, leave and sue him. they treated us like trash. I asked to speak to the general manager and he pointed to the door and said leave. His name was Greg Amos (Sales manager).  They won't take responsibility for the car or the terrible repairs.",1.0

I found my color at Courtesy Nissan ,but it was too late.
I took the word of a salesman,big mistake.",2.0
12,"February 28, 2019","1. The advertised price is not the price. They publish the price of the vehicles on the internet but fail to disclose their 're-conditioning' fee of $1,495. The reconditioning is non-existent. I purchased a 'reconditioned' vehicle and later discovered it had a fog lamp bulb out, the dome light was out, and the car needed new brakes pads all the way around. A door tensioner was also broken / unattached.

2. Get everything in writing. I was promised new floor mats for my vehicle during the negotiating process. I specifically asked for OEM floor mats and not some xxx floor mats from Wal Mart / Auto Zone. Sales person Sarah Beuchert , who also goes by Olivia Brock, said 'no problem I have a contact that can get those at cost and will deliver to you.' Of course, following the sale I was told by both her and Sales Mgr Doug to go buy my own.

3. Plates - bought my car over a month ago and still no plates.

It does appear the new ownership is addressing some of the prior fraudulent business practices, expediting plates, etc.  and hopefully they have cleaned house of the unscrupulous sales people.

17,"January 22, 2019","A stated tenet of Fenton Nissan Rockwall is to not waste a customers time. They don’t follow that tenet. After making an appointment for a simple oil change, apparently included with the purchase of a new vehicle, they seemed surprised that they were questioned as to why the vehicle had not been moved after two hours of waiting on a low traffic day for them. Employees are unable, or unwilling, to communicate and display an attitude of being put off at having to do their jobs. Do yourself a favor, shop elsewhere. Their demise is well earned. ",1.0

20,"January 21, 2019","Okay so I really don’t like leaving poor reviews, and honestly they did everything I asked them to do. However the service here is sub par compared to the other Nissan dealerships I’ve worked with. Upon arriving I wasn’t even greeted, minus the fact I was standing right infront of two Nissan representatives. I just kind of stood there till finally someone said “someone will be right with you” I had scheduled an appt yet the wait was still going to be 2.5 hours (for an oil change and tire rotation..) I also asked them to look at a few other things (which in turn would make them more money because I know they had to be fixed) and I was told they absolutely wouldn’t have time to even look at what I was talking about. I am a loyal customer to Nissan and my last three cars of which I’ve purchased has been through Nissan. If they just paid a little more attention to their customers, this place would be a gold mine. However, due to the poor customer service and the unfortunate poor reviews, I’m afraid this might be the worst dealership I’ve ever been to. Do us rockwallians a favor a bring someone over from the Grapevine location and turn this place around!!! Now THAT is some great customer service :)",2.6
21,"January 19, 2019",I’m happy pretty much with everything.

Both times I wasn’t able to go to work. ,5.0

Watched it being taken down. And finally setvucf manager came over said it was done and onnit way out.

30,"January 02, 2019","Purchased a 2018 Nissan Titan. After the salesman and I agreed on the deal, the Finance Dept. clerk, named Elvis, was very deceptive in his explanation of why he couldn't allow to financed our own vehicle. We bought the truck anyway and with-in 30 days re-financed it with our preferred source at 3% better. Wasted a lot of time listening to his BS.
 Have been in for 2 oil changes now, the first one one took 3-1/2 Hours, and we had scheduled ahead.
  The second oil change took 2 Hours, they allow you to see the mechanics at work, thru big glass windows, Management must never see what customers see, they are so SLOW....it is incredible that it takes so long... the Mechanics spend a lot of time talking to each other and laughing , while customers wait. Had apt for 8:00 AM to get in, I left at 10:05 AM... pretty poor..also, by the way, I was the only oil change during the entire 2 hour wait. and then   they left greasy handprints on my hood..  and there was no seat protectors laid on the seats and floor mats that most other dealers use.
NO  sense in pride of work...

36,"December 27, 2018","Totally unsatisfied with service experience: After spending $1100 on getting my heater and air conditioning fan replaced and a practically new 2017 pathfinder, I found a coupon for $75 off the labor cost. Since I already paid they did not honor it! We also had an unpleasant experience when we purchased a used Nissan car-It was missing a spoiler and we still haven’t received it after a year. I’m not sure if will buy you another Nissan product  again Or use Fenton service center again.
 There must be something wrong with the Nissan Pathfinder fan because apparently I was the fifth person that week that had that part replaced. I could see if it was a 2015 or below model but to spend over $1000 on parts and service is ridiculous. 
The final straw was not honoring my $75 coupon.

When I arrived that afternoon, I went to the service desk, and waited for a couple of minutes, no employee acknowledge I was even there. Phillip had said on the phone, that the cashier would have my paper work, so I went to the cashier's desk to pay, after waiting for 10 minutes, with no one in sight, I went back to the service desk and I was still ignored. After waiting about 25 minutes I finally got someone to say the cashier was the lady that was checking in a vehicle for a customer. I thought really, then who is maintaining the cashiers desk. Another customer came in to pick up her car from an oil change and she had to wait again for the same lady. Why would any company have the cashier, check in customers? Phillip is great but when Phillip is not there, your customer service is well below basic standards. This was the rudest service ever provided, not just to me but to all of those waiting to pay you money. To come, when you aren't that busy and wait over 30 minutes to pay and drive off is extremely poor customer service. You can see from the parking lot that Fenton is trying to sell the dealership, I have put off my next truck purchase, I am not going to by from you if I can't get good basic services.

Used Fenton to rotate my tires. I needed to take my wheels off to change the brakes and they had put my lug nuts on way too tight. I can not listen them.

I informed the man in the service department they were obviously too tight and I just needed them to help me and I was told it would me a 30 to 45 minute wait. I do not recomend them not only because they over tightened my wheels but also because they don't want to fix their mistakes.

Update 6-14-18.  Was contacted by a manager named Nick. He told me to come back and they would fix it for me. It took me a while but i finally went in today (after having a flat and not being able to take my wheel off) the service writer Antonio was very disrespectful and rude. Another young man came to help me and was very nice. They took my truck back and brought it back with the same problems.

62,"November 01, 2018","First off let me state this review is only for the email I recently got from Fenton Nissan, not my overall experience with them.  Overall, I would give them a 4 out of 5 stars.  

But, I just recently got an email from the General Manager, Patrick Davalos, saying my car is in very high demand right now and they are willing to give me more than what it is worth if I trade it in on a new car which would be marked down with huge discounts.  Here is the email below:

(Email received on 26OCT18)
""My name is Patrick Davalos, and I'm the General Manager at Fenton Nissan of Rockwall.
Right now, you are sitting on a very large nest egg that’s worth thousands to us at Fenton Nissan of Rockwall. The vehicle you're driving right now is in high demand and we’re willing to pay for it. But you must act now! Every mile you drive is another dollar down the road going into someone else’s pocket. I’m going to significantly cut prices, so I’d rather pass the savings to you. Please come see us now and get the money you deserve.
Heavily discounted Monster Sized Savings offers are going on now. But for a select few, like yourself, I am offering an exclusive 4-day VIP opportunity to take advantage of those significant savings and more! Including a $1.00 Down Special to get you behind the wheel! This is a limited time offer, just enough to make my October sales goals and no more. I can’t afford to do this long, so please contact me as soon as you’re able. Just think, you could be driving a brand-new vehicle for the same payments or even less.
Because you’re a customer of ours, we will give you SPECIAL PRE-AUTHORIZED TRADE-IN TERMS that will pay you more for your current vehicle today than at any other time.
I’m doing whatever it takes to make sure our customers have a great experience, so you can reply to me directly or feel free to give me a call at the number below.
Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you soon!

Call me at: 972-961-4842
Or email me: patrick.davalos@fentonmotors.com
Thanks again,

Patrick Davalos
General Manager
Fenton Nissan of Rockwall

I responded to his email and after 3 days never got a response, so I decided to go in and ask to see Patrick Davalos, who was conveniently in a meeting and was asked if would talk to one of the sales people who is familiar with the email I got.  Sure, why not?  

The value they offered for my trade was the $1,500 below the KBB value.  The email said they were willing to offer me more.  They were way off.  Then, the price of the car I wanted, Rogue SL, was the same as MSRP $32,500.  Of course the way they show it to you, they mark it up to $37,000 and say they have given you $4,500 in discounts and rebates.  Where is the ""Heavily discounted Monster Sized Savings offers are going on now"", I didn't see any.  

In the end, they wanted to pay me less than KBB for my car and they did not offer any ""Heavily discounted Monster Sized Savings"".  They just used the email, effectively I might add, to get me in there and try their high pressure tactics to sell me a car.  I would expect this from lessor, more in line for used car salesmen, smaller dealerships.  Not a tactic I would normally associate with the Nissan brand or this dealership. 

I have no issues with the salesman Greg Amos.  He was good to work with and the test drives were great.  I really liked the Nissan Rogue SL.  Great car to drive and really nice all around.  Was really looking forward to driving away with it that day.

Very disappointed with Fenton Nissan and will most likely never buy from them again.  More over, I will now most likely never buy another Nissan again; of which I have owned 5 Nissan vehicles in the past.",2.8
63,"November 01, 2018","I was done with work early and went ahead and came. The gentleman came right out to me and I explained what my car needed. There was a table I could sit at and watch my car being cared for. Since I'd had to skip lunch, it helped to have a blueberry muffin. Also great NOT to have news on tv, but something soothing like home improvement shows. Everything is set up to for a calming experience: food, drink, non-controversial tv shows.

When I got my car back, it was so much cleaner. I'm sorry, I forgot the name of the gentleman who helped me, but he showed me a breakdown of what I needed and helped me select the things I could afford now and what would have to wait. The car runs a lot better and sounds better. And I got the checklist of things my car needs.

95,"October 03, 2018","I traveled over 3 hours to buy a truck that was advertised in listingallcars for a good price. I called before I traveled to be certain that my trade would bring a fair price and that there were no hidden fees.  I was assured that if my trade was how I described it there would be no problem. The salesman was actually a good guy but the process was so awful that I found myself having to demand that the key to my trade in be returned so that I could leave. I was first informed that there would be $2000 added to the advertised price due to previously undisclosed dealer ""add-ons"". Next I was told that because I wanted to pay cash that $4000 would have to be subtracted from the Nissan discount, next I was told that even though my trade-in was exactly as I had described they nonetheless could give me only $6000 for it - I was told $7000 over the phone. At each point in this somewhat grueling negotiation I was left, like the sucker I was being taken for, to wait while ""Management discussed the deal"". Next I was told that I would have to finance the truck in order to have the advertised price plus the add-on honored. I did not want to finance and I told them so but they insisted that I provide them with a credit application - I refused. It was not until I stormed into the ""managers"" office and demanded my key back did they offer to sell the truck at the originally agreed trade-in for cash. I would have walked anyway if I had not already driven 3 hours and spent 3 more hours in a stupid negotiation. This sort of treatment is exactly why car sales has such a horrible reputation. I can say this: I will never recommend a Nissan to a single person!

After 20- 25 minutes a service tech came in and tod me I need inside air filter and the air filters for engine as well as adding brake fluid. Since this is a leased  vehicle and never had to pay for any maintenance to the vehicle I told him ok. When they finished the work I find out I need to pay $289.00 out of pocket.

It sat in the bay for half an hour after it was completed and then taken to be washed. I watched employees come in regularly to get drinks at the fountain inside the dealership. It seems as though they take a lot of breaks. Also I was told when I bought the car that I only got one free oil change and a week ago I was told that I was supposed to have 2 years worth of oil changes. Since it was the end of my two years I got one free oil change at the beginning and one free oil change at the end and paid for all the ones in between somewhere else.

Hi, I purchased a car from you guys around the 9th of August. After going back & forth with your sales guy he asked if I had purchased any extended-warranty's or gap. I told him yes. He then told me he could check with the Greenville Nissan to see & if we could cancel those, the funds could be used on the negative equality. I told him I didn't want to purchase a car if I wasn't going to eat up any of the quality. He returned and informed me that I however didn't have any type of extended warranty or gapp on the car, and I asked was he sure & he said yes. So at that point I felt like the only thing I could do was trade my car in because it was never covered under gap & I didn't have any extended warranty s. I returned home and something just didn't sit well with me so I reached out the dealership in Greenville myself. Feeling as if they had took advantage of me or maybe I missed that info in my docs. After speaking with the finance manager there he told me I did indeed have gap & a extended warranty package on the car! I've done business with Nissan for a while and I've never felt taken advantage of until this happen. I will not however put all the blame on your staff there because I should have doubled check myself from the start but you guys are the experts right?! But I do now feel horrible about my buying process and extending myself on a purchase that I didn't really have to make & now having a payment that's 50 bucks more but still.  Anyway I was able to get in touch with the dealership in Greenville and he was able to give me a cancellation form to cancel both of the policies. Chris was nice & friendly not to much to say but some where somebody dropped the ball. 

I will also be stopping in Saturday to cancel my extended warranty that I purchased with this car this Saturday. 

Thanks for your time, have a great day!

Two days before my temp tags expied (which would  fall on a Sunday) I make another attempt to follow up on my tags to find out how to handle expired temp tags and was hung up on so I called back and was transfered to a lady named Hilda only to be informed MY TAGS HAD NOT EVEN BEEN APPLIED FOR due to a lack of inspection on the truck I had purchased and  (apparently) a final inspection was supposed to have happened the day of the purchase (2 months prior) 
As a result,  I NOW LOST A GREAT DEAL on my USED TRUCK purchased due to their incompetence and then upon arriving in person to demand answers I was told they had tried to call me MULTIPLE TIMES, PLUS LEFT MESSAGES THAT THIS INSPECTION NEEDED TO BE DONE BEFORE MY TAGS COULD EVEN BE PROCESSED!....(NOT!!!) (After confirming of course that THEY HAD BOTH CELL and HOME NUMBERS CORRECT; I can up most assuredly confirm that this was NOT the case ! Even in person they lied to my face .  After becoming very irate and emotional at the situation and talking to multiple people to which quickly found a PRIVATE sales room to put myself and my son in for THEIR privacy and THEN to be disrespected and treated like a child I was asked to CALM DOWN for MY HEALTH and to DRINK SOME WATER and after almost 4 hours of wasted time and lost MONEY spoken down to, They somehow managed to go get my inspection accomplished and needed on my used truck, go to tax office and get my new tags and then offer me a ONE time OIL CHANGE, ONE TIRE ROTATION, ONE FREE TANK OF GAS AND A REFUND IN CHECK FORM of $650.00 TO BE MAILED HOPEFULLY WITHIN THE NEXT TO WEEKS not sure when it will be received FOR MY LOSS AND TROUBLE of paying full coverage and car payments on my vehicle at home so that I can sale it but is now on hold until I can receive my pd in full title for the used truck I purchased through them which will be another wait of 2-6wks of payments of waiting for state for my title.  They did however kindly offer (while reinforcing to me that they WERE NOT LEGALLY RESPONSIBLE TO DO ANYTHING) but admitted to the errors and lies made on their part from the call logs that were pulled with steps traced to verify what I was saying was nothing but the truth so help me God (Thanks for the favor)! I would like to applaud the Used car Sales Manager Chris for his integrity for owning up to the errors made during this process and to the wonderful service manger over inspections who kindly put the new tags on my truck  for me and although the compensation made was GREATLY APPRECIATED and certainly WELL DESERVED, it WASN'T no where near ENOUGH to COVER MY LOSS and restore the trust I had for the Nissan dealership in Rockwall Texas.  
You can decide for yourselves if this is where you want to go for your next purchase but this was my FIRST experience and LAST experience with this particular Nissan dealership location .",1.0

Took 2 1/2 hours

Had to go looking for my car and someone to help me 2 1/2 hours later

They got my car mixed up with another car and gave wrong keys, had me sign wrong paperwork, asked me to pay for some work on brakes that was not done on my car.  When I questioned the payment (I had asked if it would cost anything on the day I made the appointment because I wanted to be ready and,  they had said nothing) the guy next to us (that was helping another customer) started discussing why I had to pay the amount VERY RUDELY in front of his customer and more!

220,"August 19, 2018","This was my first experience with Fenton Nissan. I learned of them through searching the net for a particular vehicle I was looking for, and they happened to have a potential ""Keeper"" for me. I was very apprehensive at first, not knowing anyone at the dealer, or the area. I live about an hour and half away. I phoned the dealership to confirm that the vehicle I was interested in was still there, and I spoke with Greg Amos, who informed me that it in fact was still available. I said I'd like to come on in and check it out, and he said, ""Great. It'll be up front and ready for you when you get here."" I can't say enough about Greg as my sales contact. He was outstanding. No slick sales gimmicks, no pressure, no attempts at manipulative ploys. Just great, accomodating service. It sounds like a cliche, but we hit it off like this guy has been my friend for years. And trust me, I'm a skeptical type of personality. I ended up purchasing the vehicle I was interested in, for a price that I was comfortable with. No hassles. Just civil, relaxed negotiations. Amos went above and beyond when I had questions....Gave me complete peace of mind, which we all know, is close to priceless. Thank you Mr. Amos!",4.8

Anthony in the service area provided great customer service and helped me with the issues I was having with my vehicle. ,4.0
235,"August 14, 2018"," I would like to start off saying that the sales department Was professional and courteous except one point and that is the Internet final price was not the final price when I got there the price went up about $1700 because of tinted windows and things like that. I wish they would have stated included in the Internet price,but that is not my main point. After a couple of months I was due for my first free oil change and as I stood in the lobby and look through the windows as they pulled my truck in and out several times I noticed why they were doing that. There are two narrow beams of iron that they are trying to bring my truck between they had to bring my mirrors in and once they pulled my truck into this brand new facility the mechanic could not get out of my truck he had to put the Door up against the metal beam as the other mechanic try to place his hand in between. As I noticed this I walked into the mechanics bay and asked very nicely ,I’m sorry did you have to put my door up against the metal beam  to get out. He said yes but the other guys hand blocked it from getting scratched I thought that was a weird being that this is a brand new facility and I have a Nissan titan and there should be a better place and equipment to change my oil and rotate my tires. I left to have dinner with my parents but when I came back , I realized I must’ve really upset those guys that I asked if they  had put my door up against the metal beam because my seat was completely laid-back pulled back the lumbar was completely blown up my mirror was completely Messed up and had to  readjust and my radio that was on talk radio was now on rap, my medical therapy devices  that I had in my Front passenger seat with my vest, is now in the floorboard one of my clamps was outside of my truck on the ground and the sticker that they placed in the window to remind you when your next or change is supposed to be was 1000 miles over the limit  for the next oil change. Another words If I  would have gone by that sticker I would have driven 6000 miles before my oil change when I’m supposed to get an oil change every 5000.  I called and left the service manager Nick Nicholson several messages he obviously is no manager at all and doesn’t care about  customer service. I now believe they are  only after selling you a vehicle and then not really concerned with your repeat servicing on a new vehicle this is obvious by not receiving one phone call  back from Nick . I would not recommending getting a vehicle serviced year find a better dealership or a small mom and pop that will give you better customer service and actually get to know you and if you do have a problem or issue will return your phone calls .",1.0

From that point forward things were handled in a much more respectable manner. .  My daughter and I drove four and a half hours to the dealership.  We were treated very well even though I brought up a discrepancy with the actual odometer reading versus what was advertised on the website.  Needless to say they took a little more off of the price.  Finally about to close the deal and they had made an error figuring out wonderful Louisiana taxes.  They ate that as well.

303,"July 19, 2018","Be aware! 

They sent all my paperwork to Nissan auto finance bank without my permission. The finance person ELVIS told me that his manager” forced him to do that”. I was still very patient. I decided to refinance my car through my bank but still had to wait FOR Fenton Nissan in rockwall to send a check to Nissan finance bank for $3000 for a bumper to bumper coverage that I didn’t want. I had to idea it was going to take 2 months...

What ended up happening, since they were taking so long, I had a car loan at 2 different banks just because they were refusing to fix their mistake and simply do their job. I got the car on May 6th, yesterday after over 2 months of me begging them to do it, July 18 the check was finally sent which meant my car was paid of at a Nissan auto finance and they only loan I’m paying is with USAA bank. Of course, I never heard any apology for their lack of professionalism but it’s ok at least I don’t want to deal with them anymore. 

The only good experience I had was with the sales person-Justin who did a great job and I was very pleased but once I had to start dealing with the financial part all of a sudden everyone was too busy to help you out and refused to pick up their phone multiple times as soon as they took my money and I became their “customer” 

Im very disappointed but at least had a great lesson NOT TO DO ANY BUSINESS WITH FENTON NISSAN IN ROCKWALL!",1.0

319,"July 10, 2018","We went to the Fenton Nissan of Rockwall and purchased a Sentra. Our salesman, Chris was helpful and friendly but made promises he could not keep in regards to work that needed to be done on the car. We got in writing that we wanted the scratches and dents fixed, a new battery, and the windows tinted on the car. After purchasing the car we left it at the dealership for a few days so they could tint the windows and replace the battery. We were told that we would need to set an appointment with Chris to have the car serviced at the onsite body shop for the dents. So we set the appointment with him for a week later at 8:00 in the morning. When we brought the car to the body shop for the appointment they said there was no appointment for us and that they would not be able to work on it at all that day. It was not possible for us to bring the car another day since we already drove an hour to drop it off for the day. So we told them we would be leaving the car with them and they needed to get the work done. We got multiple calls throughout the day about updates on our car being ""almost done"" and that it should be done by 6 that evening. When we called before heading up to the dealership to pick up the car we talked to many different people all unable to locate our car. They kept saying, ""I don't know. We can't find it anywhere on the lot."" Once we heard that we drove up there to check out the situation ourselves thinking, ""How can you have lost a car...a car we just bought?!"" When we got to the dealership the car was parked right at the front in customer parking, exactly where we had left it that morning. AND the car had not been touched. They had not done any of the work they said they had over the phone. The strange part is they went out of their way to call us with updates of things that had not been done. Our main issue with the dealership is that they will tell you whatever you want to hear true or untrue. We also still have not received the license plates after two months of making the purchase. My husband has called 5+ times asking when the new plates will be in, seeing as though the temporary plates will expire soon. Each phone call went something like, ""Oh they will be in by saturday, tuesday, next week etc."" Now the plates are expired and we still don't have out new ones. He called again and was told the plates were just submitted today by the Title Clerk- Hilda. Meaning- it could be another 3 or 4 weeks. The receptionist we spoke to Adia Kirks was very helpful and sent us an email with temporary plates and was honest with us about the situation. We asked her why the plates were not ordered months ago when we purchased the car, she said she didn't know. This dealership really will tell you anything just to get you to stop bothering them.",1.8

I had the oil changed and also had new windshield wipers put on.

386,"June 15, 2018","Went for an oil change. They did their multi-point check service as well. They told me items to be watching for that appear will need service or attention soon, but didn't try and sell  me or push me into additional services or items that I didn't originally come in for. They were honest about what they saw and why the concerns, but not pushy by any means. I didn't know that the 1st oil change was free, since it's my first time going there. They didn't have to tell me that, but they did. That says a lot about their honesty and true customer service drive. Definitely go back, and definitely recommend to others. ",5.0

The lady who scheduled my appointment over the phone was polite and professional. They were able to get me in the next day and didn’t ask for a ton of information over the phone. When I arrived the greeter was extremely helpful and got all my information put in their system quickly with a tablet. I expressed my concerns and they let me know they would call when it was done. The work was completed quickly and everything was explained to me in a way that was easy to understand. My car had been washed and vacuumed as well!

390,"June 12, 2018","Doing and closing the deal on our 2018 Rogue Sport was a breeze but it stopped there. We were given a loaner to use while the service center installed door edge guards and cross rails on the roof rack. After having it for 72 hours and my having to fish for updates I found out they scrambled at the last minute to do the doors but still didn’t have the cross rails. I had made a call to the service center to get updates and discovered after being on hold for ten minutes during a normal weekday that everybody leaves at 5, including the service manager and all of the service writers. This is unacceptable for a dealer franchise seated in a suburban community when most residents commute from Dallas. Moreover it’s unacceptable to be made to wait as long as three weeks for an accessory for a current new model to arrive when their distributor should already have it on the shelf. Being told that the service center is only open for “limited” hours on a Saturday is also unacceptable, as most people can only come in over the weekend to get their car serviced. ",3.4

Well the light was taken off but came back on the next day. To make a long story short, the light comes off and on now after I called the dealership and told them about the light coming back on. They can't promise me a rental car and while I'm 8 months pregnant, I'm scared to even turn my car back over to their service department because last time it took 2 weeks to get my car back. Very aggravated with this dealership and I haven't even made a payment on my car yet.

427,"May 13, 2018","I can truly say i love the car i purchased and have no regrets whatsoever. That being said, i purchased the car that i wanted, not because of anything my sales person or the dealership. The kid who accompanied during the test drive didn't even know what kind of car we were in, let alone able to answer any questions, and the test drive itself consisted of 3 turns with a maximum of 30 mph. That was disappointing but not a deal breaker. The purchase itself took an incredible amount of time, finally ending at 10:30pm on a Friday with me having to leave without the SD card for the nav system. I was told to return Wednesday, and I would receive the SD card, and a couple small repairs, as well as a full detailing, tank of gas, and someone would sit with me and show me everything the car did. Wednesday rolls around and I show up to a 30 second meet with the salesman and he asked me to wait for the repairs. I never saw him again. When the car was finished, it had not been washed nor the tank filled. I even had to ask again for the window sticker goo to be scraped off, and even when it was done it was a poor job. I was given the keys and the guys left. So now I have a nice shiny new car but i have no idea how to use all the nifty features. This probably doesn't seem like a big deal, but I was promised something and I paid for a certain service and i didn't receive it. I'm just disappointed in the experience, and do not feel 'part of the family'. Apparently my car has parking assist - who knew! i have no idea how to use it, but i know where the setting is to turn it on, so there's a start I guess...  again, i realize this probably shouldn't matter, but after spending $40k i just hoped i could trust your words. Alas, this is a typical dealership that wants your business and will push you to the side as soon as  you sign the dotted line. ",2.8

Spoke to Manager he said and we could not believe what was coming out of his mouth  ""You got a good deal on the car"" if you want second key you have to pay for it"" Really! wow

Called Nissan main customer service line, filed a complain, after two hours and speaking to general manager, he was also trying to sell us second key, when we said we will NOT pay for second key, then he gave us the second key. Our opinion is that they must have lost the second key and just wanted us to go away with A KEY. They were very rude and unprofessional. I would not recommended this dealership to anyone.  ",1.5

484,"November 10, 2017","Fenton Nissan of Rockwall is one of the best dealerships that I have seen.  They continue to amaze me with courteous attention to details and quick response to my needs.  They always provide excellent, timely attention to details and meet or exceed customer demands with efficiency and dedication.

485,"October 19, 2017","This is experience is like other car buying experiences in that you will BUY A CAR. You will be OFFERED  warranties.... Its the business. As buyers, its OUR job to know what we want and need. It is especially OUR RESPONSIBILITY to know what we can afford. Car buying is fun and exciting!! That's what Chris brings to the table with his warm personality, helpful demeanor, knowledge and experience. I trust him to get me what I want, at a fair price. I got to decide whether or not I wanted/needed a warranty. I didn't. And that was my choice, as an educated consumer.
How was this experience extraordinary???I LOVE THIS PLACE! Its a freaking awesome establishment! Chris is a real stand up guy that was super fun to work with! The service I received was above par. I will forever recoomemnd this place to my family and friends!",4.8
486,"October 19, 2017",Not an honest man when it comes to business. Beware of the papers you sign. You may have to go back and ask for a copy. His co worker that he works with to rip you off is David Rodriguez. You will be told about all of these great warranties for $4000 and it will be @your expense so they can get commission. Dont ever trade a car there. Read all reviews for this dealership. You will see most people feel like you are lied to and ripped off.  ,1.4
487,"October 10, 2017","I took one of my 2 Nissans here several months ago for an oil change since they are new and close to my home. It was a seamless experience. No complaints. Then about a month ago I get an email special about oil change. So I tried to set up an appointment online so I could get service on my other Nissan. The online reservation obviously didn't work. Never got a confirmation so on the morning of the appointment I called and they didn't show anything for me? But they said they had an opening in the next 20 mins. and I was told it would be a 45 min. appointment. So we proceeded to the dealership.  The service writer now said it would be a one and a half hour to a 2 hour appointment, even after I told him what the lady on on the phone told me 20 mins. earlier. No concession. Told him I didn't have an extra 2 hours to sit on a Saturday, so we left. Then on Monday I get an email from them saying I didn't show up for an appointment!!! I replied but that email must've gone to cyberspace. Never heard from them. I even later emailed what I thought was an email for service department. Shortly thereafter I start getting text messages to my phone. I thought it was service? It was some guy from there trying to sell me a car! I told him I was simply trying to get my oil changed. Never heard from anyone there and that's been several weeks. I really hoped this nice new dealership would be great and different from others I've used in the past. I suppose I was wrong?  P.S. - I had tried to buy a car from this place back in the spring of 2017 - and nobody ever replied to my online request for a quote. I should have known then.",1.0

489,"September 23, 2017",I purchased a Nissan Vera 2017 from them and had issues with sales person.  I explain upfront that I was not playing games and wanted to purchase car.  Needless to say he was asking for 2500 down and could not explain where the money was going (it was not coming off the price of the car).  Anyways his excuse was that he had no access to interest rates or financing..... Long story short the finance manager worked with me to get what I needed and showed me where all the money was going and what my real payment will be.  On final inspection of the vehicle found that the hood was damage what happened was the salesman left the hood rod connected and closed the hood.  which damage the alignment of the hood.  Needless to say they had to order part and guess what they did not even have it in the computer so I had to wait two weeks to get part.  They are good at apologizing for problems but fail to fix the issues.  They keep offering free tank of gas to make up for it but not really worth it because tank is about 10 gallons.  The other issue I had was the advertised price on website is not the price they try to give you in person the salesman kept telling me they added features to the car and I told him if you advertise the price on website you need to honor it.   He stated that was not the current price of the car needless to say it was all BS and he tried playing numbers game but when you get a calculator out and do the math it does not add up.  I downloaded app on smartphone that did all the calculations up he presented me and it shows the payments were almost 75 dollars more and down payment was not affecting price.  Needless to say after complaining to managers congratulating me on purchase I told them for what and told them what he did.  He was fired shortly after.  So use caution when purchasing with them and stick to your numbers not theirs.,3.0
490,"June 27, 2017","Went in for a simple oil change & state inspection.  Service advisor recommended  sealer for battery (which I bought and they applied to battery) and then tells me I have a bad battery (test showed 50% on low) so unless I purchased a battery from them, sealer is wasted - should have done battery test before selling and applying sealer.  Inspection could not be done because terminals on battery were removed before doing inspection and told me I would have to return after I drove my car at least 50 miles.  After I left, about 1/2 mile away, I looked at the passenger outside mirror and it was GONE.  It had been knocked off during the car wash and found on the floor of the car wash.  It was was not broken and was put back on.  When my car was returned for the second time to me by the manager, Brandon, he got out of the car and said, ""there you go"" - did not say sorry for your trouble, come back to see us - nothing.  ON THE POSITIVE SIDE, THEY DID RETURN ALL OF THE MONEY HAD I SPENT FOR OIL CHANGE AND SEALER BUT ILL NEVER GO BACK.   I've been in there twice looking for a new Nissan, but won't buy it there.",1.0

494,"May 03, 2017","I cant say how disappointed and angry my wife and I were after being led to believe one thing through emails and also on the phone with a salesman at Fenton about the deal we made, then driving 100 miles only to find out it was all basically a ""bait and switch"" just to get us there. Unethical to say the least. The first question I had was ""do you honor the Nissan VPP price""? The answer? ""I talked to my manager and yes, we do"". Then I proceeded to tell the salesman exactly what vehicle we found and wanted on the Fenton Nissan website. I then told him the VPP price and asked him specifically if we also get the Nissan rebate, AND the dealer rebate. He said...""YES"". I also told him we had a trade in and gave him all the info, including the payoff on the car. I specifically told him the car would have to be paid off during the deal to which he replied. ""I see no problem"". So after talking to him and being reassured THREE different times in three different conversations that my price with the VPP program and the rebates, and the trade in payoff would be our deal, I was reassured and basically they begged to come up there and make the deal. Within the next few days I received emails and phone calls from the salesman and finance manager (Nick) pleading with me to make the 120 mile trip to Rockwall. I called again to talk to the salesman to make sure we had a deal before we drove up there. He reassured me we had the deal. We made the trip. Guess what? That's right. NOTHING I was told on the phone was true. NOTHING. All the numbers had changed, and even with our excellent credit score, they had us on paper about $6k in the hole. Upside down on the trade in. $2500 down payment. NO dealer rebate. They didnt even want to honor the VPP price which is nonnegotiable from Nissan. Absolutely none of the verbal deal we made prior. This is after we both took the day off from work, and drove 120 miles to make what we thought was a great deal. Turns out it was a lie all along. Shame on Fenton Nissan of Rockwall. I'll be sure and spread the word about your bait and switch tactics, and overall shady sales tactics.",1.0

I even offered to pay more than the asking price if they would hold it for me until Monday morning 9/12/16 he stated he would talk to another manager Saturday morning and that he would call me back of, course know one called me back, so I called Demarkus Saturday morning and asked if the truck had been sold and he told me the vehicle was sold to a family member of the dealership which I'm also sure was total BS! and he offered to find me something from an auction the next week, I DO NOT BUY AUCTION JUNK VEHICLES! this was an insult that he even offered this!
