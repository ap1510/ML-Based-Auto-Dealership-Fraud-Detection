1,"September 21, 2019","I first began using this dealership to service my Tahoe. I had such quick and friendly service, I then knew this was the place to purchase my next new vehicle. I found the car I loved and Ronnie Parris was quick and eager to work out all details with me on my trade-in and new purchase. He maximized my rebate savings and trade-in value. I feel I got a good deal. I was in and out with my purchase in a lot shorter time than any other dealership I have purchased. I love my new Traverse!",5.0
2,"August 23, 2019","Enjoyed the no hassle purchasing experience and the complete open explanation for each question that I had and the reason and openness concerning the selling price and value of my trade in.  In the past I did not look forward to the purchasing experience of buying a new car because of the ""dog and pony"" show you had to experience.  What a refreshing experience dealing with Ronnie and the entire Jay Hodge team. ",5.0
3,"August 22, 2019","My experience with Jay Hodge, Bill Owens and Ronnie Parris was a great one.  It was a smooth, no hassle time.  Ronnie had it all looked over and ready for me to choose a color and sign my paperwork by the time I arrived after work.  I would recommend Jay Hodge and Ronnie to anyone looking to buy a vehicle.  Ronnie and the whole staff were very friendly.  It was like being around family.  He made it an extremely easy process.  Donna was awesome as well, helping me get set up with On Star and linking my phone to my car.  I purchased a 2019 Chevrolet Trax and I love it.  Thank you guys for being so courtesy and kind.  I may just have to come for a visit to say hi...  Thank you again,

8,"July 17, 2019","I stopped by to look at my dream car a Chevy Blazer with all the bells and whistles and then some I didn't know about. Tyler was awesome and worked to get the payments to where I could afford to get the top of the line car that I thought I could dream about.

18,"February 23, 2019","My husband called Jay Hodge Chevrolet to let them know that I was interested in trading vehicles and told them what I liked. They called me within a short time and asked if I would like to come down and look at what they had that they thought would work for me. I ask if I could come down later that day and they said perfect! I went in and they treated me like a guest.  They showed me what they had offered to let me drive it, showed me all the features, answered all my questions, and I picked up the car that evening!  The salesman, Jeff, spent time showing me features, Donna stayed late helping me set up my on-star and everyone was super great! They made me feel so welcome!

40,"November 06, 2017","I'm 59 years old and have purchased many vehicles. I was recommended by a friend to try Jay Hodges's while recently shopping for a pre owned four wheel drive pick up. Upon arrival I was greeted by a very friendly salesman named Doug. Very helpful and not pushy or over bearing like some can be. I found a truck that I really liked and told him I would get my wife and return, which usually freaks out some sales people but it was cool with him.... When we returned he greeted us with the keys and told us to take it out on our own, which was great. While we were gone they looked at our trade...
Upon returning we were given our keys back and told they had a figure for us. The trade offer was more than expected and when I told them what I wanted to pay for the truck (which was low)  The general manager came out to thank us for our business. It even went well to my surprise in the finance office. Everything was explained in plain english and we goy a great rate. Why can't all dealerships be this easy? We are loving the truck. It has one minor issue and they are even fixing that after the sale.",5.0
