Lastly, today during the delivery, Delia's mother [88 yrs old] had fallen and Delia needed to get home to her car to go to her mother's aid.  Mark had me take the new truck to get Delia to her car.  That worked out well and mom is okay.

I found my car through KBB.  I used the app functionality to ask the dealer whether the car was still available. I got a phone call very shortly thereafter.  spoke to Catherine who was very pleasant and helpful. I had a question she could not answer so she got Jose to call me. He was very encouraging of course. He met us at the front door when we got there to drive the car. And the rest is  history. 

I  I am horrible with names. So I think our finance guys name was Randy. He had some cool technology that really helped us get through the paperwork fast. And he did not seem forceful or slick.

The tagging is completed prior to the car hitting the lot but is NOT included in the listed price. I don't need nor want that but too bad it's done. I did not like that surprise charge. 2) Process took about 5.5 hours, again typical. We decided on the car via online shopping. I spoke with salesperson the day before and sent documents to prequal for loan. We are well qualified buyers, but it still took a while for finance dept to pull it all together.

Dave Edmunds the Internet Director knows what he is doing and he is very approachable. He gave me all the extra concessions I needed to be able to sign on the dotted line. Chris Scott is the Finance Manager and he was able to get me the monthly payment I needed. He even threw in a 2 year extended warranty at a cheap price to give me peace of mind on buying a used car with high mileage. His fancy board to sign all the paperwork on was cool too.

762,"April 29, 2019","Received several emails/robo call  expressing interest in my 2017 Buick Envision . Decided after robo call to visit to explore the remote possibility I'd be interested in trading,ie no interest if requiring downpayment or significantly larger monthly loan payment for a new car. Salesman was excellent--he identified the terms of my interest and what features in the prospective  new car were required. In a very low key manner (not pushy which turns me off) , he ""worked the problem"" resulting in the trade/purchase . ",4.4
763,"April 29, 2019","This is my 3rd used car from a dealer. Other purchases the salesmen are pushy, question what I really want, try to get me into other cars I’m not interested in and push extended warranties until the moment I drive off the lot. West Point was not like that and all of the agents I spoke to were knowledgeable and straight forward. The only product heavily sold to me was an interior and exterior protectant that sounded interesting but overall is really unnecessary for modern paints.

The signing process was INSANELY smooth. All e-signatures using a DocPad. My wife and I were talking about that all night long about how much smoother the signing process was compared to other vehicle purchases.

Only complaint was that waiting to go through loan processing took more time than the test drive and document prep that our salesman did. I know we were there pretty late so we understand, but if there is any critique, it would be that.

10/10 would recommend!!",4.8

898,"March 14, 2019","It had been 18 years since my last vehicle purchase. It was a 2001 GMC Sierra HD2500. It has been a phenomenal vehicle and a great follow up to my 1991 GMC Sierra which I drove until the 2001 came out. I ""cold called"" West Point GMC to see if I could schedule an appointment with a salesman after work. London Seals answered and set up the appointment. We even exchanged a few text messages to make sure we were on the same page with regards to what I was looking for. As I was leaving work London texted me to say he had fallen ill and had to leave work early but that he had arranged for Mustafa Manni to meet with me. Upon arrival I met with ""Manni"". We discussed what I was looking for and then he grabbed some keys and we went out to the lot and started looking. He showed me several vehicles and then we picked one to drive. As I drove he had me try out some of the features and related his favorite features from his personal vehicle which was similar. After a few test drives we went back to the lot to find specific vehicles that met the features I was looking for. Manni's patience was impressive. Fortunately for me they had several identical trucks on the lot that matched what I was looking for. Manni and I then began working on the pricing. I confirmed that the West Point GMC website was very accurate and up to date on inventory, pricing and offers. I was surprised that I DID NOT hear the typical sales line that the website pricing was only good for one or two vehicles and that no one qualifies for all of the offers listed. Instead Manni worked with me to hammer out a deal even on the discounted price of the truck. He even considered the trade-in of my 2001. In the end (after about 4 hours) I got the vehicle I wanted, the deal I was hoping for and a pleasant sales experience along the way. The best part for me is that I got a brand new truck on my Birthday! How cool is that. It was a once in a lifetime event for me and was definitely better than what I was expecting. Thanks West Point GMC,  Manni and ……….London.",5.0

958,"February 20, 2019","Good morning  - Having been in sales for 25 years and appreciate honesty and integrity, Nate Natanson and Chris Scott (Finance) are both 5 star all stars.

My fiancée and I scheduled an appointment to look at a Terrain that was advertised on the internet.  We were assigned to James Reeves.  We did the test drive and James explained about the car and the rebate specials that GMC was offering.  James explained about the trade in rebate among others.  Once we finished the test drive and was back in his office, I was very direct with my questions.  I could use an employee discount code, and asked if both could be used, or if internet pricing was better or employee code better to use to purchase the vehicle.  After, a few keystrokes by James, I was told I could not use both employee and internet in conjunction with one another, and that internet pricing was better.  OK, store that answer for the moment.  It mentioned rebate for financing; I asked about any pre payment penalty since GMC interest rates are not competitive.  He stated no pre payment penalty but preferred that loan was kept in place for 4 months so yall don't get dinged for early payoff.  (Like I am worried about yall's bottom line).  After some more direct questions, James left the office to go get trade in value on old vehicle and to consult with Brian Sommerfelt.  James brought back a deal sheet upon his return.  1st line item was your junk $399 insurance policy. I asked specifically if this was mandatory, not once, not twice but three times.  The answer from James was "" well I have bought it on my 3 cars I have purchased here, and the sales rep next door has bought it on his 2 and so on""  So I asked again, is it mandatory, no response.  I asked my fiancée is I was speaking in English or French as James had yet to answer that simple question.  I looked James in the eyes and asked a third time, and to this day, he cannot and has not answered that simple question.  So we go to trade in value, and there is no additional rebate for doing the trade in.  I asked where it was, and he said you don't get both trade in and the trade in rebate.  He didnt have the financing rebate on there either.  He then asked for employee discount code (remember James said internet pricing was better and that I could not use both) and I asked why he needed it.  He stated that WestPoint gets rebates for using code I asked if those rebates flowed down to me, and he said no.  So I reminded him of his answer which one was better, internet or employee code, and he said employee code.  I asked if I could use both and he said no.  So why would he ask for code now? At this point we had been LIED to enough.  I asked for his business card, and he refused to give it to me, and I told him we were leaving, and I didnt appreciate being lied to multiple times.  Keep in mind Jmes still had our keys and car.  WE moved to the lobby.  After 15 minutes of waiting in lobby, like this deal could be saved, Brian comes out.  He start saying how he thinks we are $500 a part, and I said no we are not.  I said keys and car NOW, we are leaving.  I explained the situation since I have a witness and stated that James repeated lied to us, and refused to give business card and we were leaving.  I can go somewhere else and get a better deal ALWAYS.  Another 10 minutes to bring car up and leave.  Nate called the next morning and apologized for the way we were treated.  Finally an honest man at your dealership.  Come to find out the $399 insurance policy is a junk fee and is not mandatory, or maybe it was just waived.  Ohh and we get the trade in rebate on top of trade in and we get the financing rebate and we can use internet pricing with employee discount.

The service department took 3 times to get all of the work done on the car.  That is unacceptable.

The finance gentleman, Chris Scott is awesome as well. Nate and Chris gets 5 stars.

I will refer people to Nate specifically for an honest straight forward pleasant car buying experience.

Its unfortunate that I have to put a 1 star for James and Brian, neither of them deserve the 1 star.

If James was working for my company, I would have fired him on the spot or when I found out what had transpired.  He lacks the honest and integrity to be a janitor at my company",5.0

As soon as jumped out in the parking lot I was greeted and eagerly assisted by Yoseth Guzman, a well distinguished rookie of 2 wks. Originally the 1st vehicle I was eyeing was no longer available but luckily I had a second choice which Yoseth quickly made available for a test drive. Fast forward to the ever so dreaded bargaining scenario that gets a bad rep., Mr.Leroy, aka Uncle Leroy, was the MoD who mediated my lowball offers. He was courteous, precise and got straight down to business! We were able to quickly come to terms with a more than fair price AND I was able to score some sweet upgrades and accommodations to my new truck! Soon after, I got set up with Mr. Chris Scott and David Le in financing who could absolutely have not made the process any smoother! Real classy guys! Mr. Scott diligently broke down the buying process and ensured that I walked away with a fantastic loan term as well as a kick ass warranty, including the Nano technology protection package. All in all, the team was consistent in excellent service, formidable throughout the entire execution of my purchase and were genuinely personable human beings!

CJ was extremely professional from the time we met till the day I picked the Yukon up the next day as for myself I really appreciated that and am now feel better about us bringing our vehicles to West Point for service.

That evening, my mother in law drove out with a brand new Buick thanks to Chris.  Great Job.  The trauma caused by Harvey and health issues brought a new home and a new car all in the same year.

I was told he was going to run some numbers and pull some vehicles for me which I was looking forward to since I couldn't make it in until 7:30pm after work. I get there and had to wait. I understand when appointments run longer but after being paged twice and called, I had to wait 45 min before he finally passed me onto someone else who was obviously unprepared and ended up leaving me in the parking lot another 5 min so he can run some numbers as well. At that point it was already dark, I didn't get much help and left. I came back Saturday with my family to try again, test drove a vehicle, loved it and found another one that met my needs and Anthony was going to figure out numbers and send it to me while my family went out for lunch. I never recieved anything. Not even a call. I called today to see if he had it ready and I still have not received anything.

1355,"July 23, 2018","Shane greeted me almost immediately upon my arrival to the pre-owned lot.  I had a particular vehicle in mind, but wanted to test drive a few other vehicles and had no intentions of purchasing a vehicle that day, but Shane was accommodating and listened very well to my needs and me offered some options to try out.  It was plenty hot that day, and we both felt a lttle tired and defeated since the test drives were nice, but just not quite right for me.  We decided to do one last check of inventory, when we both saw a pretty little Acura parked in front of the office.  There was already an interested party but we took it for a test drive anyhow and I was hooked!  It was perfect for me.  Lucky for me the other party fell through, and we began the finance process.  This was probably the hardest part..the waiting for this to complete.  Shane was gracious and understanding and handled questions about my financial status professionally.  I felt completely in good hands. Shane and David handled my paperwork as smoothly as possible and after an unexpected very long day   I was extremely pleased with my overall experience at Westpoint Buick ",4.2

1377,"July 01, 2018","This car buying experience has been like no other.  CHRIS JONES and the team were helpful even though there were too many hurdles to overcome.  I started my car buying experience by talking over the phone with Chris Jones.  I explained to him exactly what I was looking for and that I did not want to play any games.  I shared with him exactly what I was looking for and what I was trying to do.  I even told him that if I  felt any funny business I would not come on in or even leave the dealership once I was there.  I went in because they had the car I was looking for and the price point I felt comfortable with.  When I made it there I was informed that the car was sold that morning, that was the first hurdle.  They showed me another similiar vehicle that was just as great.  I put a deposit and was getting excited that now I would be getting my wife one of the greatest anniversary gifts, exactly what she wanted.  I went back to work for a while and then went to get my current car ready by cleaning it etc since I was going to trade it in.  I headed back to the dealership excited about our new car and when I arrived I felt something was wrong when I saw a worry look on his face.  I asked Chris whats wrong, he explained to me that the car that I had put a deposit on was sold before I had put the deposit.  I was beyond upset and I could see his sincerity about the situation.  ""Hurdle two"". At this point I usually would walk away because when things like this go wrong, I feel like it is a typical car dealership games.  I could not walk away because of Chris Jones. He had made an impression on me beyond anything else, his true sincerity, his faith, his family beliefs all resignated with me.  He was about the customer and not the sell of the car.  They then found a car in San Marcos exactly what I wanted and had there driver drive back all in the same day.  I left my sons track meet early to come get the car because we thought the car would have arrived by 4pm.  No It did not get there, low and behold there was a flipped 18 wheeler that delayed the driver in Sealy for several hours.  ""Another hurdle"" you cant make this up.  So now Im thinking I guess I will call my huber to take me home because my family was in from California for my nieces Quinceñera party but I had come to far.  In the interim I was getting several calls from other dealers to go to their place and they would take care of me.   All I could think of how far Chris Jones and myself had come.  I waited it out and got my wife the car she had been wanting.  Now its time to meet the finance guy.  Let me tell you, meeting the finance person is not always pleasant.  I have purchased for myself and our comapny well over 80 vehicles in my lifetime and dread that part.  Mr. LE was the nicest most honest person.  When he asked me if I had inspected my vehicle I said yes and then he asked carefully?  I said No so he walked out with me.  I have never had a finance person do that.  That is why his card say finance director. Now when it came down to the paper work he explained everything carefully where I understood and felt comfortable.  I have to say Mr. LE has the coolest shoes and has swag.  You would have to meet him to find out.  At the end of the day I went thru many hurdles No customer should ever go thru.  I did because of the key employees that made it right.  I have a family business that has been around in Houston for 48 years.  Things happen that you have No control but it is up to the company and owners to make it right and it is about the customer and not the money.  A customer of a lifetime is more important then how much money you planned making on the deal, I know that first hand.  At this point Westpoint has my business and will share with my circle of influence.  A special thanks to Chris Jones for staying true to his core values, Nate, Mr. LE, Bob Price, and all the people behind the curtain.

Thanks

I worked with Chris Jones a/k/a xxxx C, and his customer service was 2cd to none!!! He listened to my situation and gave me suggestions on how to make my bad loan right. He advised me to look into another vehicle with huge rebates and incentives.  He worked out all the numbers and basically assisted me with making the bad loan good. I was terribly upside down in my current loan, and after he worked out the numbers, everything was fine. I came to West Point Buick looking for a Base model Yukon, but instead my family left with a fully loaded Sierra SLT, with warranties and all.

After test driving the car and deciding it was ""the one"", we were up front and told him we were buying a car outright. No financing. No trade-in.

1517,"April 10, 2018","I made two trips to this dealership to buy a Yukon XL.  First trip (on a Friday), salesman A (Mo) took all my information down and valued my trade in and said he was gonna call and email me information on Monday which I thought was weird because he didn't even seem like he wanted to make a sale that day.  
A week goes by and I never hear from him so I sent another internet request for information.  After getting a call from salesman B (James), we arranged an appointment to check out two trucks that had the exterior/interior color combination I wanted.  I came back into Westpoint GMC on a Saturday.  Car #1 was a demo car being driven by one of the managers as a daily driver that had almost 4,000 miles but the salesman kept insisting was new because it was never titled.  Car #2 was brand new with no miles.  Keep in mind these are the exact same trucks with the only thing differing between the two was bench seat vs. bucket seat second row.  
So we walk inside to work out some numbers on both trucks and the salesman came back and said the demo truck was gonna be my best deal.  He never even gave me any option to talk about the truck with 0 miles.  James, the salesman, low-balled the heck out of me on my trade-in and quoted me an outrageous price on the demo truck with almost 4,000 miles.  I was immediately turned off and showed him paperwork from other offers I got.  He went to the back and immediately came back and said they could give me $8000 more for my trade-in and drop the price a couple thousand--a difference of almost $10,000 just like that.  I wanted a breakdown of the numbers and even at the offer they just gave me, something didn't seem right about it.  I did the math (very generously in their favor might I add) on my own and even showed James the salesman the ""out the door"" price it should have been given the information he just presented me because I wanted to know where the extra $5,000ish was coming from.  He stumbled a bit because he couldn't give me a straight answer.  
At that point, I asked for my keys back and left Westpoint, purchased my vehicle same day at another dealership, and never looked back.
I don't claim to be an expert on selling cars, but Westpoint GMC committed every salesman error in the book including, but not limited to:  they didn't read the needs of the customer and just assumed I was an idiot when I walked in, they were not very knowledgeable about the product they were selling, and most importantly, they did not attempt at any time to seem like they were being truthful and forthcoming while doing business.
These two visits to Westpoint GMC is the reason most people dread the car-buying experience.  I usually don't write reviews and rather let people make their own opinions on a business, but I'm actually making it a point steer people away from Westpoint GMC so they don't have experience I had.",1.7

We had a great experience with the purchase of our first vehicle a couple of years ago at West point Buick in Katy TX.so it was no question that we would return there to the same salesman Chris (CJ) Jones.  He recognized us and greeted us immediately.  He truly treated us like family from the moment he saw us walk in. He even asked how our kids were doing which showed that he really cared for us and not just for a sale. CJ found the perfect vehicle and worked quickly yet diligently on getting things within our budget. It was late in the evening so I figured we would have to return the next day cause it was already past their closing time.  But CJ  worked with David Le to get the financing approved.  They worked their magic and we were signing the documents within a very short time. I know they worked incredibly hard to get this done quickly so that we wouldn't have to do the 45 minute drive again the next day.  CJ and David were just as excited as we were, but not just excited because they made a sale.  They were genuinely excited to see my wife be able to drive off in a car that she desperately needed.  Before we left the lot Angel Nino showed us the ins and outs of all the buttons and gadgets and many other things that came with the vehicle.  He walked us thru setting up the apps on our phones to connect to the car.  Angel was so patient with us.  The service we received from CJ, David and Angel will not only keep me and my wife from coming back for a lifetime but we have already recommended our son and other family members and friends.

Paid a little more than what I would have liked too for a used car here but the manager worked with me in wanting to fix just about everything free of charge. Wouldn't recommend purchasing a used car here unless it is certified pre-owned buick or gmc. Hyundai unfortunately does not transfer power train warranty unless it is a hyundai dealer as with just about any brand of vehicle. Our salesman Anthony Rolls was excellent and made sure everything that he wasn't able to do somehow got done. Ended up walking away with a good car with a solid engine for a reasonable price. No amazing deals and dont expect a whole lot of haggle. Other than that friendly sales team and an overall worth while experience with west point buick.,4.4

He offered me a warm cup of hot chocolate (because I am Mormon and don't drink caffeine) and I appreciated his remembering that.
After telling him that my car was making a sound that could only be described as sounding like a Moose that had gotten his testicles caught on barb wire (don't ask how I know what that sounds like) and also the car emitting an odd but slightly arousing smell of burnt rubber did he inform me a recent recall with those exact issues and he would have my Regal out with repairs with 45 days.

Manny was professional and answered all my questions. Told him of my situation and how I was working with another dealer and how they  requested all sorts of documents and I was waiting to hear from them about my loan application and it had been 2 weeks and still nothing. 

Well long story short I put in an online application with Westpoint Buick at 8:30pm received a call from Manny at 8:50 pm advising me he has received my application and they were closing now for the night and I will hear something from them in the morning. Well, I got that call and was surprise I had several options for financing and went into dealership selected my vehicle and was handed keys to my new 2018 GMC Terrian. This posting is about 2 weeks after I got my car and I’m loving every minute of driving it.

1764,"October 10, 2017","I contacted the dealership on a Friday (after 1700!) and spoke with Nate, new car sales manager.  I was out of town with my wife, explained what I wanted and that my wife and I were unable to make it over until the following Friday since I live in San Antonio (200mi away).  Nate worked with me, providing everything I asked for (and things I didn’t!) upfront and assured me that we could get a deal done despite being a week out.  My situation changed when I learned of a friends passing and his service was on Friday.  Due to a work trip that would put me into a miserable weekend, I texted him on Sunday afternoon and he not only solved the problem but did so beyond my wife and I’s expectations!  Nate put me with James who greeted me at the door after my drive on the following Monday and got me through the sales process and back on the road home as fast as humanly possible.  He explained the process better than anyone has in almost fifteen years & connected me to the right experts to explain the key features of the vehicle, focusing on what I needed to know for the drive home & go forward.  

Despite having three GMC dealers in my city, I would gladly make the drive to Houston to deal with James and Nate again, this dealership (in a big city) has the same small town values of dealerships where I grew up.  Treat people right, honest and upfront about the details, and like you would a good friend or a family member.

1822,"August 21, 2017",James Reeves was our salesperson and he went above our expectations.  We have bought numerous vehicles and this was one of the best car buying experiences we had.  We highly recommend James and West Point when purchasing your next GMC vehicle!,5.0
1823,"August 20, 2017",Manny was so helpful locating the truck and options we wanted. Then he arranged the aftermarket product's thru Four wheels to customize our truck. The price was thousands below all other GMC dealers in Texas. This a top notch white glove sales and service. I will be a life customer.,5.0

1825,"August 19, 2017","CJ was awesome salesman. Havung not purchased a vehicle in 8 years he made the process easy. He had vehicle picked out before I even visited the dealership. This was even more outstanding when it all came together matching my needs. Overall great service, I felt like a life long customer yet it was my first time.",4.4

1829,"August 18, 2017","I'm not one to leave reviews online but I felt like I needed to speak up and say something because the way I was treated was truly unexpected. I don't like buying cars, the overall experience is not pleasant. I walked in to the pre-owned department and looked at a few used acadias until I found one that I liked. I can say it wasn't the best experience I ever had but it was not the worst. This is not the reason for my review however. What earned my review, and a 5 star one at that was what happened when I have a problem with my vehicle nearly a month after. I called in and was sent to the sales manager nino who was extremely kind and understanding. He informed me I made a great decision in buying a certified car and he would make sure I was taken care of. He had me set up with an appointment to bring my Acadia in and be repaired at no charge and even had a loaner car ready when I got there set up with David. I was expecting a complete runaround and instead had everything I asked for taken care of promptly and even found my car washed and faded again when I picked it up. I will be sure to come back here again. This was a great experience.",5.0
1830,"August 17, 2017","My sales teams made my experience purchasing a GMC Yukon a breeze. Step by step, top to bottom, they answered all my question and concerns , and the finance department was quick and friendly. I will definitely it pass on to my freinds and others to go visit West Point, Buick -GMC , for thier next vehicle purchase. ",5.0
1831,"August 15, 2017","My husband and I have bought a few cars through the years and I can say this was a pleasant experience. Manny was my sales consultant and he made me feel relaxed and built a rapport with me quickly. The finance man, I'm sorry I don't recall his name, was just as pleasant and professional. We were targeting a specific monthly payment and they offered as many discounts as possible for us to achieve this. However once I was home with my new car I found a razor blade in the side pocket of driver's side. I'm sure this was an oversight while cleaning but a dangerous one. ",4.8
1832,"August 01, 2017","BUYER BEWARE!  We were promised a deal on Saturday which would be good through Monday. When we came in to sign the paperwork on Monday we were presented with a price $5,000 higher than originally promised! This is not a joke or a misrepresentation. This extreme withdrawal tactic is criminal and demonstrated the lack of integrity and fair dealing of this dealer's management. We were offended and appalled by their manipulative tactics. 

We were upfront with our situation and needs, and this dealership completely misrepresented their pricing and would not honor their promised deal. We went to Sterling McCall GMC on the southwest freeway the same Monday and bought a similarly featured Yukon XL with no hassle. The stark difference between the straight forward dealing at Sterling McCall GMC and the underhanded ways of Westpoint GMC (especially Nate the manager) could not be more evident. 

I hate to give a negative review but buyers need to beware of the shady and unethical dealings of this place. CAVEAT EMPTOR!",1.0
1833,"July 28, 2017","Had another deal going but gave this dealership a chance to compete.  Ultimately, worked with Charlie Nelson to agree to price and accessories for a new GMC Sierra 1500.  We scheduled an appointment to pick up the truck on Friday evening after work.  Upon arrival I was taken directly to Charlie’s office.  As soon as we were seated he mentioned that he would need to go talk to the sales office and within five minutes, he returned mentioning that the dealership no longer had the coupons he was using in the deal and his Sales Manager would no longer be able to honor the deal that we had agreed to.  There was no discussion about another offer or even a proper explanation about what happened…..only lots of squirming and mumbling.  At this point I was furious for driving in rush hour traffic from Tomball to finalize a deal that did not exist.   No deal...just a waste of time.   I also received a follow-up email from Charlie (the next day) thanking me for stopping in but his manager couldn’t make the deal work.  He asked if I had any questions about another truck – I hope he was kidding!  ",1.4
1834,"September 27, 2016",Randy Bryant is a joke. He is the biggest condescending person that I have ever met.. It seems that he is just an unhappy man. It seems he is upset that he is at a dead end job and the younger generation is doing better than him.I would highly recommend using another dealership. The finance department says they put your money and down payment towards one thing and don't do it. Then when they(Randy Bryant) get called on their lies they get defensive and condescending because this younger generation just outsmarted them,1.0
1835,"September 24, 2015","I experienced the worst customer service from the service manger while getting my GMC serviced yesterday. My car was leased in Dallas from a dealership known for their customer service. When I have to turn it in next August, I certainly won't lease here. I also will never return to have my vehicle serviced here. After waiting two hours they told me my car had been not been looked at because a technician was still not available. I made an appointment six day prior. If the service manager couldn't have made the situation better, he could have at least attempted to make me feel better about it. I was treated like an inconvenience and like I was wasting his time. It seems like they need some serious customer service training from the top town. ",1.0
1836,"September 07, 2015","We came in for the 20 percent off GMC truck deal and brought a vehicle to trade that had been by every other dealership we went to for at least 12,000.00 more than the West Point hilarious offer. This used car manager does not know how to put a number on a car. Absolute waste of time. ",2.8
1837,"March 29, 2015","We had been to 3 other dealerships, the 1st one we looked at a Denali - but the salesman said he would call us when the one we wanted and never did? the 2nd and 3rd dealerships were Cadillac as we decided to go with an Escalade ,one told us they had the car and it was being detailed for us - we had arranged to purchase it. We drove 1 hour, was in the dealership 2 hours to find out they never had the car! The 3rd dealership wanted to basically give us nothing for our car after we had clearly agreed upon a price. My husband called West Point and spoke to Adan, he was impressed by him so we drove there all the way saying lets hope this is good. Well it turned out great! Thank you Adan & Miguel for the wonderful experience we had yesterday. We love our new Denali, it is our 3rd one. I wish we had purchased the first 2 from you! It was such a stress free procedure and we are extremely happy.We were happy with the cost of the vehicle also. You were very honest and accommodating to us.We will be back and purchase the next one from you!

1839,"September 22, 2014","I had a really poor experience at West Point. I believe the name of my salesman was Echo or Etko. I came in to to a 2009 BMW 750LI. It was originally listed on Ebay for 29k, a vehicle with 50k miles. I found that to be the best bargain online and I called in immediately. I originally spoke to a gentleman name Jay and he was very helpful and informative. However my schedule and his conflicted and unfortunately had to deal with Echo. I test drove the vehicle, the BMW had a some type of battery issue and was less than a perfect ride. Even still I figured we can work out a deal, get some of those minor issue corrected and still drive home with a new car. 

Upon working the deal Echo attempted to sell the car to me for about $5000 more than what the advertised price was even AFTER I told him the special. He goes back and comes back and still tries to sell it to me for about $2000 MORE than what the advertised price was and basically write the original arrangement off claiming that whoever listed it for so cheap ""could loose their job"". I was less than amused.

When asked if I could take the BMW to a BMW dealership and have it checked out he said I would have to wait until monday and if there is any other issues that they will not be willing to fix it or address it. 

It was very clear than when he realized he was not going to be making nearly as much on the deal as he hoped he became very short, impatient and downright rude. I asked about warranty and he threw some number at me and wouldnt let me speak to a manager. I really wish I wouldve seen Jay that day and maybe things wouldve been different. ",1.0
1840,"March 10, 2014","My husband purchased a vehicle to surprise me and it was quite a surprise!  The dealership took our deposit and did not disclose that they had already decided to sell to another party.  Even after knowing this information they did not contact my husband and after several hours of making the deposit he arrived with a cashier's check so that he could pick up our vehicle.  When he arrived they let him know the vehicle was sold and if the other party decided not to purchase they would let us know.  What, I thought it was sold???  What makes it worse is that the GM was going to make it right or maybe I misunderstood him....no call and no follow up with in the agreed timeline to make it right.  Too bad people don't live up to their word.",1.3
1841,"September 12, 2012","Came in for an oil change. Was greeted immediately before I even shut the door on the truck. Prompt and friendly service.  Work was completed at the exact time quoted and the price was reasonable for the work performed.
