8,"November 12, 2016","Jeffrey Kahn was the sales person who helped me. Between him and the accounting department rep, they got me into a dream car fast and easy. I was surprised at how I picked a new car, drove it, and drove off with it in only a couple hours. The dealership is beautiful, comfortable, and has plenty of cars to drool over. And the salesman I had, Jeffrey Kahn, feels like a new best friend. I'll easily buy my next car from them. ",5.0
