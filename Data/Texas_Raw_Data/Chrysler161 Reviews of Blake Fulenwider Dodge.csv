124,"March 29, 2018","By far the best dealership I have ever delt with. I have worked at several different dealerships myself but have never had the priveledge of working with such a knowledgeable, honest, understanding and genuine sales person. I HIGHLY recommend Justin Wharton to everyone and anyone. He will go above and beyond to get you taken care of; not only will he take care of you while getting you into your new vehicle but he will also make sure that you are well taken with the service department after the car sale is final. You don‚Äôt get that service just anywhere and that is one things I really appreciated.  Justin and his guys worked numerous deals to try and get us in the perfect car for our family and our pocketbook and he did just that. We are so happy with our new Dodge Durango and so happy that we have a trusted dealership on our side! If you are in the market for a new or pre-owned vehicle go see Justin Wharton at Blake Fullenwider Dodge in Eastland and see just what he can do for you!! I promise you won‚Äôt regret it, we sure didn‚Äôt! ",5.0

158,"April 16, 2015","The Facts:
Bought truck (2013 ram 2500 57000 mi.) Jan. 2015 
Truck runs good for 3 weeks 
Front end begins to rattle
Continues to get worse 
April 15', Take truck to big bend national park where ignition module goes out
5 people stranded
Had to get truck towed 180 mi to monahans
Had to ride with tow truck driver 70 mi to marathon
Then had to hitch hike another 30 to alpine to retrieve another vehicle to drive back and pick everyone up
Was left without a vehicle for a week making work school etc a major hassle
After talking on the phone, the dealership informed me that I was on my own and they would do nothing to even help with the bill. Hard on a college student

I have just gone through a divorce and ended up without a vehicle.  Wasn't sure what I could afford or if I could even do anything.  I first spoke with Will Mazel over the phone and he gave me some options and told me they could take care of me on financing.  When I went over, he took great care of me and the finance guy, Shaun, greatly helped.  I left with a Cadillac which seemed to irritate the ex, so it was totally worth it!  I tell everyone that Will got me into a car with ""Lots of Wow, but no owwww""!  I will come back to them when it comes time for my next vehicle purchase!  ",5.0
