Talked it over with my wife for a few days, and we decided to come back to Hyundai of Pharr the following weekend, to see out of curiosity, what could be done. Test drove the new Hyundai Sport in Quartz White, and we fell in love with the car. We found it a little more roomy, exterior a little longer, smooth/quick/responsive, and the sound system was WAY better. A few hours later, we drove off the lot with our NEW Sonata, with payments close to what we originally had on our 2014. What can I say other than, we were very impressed with the deal that we received, the great communication, professionalism, courtious staff, and very knowledgable about their product.

He found us the right vehicle and walked us through the process.  It was obvious that Julio is very supportive of his sales staff.  Our original salesperson Pedro didn't try to sell me, instead he was just there to help us decide what we liked the most and felt comfortable in.  He admitted that he was new and may not have all the answers, but he would get me answers to all my questions from his sales manager.  Before leaving, Julio came out to introduce himself.  After listening to our needs, he assured me that he'd earn our business if I gave him the time to research and find the right vehicle for our specific situation. After working with Julio over the next few days, he earned our business.  I have to say that the other sales staff that helped over the next few days were just as helpful and patient.  Not only did Julio and his sales staff meet our expectations, they exceeded them.  Thank you for taking the time to earn our business.

He took my information and I promised to come back with my husband.   Life happened and our schedule did not permit us to return but Joe was patient and never gave up.  My husband and I finally showed up in June.  Joe showed me a Santa Fe turbo and Santa Fe Ultimate.  I left much more confused but appriciative on the ammenities the vehicles offers.   After a good nights sleep, it was the Santa fe ultimate for me.  My husband test drove the vehicle as I sat in the back wondering if my ( kids ) passesngers would appreciate it.  I was satisfied.   Joe introduced us to his general manager, Luis Galvan. We collaboratively made a deal.  We were treated as royalty from the sales floor, service department and finance department. We had a much better experience than seven years ago.
My husband and I wanted to buy a new Sonata.  The salesperson tried to sell us a used Sonata.   We left in the middle of the deal over $40. The next day the salesperson agreed to our offer. Since we left angry,  we no longer wanted the car.  The salesperson proceeded to cuss us out. The following morning,  my truck was vandalized ( he had our personal information).
This time around, what a difference!  We continue to have a great service! So blessed!

795,"January 04, 2012","This was, by far, the best experience I've had buying and shopping for a car.  I am a VERY picky shopper, ESPECIALLY when it comes to a long-term investment of my hard-earned money.  In this review, I've included my first impressions of the dealership, the customer service of the employees, and my overall experience in buying a car here.

When I walked in, I noticed right away that the facility is clean and spacious, and the environment overall is modern and welcoming.  There are plenty of comfortable chairs to sit in, a tv with local channels, and a receptionist who was courteous and helpful.  I would have preferred more of the employees passing by to ask if I needed help.  But some people like that, and some don't.

Now, if you go to Frank Smith Hyundai in Pharr, ASK FOR DAVID RODRIGUEZ!  I definitely lucked out.  He is the friendliest, most couretous, and most helpful car salesman I've ever encountered.  If I needed anything at all, he was very accomodating.  He seemed very honest in his answers.  There was little to no pressure on making a sale, and he was very informative.  If he didn't know the answer right away to one of my questions, he made sure to find out in a TIMELY manner.  It was obvious he is there to work for the customer's satisfaction.  It was also obvious that he usually had several other customers, and yet he still made time for everyone, and he still made time to sit and talk with me, call me, and email me.  I found this extremely encouraging to buy my vehicle from this dealership, because it showed me that David Rodriguez knows that EVERY customer is valuable and should be treated with absolutely the highest courtesy and respect, in a timely manner.  I just can't say enough good things about Mr. Rodriguez.  Thank you!

The sales manager, Julio Martinez, was also very helpful and courteous.  I'm very picky when it comes to long-term investments, and he was also very patient.  We worked out a terrific price.  I am realistic and know that car dealerships are a business.  They need to make money to keep selling cars.  But my impression is that these guys are not about ripping you off at every turn...  They are more about gaining your trust through terrific customer service, and giving you a fair price that is realistic, yes, but still good for you.  This also included my trade-in, by the way.  

Alex Cortez was helpful when I finally decided to sign the paperwork.  It felt slightly rushed at times, but he patiently answered any questions I had about the paperwork.  Still overall a courteous and helpful experience.

I should mention that I took several days to make the decision to buy my car from here.  I took my time to research prices online and at other hyundai dealerships.  David and Julio welcomed my questions and price negotiations every time, and were very patient.  Again, I do not take this kind of purchase lightly.  I work hard for my money, and I want to know that I am getting the best deal possible, as well as the best customer service possible.  Frank Smith Hyundai provided exactly that.  
Thank you!",5.0

798,"November 01, 2011","David Rodriguez greeted me with promptness as my wife & daughter were looking for an economical vehicle. We saw and test drove the Hyundai Tucson which we really liked. David was helpful in answering all of our questions. We never felt pressured and David has a great personality which made the vehicle search a pleasant experience.

When we decided to buy the 2012 Tucson we spoke to Ivan Nava, Sales Manager. He explained all the buying options and wanted me to feel comfortable with the price and payment. Ivan Nava & Luis Galvan were patient with me since buying a vehicle is a ""Big"" investment. After talking it over with my wife and daughter we decided the offer made on the vehicle was the right price for us. 

In the final stage we met with Alex Cortez, Finance Manager. He went over the warranties and other buying options which we could purchase. We never felt he was rushing thru the process since it was well over closing time. He reviewed with us the details of the final price, payment amount & due date. He made the final stage of our purchase a great experience.

We came across the tundras and he was very knowledgeable about the different tundras and when we found the one we liked we actually sat down and discussed numbers with Luis who also made us feel like we were in great hands. He got us maximum money for our trade, which is when my wife and I knew we were going to make the purchase and while we were finishing up the paper work Mario was getting the vehicle washed and ready for us to drive off the lot. My wife and I were extremely happy after this vehicle purchase not only because of the type of vehicle we purchase but because of the customer service that was shown by the staff of Hyundai/Toyota.
