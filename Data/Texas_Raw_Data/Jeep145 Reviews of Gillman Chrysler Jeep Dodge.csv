0,"June 02, 2020",I worked with Dave Campbell and Kam Roushan. They worked hard to ensure my happiness with my purchase. They stayed late so I could come after work. All papers were prepared and I was in and out in about 15 minutes. Kam took the time to get me comfortable with the car before leaving the lot. Best car purchase experience I have ever had. ,5.0

2,"February 08, 2020","Don’t waste your time coming here! I bought a truck from here 2 years ago with a very big down payment, over 15k, and here it is 2 years later and it’s inoperable. If you’re looking for a sign not to purchase here, take heed. The whole staff has changed since I’ve purchased and no one wants to return my phone calls after leaving messages with finance managers and other staff. I’ve had light/water damage from apparently a previous owner that has lead to a series of unfortunate events. I was told that I could claim and/or get, substitution of collateral but I kept getting the run around as to who would start the process for me. What a waste of time and money I’ve spent and I’m not happy. I was also sold a maintenance care package that literally expired 2 months after I drove off the lot. I was told that it would get taken off of my loan but it’s still on there. I just feel like it was very unprofessional and I got messed over because I am a double minority who asked for a vehicle that people who don’t look like me usually go for. I really took it personal and I now question the integrity of the whole company.",1.0
3,"January 16, 2020","HORRIBLE customer service.  Once you purchase a vehicle, Gillman could not care less about taking care of  you and getting your vehicle fixed.  I bought a vehicle from Gillman, air conditioning and warning lights were on.  Their words were too bad, we cant get to you and help you anytime soon and can't do anything about helping with a rental vehicle. It will be at least two weeks.  This is coming from the place where i bought the vehicle. Customer service rude and completely dismissive.

I call Helfman Chrysler and they say no problem, bring it in and we will take a look at it, but it might be a day before we can get back with you, but we have enterprise rental onsite and will put you in a dodge caravan while we take care of you.  This is how service should be.  I didn't buy my vehicle from Helfman,  and that was a HUGE mistake.  I would highly recommend to stay away from Gillman.  Helfman gained a customer in me.  

Again, ZERO stars for Gillman.  Go to Helfman where they care about their customers (and future customers).",1.0
4,"September 23, 2019","Wow, can't believe they do bait and switch.  The price online did not include the lift and tires.  So after the test drive, I was told they could remove the lift kit and tires or pay an additional $10k above the listed price.

Dealership Response:
Please know we strive to provide accuracy in the showroom and online. There are vehicles that have additional equipment and are priced higher than the original MSRP. If you'd like, we can certainly provide documentation of the equipment added and will duplicate the vehicle without the outfitted equipment for the price listed online.

Additional Info:
The Total Price of the shown vehicle is $39k (original MSRP $31k) online.  The actual price to purchase the entire vehicle shown is $49k.  In order to purchase the vehicle at the shown price, the lift and tires (and other additions) would have to be removed (as stated in their response).  ",1.0
5,"July 23, 2019","I booked an appointment for my Jeep, on a Thursday, as the radiator fan motor was seized. I called the next day to see if there was any news, I was told my service provider would call me back, no call. I went in on Saturday to see what was going on, I was told they were waiting on parts. Waited until Tuesday until I went back in again, as I had no calls or updates, to be told that they hadn't even looked at the car yet. I am not sure why you would need to make an appointment, if they are not going to look at it.
I asked for the vehicle back and was given the keys with no care or apology.
Don't use this company, I had bought 7 cars from them up to now, because they were local and the service department has just got worse and worse. All they care about is up-selling to you, which you can see on the service managers board.   

Jackie from Gilman has followed up and has taken the car in. ",1.0

7,"May 31, 2019","My brother and I drove over on our way to another dealership further downtown.  We were greeted by a fellow the moment we walked in.  I had no idea he was going to be my salesman, and I was very pleased that he was.  I had done all my research on the Ram the week before actually going out to a dealer.  The internet is a great way to educate yourself.  In short, I explained where I was headed to my purchase, however they has the exact 1500 in the storage area  behind the dealership.  My salesman excused himself and went to locate it and retrieve it for me to test drive.  It was an awesome drive.  We went in to talk business and agreed on a purchase price in less than half an hour.  Everyone there at Gillman was friendly and real.  I picked up my 1500 two days later and everything was as smooth and easy.  I highly recommend  this dealership to you.  I couldn't be happier. ",5.0

9,"February 22, 2019","Please avoid this place at all cost their sales manager Johnny is a sleaze bag and will lie to your face if your buying a used vehicle take it to your personal mechanic to inspect the day you take it home because if you wait any longer they will not take any kind of  responsibility  claiming that it was your fault and finally if you take your vehicle for service expect it to take longer than a day and you won't receive any kind of update from the service advisors so again please go to auto nation or another dodge even if it's out of your way.

Update: I tried to contact the email provided in the reply but it's all for show I never got a response. 
On another note i purchased a new car and made a very unwise decision to give this dealer a second chance because it is very close to me and I have an extended warrenty. BIGEST MISTAKE!!!! When I dropped of my car because my headlights are not working properly. They told me to an expect a diagnosis within 2 days. Here we are 2 weeks later and still no diagnosis. For every 20 times I called my service advisor he answered once! with no info on my car just asking for more time. I finally got fed up and went to go pick my car up they fed me excuses on how the service techs are super backed up but they gave me my keys and car no problem.....or so I thought I get home and notice that the whole passenger side panel is completely off on my car and they damaged one of my wheels I am sooo upset with this dealer but I will just take the loss because there's no way in xxxx I'll give them my car ever again.",1.4

11,"January 03, 2019",Watch these guys! They charge for setup on my ‘15 Ram CPO should have covered replacing the bald tires. I went to get the truck and there was a set it $99 cheap tires I saw later they added it to the cost of purchase as well as $450 for some bogus paint protector. My Wife was feeling bad when I signed so I missed it. Then I drove it home only to find they bent a wheel that they would not replace. Oh there’s more.....,2.2

I have a 2017 Chrysler and I have brought my vehicle in three times for the same problem. I have waited over 3 hours one time and today was 5 hours.

14,"July 18, 2017","After getting a very good deal through my bank I headed to the dealership to meet Mr. Eric Villata, sales manager. I was totally surprised when Eric was able to get me an even better interest rate than the bank and I was able to get an extended warranty and still keep the payments at what I wanted. They are absolutely fantastic in going out of their way to satisfy a customer. The people in the finance department were just as great and easy to work with. What a great group of people at Gillman Chrysler Jeep Dodge West Sam Houston. I will certainly recommend all my friends to visit this dealership. They will work on getting you the lowest interest rate possible. Better than a bank.",5.0
15,"July 13, 2017","I was looking for a Jeep dealership that would take a look at my car (the dealership I bought it from was 2 weeks behind on making appointments) I called Gillman and got an appointment, I asked if they had loaner cars available since I don't have another car to use - I was told they do have loaner cards  My second question was how long it takes to get the car looked at, because from past experience with other dealerships I have to drop it off for days before they can take a look at it - I was told that it would be looked at that day it could take hours but it would be that day. I went in the day of the appointment (9:30 am) and I was told they don't have a loaner program and the car wouldn't be looked at for a day or 2. I tell her what I was told on the phone, she just tells me that's not the case and then wants to take out her log of cars to show me what cars are on her list. Very rude and arrogant. 
I call my original jeep dealership (Finnegan) to get their advice/ help on getting a loaner car since I don't have any other form of transportation. They tell me Chrysler will pay for a rental car if the repairs are covered by the warranty, which they were. Why couldn't Gillman tell me this? Why didn't they try to give options? I'm upset to have gotten lied to on the phone but I let it go. I ask to speak to a service advisor to go over what I believe the problems are and to have a person of contact,  I was told by the lady that I would be getting a call from the service advisor once they get the car and know what's wrong. The next day I called at 5:20pm and asked for an update I'm told Blanca is my advisor and I get put on hold and keep getting transferred around for 40 mins, until they closed. The next morning I called and I am told that Blanca probably doesn't know yet what's wrong with my car and doesn't have an update bc if she did she would've called me. I don't really care if that's the case, I want an update on my car. So I'm put on hold for 10 mins and then I'm told she'll call me back. An hour later I get a call from Blanca, she says my car is ready for pick up. I'm happy it's available to get picked up, I go to the dealership and I ask the lady that filled out all my paperwork the first day that I was there to pick up the car and she tells me to go to the cashier or she'll get someone to escort me...I can figure out where that is, so I head over there. THE CASHIER WAS SO HELPFUL AND HAD GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE, She even walked me out to wait for the car. The car pulls up and I am given the keys. I'm waiting for someone to come let me know what happened with the car. Nothing. I go in and ask to talk to Blanca---apparently Blanca is the same lady that took my information the first day, the one that wanted someone to escort me to the cashier. I ask her what was wrong with the car and what was fixed, since no one called me. She took the paperwork they gave me and started reading off of it. First of all, I can read. Secondly, when I asked her what it meant or what those parts were, that she was reading off the paper, she said ""well I don't know what that is."" How is it ok to give a car back to a customer and not explain what the issue was? Ask the technician before giving the car back so that you can tell your customer! 
From beginning to end the experience at Gillman was terrible. 
I understand each service advisor has xx amount of cars to keep up with but it shouldn't take for the customer to call for an update to be told the car is ready. That is the car I bought from the company you work for (Chrysler) therefore you should be calling and updating me on what's happening with the car, or to tell me you are my service advisor and my contact person from now on. There was terrible customer service from the service department, or at least from Blanca who was the only person I came in contact with. ",1.0

19,"April 24, 2017","I was in a rollover so recovering and needed some help. Salesman lied about everything. Truck was said to be owned by 1 owner, older couple who did not like it and brought it back at 3126 miles and traded it in. Spotless he said. So they knew we were coming at night, parked under trees, no lights, and we di not see all the dings and that grille was broken and super glued. Then we find customer rental agreements in the glove box showing it was rented out at 2439 miles, when the sales man said the older 1 owner couple had it. It was used as a rental by Gillman. WE live 2 hours away. They sent us an email, no phone calls saying bring it in and leave it they will repairs dents, that is all. The truck had over 4300 miles on it but they had the odometer turned off so we could not see they lied about that too. BEWARE nothing but liars and con men at this dealership, MONEY is their key, your money",1.4
20,"March 03, 2017","Let me preface this review by saying that I've had many cars and I've gone to many service centers in this by far has been the worst and it is still ongoing as we speak. My jeep was called in on a recall this recall has been going on for over a year and I was called to finally scheduled my recall with the understanding that the part would be in stock. When I turn my car in at 9 a.m. this past Wednesday the gentleman told me that they would have everything done within 2 days I also had a couple of more issues with my car that I needed for them to check he told me that they would call me and let me know what's going on with my car. Well Tuesday afternoon, I got no call Wednesday morning, no call Wednesday at Thursday I called and he did not have an answer for me he said that my car was still waiting to be checked and inspected mines you that I had already rented a car for only 2 days so Cesar told me that he would check and call me back I did not get a call back until Thursday after 5 o'clock saying that there was something wrong with my evaporator and they could not find the leak. The point of this whole story is that they took my car and they told me that they would call me back about my vehicle and I got no calls I had to constantly called them and that is not good business especially when you're spending your own money to rent a car while your car is fixed. Not going to any other regular mechanic or professional they would have had my car done same day still waiting for car to be fixed and for pricing I would probably be contacting my attorneys",1.5
21,"February 04, 2017","I have been coming by here since I bought my vehicle for oil changes. The first year 2011 service was awesome after that everything went down hill. Every time I come in for an oil change there is a 30-60min wait to check your vehicle in even when there's hardly any customers. They NEVER reset your screen for your vehicle not put an sticker to let you know when your next oil change is due. The employees stand around and tell you to wait in line as they sit at there desk and have side conversations. I feel sorry for the one or two people who actually do there job b/c their colleagues are not pulling there weight. Today I came in for an oil change and they no longer use the oil that is needed to change for my vehicle the cost went from $39 to $79 for an oil change took them an hour to tell me that. I will NEVER buy or use Gilman services ever again. A waist of time, not worth it!",1.0
22,"January 27, 2017","Gillman sold me a a new 203 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited with a 2.5 inch list.  They outsourced the lift installation to Cutten Customs.  After 3 times of bringing the Jeep back for alignment issues they told me it was all fixed.  The alignment was.  The part that wasn't was the lift itself.  Half of it was installed ""backwards"" - not my words but the words of 2 separate extreme performance companies.  Fast forward and I am now having to replace most of the underside of my Jeep including the crappy lift.  Parts that would not have worn out this fast if the lift had been installed correctly.  Gillman claims no responsibility and tells me they aren't responsible for the lift.  Buyer beware - they don't take responsibility for what companies they outsource work to.  ",1.8
23,"January 16, 2017","The negative reviews here for Gillman Chrysler Jeep Dodge Ram very much surprise me. This too is coming from someone that ultimately didn't even buy his car from them. I was in the market for either a used or possibly new Jeep and worked with Joe/Jose Hernandez. Joe himself was fantastic. He did absolutely everything in his power to get me a great deal on the exact Jeep I wanted. This included wheeling and dealing with other dealerships. In the end, everything fell through at the last minute by no fault of his own as he couldn't get me the exact car I wanted because of a miscommunication from one of the dealerships he was negotiating with. I had even put down a deposit because we thought it was a done deal. Once I found out it fell through, Joe was quick to apologize and refund my money even though it wasn't his fault. Eventually, he did find the car I wanted a day later but by that time I had already purchased another car. Still, I would not hesitate to contact Joe again the next time my wife or I need another car.",5.0
24,"January 08, 2017","BEWARE! I would give them NO STARS. This dealership is worse than poor. From the day we bought the jeep, service was a nightmare. We bought it at Christmas time later in the evening so when they brought the car out my husband and I didn't notice the dirtiness of the windshield until the next morning. The car had not been detailed at all there was still dirt from people's feet test driving it and there was a weird residue on the the windshield from them doing an absolute half-xxx job of cleaning the car. When you buy a new car you expect it to be spotless, no matter what time of day you purchase it. That should have been my first sign. I then tried to call to schedule my first service when it was coming up (oil change, tire rotation, etc.). I tried for over a month to call the service department and schedule an appointment. I left over 20 messages and NO ONE ever called back. I ended up driving up to the dealership and xxxxxxxx at them about the ordeal and they magically got me in that day. I shouldn't have to go up to the dealership in order to schedule an appointment. They reassured me it wouldn't happen again because there had just been a change in management. After the oil change I checked my oil life monitor on my dash and it had not been reset, even though the oil had just been changed. I called to ask about it and guess what? NO ONE answered. This place has the worst customer service I have ever witnessed in my life. They do not give a xxxx about whether or not you have a good experience they only care about over charging you and getting their money. I took my jeep in again today because I try to take care of my vehicles and it was due for another oil change. I hesitantly took it in and it was done in less than 40 minutes. I don't know about you but a quick oil change at a dealership does not make me happy, it concerns me. Every time I take my car in for a service at the dealer and it goes quickly; something is not done or not done correctly. My husband checked to make sure the oil had actually been changed because believe it or not that has actually happened to me. It had been changed so I went in, paid, then drove the 20 minutes home. Checked my oil life monitor once I got home and it had not been updated once again. I mean how hard is it to do your job? They just do not pay attention to detail or care about anything but getting on to the next car. All the service people are incompetent, careless, xxxx-tards who need their heads pulled out of their xxxxx. I bring my car to the dealership for quality not quickness and Gillman is NOT quality.

29,"September 15, 2016","If you are buying a used vehicle, I would AVOID this dealership at all costs. 
Let me give you a rundown on everything that has happened on the day of and since purchasing my vehicle from Gillman Chrysler Jeep Dodge Ram. 

For starters, I was LIED to and told that the airbags (a part of the ongoing Takata recall) were changed and the car was ready to be sold and driven. 
I discovered 2 months after purchasing the car, that the airbags were NOT replaced, I was driving around with a defective drivers and passengers airbag...and this is only the beginning of my troubles.

When purchasing the car, the service was shaky. People that work there don't really seem too confident that they're selling you a guaranteed quality car. 
Also, they take FOREVER and a year to get you out of there. It is blatantly visible that not a single soul that works at Gillman cares about anything. From the receptionist blurting out expletives loudly, their disgusting waiting area, right down to their untrustworthy management.

After a few weeks into owning the car, it started to have troubles driving, engine was sputtering, etc. I took it back to have them look at it, and apparently the manager chalked it up me being a hallucinating pothead and making up the problems with my car. 

I took it to a certified dealership for my car, and they told me they didn't detect any problems at that point, but if anything else went wrong, bring it back to them. 
Sure enough, a few days later, a blinking engine light and a car that refuses to accelerate. It turns out the spark plugs were bad and there was a corroded ignition coil in the car. 
These people DO NOT CARE what they're selling you. The mechanics are of very poor quality, and their salesmanship is QUESTIONABLE at best. 


Please, please, please find a better dealership that knows what they're doing.

36,"December 30, 2015","I went there this past summer to buy a used Ford for my daughters first vehicle.  We searched online for weeks to find the right vehicle.  I contacted the dealer online and told them I wouldn't pay more than $9500, the vehicle was listed online at $10k.  They sent me a response $9.8k as the price, I told them they would have to do better so Taha (the sales person) said they would work with me, so I took the risk and drove an hour, figured with his response and only being $300 off we'd come to a deal.  When I got there, they had add $1k for dealer prep and stayed at the original $10K price for a total of $11k.  I told them not a penny more than $9.5k they kept coming back with slightly lower numbers but nothing close to even the $9.8k in the email.  My family and I went to lunch and I told him to call me if he could do $9.5k.  He called and said they ""had the price I needed"".  I should have been smart enough to smell the BS.  I went back, still nothing near the $9.5k, so I walked out.  Taha came running out the door and said we can do the $9.5k...I said, ""you've irritated me so $9.3k"" and I kept walking and got in my truck and left.  He called like 5 min later and agreed to the $9.3k.  Because my daughter loved the car I went back and bought it.

46,"February 04, 2015","Most horrible experience while shopping for car in this dealership, crook salesman along with dealership played lots of mind games.
My experience: The car I was interested was listed for $12,995 on their website. I drove an hour to get the car with CASH $$ in my pocket. When I get there salesman brought a list and told me price on internet was mistake and actual price should be $13,895. I argued to honor the internet. After another 15-20 min, this dealer/salesman came up with an offer $12,995 for the car but added another $899 saying they have to add wheel lock and tint making it again $13,885. It was my first experience in this dealership, I was surprised to see how they play with their customers. 

I was upset so I left dealership. Salesman didn't said a word to me when I was leaving. Seems like he wants us to leave from there as soon as possible. 

Since I drove from far and wasted hours I decided to donate extra $899 to dealership crooks and buy same car. I returned back to dealership within few min. I saw same salesman  is selling same car to his friend/relative (Might be lower price then what I was willing to pay- dealer managers check it). And salesman gave me that creepy look.

47,"January 14, 2015","In order to give a full review I have to go back to November 1013. 
I came to gillman dodge to trade in my dodge challenger that I had bought from helfman, I came here because the people I had at helfman were kind of arrogant but in hindsite I would have taken them any day. I also came here because kevin in service had always been great on my oil changes and stuff on my dodge. I came to purchase a 2014 jeep grand Cherokee and from the beginning it was a hassle.

Let me start by saying im not a difficult approval, I have good credit and have been at my job for years, so its not a matter of getting a lender to deal with me.

Anyway I had my salesman halfway through pass me off on someone else because he had personal problems..not a problem because I liked the new salesman better than mine anyway, but take something over halfway through and its confusing....get approval fill out paperwork then the paperwork says its going to cost more than I was told I DON'T THINK SO...so after that fight I was forced to omeet them in the middle...whatever......then I get a call that the paperwork was messed up and I had to come back again to resign....ok........then after I have had it until my first payment is due and still nothing from the finance company so I have to come back in yet again to make my first payment to the dealer!!

While im there I talk to service because im having problems with my radio and im told they cant give me a loaner or rental because its not something that warrants it....ive had the car for less than 30 days!!!!

Talk to the salesman and he takes me to the general manager and they agree to give me a loaner.

When I bring it in I get the loaner and have it for 2 days and am told I have to bring it back because they cant fix it right now until they get parts and they need their car back.

When the ""parts"" come in I take it in and now they wont give me a loaner!!! So im on my own.

I call and leave a message for the general manager and I don't hear back! Let me also add that every thime you call the receptionist acts like it's a bother to do her job..answer the phone

They tell me they ran updates and it worked...great...about a week or 2 later...same problems

So lets just say its been in for the same problems several times...always hear ill get replacement radio and then excuses..oh updates fixed it, Chrysler wont let us replace it...stuff like that

General manager 3 phone calls never once responded. Got ahold of a friend who knows the gillmans...never heard from him either, but he did make a call to the dealership telling them to FIX THE PROBLEM..

They didn't!  same old story. Ive gave them lists of problems, sent pictures etc.

I even took it in for an unrelated grinding issue and got...cant duplicate the problem...to their mechanics even look at the cars??

Now radio is completely out..and the service rep says..why didn't they just replace the radio....i tell him the things I was told and he says..no that's not right  im replacing the radio and the usb hub...WHY WASN'T IT DONE A YEAR AGO!!!!

And then proceed to put me in a total xxx rental and pretty much tell me this is it take it or leave it..thats bullcrap!!! So all in all ive been dealing with this for over a year and lost over 25 hours of work running back and forth.....REDICULOUS",2.2

49,"October 23, 2014","My sales experience with Gillman went smooth.  My car was shipped from another dealer in Kingsville, TX and delivered to me within 2 days of the sale.  The sale was easy and I felt good about my new purchase.  In August 2014, I began having issues with the transmission and took it into the service center.  They had it for about an hour and told me that it needed a software update and I was good to go.  Drove the vehicle for about 3 weeks and it began having the same problem.  Took it back, and this time they gave me a rent car.  Good thing, they had my car for 2 weeks.  They went through a series of tests and resolutions and more tests and said it was good to go.  Had the car back for 2 weeks and on October 20, the car is back in the shop with the same problem.  I dropped it off on Monday, got my rent car (after being gone from work for 2 hours) and this is Thursday.  I haven't heard anything from the service department.  I didn't call Tuesday, thinking I would give them a day to look at it again.  I called yesterday and 3 times today.  No one is calling me back.  

To that end, I guess the sale was the best part about buying this car.  Now, it is time for them to give me money back so I can go somewhere else.

50,"September 01, 2014","Short Review: These guys are the reason why people call them ""stealerships"".  This places uses the classic BAIT AND SWITCH tactics and will pretty much try to scam you every step of the purchase process.  This was the worst car dealership experience I have had. I highly dissuade anyone from coming here. BEWARE before giving them ANY of your money.

Long Review: I came here to order a Jeep and was INITIALLY given a fair offer for my trade and the purchase price of the new vehicle (plus three free synthetic oil changes).  I agreed, and I left a $1000 ""refundable"" deposit.   They were pretty eager to take my deposit.  They didn't write up a formal contract, but resorted to using a standard letter sized paper with handwriting for everything (highly unprofessional).  One manager, Dana?, assured me that their deposits were refundable.  I hadn't signed anything regarding nonrefundable, nor had I seen a policy, so I didn't think too much (my mistake).

I hit a few snags during the 6 weeks that I was waiting on the vehicle.  In particular, the refundable deposit they stated was now nonrefundable.  I inquired twice to make a change before the building process (which Dana? told me I could before it was built).  First time they said it can't be done.  Second time, they said they would take my deposit.  If they cannot make changes, I was misinformed.  They should take responsibility to work with me.  When I went in to try to work with them, one manager, Raymond B., told me to ""get out of his face"" and ""I have better things to do.""  After he said this, he proceeded to surf YouTube.  This left me with a bad taste in my mouth and I was pretty upset.  I have never seen such unprofessionalism.  I considered fighting for my deposit using various consumer tools, but I figured I'd stick it out and see if they'd actually honor the original deal I had negotiated.

When my Jeep finally arrived, I came in to finish the deal.  They told me they can't give me the price we originally agreed upon for my trade.  The original trade value was $10,500.  They said they could only give me $9000.  They claimed to had lost the shady letter sized paper or it wasn't legible they claimed.  No surprise.  This is a classic bait and switch.  They take your ""refundable"" deposit after you agree on a price and then proceed to lowball you on your trade.  At this point, I was already prepared for what they might do, so I proceeded to deal.  It's a shame that I had to ""negotiate"" something that was already agreed upon.  Raymond B. gave me grief at every step of the way.  I ended up getting $10,306 for trade in value and the same purchase price (and supposedly 3 oil changes) after 2-3 hours of arguing with them.  After signing paperwork and receiving my keys, I was on the way out.  I thought everything was good at this point until Raymond B. greets me at the door saying we are not giving you the 3 oil changes (Why do this?  The deal is over.  You should congratulate me on my purchase and fake a smile).  I demanded to speak to the general manager (at this point, Raymond B. says ""go right ahead"" with an attitude.)  Matt C. had the service department write up a Chrysler service contract for me to get my 3 oil changes at any dealership.  (I thank you for helping me Matt, but it doesn't make up for the treatment. Also, I should not be bribed with something I have already purchased just to give ten stars on the survey.  This does not help to improve the overall Gillman experience.  I hope you work towards improvement.)

It's a shame that they had to give me so much grief on something we already agreed upon.  At the end of the day, I purchased the vehicle short of $200 dollars on the original agreement (with much effort).  They need to ask themselves if the trouble they gave me was worth receiving a bad marks on their record.  $200 dollars is chump change for a dealership of this size.  Why treat your customers like this and risk another taint on your reviews for $200? As of writing this review, they're not looking good.  The service department reviews (users with 1 review and no friends, sketchy reviews praising Allen S.) barely save them in ratings.  

If any of the Gillman executives read this, please do a thorough check/review process on your employees and provide written policies for EVERY step of this procedure.  This level of unprofessionalism should not be tolerated.  I believe professionalism should be enforced at a dealerships of this size.  A purchase of this value should be handled with the utmost professionalism every step of the way.  Even restaurants that sale items 1/1000 of the purchase price of a vehicle treat their customers with respect.

Bottom Line: I highly, highly dissuade anyone from coming here unless they like to be treated with disrespect and dishonesty.",1.4

58,"March 11, 2014","Took my Dodge Dart in for warranty work sometime last week as its ability to start became sporadic (needed an update for the CPU). Service and product were well enough. I had to leave it overnight and the next day when I went to pick it up there was a moderately deep scratch in the driver door. All fine, accidents happen, as long as it's fixed. The service man I worked with called ""the boss man"" out, this is Jim, and he said to have them buff out as much as they could while we were left to wait for it. We happened to wait outside the service bay so we could see how the technicians handled the cars. NOT well. One technician drove a Rallye inappropriately fast out of the service bay. I would be personally offended if I had seen somebody driving my car that way. Reckless and disrespectful.
Them ""buffing out"" this scratch was never going to cut it for me and I think it's a cheap and dishonest way to try to fix your problem. When they brought the car back to us, sure, it was coated in nice shiny showroom wax to attempt to distract me and the scratch was barely noticeable, now a whitish cloud over my blue paint about the size of a nickel. But I understand a large portion of my clear coat has been buffed away trying to cover up your mistake and my paint is left no protection in this spot.
They still offer to fix it in their body shop after I say I'm not comfortable with it. Good on you. They provide me with a rental and my car is gone for three days in which I receive no update and only get one on the third day when I call the body shop to ask for one and they tell me only that ""It's being finished."" and will be ready later that day but not what they're actually having done, i.e. wet sanding, painting, putting on the clear coat, baking, etc.
 So when it's ready, they don't call me as is the only appropriate protocol, yes? No, they call my father who is absolutely nowhere on the intake paperwork (but happens to have bought a vehicle from them as well) and was in no way involved. What kind of company does that?? I found this incredibly unprofessional and frankly disrespectful. Like they're looking for any way around courteous and appropriate behavior?
 So I don't get the news that it's ready until 5 minutes to close on a Friday and when I call at that time, they say they'll leave my key with the receptionist and I can just pick it up from there, no problem. But when I ask if the work order will be with the car he replies, ""Well.. no."" As if it's an obvious answer and a ludicrous suggestion on my part for requesting a RECEIPT of some sort and wanting to know specifically what they've done to fix my car. I've been to body and collision repair shops more than a few times and this is VERY common practice, sometimes with them emailing me the work order as it is updated.
After this he says that the shop will be closed until Monday so he won't be able to get me a work order til then and also adds the rental will not be paid for over the weekend. And when I express how strange I believe it is that I wouldn't expect a work order, he then says he can have one for me the next day before they close at 1.

I got everything back fine, the computer update and my fixed door are good. The end product is acceptable but the experience was sub par. I will never go back to this place for service or to buy another vehicle with them as my buying process with them over a year ago also left me feeling less than satisfied.",2.6

I have told anyone who will listen to me how outstanding everyone at Gillman was during my car buying experience.  I walked in, was greeted and I explained what I wanted.  The young lady said she would get the ""expert"" for me and when I came back to the lobby I had a circle of people waiting to greet me!  I felt like ""uh oh"" here comes the tag team, but NOPE!  They all said hi, greeted me, and introduced me to my own personal expert Harvey!  Harvey and I hit it off immediately - yeah I know I was pleasantly surprised!  Harvey didn't play any games with me - asked me what I wanted and took me right to the inventory of what I described.  Didn't parade me around the lot and try and get me to get something other than exactly what I said I wanted.  Harvey was definitely an expert on the Jeep Grand Cherokee because he showed me all of the changes since my last Grand Cherokee in 2008.  He handed me the key and told me to drive it - and WOW did I drive it and LOVED it!  I made a joke with Harvey when we got back (I was trading in my current vehicle) and said, ""Ok, don't be one of those Sales People who holds my keys hostage until I purchase something from you!""  He told me he would never do that - and made a point of leaving my keys on his desk close to me.  During the time I was at the Dealership I kept waiting for the pressure, guilt, and persuasion to begin...and I am proud to say it never happened!!!!  Harvey was by my side throughout the whole process, didn't bring other people over to pressure me and tell me what a great deal I was getting, and blah blah blah.  I even remarked to Harvey how simple this whole process was and explained that buying a vehicle in South Florida is the most irritating experience of my life and how much I hate it...At Gillma I experienced the complete opposite - It's laid back, relaxing, and overall just a good vibe!!!  Helps that Harvey let me park my new Jeep right outside his window - so I am sure I spaced out staring at it for a while!!!  Don't think twice - go to Gillman and see for yourself just how amazing they are!!!  Being in Hospitality for 17 years has made me critical of Customer Service and I gotta tell you - I would hire every single one of them in a heartbeat!  Thanks Harvey, Raymond, and Alan...Ya'll Rock!!!",5.0

They charged me almost 2500 for a cylinder head, then after returning several times because the vehicle was still overheating now they tell me I have transmission probles, radiator, cadillac converter, and throttle body. Mind you in their initial assessment none of these problems existed or were brought to my attention. Now they want me to bring the vehicle back for a fifth time. After all their promises, I am financially and mentally exhausted. My next step is the courts. And it's a shame because Dodge is one of my favorite line of vehicles.

I saw this Jeep on the internet and gave an offer by email based on what I could see in the photos.  When I got there, the soft top was taped up on the main part of the top and the rear window was ripped and taped.  For that reason I would not go with the offer I gave.  The salesman said they would sell me a new top at cost.  He went back to the parts Dept and checked the price and said a new top would be $603.  We agreed to lower the offer $250 and I would buy the top.

By the time we did the deal, the parts dept was closed.  The next day I called the parts dept and was told that the $603 was only for part of the top and not the windows.  A full new top was $1200.

138,"August 19, 2010","Woke up one morning and decided that I wanted a car, specifically a Dodge Charger. I went to Gillman's website and perused their charger selection and it gave me the contact info for Mr. Jeff Raval. He asked me what I was willing to pay for one, what I wanted on the car as far a ascetics, then asked me what I wanted in the car as far as options. Then he asked me what color, I told him anything BUT RED, and that i prefer darker colors. Once the car was picked out he then sent me the credit app via email. I filled it out and emailed it back. with in a few hours I received a call back saying when do can I come in for my finance interview! I was very excited because this my very first BRAND new car purchase! So when I walked in I met the GM Mr. Paul Hopkins and he was quite friendly and congratulated me on my new car purchase and told me that he was happy I chose his dealership. I walked into the office with Jeff and filled out some paperwork to help finish the deal and showed him my insurance. He sent the car to get properly detailed before i went into finance. There I met Mr. Javier Melgar who took great care of my questions and concerns and kept everything frank and honest, just like I like it nice and simple. He explained GAP insurance, and the extended warranty to me and I was quite satisfied with the numbers. I told him that I appreciate his efficiency with the finance part of the deal because I hate wasting time. Once I signed the dotted lines my car was ready for me to roll out and take a picture with. I had the best smile on my face because I got what I wanted, how I wanted done, and in my favorite color as well",5.0
139,"August 05, 2010",My car would not move and I was uncertain as to its problem. To complicate the situation I was due to fly out of Houston the same day. Kevin and his associates diagnosed the problem in a fast an efficient manner and repaired the car. Kevin was very professional and courteous such that I will now bring my car to this location for any future service issues. Previously I had been obtaining service in Katy.,5.0
140,"July 30, 2010","Very easy to work with-Cesar listened to what we were looking for and then explained and showed us what our options were.  No high pressure and we really appreciated it.  His immediate supervisor and the finance person were also very easy to work with..And yes it was worth the drive into Houston to this dealership.  We passed a few other, but this dealership had a number of jeeps in various colors and prices - something we didn't find at others ( we have 2 dealerships with 20 minutes of our home and we drove a hour and a half to Gillman)  Thanks for having your website easy to see what you have on your lot.  It does make a difference for those of us out of town.

Friendly atmosphere
No high pressure sales person
variety in inventory
knowledgeable sales person
The above are reason's I will return to Gillman when looking for another vehicle",4.8
141,"July 21, 2010","I had to have my Dodge Charger towed into this dealership because it was the closest to my home. I had no experience with them because I had actually purchased my car at another dealership, but was very pleased with the excellent customer service I received from the start. Gerrin went above and beyond what I ever imagined or even thought he would. I went in prepared to fight and argue to get a fair deal on getting my car repaired. Dodge corporate office was involved at my request, but I was afraid that would make the process more difficult. Gerrin made it his business to contact my case worker at Dodge with the diagnosis for my car issues and work out the details of cost with the case worker. He also kept me informed of any details or information that I should be aware of concerning the repairs and my portion of the repair expenses. I never had to chase him down or guess what was going on with my car. I would definitely keep Gillman in mind when I purchase my next vehicle. I applaud the manager of the service dept, Robert Jackson, for the superb customer service all of his staff provide.",5.0
142,"July 20, 2010","The service was great, very friendly and helpful staff. As soon as I arrived to the service department Kevin Brown, the service advisor came to meet me and asked what was wrong with my car, he took notes about the things I needed and show me where the waiting area was.  The service was fast, and they even wash my car that was a plus I wasn't expecting that.  I will return to your dealership for all my car maintenance needs.",5.0
143,"July 19, 2010","The sales department is wonderful.  This was the smoothest a car purchase has ever gone for me.  Cesar (my sales associate) even did the ""new Jeep dance"" with me once I got my keys.  When the tow package I wanted installed was going to cost more than my coupon allowed, they installed it for the amount of the coupon.  Kevin in the service department couldn't have been more pleasant, and even replaced the antenna (which had been stolen) for no charge.  Every time I've had a question the service department has been immediate in their response and have always worked around my schedule.  From the moment I stepped onto the lot, I was made to feel like they cared.  Even after they made the sale, the customer service didn't stop, as it does in so many other dealerships once they get your money.  I would recommend this dealership to anyone in the market to purchase a vehicle.",5.0
144,"July 18, 2010",Guys were fun and friendly.  Jeff took time to show me everything on the truck I bought.  The dealership was very busy the day I was there and it seemed that Robert and Jeff were working well together to keep me from having to wait around.  I got a fair deal for my new truck and the deal went smooth. I enjoyed talking with the receptionist. She told me she had been w/ Gilman for a few years and most of the staff had been there for a significant length of time as well.  That told me that the employees are treated well and that is the kind of business I want to support. It was clear this dealership was not the high pressure place some others are.  It was the lowest stress buying experiance I have ever completed on a car purchase.,5.0
