1,"June 08, 2020",I called and spoke with another salesman before driving 90 miles for a particular truck who said the truck was still in stock.  My regular sales person (Ana) was in a meeting at the time.  After driving 1 hr and 45 minutes I arrived only to have Ana tell me the truck had been sold the previous evening.  The only comparable vehicles they had to show me were more expensive.  After some dealings I decided to purchase one of the two F150 super crew platinum's.  While they were doing everything to satisfy me.  I was still left with a bad experience because stock records not being updated.  I am happy with the truck I purchased and am waiting on a call with the four digit security code for the door.,4.0

9,"March 07, 2020","Got screwed by Bob Tomes, vehicle that was sold to me wasn't worth the price it was sold at. Never saw pricing,rebates,nothing on the vehicle until I was signing paperwork.  And when I tried to work with them on the company Bob Tomes promise they would NOT assist or HONOR.  The bad part is that myself and my family are repeat customers and have purchased over 10 vehicles from this dealership.  DONT BUY FROM HERE NOT THE SAME FAMILY COMPANY THEY USED TO BE. ",1.0

11,"February 18, 2020","I worked with Matt and Tommy. They were friendly, professional and knew their trucks. Locating the truck I wanted and getting it to the dealership was a significant effort. They went the extra mile and their effort is appreciated.  Thanks for all your patience and laid back demeanor. You kept the car buying process relaxed and positive. We will refer others here, as well as be back in the future. Financial officer was very helpful. Overall a great experience.",5.0
12,"February 04, 2020",my daughter that is only 20 years old had her  2016 ford fusion at bob tomes ford not by her choice it was sent there by another dealer the car was running just had a coolant leak bob tomes ford called us and told us that it will cost $5500 to repair the car we told theme not to do anything then they told us the engine was apart and parts are in the trunk and we need to tow it home and the check out charge is $1700 just to remove the cylinder head we were very shocked by the charge we did not approve any repair we called 3 other local ford dealerships they told us that the tear inspection for the head is only 3.5 labor hours $375.00 we refused to pay the$1700 we called bob tomes 5 times to speak to the owner he never returned our calls we found out that her car was sold in an auction  February the 3rd so think twice before you do business with this dealer collin county tax office told me that this was not legal they had no record that bob tomes filed anything with theme ,1.0
13,"January 26, 2020","Negative 5 Stars!!!!!!!!! Worst service department in the world. Purchased a new 2019 F350 Lariat with all the extra warranties. At 4,000 miles the A/C blew hot air. At around 7,000 miles I was finally able to take it in. After having it in for 5 days Ivan calls me to tell me nothing is wrong with it. I told him they need to look again. He called back to tell me the mechanic, if you want to call him that, had found a leak. Yet before nothing was wrong. 1200 miles later the A/C is blowing hot air again. They want me to bring it back to see what's wrong when the obviously didn't fix it right the first time. Sub par service?????? Do not buy or get service work done here. Because of this dealership I will never buy another Ford again. Most expensive piece of crap I've ever purchased. They are only interested in taking your money and don't follow thru with service. Service is what keeps your customers. You would think they knew this but they do NOT care about there customers.",1.0

16,"December 30, 2019","I went in not expecting much, Matt Hoopes TOTALY changed my mind about car salesmen, He not only listened to me but went over the top to get me the best deal. He is down to earth no bs and doesn't want to hold you up for 4 to 5 hours to make a deal. Everyone I talked to that day was like talking to a friend. HIGHLY RECOMEND going here and ask for Matt he will HOOK YOU UP !",5.0

19,"December 21, 2019","Just DON'T People! Go anywhere else. I didn't buy my F150 here because every time I've tired to trade here the whole experience was so shady, I just left. However it is the closest Ford dealer to me. So when I suddenly had sensor lights (plural) come on, I took it in, and asked for an oil change as well. My truck is a 2019. I've made 5 payments on it. When they found out I didn't purchase my truck there, their attitude changed real quick and I could tell I had been moved to the back burner.  THEY HAD MY TRUCK 5 DAYS. They told me a mouse chewed some wires and that was what was happened to make the lights come on. They didn't have a loaner or demo I could use, but would call enterprise for me to RENT a car. No thanks. They also told me I didn't have any Ford Pass points on my app so I had to pay for the oil change as well as an entire new wiring harness. $502. At this point, I just wanted my truck back, I was tired of the run around I was getting everyday I called to check on the status of my truck. Well, 2 weeks later my check engine light came on. I read on a Ford Forum where you can go to auto zone to have the codes read for free, which I did and they were great. When I came home with the codes, my husband popped the hood and guess what, NO NEW WIRING HARNESS! There was a ton of black tape where they jerry-rigged my wires, but they didn't put in a new harness. So what did I pay $502 for? Did they even change my oil?? I wasn't going to write a review on this place (I didn't do their survey either) because I try to be a positive person. Ya know.... if you don't have something nice to say, be quiet..... but when I saw all the black tape where they had spliced my wires, it was the last straw. Don't go there people. Save yourself the trouble. I do love my F150 though.",1.0
20,"December 06, 2019","Bob Tomes Ford has an excellent staff that were patient enough to help me figure out the right car for me, while also providing me the best deal available.

24,"November 25, 2019","David Hooks in Sales was absolutely amazing throughout the process. He was not pushy at all. Very friendly and down to earth. He was very helpful and made sure the deal went smoothly. I would highly recommend asking directly for him if you shop at this dealer. Also, David in Finance earned my trust by giving me numbers that didn't change during the process. He was fair and fast. There was one guy in finance (Daniel) I cannot recommend as I felt like immediately he tried to change the deal, low ball my trade in significantly, and charge more than advertised for the vehicle. Maybe it was an off day for him but otherwise my experience with the two Davids and Jeff at the end was really great! ",5.0

29,"October 11, 2019","I meet Jerry, New Car Manager, because he was wearing his logo shirt. I approached him and explained my situation with him. He guaranteed me he could take care of me and he did just that! I’m new to Texas and he made me feel comfortable and confident that he would not try to beat me because I was a woman and new to the area. I came in, he had two trucks pulled for me to see, introduced me to Kevin Rucker to work with, and within 24 hours everything was handled and the deal was sealed!

32,"September 02, 2019","We walked in with a pre-approval..
We met with Brandon who did an amazing job helping us answering all of our questions. Once we had picked our car, let them access our trade in. Once the finance department got involved it went downhill FAST!! They tried to sell us a car listed for 23k for 30k!! All because we were preapproved for 50k loan! 
We wanted the car we had picked out, but it didn’t work out as we tried to negotiate with the finance department for the price listed on the website. We finally had to get up and walk out, which they wasted our time, kept our car keys refusing to let us leave trying to get us to pay 7k above the sticker price of the car!! 
Absolutely the worst experience ever!! Will never recommend anyone to visit this dealership!!!!!",1.4

How long does it really take to find a leak and put on a new tire???

39,"August 22, 2019","Kevin Rucker was our salesman and from the first minute I knew we were in for a great experience with him.  I have dealt with many salesmen and never had such a great time as I did with Kevin.  He wasted no time in getting us into the driver seat of the trucks we wanted to test drive.  Pleasant conversation the whole time, and when we made up our mind which to buy, he facilitated a very quick purchase with no sitting around waiting on paperwork.  By the time we had signed he had our truck ready to go with a full tank of gas and temporary tags and ready to roll!  What a great experience!",5.0

41,"August 16, 2019","Worked with Butch Millican (and Floyd). Over past year daughter, son, & wife also worked with him and all bought new Fords (this from a Cadillac & GMC family).

Liked the way he handled the sale process - no pressure, no BS, plain and simple honest answers to all questions. Found a few vehicles matching my desired options list and colors; not exactly easy given options NOT wanted. ""Let me know which one is the right one! If not these, I'll help find the right one!""

When time came to talk price, good price given (you need to do your homework!!) so a comfortable and an acceptable purchase price could be reached and agreed upon.

Based on Service department handling of the rest of the family - always friendly and accommodating - timely service times. Comfortable with the future service of my new vehicle.

Post purchase introduction to Eric Murrell (Aftermarket Sales) - anything else that you need for your truck let me know - by the way, yes - quote given before walking out of dealership - and subsequent order being placed.

Very impressed with the dealership; but, Butch sold me on my first Ford truck, Bob Tomes Ford as the place to buy and service that truck, and for him to be that person I entrusted to buy from. 

Thank you, Butch, with all the highest scores available, and Bob Tomes Ford for having someone of his caliber representing them!

My sales person Micheal G and Finance Rep were on point. No pressure at any point from beginning to end. Professionalisms at its best. I have been to many dealerships but Bob Tomas Ford is the best in my book.

57,"June 24, 2019","I found Bob Tomes after an internet search for a new Ford F-250, and they had the truck I wanted at a very competitive price.  They gave me a fair value for my trade-in and worked with me to get a payment I can afford.  Overall I'd recommend giving them a try.",5.0
58,"June 24, 2019","In 2013 I bought a used F-150 at another local dealership and had nothing but bad experiences from the start with them.  It took 6 weeks for them to order and install a damaged taillight that they had promised to fix when I bought the vehicle, then they failed to notify me of a leak through the back window.  Needless to say I took the vehicle to Bob Tomes Service Department and they corrected everything at no charge (even the taillight)  I've had that truck taken to the dealership for miscellaneous services and recalls and have always walked away pleasantly surprised.

This past weekend, I stopped in at the dealership to look at their inventory of Ford Rangers as I've been researching this model for a few months now, and met Kevin Rucker who spent time with me not using the stereotypical ""dealerspeak"" and other tactics.  His observations and recommendations were based on logic, common sense, and was a breath of fresh air as he wanted to find the vehicle that was right for me and wanted to match exactly what I was looking for.

As a result, I purchased the 2019 Ranger and actually moved up to a Lariat model as Kevin and I had discussed an upgraded XLT Model and offered only the options I really needed.  While taking my wife in for her ""ok"" on the deal, she discovered a used vehicle on the lot and based on our experience with not only Kevin but the Finance Manager who finalized our paperwork, she is coming in this late afternoon to work out a deal on that vehicle as well.

Kudos to Kevin and the rest of the staff at this dealership as they made this experience extremely easy and pleasant for me.  I usually don't do recommendations but felt this was warranted to share with other folks looking to buy a vehicle but were too stressed out because of past experiences.

Thanks again!",4.8

61,"June 03, 2019","I was looking around the metroplex for a good truck at a fair price and Jeff Griffin at Bob Tomes Ford in McKinney came through. I was hesitant to pull the trigger on my truck purchase and admittedly, I waffled quite a bit. Jeff was patient with me throughout the process. I never felt pressured. Jeff always seemed to want me to be sure I was making the correct decision and comfortable with that decision.

I have driven a Ford truck for 40 years and they have always kept me on the road but no product is perfect. As soon as I got home I found an issue with the truck. Ford did everything they said they would when I purchased the truck. They stood behind my warrantee and they very quickly corrected the issue and got me back on the road, keeping me informed and updated the whole way. 

I would not hesitate to refer Bob Tomes Ford of McKinney, Jeff Griffin or the Bob Tomes Service Department. The experience was as good as buying a truck can get.",5.0

To his credit, he attempted every dirty trick of the trade, starting with an initial price before rebates $1,000 higher than an internet price previously offered to us. He tried to explain it away, claiming it was loyalty cash when the possibility of a trade-in had not even been discussed. Additionally, without mention, he/they attempted to include a ""required"" $795 protection package and $895 Gap insurance after being specifically told we were not interested. Lastly, after reviewing our final offer with management, Gil all but threw our personal paperwork at us saying ""have a merry Christmas and good luck finding the deal you're looking for!"" as if the offer was totally ridiculous. It is important to note: we made the exact same offer, on a car with the exact same MSRP, at a different dealership the very next day--closing the deal in half the time.

Ford managed to get out of the financial difficulties by using their own ability and resources.  I will always be proud of them for that.

I emailed exactly what I was hoping to accomplish and with my range. When I arrived they already had the truck pulled up and ready, with the terms. I got all I wanted and more and while waiting for finance they all checked on me and Chase talked fishing with me for a great while. 

I will never go to another dealership and no matter who you deal with, Butch, Chase, Johnny, Brian...anyone they will make you feel important and aren't your typical 'what you want is impossible unless you spend alot more dealerships.'

He let us keep the car over a long weekend to let us get a feel for the car.  On a Cars.com search it was one of the lowest prices for that make/model and mileage in the country.  The car was already priced to sell but we ended up getting  it for less after some back and forth.  Clean Carfax etc...again no surprises.   

I made sure that before heading to the finance department that if there were any surprises that I would walk away in a heartbeat.  Paul assured me he would not waste my time.  No complaints from the finance department.  The met my credit union interest rate.

Go see Paul in the pre-owned sales department if you want a no pressure, no gimmick sales guy.       ",4.8
232,"November 13, 2012","I have bought several vehicles through the years from Alfred and his staff, Bill and Floyd, and from the second the deal starts it has always been a great experience. After the sale I have always been taken care of as well. Joe, back in service, is very prompt to contact me making sure I am updated in a timely manner... I would HIGHLY recommend Bob Tomes Ford and Alfred Davidson and his staff for anyone that needs a Ford product... Great prices and better service..",5.0
233,"November 12, 2012","We were in the market for a Mustang. Found one we liked, negotitated and agreed on a price to include a Reverse Assist Mirror addition. We signed our offer like that, the salesman went off to talk to the Manager and came back, said we had a deal.  My husband and I filled out the finance paperwork and left to get our trade-in car. When we came back the mustang was pulled up to the showroom door, they took our trade-in and began preparing the paperwork.  At this point, we'd been working with them for about 4 hours. And everything seemed to be OK.
After another 30 mins or so, the salesman brought the paperwork to his desk and told us that everything was ready except that the manager had decided they wern't going to include the Reverse Assist Mirror. The agreement we had signed was lined through and they'd written ""Does not include reverse assist mirror"". This is about a $450 dollar add-on. So we told the salesman that it wasn't what we'd agreed to and asked him to go find out if his manager wanted to lose the sale for $450. He came back and said the manager wouldn't budge.  
We didn't buy the car.  This is almost a bait and switch approach to car sales and I would caution anyone who tries to work with this dealership to be very careful. We certainly won't be back. 
Note to the dealership - if they hadn't agreed to the add-on to begin with, we'd probably still have bought the car. The fact that they agreed to a written offer and then changed at the last minute is what killed the deal. Not an eithical way to do business.",2.3
