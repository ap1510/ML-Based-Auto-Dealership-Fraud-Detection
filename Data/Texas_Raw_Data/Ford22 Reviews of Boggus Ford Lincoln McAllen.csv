1,"November 26, 2018"," To make a long story short, the used Lincoln I bought from Boggus(which still has 2 years bumper-to-bumper warranty left) back in October needed over $8000 in parts and labor recently.  I dealt with Lane in service and he was right on it in making sure things got taken care of quickly. ",4.2

the manner and attention Mr Rivera delivered in this deal.  It better At Boggus is not just a slogan, but a way of life at Boggus

15,"June 27, 2017","My experience was absolutely horrendous. Not only did the manager laugh and mom my mother and I, but he talked down to us as if we are stupid. We ended up leaving and Jose asked us what happened. Storming out was the best thing because we ended up getting a really good deal out of that. Jose asked if I was a student first and I said yes. However, nobody else even mentioned to me that would be a discount. Although I got a great deal in the end because of Jose, I shouldn't have had to storm out and be mocked for it. ",4.2
16,"June 24, 2017",This was our 2nd vehicle purchase at this dealership and each experience gets better and better. Joe de la Garza gets to know his customers and guides you through each step of the purchase. He is not satisfied until you drive off the lot fully knowledgeable of your vehicle and completely at ease. Thank you to everyone who made our new purchase a great experience. ,5.0

20,"June 20, 2017","What a terrific experience, shopping for my son's first new car! After having tested the Chevy Camaro and the Dodge Challenger, and having to deal with their personnel regarding financing, Stevie Roman in sales and Mr. Nick Goris in financing made it impossible to make our purchase elsewhere. It didn't hurt that Ford offered up a superior product. This experience at Boggus Ford in McAllen has changed my views on shopping for cars in the Valley.  I am so happy with the service and my son is thrilled with his beautiful new car. Thank you, Boggus Ford in McAllen!",5.0
