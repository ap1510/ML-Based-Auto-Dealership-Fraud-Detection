0,"November 27, 2019","I have spoken back and forth with Luis Tirado for a few weeks now and have been hung up on twice. I would highly recommend that you shop else where. Staff is highly lazy. I requested information on 2019 Ram 2500 Crew Cab 4x4 Diesels in white. I was told that i should go to the website and find the trucks my self and then send them the stock numbers so they could then look them up and give me the same pricing that is online. I then made an offer, salesman refused to take it for approval or denial from manager/management. I then said ""ok"" at which time the salesman hung up on the phone.

1,"October 09, 2019","I literally never leave reviews but it’s imperative. Don’t buy from these people. They’re your best friend when you’re about to buy a car but ghost you like a bad Tinder date when you need them after purchase. Let me set the scene for you to give some background as to what led me to be so disgruntled. Bought my second car from them in August, a new challenger. 1) sales lady  made me deal directly with my old lender to get pay off info and repeatedly told me the information I obtained was ‘wrong’ to later find out it wasn’t. Lender wanted a fax number and sales lady reported ‘they didn’t have one’ and later amended it to she ‘didn’t know where it was’. Manager explained to me that if I didn’t finance through them I’d lose ‘1,000’ rebate. So I did even though the interest rate they got me in the end wasn’t that amazing. Fine. Whatever. A lot goes into that so I overlooked even that. Told me the trade value with added ‘trade voucher’ (some gimmick they sent me in my email that persuaded me to return to their dealership in the first place when I didn’t necessarily want to) of my essentially new 2019 Jeep Cherokee latitude plus would be 16,500. When I get to the financing desk the guy accidentally slips and mentions the trade value of my Jeep was listed as 15,000. Whattt?? My dad happened to catch that and they had to amend it to their original offer. Even after all of this I still decided to buy from them and maintained a positive attitude. The same couldn’t be said about my dad, but I kept it cool and friendly despite obvious signs telling me to haul xxx for the door. 

I wanted black rims and the detailer promised I’d be getting an amazingggg deal powder coating at 899 because black rims would traditionally cost ‘2,000’. For one, that’s xxxxxxxxx. I did my research after the fact and realized I got ripped off. Poor shopping around on my part. An entire blackout package only costs 995 yet I paid almost that for them to dip my rims in some black paint. Sales lady said she’d call me the following Monday to set up an appointment for this, never did. So I took it upon myself to call and get it going. Here’s where my latest and real big problem comes into play. 

I noticed my car had a weird vibration to the wheel and ride after I got it back from them powder coating my rims in late August. I chalked it up to the tires being over aired (which they were, ridiculously so at 42-45 lbs a piece). However, letting air out didn’t help the vibration. I was doing my best to ignore this weird vibration because certainly a reputable dealership would know to rebalance my brand new tires on my brand new car and wouldn’t have damaged them, right?? Wrong. The vibration had gotten so annoying and severe this past week that I took it to the ford dealership in Waco where I live and the mechanic told me that not only were NONE of my wheels balanced, TWO rims on the front passenger and rear passenger were bent, on the INSIDE. Mechanic said most he could do was move them to the back but that I’d always have a vibration problem  and rough ride as long as those rims stayed. And hi hello, the bad rims will be in the front at some point when I have to rotate my tires making the ride that much rougher. So all in all I bought a new car and paid for rims to be painted to leave with a janked xxx driving car. I tried calling sales managers, service managers, service advisors, while also leaving voicemails for days and NOTHING. I’m being dodged like I have the bubonic plague now that I actually need them to fix the problem they created. All I wanted was two replacement rims for the two they jacked up.  I even emailed the woman that sold me the car and the ‘manager’ that talked me into financing with them and natta. I would not have been this upset nor left a negative review had the rims not been the last straw to an already sub par experience. Guess I’m screwed and on my own at this point. Don’t buy from here unless you want to be taken advantage of and discarded. ",1.0
2,"March 27, 2019","We purchased a used vehicle.  To begin with, when we purchased the vehicle they swore they were not going to run our credit because we had a pre approval through a authorized bank (the manager even wrote it on the purchase paperwork ""will not run credit) and low and behold the next day we get an alert that our credit had infact been ran. That was the 1st of many issues. The vehicle started making noise the day after we bought it. We took it back to the dealership they said they would fix it, they kept the vehicle, we got it back and it was still making the same noise. We tried for 2 weeks to get ahold of someone and get someone to call us back. I was calling and texting every day. Finally a gentleman called me, who is very snarky. Telling me I could bring it in and they look at it but if it's not the original problem they're not going to do anything. So I asked him to clarified what work they had done, it is in fact the work that they were supposed to do and they won't fix it. The gentleman was extremely rude laughed and said everybody there knew about it.  I only wish I had seen these reviews before we purchased from them, we never would have purchase the vehicle from them.  The excuse was ""you know it is a used car right"". And ""we put a $1000 into that card just to get it sold."" ",1.0
3,"February 01, 2018","This review is being written in response to an e-mail request from Nyle Maxwell to review their services. I recently bought a used Jeep which included a lifetime Maxwell Forever Limited Lifetine Powertrain Protection.  I was told that this lifetime protection is only included on vehicles that have been thoroughly inspected. This was a key factor in my decision to buy this car.  But, I wanted to know more about the warranty and inspection, and asked the sales people for it, and was told this will be provided, but never was.  Soon after the purchase, an engine problem developed (I fear there is also transmission noise) and although the dealer made the repairs, this event demonstrated to me the importance of knowing the warranty and inspection details.  Repairs, as well as rental car approval, (car was at the dealer for about 3 weeks)  required insurance approval for the Lifetime Protection.  What if the insurance company had denied the claim, will Maxwell pay the difference, or will I be asked to pay for it.  Advertising with the words ""Lifetime Protection"", ""Forever"" and Limited, are misleading. More details about the Maxwell Forever Lifetime Protection, and the inspection that was made before this protection was offered, have been requested from Maxwell since before the actual purchase was made in late October, 2017 up to the present.  No information has been provided, not even an acknowledgement of the request.  When the General Manager of a store ignores a request for assistance after the sale, why would anyone else on the staff feel inclined to do so?

4,"January 14, 2017","I bought a brand new 2016 Jeep Cherokee TrailHawk a year ago from Nyle Maxwell.  My vehicle only has 13k miles and after my second oil change the engine light came on with red warnings via the UConnect service.  I called the dealership and they instructed me to bring it by for a diagnostic. I took it to them on Thurs. 12/29/16.  I was told it says the oil pressure sensor is off and to bring it back on Monday 1/2/17.  I took it in on Monday am and was told it should take 1 to 2 days.  Today is Saturday 1/14/17 and still NO vehicle!  During this 2 week period I have left many messages with no return calls.  Have tried to speak with the service department but keep getting referred back to my ""consultant"".  I have even spoke with their ""Service Director"".  Have gotten many excuses including ""when reinstalling the oil pan the technician cracked it and they have to order one"".  I have spent weeks waiting for my vehicle. Being told in the am a week ago it's ready just processing paperwork then being told late in the day internal shop problems or the computer shows it's ready to post but can't find the paperwork and no engine technician in the shop to finish the job!!!  In addition, they gave me a Dodge Dart with less than 1/4 of a tank of gas to drive.  I spent ALOT of money on my vehicle to receive such disrespect and total lack of regard.",1.0
