0,"July 01, 2017","An exceptional buying experience, exactly what a high-end dealership should provide (although a bit less ""formal"" ... we like that). Marcus went through every detail of the MKZ with us (and there are plenty on this vehicle), answering all questions ... he really knows his stuff. Â There was no pressure to buy, although Ruben had to step in to finalize the deal. Both gentlemen were pleasant and easy to work with. Again, no high-heat sales tactics. We got exactly what our trade-in was worth, a great price on our new ride, and drove away happy in our '17 MKZ.

I returned about four months later with a minor issue, which Arthur resolved expeditiously.  West Point is a first-class operation in every respect. ",5.0
1,"April 06, 2017",Initially I had a bad experience with West Point due to the timing they took in repairing my Altima's window. But yesterday Marcus along with Lincoln's excellent service dept made sure when I left I was happy. He put me in a loaner car until mines was ready. Now today my car is fixed clean with a full tank of gas. Thanks so much Marcus and Lincoln for rectifying my problem.,4.0
2,"August 09, 2016","DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY!!!!!!  I bought a MKX less than 2 years ago from Westpoint and all they care about is selling you a car.  They say you have a warranty but they don't fix your car when something is wrong.  I have had several issues with my MKX including a break booster going out.  I made an appointment to bring in my car again today.  I had several issues again.  The air conditioning is not blowing cold out of the passenger side (second time in 2 years this has happened.  I guess they are incompetent and couldn't fix it the first time.)  The weather stripping is coming off, when you turn the radio up it gets stuck and goes as loud as possible, the bluetooth is all static.  I also needed an oil change and inspection.  I live about 45 minutes away so I made an appointment.  I get there and they said they can't do it until next week.  WHY DID I MAKE AN APPOINTMENT???  I wasted 2 hours of my day with this.  I will NEVER buy another Lincoln because of this company.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!",1.0
3,"August 30, 2015","Our experience at West Point was superb, everyone was courteous and friendly. Truly going out of their way to meet our needs!  Exceptional, this is the way car buying should be. Our salesman, Patrick Rodriguez was very knowledgeable about the vehicles, he really put the car though its paces on our test drive ( over a variety of city streets/freeways, and we all know what Houston roads are like).  From start to finish ( love my CPO Lincoln MKX) could not be happier with our experience. Everything was upfront with purchase and financing, no games or last minute fees. When I picked up the vehicle, Patrick gave us an amazing orientation, he had even preset up navigation and sound systems for us, gave us all weather floor mats in addition to the carpeted ones. (Wow, when I bought my Mercury new at another dealer, regular floor mats were extra!). Although this dealership was farther away for us, it was well worth the trip.  West Point has everything- great product selection, great service, attention to 
detail , committed and an amazing staff!  It was clear that the they have a commitment to the customers and customer service across the board,  I highly recommend them! If you are looking for a pleasant car buying experience, this is the place to come.  ",5.0
4,"February 11, 2013","This dealership was incredible. We came in to look at an MKX and possibly trade in our car. After looking at our car, not only did they offer us a reasonable trade amount, but they also had IN WRITING the cost of the vehicle we wished to purchase, taxes, title, and a drive out total. Blew me away. We had just come from Planet Ford where we spent 6 hours only to leave with no idea what our trade was worth, what the total for the vehicle was that we were looking at, no idea on whether we were approved for financing, or what our rate or payment would be. Yet Planet Ford still tried to talk us into taking the car for the weekend!!! Unbelievable. West Point was friendly, courteous, laid back and told us right up front what our trade was worth, what our cost to drive out would be and got us financed quickly at a better interest rate than we expected. I will be going there when I purchase my next vehicle. Great place. No games. Loved it.",5.0
