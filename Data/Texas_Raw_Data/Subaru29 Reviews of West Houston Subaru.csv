The sales manager offered windshield/body paint service plans complementary with the purchase of a 2,500$ extended warranty plan.  Only when home did I realize that he lied and we were charged 900$ for windshield, $950 for body paint, and $2,500 for manufactures warranty. Over 4500$ in addition to vehicle price. Went bank the next day to cancel, but was only able to cancel the manufactures warranty and the body paint service plan.  They already sprayed their ‚Äúmagical‚Äù spray on the windshield so they wouldn‚Äôt cancel.  I don‚Äôt have any problem with the car salesman Ken, but his sales manager is a LIAR and a THIEF (Middle Eastern looking man with a long black beard).  I feel sorry for them that they have to lie every single day to make a living.  I do not recommend this place!!!!

1,"September 17, 2019","Literally as I'm pulling out in my recently purchased used 08 Hyundai Accent the check engine light comes on. Since it's a used car I purchased it ""as is"" and without any warranty. After the suggestion of my wife I reluctantly call our salesman about the issue who had absolutely no obligation to help and had every right to remind of the fact it was purchased ""as is"" and without warranty. However the salesman did offer to help since it was after hours I had to bring the car back at my earliest convenience during regular hours. Considering the dealership is an hour away from my home it was about a week before I could go back. I had the codes read during that week so I knew what I was facing. It had 2 codes 1 of which I took care of. On the day I'm to return to the dealership the check engine light goes out by itself so rather than making the hour drive I called and informed them of the update and that's when all the lies and empty promises was made right telling me that they had to inspect the car to process the registration they also said that would give me a complimentary oil change and new o2 sensors (the other code) and also told me when I picked up my car that they replaced the o2 sensors and performed an oil change. Well after I posted my review on another site the general manager confirms what I already knew because he says well after checking our records we performed 2 inspections on your vehicle and it never gave us a code for bad o2 sensors so no they wasn't replaced and as for the oil change it was performed just before you purchased the car. I'm very satisfied with my car and the fact that the o2 sensors were never replaced or the oil never changed but I'm not satisfied with being told it was and had to put out bad reviews to find out the truth.

She is knowledgeable, efficient and very polite. Also, my car was in and out in a timely manner.",5.0
3,"February 15, 2018","My 2013 needed air bag recall service.  I decided to try West Houston Subaru following a recent bad service experience at another dealer (original purchase dealership).  I set an appointment for vehicle drop off, paperwork was printed and ready when I arrived.  Dropped off at 12:30 and vehicle was ready by 2:30, complete with wash and vacuum.",5.0

6,"November 28, 2017","I had a flat tire while driving on the Highway, I didn't have an appointment,  but they accommodated and fixed my problem, thanks to the West Houston Subaru service advisor,  Mr. RICK RODRIGUEZ. I think Mr. RODRIGUEZ went above and beyond and he provided me with an EXCELLENTüëå customer service. Thank you Mr. Rodriguezüëç",5.0
7,"November 11, 2017","Bought third car at this dealership in 5 years.  The second car, a 2014 Subaru Forrester XT, required no less than five visits to get the electronics fixed because of the incompetence of the service department.   Just bought a 2018 Subaru outback and it immediately started having lack of traction in the rear wheels making the car dangerous at speed and on slick surfaces.  Instead of showing concern about my issues, the sales person was insulting, questioning whether I had kept the parking brakes on in the car.   The sales manager, Mr. Johnson, with no less sympathetic. Finally, demanded that they take the car back and have it reviewed by their service department, where I significant rear alignment issue was found. When I went to pick up the car, no one from the service department said as much is a word to me.  There was no apology from Mr. Johnson or anyone of the sales staff. Buy a car anywhere else but here until they fire Mr. Johnson.",1.0
8,"October 28, 2017",The service representative Rick advised that the installation of our remote starting system would take about 2 hours and he would call when done.  I would be wealthy if I had a nickel every time this hollow promise has been made with previous dealers. He called 2 hrs and 15 minutes to inform us the work was done.  When we arrived the car was pulled around after it was freshly washed.  I couldn‚Äôt be more impressed with the commitment to customer service exemplified by Rick and West Houston Subaru.,5.0

11,"October 19, 2017","Had very low mileage so only needed a few things done.  But all was performed efficiently and on time.

13,"October 04, 2017","First impressions last and my experience with Subaru west Houston is nothing short of excellence. Not to mention the good coffee, the place is very clean and staff were very accommodating. Then the free car wash and vacuum after the service is the cherry on top. Keep up the good work!!!!!!!!!!",5.0
14,"September 23, 2017",The transmission went out on my 2008 Tribeca. It was towed in to your dealership the next morning. Your service department kept me updated on repairs.  I spoke mostly with Robert.  Took several days because the parts were stranded in Georgia which also had a storm.  When it was repaired I paid the charges with my Visa over the phone and my grandchildren  picked up the vehicle.  For a an eighty-nine year old that was real much appreciated service.  Thank you.,5.0

17,"September 10, 2017",I had bought my WRX from a dealer in Dallas and when I brought it to Abel for service we went out of his way and performed a full inspection on the vehicle and quickly answered all my newbie questions since this was my first Subaru.,5.0
18,"September 07, 2017","By some freak scenario, there was one aftermarket stud set on my car and it somehow caused my lugs to come loose after over 3 months of ownership. This caused damage to the wheel and caused me to have to replace it. Abel was extremely accommodating, apologized for letting the car be sold that way, and replaced the whole hub at the dealership's cost. I am very relieved to be safe and am extremely satisfied with the service at West Houston Subaru.",5.0
19,"June 25, 2017","Hi:

We ), would like to let you know how much we ENJOYED buying our cars (two identical Subaru 2.5i with all weather and rugged option #1) with Troy this morning.  We work around the clock in health care, and any free time is precious; therefore, we so appreciate his straight forward, no-run-around, no BS way of dealing.  

We will definitely be letting our families and friends know about your dealership, from our most surprisingly pleasant car buying experience.  

Thank you guys (Troy and Karen, especially)!

20,"April 24, 2017","We were torn between a Honda CR-V or the Subaru Forester. What made the difference in this case was the salesperson.  Frank Hallinan was attentive, diligent and worked for the sale.  Even after we test drove a couple of vehicles and continued our search. Frank kept after us by alerting us to new inventory and giving us a reason to come back again.  In the end, they had the right car and the best salesperson.  The ease of completing the sale was remarkable. The fact that he and others stayed late on the Saturday before Easter so we could finish up and take the car made me feel that this was the right place to buy a car.  Our experience with West Houston Subaru was by far the best I have had in any car purchase to date. When it comes down to it, experience and hard work trumps everything else when it comes to purchasing a vehicle.  They earned my business and I would go back there.",4.8
21,"April 05, 2017","We left $500, non refundable, deposit and request for certification of vehicle. Were informed certification would take extra day due to hail damage needing repair. 

In the interim, we found a better deal at Gillman Subaru. Gilman also informed us that it is illegal for the dealer to take a non refundable deposit. Prior to West Houston Subaru (WHS) scheduling a 3rd party hail damage repair company to come fix the dents, we contacted our sales rep and informed him that we had found a better deal, and we appreciated his time and assistance but that we were going with the other vehicle. 

His immediate response, that same evening, was ""you did sign a non refundable"". The next morning he left an amiable toned message to let us know they went ahead and scheduled the hail damage guy to come out the following day. Then he reminded us again that we did sign a non refundable deposit agreement and that they will have to pay a $225 minimum to the hail damage guy (even before he had come out to do work). We left a message in return telling him that we had let him know the day before that we were not going to go through with that car and whatever he has to pay the hail damage guy can be taken from the $500 (which we were just counting as a loss). He then called us back and while we were speaking with him he brought into question my honor as a military man as well as an American citizen. When we reiterated that we were going with the other deal because it was better, he hung up on us. The tone of the call was very intimidating. 

Gillman auto offered to help us get back the $500 as it works as illegal for them to require that of us. Take your business to Gillman!",1.4
22,"February 12, 2017","West Houston Subaru is the most trust worthy dealership.  We have purchased at least 7 cars from them and have never walked away feeling like we have been schamed.  When our daughter went away to college, in Stephenville, we wanted to make sure she had a vehicle that was safe and reliable for her, so we talked with Steve Palmisano and purchased a new Outback Sport for her.  We live in Bay City Texas and travel 72 miles just to buy and get service from them.  ",5.0
23,"January 30, 2017"," I have been dealing with Rob in the service center for the past 7 years and I have no idea why he is still employed at this dealership. He is very condescending to this customers and will not acknowledge anyone that comes in for service. Many times I have stood right in front of him and he refuses to acknowledge me, look up from reading, or stop idle small talk with his fellow employees, just completely ignores me like I‚Äôm a ghost.  He is a very miserable person to deal with and always a hassle.   This is not a case of Rob having a bad day, he has always been difficult to deal  with since I purchased my car here. .  Once he does decide to talk to you he will not make eye contact, mumbles his responses and is very dismissive of any questions you may have.  I know the dealership has had many complaints about him as he treats all the customers in this same manor, however the dealership refuses to do anything about it. 
He doesn't seem to grasp the fact he is in the service industry, and treats customers with contempt and  as if  they are lucky to have a moment of his time to discuss thousands of dollars‚Äô worth of work on their vehicles. 
He needs to be reprimanded and retained.  He has been at the dealership so long he has become surly and unapproachable. It‚Äôs to the point I dread even taking to him on the phone.  Many others I talk to that get their vehicles serviced here will purposely go out of their way to deal with one of the other service reps just to avoid Rob.  For this reason alone I would never purchase another vehicle here no matter the deal they could possibly give me, it‚Äôs not worth dealing with Rob for more years to come.

24,"October 23, 2016","I was given pricing online (Troy Lynn) and it was much less than another dealer.  Went in and purchased the vehicle.  No issues.  We did have a trade and an offer from Texas Direct.  With less tax on the new vehicle, I came out about $500 more than Texas Direct.",5.0
25,"October 30, 2015","Dishonest sales person. I contacted West Houston Subaru online and ask if this location was a authorized dealer under the COSTCO program. I was contacted by Ryan Nguyen and he stated YES this location was part of the COSTCO program and sent me a price on a vehicle I was interested and clearly in the quote it states COSTCO price.  I was then told I only had 5 days to put down a deposit of $500.00 although the vehicle was in transit and not available for 15-30 days. After the deposit was made I was told the deposit was non refundable. I told Ryan that I had a vehicle to trade and that a dealer in the Dallas area offered me 13,750.00 as the vehicle is in excellent condition. Well 20 days later I get a call that the car is in and we can drive 250 miles to get the new car. When we get there as he holds your deposit as ransomed, the dealer low xxxxx the trade in ($12,000.00) in hopes you cave in. I got up and walked out. drove to Gillman Subaru, who is a COSTCO dealer. I saved over $2,000.00   ",1.0
26,"July 03, 2015","As an out of state buyer, I would recommend West Houston Subaru to everyone that I know. I purchased a used Honda Accord from Vince Ramacca awhile back and still feel that it was the best decision that I could have made; this is why: I looked all around the country for the best deal that I could find on a used Toyota Corolla and West Houston Subaru had it, so I got in touch with a sales guy by the name of Vince Ramacca. Vince spoke with me and confirmed that he had the Toyota in stock, he also confirmed the sales price and car details. After talking to him for awhile he started to understand the reasons behind why exactly I wanted the that particular vehicle. After listening, he began to let me know that I had other options based upon my ideal vehicle criteria. He was not pushy or like a typical car salesman but rather informative and understanding. We went back back and forth via email for a some time and I finally decided on a lightly used Honda Accord. He took the effort and the time to work with me to find the perfect car that fit my needs/wants. I was not just another ""sale"" like I had been at every other dealership that I spoke with. A few weeks after our initial discussion, I flew down to Houston from Kansas City and Vince even went so far as to pick me up from the airport in the Honda that I ended up purchasing!!! He had me out and on my way within a few hours and to this day, I feel that Vince made all the difference in my purchase satisfaction. I will be purchasing all of my cars from Vince in the future and my family has done and will do the same.   In all, I have never found a more caring, professional or intelligent car salesmen than Mr. Ramacca. In addition, I don't typically write reviews, but I feel that the service I received at West Houston Subaru and with Vince truly warranted a great review because they went way above and beyond the call of duty for me!",5.0
27,"July 01, 2015","COMPLETELY DEGRADING TO WOMEN. Joe was/is absolutely the most disrespectful, disinterested, arrogant salesperson my daughter has ever dealt with. Laughed at her questions and lectured her on how dumb he thought her questions were. Far more interested in talking down to her than in helping her determine if their used Impreza was the right car for her. It appears that Joe has had other complaints from people mad enough to post a complaint, yet he still works there. What does that say about Joe's bosses? If you are a woman, don't even bother wasting your time with these people.",1.0

Yes this would be even more helpful if you all wouldn't try and screw everyone buying a car from you. You would be able to help more people and pets out! I tried to buy and they jacked price way up on me after putting deposit on car that is non-refundable and working with sales and management all day. Manager Gerald tells me you can't buy that for that price you have a new price. This place is a joke!
