0,"June 02, 2020","Dealt with Lisa and the Philpott on buying a low mileage diesel vehicle.  Bridge loan with Neches Credit Union was suggested by the Philpott team which worked out well.  Fitment of OEM tires from Michelin was as also coordinated by sales and management staff.  Very good experience overall.  

Thanks again,

2,"May 08, 2020","Oil change took 4 hrs was told 1 hr . Went to ask about it was told they are running behind. Been told this before. Not the first time this happened. Had an appointment too, but it's a shame that they dont even honor appointment time. They didn't even get to it for 3 hrs. They didn't even have anything to drink and had to wait that long. Last trip here. Other vehicle is serviced at silsbee and takes 45 min.",3.6
3,"May 06, 2020","Philpott did a great job at performing the regular maintenance on my vehicle. It was time for the Texas inspection  sticker to be renewed. They took care of that as well. When they were through, they sprayed disinfectant (coronavirus) on the door handle & steering wheel. I appreciated them taking such safety measures. They do good work. ",5.0
4,"May 01, 2020","I had a recall - I was not offered the shuttle service over the phone. It would have been less hassle for me. I went back to pick up the car and it was not ready, then I was offered the shuttle service. (After 2 favor rides) Britney was very courteous and professional- A procedure should be in place",3.0
5,"April 22, 2020","They took care of me, the recall fix took longer than I expected, and based on their estimated time. (More than 2.5 hours) At the end the car was ready but the lady that was helping me went to have lunch or something, I had to go and ask for my car which was ready I don´t know how long ago but at least 10 minutes and I was crazy about getting going.

When I get in the car, it looks like the technicians put tools on top of the passenger seat and the seat was dirty, I had to go back and report it. They helped right away and cleaned it very well, but at that point, I was a little uncomfortable with the service.

I wanted to check options to trade in but at that point, I just wanted to go home. And I felt they did not have much stuff going on because of the COVID-19 so it felt like they were with the guard down that day.

Usually, I receive good care and good results. Just please talk to the technicians, that was the part I didn´t like the most.",4.0

10,"March 27, 2020",Philpott's Service department is very professional and speedy. I never feel pressured to get recommended services but they are happy to provide quotes on prices for said services. When you take your vehicle in you expect timeliness and professionalism and Philpott scores A+ in those categories.  In the time of the covid-19 virus I was happy to see Philpott's employees taking great precaution to maintain social distancing measures and ensured it didn't interfere with the services I needed. Great experience. Will continue coming to Philpott for all service needs.,5.0
11,"March 15, 2020","This dealership has professional & outstanding service. The atmosphere @Philpott is pleasant and inviting. I love everything about this dealership. My vehicle purchase was a good one. Kendall was a great salesman & the (FYNE) finance man was amazing as well. All of my service appointments have been good ones as well. I don't even dread going to my service appointments, I actually look forward to them. Tracy & Brittney are wonderful managers. Courtney is wonderful and the cashiers in the back are great too. I even saw some service mechanics @the Shell station after hours on evening and they were pleasant away from the job. If you are looking for a Toyota, Philpott is where you should go. If Mr. Toyoda were alive today, he'd be PROUD. I'm a customer for LIFE! ",5.0

16,"November 21, 2019",This dealership takes constructive criticism in a positive way and continues to be the best dealership within a 50 mile radius. I make the above statement with firsthand experience.  The service department is certainly “proactive” and not “reactive.”  Attitude is everything. Customer service is your reality. People may forget what you say but they will never forget how they make you feel. Thank you for making maintenance as painless as possible. Love their shuttle service. Such warm and friendly folk. It is very obvious that their service manager is a leader. ,5.0

18,"November 05, 2019","Its never easy to understand why my wife doesn't tell me her service engine light is on and has been for months. So I tried my luck to stop in to Philpott Toyota Service Center Saturday morning and get things taken care of without wasting all of my Saturday. I was a little nervous when Amber asked if I had an appointment and I had to say no. No problem, she said,  I think we should be able to get you taken care of. She was very polite and courteous in getting my wife's vehicle serviced and out the door in about 2 hours.  ",5.0
19,"September 27, 2019",Philpott Toyota and Mark Fiorenza did a wonderful job helping me get my new 2019 Camry.  They really went the extra mile and worked so hard.  It was a very pleasant car buying experience and I will recommend them to all my friends and family.,5.0
20,"July 30, 2019","So,  the Kia Dealership that I bought the Scion FRS from stripped the head on the oil drain plug plus overtorqued it thus making it impossible to remove. I went to Philpott to have it resolved and they absolutely did. They grinded and manhandled the old drain plug out, ordered a new one from the Subaru dealership across the street, and slapped on a Tokyo Roki Subaru OEM Oil Filter to finish the oil change! I'm already happy that I can do my oil changes again but having the preferred oil filter too without extra cost made my day. I was expecting the cheap fram filter or the OE spec Toyota ones to be provided but they went the extra mile away to service one of few FRS's in the Golden Triangle. 

You did good Philpott Toyota! I may not live there anymore but my family comes there for their routine service every time. ",5.0
21,"March 25, 2019","My service advisor (Tabitha) was awesome to deal with and very accommodating.
I would however recommend a QC to look at  any work once completed. After my Turbo was replaced and I picked up the truck a heater hose blew off on my home making my truck immobile. Thanks to my service advisor the problem was taken care of without me losing time from work. I would recommend to ask for her when you visit the service department for your next vehicle service.
