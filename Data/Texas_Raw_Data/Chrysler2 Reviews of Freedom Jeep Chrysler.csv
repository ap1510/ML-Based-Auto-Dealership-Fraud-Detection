0,"September 19, 2019","I recently took my vehicle in because the rear a/c was not working. Luckily I had an extended warranty which covered the repairs. I was told only the control module was bad and was replaced. When I picked up my vehicle the rear a/c was working fine, however only a week later the rear a/c was not working again. I then went into the dealership and advised them of the problem to which I was told they will take care of me and do not want me to be unhappy. However when I picked up my vehicle I was told the rear blower motor was intermittent and needed to be replaced. This is also a part of the rear a/c not caught on the last service. They told me I would have to pay my deductible again even though they failed to diagnose this problem the first time. I will not be bringing my vehicle back here and will drive an hour to a dealership that will care for us properly.",1.0
1,"December 22, 2018","So my problem is with the sales team and the service department. I purchased a 2019 Jeep Cherokee with the 2.4l engine. Terrible mistake. Came in looking for a wrangler and to trade in my truck that I completely regret trading in. I do understand that I have poor credit and not a ton to put down and they were able to get me into a vehicle. It is my fault for not realizing the terrible mistake I was making. The biggest  issue I have at the moment is with how the sales staff conducted themselves and with the service department. I was simply another number and that was that. My vehicle has had nothing but problems and I currently only have 4,001 miles after 4 1/2 months. The motor completely stalled out at 400 miles with my one year old son in the back seat while I was stuck in the middle of a busy turn in. Contacted my salesman immediately after it happened and was told to call service and have a nice day (I do understand that he could not do anything about it, however he presented himself as a friend throughout the process of the sale). So I felt as if I was not takin serious and decided to wait to see if it happened again (maybe just a freak accident because no codes were thrown). Fast forward to 990 miles it happened again at which point I did some research and learned that other people were having this problem as well. I decided to have it  towed in (mileage was 1030) after all day of not having any answers as well as not being provided a loaner (not that I didn't just purchase a vehicle from them) I was finally texted that nothing was wrong. I provided video evidence and was still told the same thing. I was told don't worry that it is just the auto stop feature and that was it and that her service manager and tech test drove the vehicle multiple times to confirm. I went to pick up the vehicle, got in, and the odometer still read 1030. Big surprise that they completely did nothing. I worked and occasionally still do on cars and on the newer ones as well. What happened with me had nothing to do with the auto start stop. hopefully that can paint a small picture of the frustration. The vehicle did stall out again only this time with my wife in the vehicle while she was getting onto the interstate. Now FCA did come out with a recall stating that it had to do with their transmission not shifting properly (forgot to mention that I complained about it never shifting right and was told it was fine). The best part about is; the car still drives like crap and every once in a while it will lug out before leaving a stop sign or light. So in the end I do not like my car at all. This is not the reason for my negative review. My problem with this store is the salesman, sales manager, and service department. They have no integrity; they only see a dollar sign.
