1,"June 17, 2020","Yes I made an appointment over the phone to have my oil changed with Chris Chavez. Upon arriving to the service area i stood outside of my vehicle waiting for someone...anyone to pay attention and ask me how I can be helped. 30 minutes later I get the chris coming to me asking how I can be helped. I told him I made an appointment for an oil change and he told me he had no idea.Why did I make the appointment

6,"May 20, 2020","I was taken care of immediately, allowing me to decide what vehicle I wanted since I am a person that goes to a dealership and knows what he wants and does not like to waste time.  Antonio, my salesperson was very knowledgeable, courteous, and friendly.  Martin, the manager was very good in giving me a great price, and not wasting time.  Thank you to both these salemen.

12,"April 19, 2020","my visit from the Viva dodge staff was great. The young man that met me, Whose name was Chris, was very professional and addressed my needs including washing my car. Stacy, the service manager also came out to greet me and make sure I was being taken care of. The gentleman who is in charge of all service centers for the Viva dealerships, Mr. Patrick Brown,  does a great job in training his service people in customer service. ",4.8

14,"April 07, 2020",My experience started in 2018 when I had lifters replaced.  The lifters were replaced twice times and I (and my warranty have paid over $8000).  I was told that I had aftermarket parts from AutoZone because supposedly the parts were on back order by 6 months (At one point they had my vehicle from July - Nov and I had to take it back in Dec :(   I no longer have a warranty and this last time I took my car in I was told that the warranty is expired and they were being nice to me by offering to not charge for labor (lifters again) but I could buy some lifters that came in for another vehicle.  I really believe that there is an underlying problem and did not think I should have to keep buying lifters and the REAL problem isn't addressed.  Needless to say that was their final offer.  I have my car after spending over $8000 and its still not working properly.  I spoke with everyone from the service manager to the general manager...NOT RECOMMENDED!!,2.4
15,"March 18, 2020","My fiance took my Scat Pack to the dealership for an oil change and ended up paying over $300 extra. Instead of asking her if she wanted them to do the filter replacements, fuel injector flush, and brake fluid flush they took the liberty of starting on it without her say so. To make matters worse they tried to explain to her what and why they did it as if she knew what they were talking about. The way I see it they took advantage of the situation to make a profit. ",1.0
16,"March 11, 2020","My experience with Viva Dodge was awesome! I love my new 2019 Challenger GT.  I worked with Rian Toms and she was friendly, professional and was able to get me taken care of with no trouble at all.  Everyone there was super helpful and welcoming.  I would recommend Viva Dodge to anyone looking to purchase a new vehicle with no headaches! ",5.0

23,"December 18, 2019",Right from the beginning Chris in service was rude and nothing but  negative he would not honor my two year warranty for oil changes even with proof I handed him after arguing with him for quite a while he decided to take my vehicle in for service and made sure to have them take there time on changing the oil I was told on Saturdays first come first served I was the first one in line it still took over two hours I had to go ask and he said he was getting paper work ready instead he went and    Hid my vehicle out on the lot  and never called me in waiting area to leave instead I had to go looking for someone else to help me if this young man doesn‚Äôt Like his job he should find another field of employment he also did not return my due bill and they could not find it in the paper work I have bought several vehicles from this establishment but we‚Äôll never return to this dealership ever again bad Service also called Dodge 800 number and put in a formal complaint ,1.0

32,"September 17, 2019","My wife and I visited the Dealership with no scheduled appointment. We had received a quote from another Dealership. I asked our Salesman if Viva Dodge could match, they not only matched but offered a better price! Our overall experience at the Dealership was excellent! Thank you, Viva Dodge Chrysler Jeep!  ",5.0
33,"September 09, 2019","I was extremely disappointed with the customer service I was provided on Saturday.  I dropped my van off for an oil change at  1:30.  They said they would call when it was done.  By 3:45 no on had called me to tell me if it was ready so I called back to check.  They could not find any record of us and it took them five minutes to find record of our car and then when they found it,  they let us know it was done.  I went to pick it up, paid and was given the key.  No one offered to get the car for me.  It was parked in a line of cars with 3 in front one behind and then another line of cars to the left.  I thought I had plenty of space to get my car out and was struggling.  Someone finally came to move the car in front of me.  He told me to back up, which I did slowly.  I side swiped my van door on a yellow concrete pole, dented the door and got yellow paint on my car.  When I got out of my car he walked by non-chalantly.  I said. ‚Äú Do you see my car?‚Äù  To which he rudely replied You should have asked me to move it.  I have never been to a dealer where they do not bring your car to you after servicing.  I feel like this could have been avoided with better customer service. When I asked to speak to a manager they told me they were not available and that Stacy would call me on Monday.  They also took pictures.  Stacy still hasn‚Äôt called.  When I asked if someone could wash the paint off they said no.  All of the people who could do so we‚Äôre gone.  I took my car home and washed it and am still awaiting Stacy‚Äôs call.  I believe they should fix the dent due to poor customer service.",2.2
34,"September 07, 2019",My parents went to trade in their already paid for vehicle for a newer one.  Immediately they kept hers gave her a loaner while they detailed the one she wanted supposedly in two days.  Three weeks went by and mom was never able to drive that truck because if it wasn‚Äôt a rotator was issues with bank and supposedly bank had already sent them the check already.  A bunch of lies and cowards not giving face not to mention they don‚Äôt answer the phones or return calls left on voicemail.  4 weeks later mom got her truck back we are still hoping they better not screw her with bank and credit.  I recommend no one deal with these unprofessionals .  I went last week to Casa Ford and got my truck in 2 days very friendly and straight professional.  I don‚Äôt give a single star to Viva Dodge Chrysler Jeep!!!,1.0
35,"August 12, 2019",My whole experience was really stress free and was the quickest process ive experienced with buying a vehicle. I would definitely recommend this dealer unless you prefer being mistreated then in that case go to sundland park dodge.,5.0
36,"July 24, 2019",I bought a vehicle from Viva Dodge on the 19 of july. On Sunday 21 I called to inform them I was experiencing several issues with the truck I would like to return it. On monday they directed me to the service center. After 2 days without a call I went in on my own and said they couldn't replicate the problem. I took the mechanic with me and replicated the problem myself. After he admitted the problem I asked again to have my old vehicle back. A very rude finance manager named Julio Gomez said he couldn't do it because the deal had been processed on the 23rd. He kept repeating is there anything else while we were trying to talk to him and then walked out on us while we were still talking. Keep in mind I brought the vehicle back on 22nd before the deal had been processed. I have purchased many RAMs before from this dealer and have never been treated with such disregard and disrespect like I did with mr Gomez. The mechanic admitted there was an issue on a vehicle I had for 2 days. After reading reviews this is not an isolated event. I would advise anyone to buy from a different auto group.,1.0

42,"April 15, 2019",God job happy with service . I will come again. Attentive to my car needs. Glad to be educated about the car.  I will apply what i learned,4.8
43,"March 27, 2019","I worked with Juan Wiesel. He helped me out a lot, I would recommend him. As far as the dealership, I didn't like that they don't offer any maintenance, extra washes or gas tanks. With previous experiences, I always get some extra perks for buying at a particular dealer. Mission Chevy even allowed us to spin a wheel and I won 100 dollars. Juan was great, the dealership is not very enganging.",4.2
44,"March 16, 2019","So I‚Äôve had prior experience with this dealership when I bought a used Dodge Charger, and that first experience was terrible from the sales person to the service department. But I wanted to buy a new pick up truck and started shopping all the dealerships and decided to just look at what viva dodge had. Since a lot of dealerships didn‚Äôt have what I was looking for our blew me off and thinking I was to young to be looking to buy a truck. Well they upgraded they‚Äôre whole staff! Super friendly and attentive Alexis was able to work with me and we where able to get a deal on the truck I wanted. After that got sent into financing and the Manager Julio Gomez wasn‚Äôt like normal financial personnel that are pushing all these warranties down your throat, he also was able to get us a amazing deal on the maintenance for the truck. Overall would recommend to come here and purchase your dream car. ",5.0
45,"March 13, 2019","I had been researching the new redesigned 2019 Ram trucks and decided to go after work on Monday, 3/11/19 to check them out. I had not one, but two excellent salespeople, Denise and Raul. Denise was first and actually said Raul was the Ram expert and had him jump in to help. Not only he did he know everything about the new Ram, this was the first time I ever saw two car salespeople work together. They also negotiated with us without pressuring me to do something I didn‚Äôt want to do. They were so polite and helpful, and I learned that Viva Dodge uses non-commissioned sales. That explained the more relaxed nature of the entire dealership. I think more dealers should go to that model of sales. To end, Leo, our finance manager, did a masterful job of getting us a good deal with the credit union; his explanation of Gap insurance and warranties were the best I had ever heard. That says a lot for someone who has bought his own vehicles for over 20 years. I had Gap insurance before, but just because I knew in a basic sense it was important. The expansion of knowledge was so beneficial. They sell the Ram, Jeep, Dodge, and Chrysler. Visit them and give them a shot!",4.8

48,"October 04, 2018","Didn‚Äôt feel like my business was important. Got looked at like I was bothering them when I drove in the bay. Took over five minutes to get approached. Then the lady who finally approached only wanted to know what I was there for and if I had an appointment. Once I told her I did and that it was with Joe, she said he was busy on the phone with another customer and disappeared. She finally returns telling me that Joe is STILL busy and asked me to fill out the paperwork for Joe. Once I did Joe‚Äôs job, I was told I could leave my keys and go to the waiting area. I mentioned that I wanted to speak to a manager because I had a complaint and the lady said she would send them to the waiting area. The manager never came and I didn‚Äôt feel like walking around looking for someone who most likely wasn‚Äôt around. Got passed by several employees that seemed as though they were in prison. No hello, good morning, or even a smile. Finally my truck was finished and the technician didn‚Äôt inform me of exactly what was done to my truck or anything. He just told me my truck was done and to sign some paperwork in a few places. Someone really needs to discuss customer service with this team. Most people want to feel slightly important when bringing their MONEY/BUSINESS to someone. There are two other dealerships that we can all go to. Make me not want to go anywhere else. It‚Äôs that easy. ",1.3

50,"August 30, 2018","They Straight out Lied about having to immediately need to service my rear brakes, Makes me wonder if Recall on Air Bag issue was even completed!!

Took vehicle for recall issue. Was adviced my rear brakes needed replacing. Informed them I had taken vehicle to Midas last year. Took vehicle to Midas due to Lifetime Brake Guaranteed-- they checked and showed me.  Brakes - all around- front and back were all serviceable- no need to replace.",1.8
51,"August 25, 2018","Almost walked away from the deal just because of our salesman. The Sales Manager helped to seal the deal. Over all they took care of us and we went through with the deal. But again the salesman is not all there, lost our owners manual and our spare key, and the final detailing of our SUV was really bad. They cleaned the front driver and passenger side somewhat ok, but the 2nd row was done fast, could tell they rushed it, and the 3rd row they didn't even touch at all!! The mat that goes in the 3rd row had just been thrown back there. Again, over all the dealership is great and nice but our experience, even though we got taken cared of, was not very good. ",3.2

64,"April 13, 2018","I went in to get a dent fixed on my car. I dropped my car off to the service area because that‚Äôs where they said they‚Äôd fix it. Along with getting the dent fixed, I was supposed to get a ‚Äúcomplimentary‚Äù car wash and 5 gallons of gas. 
When I dropped off my car, they said it could take the whole day but they‚Äôd call me when it was done. I had stuff to do that day so I later called asking for an estimate on how many hours it would take so I could plan around it. The lady that I called had bad customer service, she just kept transferring me to a number that went straight to voicemail. Instead of asking someone above her what to do, she kept transferring the call which annoyed me. Finally, the guy from the shop called me to tell me my car was ready. It was time to pick it up, yet it wasn‚Äôt washed and they didn‚Äôt add the 5 gallons of gas.
I let them know about it and they told me they‚Äôd take care of it. 30 minutes pass by and they finally come back with my keys telling me it‚Äôs ready. 
Once I got to my car, IT LITERALLY LOOKED LIKE THEY WIPED IT DOWN WITH A RAG. My car was still dirty near my tires, there was still dust on my windshield on mirrors. I was so upset but at that point I wanted to leave already. 
I DO NOT RECOMMEND GOING HERE!",1.0

66,"December 30, 2017","This dealership is by far the most crooked dealership. Purchased a vehicle on November 4 from these people, received it with no gas, undetailed, and no ""welcome Kit"" as it states in the contract. It has been 3 months and my trade in has not yet been paid off, I am getting collection calls from my trade in and of course the worst part I now have negative credit remarks on my credit report that I didn't have for the past 5 years. To top it off they forgot to do the inspection on it and I was left with doing so and was told I would get re-imbursed. Not live in town so I was forced to do so. I was also told I was to keep my air force license plates and just found out they did not submit the paperwork and gave me different plates lol. Overall these people have been liars from day one and have not returned my phone calls for the last 2 months to inform me what the status is on my trade in pay off. Don't let them ruin your credit. All they care about is their sale and after that your screwed. I am now taking legal action to resolve this. ",1.0

88,"October 20, 2015","I went to purchase a vehicle from viva jeep. I wanted to trade my car in. They came back with a low trade in offer. I asked who they use to get trade in value. The sales manager and sales person said Nada. So I looked the trade in value of my car and in rough condition value was 12,900. My car was in mint condition and trade in value for mint was 14900. They came back with a offer for 9,000. The highest he said they would go was 10125. Not even close to rough condition value. I asked how he came up with that value and he told me because the resale value was not good. He said he would offer me more but the price on the truck has to go back up. He needed to show the bank. I couldn't believe what he had told me. He was just feeding me a bunch of xxxxxxxx. I had never heard anything like that out of all the cars I had bought. Oh and when they say they'll get you approved it's not true. You better have really good credit. Because if you don't they won't call you back and give you updates on what's going on. You have to call them and ask. Redicoulas sales manager and the way they try and rip off the people. They are definitely a dealer ship that won't give you more for your trade. I would never consider buying a truck or car from here again. ",2.0

She took very good care of me and I was very pleased with the service they both gave me.",4.4

92,"August 01, 2015","I took my car for the Mopar Express Lane and do the oil change, tire rotation, and all the things that were supposed to be done as advertize on the website, but all I got was a oil change, no air filter change, nor wiper blades replacement and tire rotation, I also was supposed to get the oil change free since it was the first time I took my car there and they denied it. I'm very disappointed with the service and more than likely I will take my car to another dealership fro service.    ",1.8
93,"July 30, 2015","Considering I bought vehicles from this dealership before, I went here first to see what I could see.
Luis Perez was asked to help me look at some trucks. He took his time finding out what I was looking for and we saw a couple of trucks. We also went on a test drive.  Although I recognized some pressure tactics in play, I felt comfortable dealing with Luis. 
Since I have to check for the best deal myself, I didn't purchase anything that day. 
After checking at 3 other dealerships, I returned to Viva Dodge a week later and asked for Luis. 
We looked at the previous vehicle and another one. I ultimately bought the new vehicle we saw that day. 
Overall I had a good experience purchasing my new truck. ",5.0

103,"October 23, 2014","I purchased a brand new 2014 Dodge Dart GT from Viva Chrysler Dodge Jeep at 8434 Gateway East El Paso, TX 79907 in late August 2014. When I brought it back in a week later to get it washed and detailed, my husband realized the front right rim was scratched up about 1/4 of the edge of the rim. I told the service department and my sales representative and they took pictures to send up to the manufacturing company, but it got denied and they told me the dealership can't help me with this issue. They basically expect me to pay out of pocket for a damaged part that I had no fault in. I would not recommend going here to purchase a vehicle especially a new one. If you do, be sure to check every little thing on the vehicle before they sell it to you, don't let them rush you into signing anything until you have inspected everything. And when you bring it into services for any reason, make sure you inspect your vehicle before and after to make sure they did not damage anything. That way you can point it out to them right there and then before they deny causing any damages. Please don't let the crisis I am dealing with happen to you.",1.0
