0,"May 13, 2020","My wife and I went shopping for ""her"" dream car.  We had no idea that Patterson Honda in Wichita Falls had just gotten her dream car delivered that day.  From the moment we stepped into the show room we were treated BETTER than family!!  Micheal Stran Smith, was an amazingly talented young man.  We felt like at no time did he even sell us anything, rather he just gave us information and the car picked us as her new owners.  Once my wife got behind the wheel it was love at first drive!!  We were always made to feel that we were visiting family rather than going to a car dealer.  This philosophy was maintained from The General Manager to every single employee of the dealership.  Everything was effortless and painless.  Even paying cash for the car and buying the extended warranty etc with Brent the finance manager was a wonderful experience.  It went beyond just buying a car we became part of a dealership community and we know going forward we would be taken care of every step of the way.   Thank you so much for being who you are and being in business!!",5.0

8,"June 25, 2019"," This is our 3rd vehicle to buy from Steve and close to 10th when you include our family.

20,"April 25, 2017","I broke down half way home from an area 1-hour North of Houston to Albuquerque in a 2003 Trailblazer having 203,421 miles on it throwing a rod on Feb 27, 2017. Initially the problem was thought to replace a part to do with the cam timing using a code reader by a fine fellow in a fueling station. Checking with google asking closest parts store coming in from Jolly, TX directing me to them turning out to be a GM dealership certain to have the part which they did. The service guy was excellent and helpful. Finding I was having trouble installing the part, one service technician handed me tools and a power drill-driver not knowing me from anyone being close to closing at 6 PM. Louis, another service technician came to rescue me and stayed extra on his time to help me realizing it was a much more serious problem filling out a service request leaving the vehicle to be evaluated. He was patient and took me to the Baymont Inn and stayed with me to make sure I got checked in giving information to get back. It was estimated to be $8k to replace the engine to a vehicle no where worth the price, yet I was in a jamb electing to do it. Keith the service manager was very expeditious in getting the process started knowing I would have to stay in the hotel for better of a week. My family from both sides were screaming to put the money into another vehicle to buy. Having less than stellar credit, I feared there is no way we would be approved for a loan. I pleaded my situation initially to a lady in the BMW office being most gracious and not shooing me away getting me to Jason at the certified pre-owned area. We, through google face-time like with the wife and looked a number of options with Jason showing her inside and out. We settled on a 2014 Chevy Silverado 1500 Crew Cab Z-71 4x4 and low and behold we were graced in getting financed! It was considered a high-risk loan, nevertheless it was something we could use well into the future with different plans we have. They even game me a free car to drive around in the whole week. We had other options added and they including the lot manager, the finance guy Brady who was super-duper incredible treating me first-class with all being flexible. Even Keith the service manager was gracious in getting the motor sent back not wanting to turn them off as we did not expect ever getting financed. Come to find out, Louis had made sure he was the technician for my vehicle preparing it up to 4-bolts from removing the engine on his own time to 1 or 2 AM in the morning to ensure to expedite installing the new crate motor - incredible. I did get the costs rolled into the new loan to make sure they and Louis were taken care of. The new truck was readied for delivery. On Saturday March 4, I rolled in with a U-Haul dolly to bring home the Trailblazer having 8 guys freely coming from the shop to push it up onto the car dolly ... that was a hoot of fun, but super great also having a truck that could pull it. Everyone and I mean everyone from Service, Parts, Finance, Sales, and on and on were exceptional going over and beyond for me and us in our plight. There are so many names and I can't remember them, but you all know who you are. Certainly knowing with faith and trust, there was a reason I broke down where I did with all the available resources not out in a rural area when it did. We will absolutely come back even driving the distance and stay a night in a hotel to get any future vehicle and absolutely recommend anyone else with full confidence.",5.0

30,"January 24, 2017","I've dealt with Patterson's Service department (2011 Cadillac CTS V Wagon) multiple times over the past year, regarding warranty work. Each time, I was treated as though I've been doing business with them for 50 years. Keep in mind, I purchased a certified pre-owned car from a personal seller- not this dealership. Regular updates and notifications, conveniently including text messages (as I can't answer my phone at work). Highly recommend them! ",5.0

40,"August 24, 2016","I contacted the dealership after exploring the vehicle I wanted in the meteoplex.  I knew what kind of deal they were offering, but was willing to give the local dealer a chance.  I was fortunate to get connected with Tyler Cameron.  He understood that I was busy and wasn' t willing to come hang out and play 'Let's Make A Deal' or as I've often referred to as 'The Shell Game"".  He located the specs that I asked for and met it quickly.  He was very knowledgeable and explained the benefit of helping me complete the sell of my car to a family member in order to save on the amoint pf taxes I would pay.

43,"July 18, 2016","My wife and I just had the best experience of buying a New car you could ever ask for!!! We have been driving Cadillac for about 5 years now and have been completely pleased with the performance and quality of Cadillac! Even though we didn't buy our first Caddy from Pattersons, they were the closest servicing dealership in the area, ( We live in Clay County). Pattersons stepped up to the plate and treated us as though we did!!! Service Department A++ in our books!!! We were in the market for a New car and stopped by the dealership, that's when we met Harvey Johnson !!! This young man was kind, courtesy, and very very knowlegable about his inventory! It was about closing time on Saturday evening, so we made arrangements to meet early the following week. Today was the day and what an experience!!! His Manager, Brad Bankston, who had actually sold my wife a new Buick in 2008 made the experience even more relaxed and comfortable for us! We told these guys what we wanted, and they worked the deal as professionals that they are and we came to terms on the deal !!! Really a Great Experience !!! No pressure no hassles, told these guys what we wanted and they made it happen!!! When we went into the finance office the experience was laid back, and extremely easy!!! Bryan our finance guy answered more questions than a person should have too, and did exactly what we asked of him!!! Over all we were extremely pleased with this experience and will continue to buy, promote, and share our experience with everyone!!!  Great Job Pattersons Auto Group!!!

70,"June 30, 2015","I recently purchased a new 2015 GMC Acadia Denila through salesman Joey Lara and later sales manger Brandon Hay.  It took my wife and I a good while to make a decision, but Joey was always patient with us and seemed eager that we get the right car.  Joey showed us several Brands and models.  We started out at the Honda lot, but later moved to the GMC lot. After choosing the Acadia line, Brandon Hay was very helpful in picking the trim lever.  He also offered to bring in a car from another dealer or place a factory order if he could not find our desire.  We could not be more satisfied with Joey and Brandon and would recommend them to others.  I also think that we made some new friends.

72,"June 12, 2015","Purchased my 2015 GMC 2500HD from Tyler Cameron, at the Hyundai showroom. Have known Tyler & the Sales Manger for a few years. So, I decided to shop for my new truck with them. Emailed Tyler a build sheet from the GMC website, on Wednesday, of the truck I wanted. There were certain options I wanted on my truck. Received phone call on Friday to come in on Saturday, and discuss purchasing a truck. Was shown the specs on a truck, that was at another dealership. Went for a test drive in a truck that was on the lot, to check out the interior and features on a GMC truck. Came back from test drive and Tyler had found a truck with more options at a very little higher price. The truck was more than expected, bought the truck. Truck arrived at Patterson's, there were three options that had to be dealer installed. It only took 2 days to have the options installed. Took delivery of my new truck on Thursday. Tyler has been in contact with me, since purchasing my truck to make sure everything is going well. Couldn't ask for better service from a salesman.

76,"June 10, 2015","Great selection of vehicles and great sales reps. Stella is fabulous! You won't feel pressured to buy a car. Stella believes you should buy the car that you are comfortable in. After you buy, they are still there for you for any questions you may have about your new car.",4.6
77,"June 03, 2015","Mike Misner was absolutely incredible!  This guy went so far out of his way to help us get the preowned car we wanted.  Here's our story....we first went to Patterson's to look for an Armada, and that is when we met Mike.  After we drove the Armada, that particular one wasn't really what we were looking for.  We had found a Platinum Armada at a competing dealer, and when we mentioned to Mike, he drove us over to his competition because he knew some of the salesmen over at that dealership and he wanted to make sure to put us with someone he trusted.  So even though he thought he was going to lose the sale to a competitor, he still wanted to help us out.  As it turned out, we weren't real happy with that vehicle either.  We had happened to mention to Mike that we had found one with the exact specs we wanted in Georgia.....(we live in Texas).  Well, long story short, after coming to an agreement, he flew a guy out there and drove it back....a 15 hour drive!  As a preowned car, it had some minor issues,  Mike made sure all our concerns about the vehicle were addressed and fixed before we took delivery.  So because of his hard work, we did get the vehicle we wanted.  I can say this, Mike is not a ""salesman.""  He truly assisted us in our purchase with absolutely NO pressure, or any of that typical ""car salesman"" feel.  He asked questions, and found out our needs  and did whatever he could to take care of us.  ",5.0

82,"May 15, 2015",John Olhjen never makes me feel uncomfortable when I'm buying a vehicle.  I have bought several cars here.  The staff is friendly and they don't attack you like sharks when you drive on the lot.  I feel like I'm buying a car from a family friend not an employee of Psttersons.,5.0
83,"December 15, 2010","I recently drove 2-1/2 hours just to purchase a new BMW from Patterson Auto group, and I must say I was very impressed. At first I was a little hesitant because we did the deal over the phone and fax, but after a couple of conversions with them I knew I had a winner. My salesperson Michael Williams was knowledgeable about the vehicle (in contrast to my local BMW dealer who didn't even know what options came on the vehicle) and upfront with all of the pricing from the very beginning, no games, and they even beat my local dealer's price by a good amount. Not to mention when I arrived the vehicle was polished and all detailed sitting in the showroom ready to take off and the paperwork was all prepared for signing upon my arrival. Having the car ready to go and drive out of the showroom was pretty slick I must say, nice touch! Definitely worth the drive, I'd highly recommend Michael and Patterson Auto Group to anyone considering a BMW.",5.0
84,"July 23, 2009","I recently purchased a 2009 Kia Borrego dealing with Josh.  He was very knowledgable of his product explaining the differances between the Sorento and Borrego and what would suit my needs best. He was extremely helpful..making suggestions and accepting my input. Josh discussed price and I feel we worked out a fair deal. Josh asked the service manager Tommy Antwine to come the the office to answer my questions concerning service and warranty.  Tommy explained the 10 year/100,000 mile warranty & took me to the service department to introduce me to the service advisors Cameron, Juanita & Gary.  All in all a very knowledgable group of sales & service professionals. I now have a very nice new Kia Borrego that I feel comfortable calling Patterson Kia to ask for information or help if I should need it.  Recommend the dealership highly.

85,"July 20, 2009","I went in for an Oil change on my 08 Accord & while they were changing my Oil they Checked my Washer Fluid, Antifreeze, they topped them off NO charge!! They checked the air in my tires, my air filter and Cabin filter NO charge!! I'm glad they did, my cabin filter was sooo nasty! I had no idea it was even there! So I got a new one! I talked to Jim & one of his technicians they were both super nice! I didn't wait very long & felt like I got my money worth of an oil change! ",5.0
86,"May 30, 2009","I did the research online and decided to special order a 2009 Challenger.  I went to Patterson Dodge/Jeep and was thoroughly impressed through out the six month process it took to get my car in.   They kept me well updated as to the progress and stage of the build of my car.  I got a call from my salesman before my car was even off the truck that it had arrived.  I could not be happier with the staff at Patterson's.  I would not hesitate to recommend this dealership to anyone...ask for Bob Parker, or James Warnock (Sales Manager).  ",4.8
87,"August 17, 2006",Took in my Pontiac G6 for sunroof service. After a month of working on it they said it was fixed. Within two weeks the sunroof malfunctioned again. Took car to different dealer and found that mechanic at Pattersons had put screws through the wiring harness causing electrical shorts that burned up the harness and damaged more electrical items in the car. DO NOT use Patterson Auto for service.,1.3
