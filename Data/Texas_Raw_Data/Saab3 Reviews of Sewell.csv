0,"June 04, 2018","DO NOT BUY OR SERVICE HERE. They are the worst kind of customer service, wolves in sheeps clothing! I’ve had nothing but problems and negative equity dealing with Ethan Groce in Sales, Scott Lord in service and GM Klint. They make you believe they are going to take care of you but you will get screwed over without even knowing it until it’s too late. 

Here’s what all I’ve had to deal with in the last six months:
-SOLD ME A CERTIFIED LEMON and made me eat $9000 to get out of the car and into another vehicle. 
-The “Certified” vehicle was sold to me with a faulty heating core even though it was inspected. 
-Purchased right before Christmas so service was overloaded with no loaners. My kids had to use blankets to keep warm for 2 weeks until service was available to take my car in.
-Service techs treated me as if I’m ignorant and don’t know how to turn on my heater! 
-When they FINALLY pulled the dash off, they agreed the heating core was bad when they sold it to me. 
-They would not take back the car even though they sold me a lemon. Best they could do was buy back the car at a much lower value bc now there’s another owner listed on the vehicle report even though I only had the car for the 2 weeks it took for them to get the car into service. 
-When they bought back/traded in the car, I was $9000 in negative equity! 
-The second car they sold me as “Certified” they installed an m sport grill per my request. When I got my car, the grill they installed was NOT the grill I asked for. The grill was supposed to be the OEM badged grill. What I got was an aftermarket purple grill which they will not correct bc it is an aftermarket product that they installed!
-6 months into my second “Certified” car, the drivetrain malfunction sensor came on and put my car in limp mode. They had to replace the fuel pump, 3 fuel injectors and the oil pan housing. 
-When I got my car a week later, I lost 100 horsepower and the sensor came on again twice! 
-Every time I pick up my car there are new scratches from the buffer they use to clean my car. I’ve brought it to their attention and just like the grill they deny wrongdoing and won’t fix it. 
-I’ve spoken to the GM multiple times and nothing has changed except now they treat me like a nuisance. 

DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY! Sewell dealerships are crooks! ",1.0
1,"March 27, 2017","My Buying Experience at:

 Sewell Infiniti
7110 Lemmon Avenue
Dallas, Texas   75209
972-490-4545


I drove from Southwest Fort Worth, Texas to Dallas, Texas on March 25, 2017 to shop a preowned Toyota 4Runner at Sewell Infiniti. Anthony Smothers, the sales rep. for the car, and the one with whom I had been in contact prior to arrival, was an absolute pleasure to meet. He was courteous, attentive and informative at all times. For Anthony, I would readily give a 5 Star Rating. 

I informed Anthony that I was a cash customer with no intention of financing the car. They ran a credit rating on me anyway, and since I had done this myself already, I knew my credit rating was excellent. After test driving the car, and discussing the history and certain particulars, my wife and I were sold on the car. The list price was $15, 899.00 without Taxes, Title and License fees. 

At closing, I requested a $500.00 reduction in the price to help with the Taxes. Anthony presented this to his manager, and the manager declined the offer, stating there were other parties interested in the vehicle at the list price. I countered with a $200.00 reduction in price, but again, my counter-offer was declined.

This brings me to my rating. For me to have had an Excellent buying experience at Sewell, I would have needed to drive away knowing I did not pay full asking price/sale price for a used car. This did not happen. Cash was not King at Sewell Infiniti, even for a customer with an excellent credit rating.  

If you are a cash customer and contemplating buying a vehicle from Sewell Infiniti, it is likely there will be NO room for negotiating the sales price. Not even by $200.00.

2,"March 07, 2005",I am a owner of a 2000 SAAB 93.  I did not buy this car from Sewell.  That was my mistake.  However Sewell's service department has won me over.  My partner just bought a Lexus and partakes in the awesome treatment that they give. He goes to Sewell Lexus of course.  I will be buying my next car from Sewell.  In my recent encounter with Sewell my service manager Cynthia went beyond her realm to help me.  I didn't even buy the car from them and they treat me so well.  No questions on getting a loan car.  I don't know how to express in words how happy I am with this company and the fact they do not look down and treat everyone just the same.  That is awesome and I would highly recommend Sewell anything to anyone.  I personaly love the SAAB cars so I will be purchasing one from Sewell new or certified used.   Thank you Sewell for making my experiences with getting service with my car painless.,5.0
