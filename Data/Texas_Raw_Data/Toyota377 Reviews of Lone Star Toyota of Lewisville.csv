0,"June 22, 2020","Worst customer service I have ever experienced. Did not take one iota of a second to fix my problem, show any concern, or have any empathy. Then I called to make a complaint and they tried to make me feel that I was in the wrong. I will never go back to this dealership for anything and will tell anyone and everyone not to go to this dealership based off this one experience. ",1.0
1,"May 10, 2020","This is the type of dealership that gives the car buying business a bad name. Did a lot of research for what was a fair price for the truck I was looking for.  Got a quote from TrueCar with an estimated price that was on the lower end but still in the range of what other dealerships were offering. Chose to check out this location first due to it being my preferred color and trim.  I test drove the vehicle and spoke to a very nice sales associate and indicated I would be interested in the car for the right price.  Her manager or finance person then came over an outlined outrageous costs for the car. The total was over 10k more than what truecar quoted and about 5k over what their own website shows.  All before tax title and license. Not really interested in paying nearly 15k over what I saw online, I indicated that the price seemed high. They basically charge full MSRP then add on a “lone star package” and a “security package” that add 5k to the cost of the car.  He made it sound like those extras were upgrades to the car but that was already added to to the MSRP as noted on the car sticker. He also acted like the car really should have been more but they reduced the MSRP and that the rebate was something they helped us out with rather than being a manufacture incentive. Tried to negotiate but sales manager was obviously more interested in making 10k off a car rather than actually making a fair sale. Not sure what I find worse, the fact that they use false advertising to waste people’s time to try to come to the dealership to overcharge them or the fact that uninformed buyers will pay full price plus 5k.

2,"May 06, 2020","I purchased a 2016 Mazda CX-5.  Love the car!  However, I filled in the application that was sent to me by the saleslady as I told her I didn't want to be there all day.  I still was made to fill in a paper application at the dealership.
Of course, they brought in the paperwork and a ""security package"" of $2995. had been added to the online price.  I told them I would pay the online advertised price only.  They came back with more paperwork and had reduced the security package price to $995.00.  The sales lady told me to draw a line through the $995. and write at the bottom of the paper that I would pay the online advertised price and then sign it.  That's what I did.  We were at the dealership over two hours.  I had already picked out the car so that time was spent doing I don't know what!
Upon arriving home, I noticed the one key that I was given was cracked and was missing part of the plastic.  I emailed the sales lady asking for a replacement key free of charge.   She said she asked her sales manager and she told me ""he said the vehicle was sold at a loss well below market value. Since the security pkg. was declined and not paid, there isn't room for him to help or replace anything beyond the purchase of the vehicle.""
Wow.  So, basically I paid $17,000. for a vehicle with one key, and a broken one at that.  
I do NOT recommend this dealership.

4,"April 27, 2020","If you want the easiest car buying experience then go here!!! After spending four useless hours at another dealership, I called them and they said they would do outside financing after the other Toyota place said no, I drove there and met Shawn and Micheal who helped me on the phone and Shawn was easy to deal with, first five minutes was all football talk and it was great, it was like we had been to a bar together and then the sales manager I don’t know his name maybe Aaron but either way he was honest and didn’t try to be around the bush which no one did, the finance office, now we all know the box sucks but this time it was so easy and fun, nichole was awesome, easy to deal with and talk to, I can honestly say that she had the personality to keep up with mine, we were talking making jokes and she wasn’t pushy and made me feel that for the first time in forever (yes a Disney line) like I enjoyed my day and will be bringing my wife there and referring everyone I know to go to deal with nichole and Shawn.

6,"April 20, 2020",This used car dealership is a sham. They are deceitful. We went to purchase a used Honda and confirmed the price before driving there. Left a deposit and told them we wanted the car. All of a sudden we get the invoice and the manager had added over $2000 to the price. When asked he first said that's to make the car sale ready. Then add it to the price you advertise! Later he said he wouldn't back down and we didn't buy the car. This is bad practice and definitely continues to give used car salesmen a bad reputation. I would NEVER send anyone here to buy a used car.,1.0
7,"March 30, 2020","My wife and I went in looking for a 2020 Tacoma, we did not want to buy, we just wanted to get numbers and make a decision that was the best for us, our biggest issue with the entire experience was that it felt very deceptive and shady, they almost acted as if they didn’t want to make a deal with us or even give us numbers at all, 
I think since we communicated to them that we weren’t looking at buying that day they didn’t take us seriously and wouldn’t really help us like I would assume they would with someone who is purchasing on the spot. 
Also they quoted us sticker pricing when their internet offers were 5 to 6 thousand dollars cheaper, and then when I asked about that, the lady literally admitted to me that those numbers are just to get people to come in, well that isn’t the type of business that I like, I’ve been communicating with multiple other Toyota dealers and they have been much more helpful... oh and also the whole “lone star package” or whatever it is they add to all their vehicles is a scam.. do not pay it. 
Charging ridiculous amounts of money or pinstripes and nitrogen tites.. a scam that you don’t have to look any farther than YouTube to get the inside scoop on.. 
I guess they didn’t expect me to be as knowledgeable as I am in all this. I came in with very high expectations given that my text conversations with the sales rep were very pleasant, and when I got in the dealership it was like I was talking to a totally different person..

8,"March 28, 2020",Can you give 0 stars?!? Unfortunately you can’t.. or I would!! I purchased my car along with another co-signer in 2009. They offered FREE oil change services for the lifetime of the car. In 2016 I had the co-signer removed and put it in my name alone. I have been to this dealership for EVERY service/repair. However on 3 occasions. After leaving dealership I lost a hubcap. Coincidence?!? I think not! They do a multi-point inspection on the vehicles they service. Including checking tire pressure. I have never lost a hub cap ever before. But ALL 3 occasions happened after leaving dealership on my drive home! I went back to dealership & spoke with service manager and asked for new hub cap as I already purchased 3 previously due to their lack of care. He refused to help and then sent me a letter to my home stating that since the car was purchased by someone else in 2009 they refuse to  honor the free oil changes and service my vehicle in the future will he at my expense. Poor... unethical... customer service!! All over a hub cap?!?! ,1.0
9,"March 17, 2020","This dealership and salesman Joe Pulaski, succeed in predatory practices and deliberate deception. By pocketing promised taxes to be paid to the State upon the sale, they have left us to come up with the additional $1800.00. Furthermore, they continually pass the buck from one employee to another, then finally ignore correspondence altogether. Apparently, this is par for the course with this dealership.

10,"February 26, 2020","I had the engine and transmission replaced in a 2010 Prius last fall.  When I got the car back, I was missing a bottle of medication that was kept in the center console.  Since that experience, I don’t leave anything of value in the car when oil changes are done.  When I bought the car at Lone Star Toyota of Lewisville in 2010, I also purchased lifetime oil changes.  This is the only reason I continue to come back to this dealership.  Last summer, I found a 4’ square piece of plastic that is secured to the bottom of the car to assist with aerodynamics missing.  I did not say anything about it to the dealership.  I just replaced it.  The day after the oil change last November, I was hearing tin scraping the ground at low speeds.  I removed the 6x14 inch piece of tin that was secured by only one plastic push pins and set it aside for the next oil change.  I called the service manager at the time to make him aware of the issue.  I received no response.  I made the service writer aware that these push pins did not appear to be resecured with the loss of one panel and the near loss of a second one.

For several reasons, I have started using Amsoil in the car.  The oil is $40 for 4 quarts.  Since the meds came up missing, I have asked the dealership to allow me to either put the oil in myself, or watch them put it in the car.  Recently, they have moved oil changes for cars with greater than 25k miles to the main service area.  Since they do not want customers in the garage, the service writer Doug agreed to have the oil changed in the bay adjacent to the rear doors so I could verify the oil being used.  The car was driven to the bay and parked while I waited in the doorway.  The person I now know was the Service Director got in the car and moved it about 40 feet further into the garage, out of my view.  I approached the car and asked that it be moved back to where it had been.  My query was met with “You need to get out of this area now.”  I said that the car had been where it was so… and I was interrupted by the Service Director.  “Get out of the garage NOW.  I won’t say it again!”

I asked to see the Sales Manager since sales tends to have more pull in an organization than service.  In giving them an opportunity to redeem themselves, I told them that experiences like this will guarantee that I will not buy another car at this dealership.  They were completely uninterested in what I was saying and dismissed my comments and concerns without any further discussion.   

A short while later, I was asked to accompany Doug to the garage.  The car was up on the rack and the Service Director showed me where the 4’ piece of plastic was secured to the bottom of the car.  No courtesy had been extended to seeing the oil being added.  Nearly an hour after this process began, I was told the car was ready to go.  The Service Director showed me the oil on the dipstick was where it was supposed to be.  I asked him how that was possible when I had only brought 3.75 quarts of oil.  The Service Director was outraged.  “Did you tell someone you brought your own oil???”  Doug, the service writer confirmed that he had been told.  Had the Service Director listened a little bit instead of practically yelling “Get out of the garage NOW.  I won’t say it again!”, he would have known what was expected even if his own personnel did not tell him.  The car was taken back again.  While waiting, I looked over the paperwork for the first oil change.  I noticed on the paperwork that 5w20 was used.  Even the cap that must be removed to add oil says 0w20.  This is a minor issue, though it further demonstrates poor attention to detail; details that we pay them to observe.  I still was not allowed to see the oil put in the car.  If the car needs anything beyond the “free” oil changes, I will take it elsewhere.  I have no intention of spending even one more dime at this dealership, and I will advertise my experiences at Lone Star Toyota when the opportunity arises.  This kind of ‘service’ has earned my undying contempt, and it will not be rewarded by me or anyone in my circle of influence if I have anything to say about it.  There are plenty of options in the Metroplex where Toyota dealerships actually value their customers and would like to keep them happy in order to earn repeat business.  Lone Star Toyota of Lewisville clearly is not one of those dealerships.

13,"January 09, 2020","This Lone Star Toyota is the worst dealership you can experience!
I have 2007 Sienna minivan and wanted to fix the problem that I was having, plus engine oil change and the tire rotation. The service advisor, Robert advised that they will thoroughly diagnose ($150) the car before any work. FYI, I had 'check engine' light on and ABS/Brake lights were on, total of 3 lights. (Yeah, it has ran 178,000 miles, but not bad for 2007 model)
The problem that I had was ABS brake speed sensor which caused a transmission not shifting properly when it's cold in the morning. I told my service advisor, Robert, clearly that I want these issues to be fixed at the beginning. So he checked in my car and called me in the afternoon that what needs to be done..
1. ABS Wheel Speed Sensor Replacement: Passenger Front- ABS light: $552.18
2. Ignition - Pick-Up Coil: Check Engine Light- Replace one ignition coil and spark plugs- have to Remove intake manifold: $719.94
3. Engine oil & Tire rotation: $62.90

The Total: $1335.02 + tax= $1445.15

I asked multiple times that if those get fixed, I wouldn't have that shifting problem? and he confidently said, YES!! So I agreed and told him to 'Go Ahead'!

Then this guy called me next day and said, 'Hey, I have a bad news that you need ABS pump this time to fix this problem which would cost another $1700!' Totally unacceptable and very unprofessional !!
Why did I pay $150 for diagnose the car beforehand? Now he's telling me I'm getting the same condition car but I have to pay $1445.15 first no matter what...Then if you want to get it fixed completely, I need to pay another $1700 for ABS pump. 

So I sat down with the Service Director, Gary, and he refused to take care nor admit their lack of thorough inspection. Then he talked to me in to discount and xxxx, and he could reduce the price of $1700 to $1100.. WOW! How Generous this person is!! I refused to pay ABS Wheel Speed Sensor which was the main problem and he said he's going to put the old parts back in 2 hours, then I can pick it up.. LOL~ so unprofessional .. and he's been with Toyota with more than 36 years... how proud you are by ripping people off of the scam like this. Since I couldn't wait 2 hours, I told him, I'd be back tomorrow morning to pick it up. Then about an hour later, Robert called and left a voicemail that I have to bring CASH ONLY in order to take my car out.. What the fxxx?? Is this some kind of mom & pop shop?? or trying to get this cash in their pocket by work around the system?? 
I just wasted time and money for 2 days and will bite the bullet with driving with this shifting issue..

I like Toyota's reputation and reliability, it's known for decades... but employee who works for this great company ruins the reputation! I WILL NEVER GO TO THIS FXXKING DEALER AGAIN!! WILL LEAVE A REVIEW ON GOOGLE TOO! BE AWARE OF THIS SCAM DEALERxxxx!!",1.0
14,"January 07, 2020","Toyota Prius 2007 was submitted on Oct 24 for Display Clauster Card replacement for which Toyota Lewisville charged ~$850 including labor and tax.Car was returned 2 weeks after repair was done. In a week or 2 later, I noticed a full horizontal crack in left dashboard AC vent which was filled in by glue to hide the damage done while repairing the display cluster card, called toyota lewisvile service desk and complained to 'John' service rep , who claimed that he called me to inform about this glue fix and so did the glue fix- Obviuosly, I didnot understand that they have damaged something as this is not how he explained when he called and talked like it, he never mentioined the piece name 'Left AC dashboard vent' - I requested him to fix the damaged piece and I must get my car back like I gave them otehrwise other than the repair requested and paid for, When he didnot call back for a week as he was supposed to check with his manager and call back, I called back again and he informed that he has to give the message whatever his manager is sayign and he is sorry but his manager said, Toyota Lewisville will charge around 170 bucks to fix it as this is labor only. I sent a mail through Toyota Lewisville website marked for sending complaints and concerns & ofcourse noone never returned any message or mail on my complaint, very disappointed with this dealership to whom I have paid more than 4.5k alone in 2019 on repairs and have always been taking my car to them for any service needed. I certainly need some fair support ",1.4

16,"December 06, 2019",Worst dealership ever please don’t go hear. I recently went there in August to purchase a new vechile and I let them no my situation And they said they work with me.. Everything went smooth until Finance Manager Mitch Trimble  pocketed my money and asked my family to go liquor store for him. He said I had car long as gave him cash down payment. So after week he called and said he lost money and he have to put it back before dealership notice and he hold my deal until then . But I never received a copy of my contract. So he tells me if dealership calls ask me if already paid my down payment say yes. So next week I receive call from the  bank That approved me called and said they didn’t have all correct information bcus I switch jobs . So I call finance manager and he says don’t worry about it an to send my  new income and I find you new bank an keep car until. Month go by and I call finance manager to check status of deal and he plays like he don’t know anything  from previous conversation and says the dealer will file missing vechile report if I don’t bring car back and I told him well you told keep it until you find me a dealer . So then he calls says I can find you another when bring car up I then said no I want down payment back and I will go somewhere else. Me and my dad brought car back up to dealership and finance dodge us whole time sent salesman out and said call accounting for down payment money and I called and lady in accounting she don’t know anything. And reached out to salesman after that he claims he don’t anything. So finance manager Mitch Trimble kept my $1000 down payment. Please don’t go to dealership they play games and you will never get your down payment back if you change mind on purchase.,1.0
17,"December 02, 2019","Called me back to resign finance agreement and swindled me out of my rebate.  This was my 4th brand new Toyota that I purchased from a dealership and this was the worst experience I have had with any dealer.
Takes three hours to purchase a car and go through financing.  I purchased a Camry, financed through Toyota and got my daughter to sign docs so that we could get $500 rebate.  The salesperson said that Toyota would mail a check to us or reduce the loan.  I confirmed this twice.  Signed docs and drove off.
Two days later received a phone call from Finance rep and said they got me a lower interest rate - less monthly payment and everything else would be same.  Cool.  Go back to sign and drove off.
Two months later asked Toyota regarding my rebate and they said it was in the doc and applied to purchase.  I reviewed the agreement and they switched the amounts from the first doc to the second.  I should have reviewed again, but thought I would trust them since I have never had a bad experience before.  I guess my good luck ran out.

Called Toyota and they said dealer will call me back.  No one ever called.  Very upset and disappointed. 

I would suggest you go somewhere else and read and read and re-read before signing.

Good luck",1.2
18,"September 25, 2019","I was told my car needed brake service and filter replacement.  Something seemed off about this.  Waited over 1.5 hours, when I asked the service advisor, he said I should have known that brake service took 2 hours or more.  He also did not reply to any text messages, even though the automated service states that you can text or call your service advisor.  Finally got car back after 3 hour wait.  After paying for this, I went back to the person who did my 100,00 mile service 2 months ago (2000 miles ago).  Sure enough, there was documentation that the brake work and filter replacement was done then.  When I asked the Toyota manager about this he replied that they were lying to me about work performed, and stood by what was done today.  Said he could show me the brake pads (how would I know they came off my car?).   Another mechanic told my I was ""taken"" and should file a complaint. Bottom line, will never ever buy car from this dealership or use them for any service.",1.4

20,"August 15, 2019","I have never experienced such a bad dealership in my life. I wanted to lease a 2019 Toyota rav4,  I went there yesterday and gave them my clear expectation and the range I want to be in per month. After a certain negotiation we were both kind of agreed to that offer but since my car has not been sold yet so I told them that give me 24 hrs I will sell my previou6car and then will take the vehicle. I did this cause I already booked my car selling appointment with carvana. Now, today morning I got a call from toyota of Denton and they told me to come with my vehicle to see if they can beat the carvana offers. So, I went there and apprised my vehicle and they gave me pretty good offer and most importantly I wanted to get ot done right away so I accepted it. After that their inventory directory director came in and he started from the beginning even though he knew all the things i wanted to. Then again he started comming with the different prices and all those stuff and led us to run my credit, even thou6i told them give me an estimate that we both can manage. So, after a long hours wait they were not telling me the numbers,  infact, instead of that they put an inventory sticker and stock number of my car and were trying to apprise it without telling me the actual prize. So, when I denied,  then they called me and gave me a paper which was the buyer's certificate and asked me to sign of that. When I denied and asked for the price of that car then they showed me some paper that I signed about paying the price they were made up off. So my question is, i told you guys about my range and i didn't want to apprise my car. You guys called me to come over and do the deal. So either make a communication within your salesperson and inventory or stop wasting ours time. Being a serious buyer I was always keeping my terms clear , if you cant do that, simply deny it. Do keep people wait for hours and hours , run their credit and make a fake promise. Its totally xxxx of an experience.  I would rather recommend toyota of denton.",1.0

38,"November 17, 2018","I purchased my 2009 Toyota Prius at this dealership, which was Toyota of Lewisville at that time.  I bought the car brand new, and it came with lifetime free oil changes.

When I brought the car in for its regular oil change service recently, I was informed I needed to bring in proof of sales that I had indeed bought the car at this dealership with that oil change free stated in the sales agreement.  I had never been required to do so.  They said people had defrauded them by claiming this free oil change service.  First, it should be on their records that I purchased the car there.  Secondly, their is a logo on my bumper that says ""Toyota of Lewisville"".  It was a hassle that I did not anticipate.  While I really like my Prius and plan to get another with my next new car purchase, I WILL NEVER EVER USE THIS DEALERSHIP FOR ANYTHING AGAIN.  Several months ago, this dealership cleaned house with all its Service Techs, and the two Techs which I had always dealt with, were no longer there.  One so-called service tech came out and said he had been there for about three years, but was new in Service department and all he knew how to write up was for oil changes.

They tried to charge her $100 and accused her of having pets in her car and said there was pet hair all over the car. She tried to explain that she did not have pets in the car and did no such thing. She told them she may have had cat hair on her clothes but that would have been limited to the driver's seat. They did not charge the $100 but told her she could not rent cars from them. We called to complain to the service mgr. Matt, and he was not going to change his mind and didn't care that she could have been telling the truth. We will NEVER use this dealership again.

A year ago my daughter's Toyota was stolen and we decided to take it here for the repair because that is where we purchased the car originally.

We assumed this was done correctly but two months ago the car was stolen again using the key the thief had from the first time.  When my daughter took it back to them they said they would make it right but when it came to get the car they wanted to collect another deductible to fix what they should have done right the first time.  They hide behind the excuse that they were not there a year ago and that the insurance company somehow didn't specify to rekey the new cylinders to a different key (not sure how more clear than replace all cylinders and keys you have to be).

He said I needed these services (without ever inspecting my vehicle) at a total cost of $459.85. I challenged him to find in my owners' manual where such ""requirement"" existed and it is not there. Only ""inspection"" is recommended periodically. When he perpetuated his lie to me and would not admit his error, I asked to see the ""manager.""

I was told twice that the paintless dent repaired company had taken my truck off the lot to repair at their warehouse. My truck never left the dealership.  The dealership did give me a vehicle to drive while my truck was supposedly being repaired but the dealership requested me to drive the loaned vehicle back in to trade out vehicles several times.

We got an internet quote and asked to come in. We were determined of the price and the market condition. Upon negotiation, the manager himself admitted on a price but we were 500 down but decided to do walk out as he wasn't caring us much. But being reluctant to come another day, we decided to make the same deal for the amount he agreed. Now he turns his deal stating that he no longer gives that price and asked us to pay 500 more now. We found his unethical business by not sticking to his words and decided to leave again. This time the sales person blocked us from our car steps and promised to make the deal for the earlier agreed amount. We were unhappy with the manager but thought to finish it off. Then it's GM turn to play his role. He tried to brainwash stating we are under loss for this price, my manager did a mistake by admitting that price, please do for 350 more. Since GM itself came over, we agreed to make that deal.

Now we got to know the trap this unethical GM made. He sent his sales man saying that car is sold so he will get another after 10 days but said every feature would match. I had a doubt, so asked for the earlier paperwork to be shown for comparison.

88,"November 01, 2016","I brought my daughter  to the dealership to purchase a used vehicle. The sales man was very accommodating showing us different cars.the last one we saw was a Infiniti G35, which the salesman said just came in and would need to be checked by the service department  to en sure that the car was mechanically sound. I paid for the car and had to wait an additional 2 days to pick it up. I called the salesman and he said hey had to change a sensor. Well a day later the car did on the highway and I had to have it towed to Firestone. I ended up paying for a sensor again, hoses, a battery and other items costing me $1500.  Now the engine light went on and now being told that the fuel pump is going.  This car is a lemon I've done nothing but put additional money into this car.  THESE issues should have been found by the dealership.  Now I know why their cars don't come with a warranty. I wouldn't recommend purchasing a used vehicle from this dealer

However, they didn't. They wouldn't negotiate on price, nor meet other negotiations and the manager lied to my face several times in regards to the value of my current vehicle and meeting other dealership promises. Well I traded it in, and purchased a new vehicle at another Toyota Dealer when the vehicle became readily available. Lastly, due to our sales associate's friendliness and good customer service, we decided to give them a third chance and  tried to assist a friend in purchasing a car there. I discussed on the phone that we would like to get their ""Lone star"" price as mentioned on their website and that they would drop the price once we knew that was the car for him.

I have decided not to purchase a new vehicle based on the bait and switch.  Lone Star dishonest and insulting.",1.0

Also, the Sales Associate had great customer service skills and did everything he could to help me purchase the car. In the end, I left with a nice car and a happy face. I am very pleased with the car and I hope to drive it for as long as I drove my previous Toyota Camry - almost 11 years. Thank you Xavier for all your help and patience! ",5.0
159,"September 10, 2015","I had totaled my previous car so I went looking. Actually went to a competing dealership and was not helped.  We drove less then a minute down the road and getting out of the car, Derek Song came and met us.  We told him what we were looking for in a car, he brought one out to test drive, and the next thing I knew I was driving home in my new Rav4.  From the start (getting to the dealership) and to the finish (driving my new car home), it took a little less than two hours.  Derek was easy to talk too, upfront and personal.  Financing was a breeze and the car was cleaned up and ready to go.

I can't say enough how easy the experience was and I would recommend everyone to give Derek and Lone Star Toyota a try.

161,"August 22, 2015","Last month I had a great experience at Lone Star in Lewisville.  I am putting this same review on several sites because of the great experience I had with this dealer.  I would rather share positive than negative experiences because a lot of time the review sites are full of people that are quick to complain but slow to praise.

After finding the car through the USAA Buying Service, I called the dealership and was put through to Jordan.  One of the pictures showed a couple of what looked like were big holes in the car and I wanted to confirm if they were holes.  Spencer thought that the ""holes"" were actually bird poop.  He want out to check and then called me in 10 minutes.  Luckily it was in fact bird poop.
 
My wife and son went over to test drive the car.  They loved the car and my wife said that Jordan was the first car person that she dealt with in our search that was pleasant and took care of her.  I talked to Jordan and asked him to arrange the paperwork for us to come back later that evening.
 
Jordan was waiting for us as we walked through the door and I took a quick test drive.  Really liked the car but there appeared to be a scratch that ran all along the right side of the car across 4 body panels.  I pointed it out and Jordan looked at it and said it wasn't deep and could easily be buffed.  I asked if they would buff it and he said that he would put it on the ""We owe you"" list but would check to see if anybody could do it that night.  While we were in with Spencer Davis finishing finance Jordan had the scratch buffed out and it was perfect.  Jordan escorted us to Spencer's office and was waiting for us with the keys when we were done with Spencer.  
 
When we drove off the lot we noticed one of the little orange bulbs on the front headlamp was out.  We returned and Jordan was with another customer but came over to me, let me show him the light, and assured me that it would be replaced.  Another handshake and we were gone.  I knew that I didn't need to take a picture or get it in writing because Jordan said he would take care of it.….(fast forward 2 weekends - my wife took the car back to the dealer and the light was fixed with a smile in less than 5 minutes)
 
I saw a lot of courtesy from the employees at the dealership…doors opened, polite hellos, letting my wife proceed first up the stairs, etc.  But I have to say that the service Jordan provided was second to none.  A lot of dealerships advertise that they will take care of you, but I felt that Jordan was truly committed to helping us pick the right car and then efficiently steer us through the process.  I don't think you could ask for a better salesperson - he listens, doesn't pressure, and just is an all around pleasant guy to deal with.  Spencer in Finance was very good as well.  He got us in and out quickly, had a good sense of humor about his name, and was pleasant to deal with.

The dealership is comfortable, looks new and has a lot of technology for the customers.  At the end of the day it's the people that provide the values and foundation of a dealership and my hats are off to the people of Lone Star Toyota!

163,"August 04, 2015","I have tried twice in the last 8 months to buy a car from this dealership.  In both instances, the folks in the showroom were very nice -- friendly, let me take a test drive, etc.  In both instances, I followed up by phone and email to ask a question about the car I was interested in.  But in both instances I never got a response!   The first time, the GM even sent me an email a couple days after my visit to ask if the salesperson had treated me well.  I replied promptly, telling him yes but that I was waiting on the answer to a question.  Silence.  The second time, the salesperson told me by phone he'd gotten my email but had been very busy.  Then he didn't follow up again.   So I bought my car elsewhere.   Ironically, the dealership's service department has been sending me ads about having my car serviced there.   If the dealership is having its emails screened by a third party (I know most of the ""Chat"" online features go to a third party), it should make sure that there is follow-up because I would never ever recommend this dealership based on my two experiences.",2.4
164,"August 03, 2015","For a cash-strapped, frazzled mom of 5, there is just no other way to buy a car!  Once I narrowed down my choice of car, desired options and maximum budget including my trade-in; I went to work searching for my dream car online in Tulsa and surrounding areas.  Our local dealerships either didn't have the Mazda5 I wanted or it was outside my budget.  Soon, my search expanded  to TX and KS!

After emailing the dealership about my car, Collin quickly returned my email with an introduction video, the complete trade-in service details and another video in which he answered all of my questions and inspected the car as if he were buying and not selling it.  Collin went above and beyond (did his job where others could not) to make a new customer.  

After a short bidding war with a KS dealership, I was off to Lewisville, TX to meet Collin McAdams face to face and prayed all the way that he would deliver what he promised.  I was dreading the interface with the car ""salesman"" behind the emails, but was greeted instead with a charismatic, fanny-pack wearing internet sales-geek!  Collin was super friendly, confident in his description of my car and prepared to get me back on the road quickly.",5.0

166,"July 13, 2015","I just had a 105K oil change service  an hour ago, before I bring in my car everything was OK - it was just a routine ""oil change"". The check engine, VSC and TRAC OFF is NOT lit ON it is ""OFF"", but after the oil change service all of this is warning is now lit ""ON"" on my dashboard. 
I did ask why so??? The answer was ""oh we have not done anything to cause that"" - I get that, I understand that because it was just a routine oil change right??? But the fact of the matter is, it was not there before the service, and after the service it was there now. Another fact is that the car was last ""touch"" by the Toyota Service, isn't it that at least as a courtesy, Toyota Service should at least check it out if it is a legit problem or not .... remember and take note, it was not there before they did anything on my car.
But yes they will do the diagnostics and check it out, but with a price attached to it - a diagnosis fee of $99. It just doesn't sit well on me, kind of unacceptable - it was not there in the 1st place before I came in, and after the service magically now there and can't explain why.
Lets do the analogy and reverse the situation, let say the dealership loan me a replacement car, beforehand it is being checked and guaranteed everything is OK even extra check if there is dents and, then I returned the car with a small dent - let say it was not the same after I returned it. I can not say, ""oh I didn't know what happen, maybe somebody cause"" at the very least I think I will be responsible for it, and most likely it will cost me.
But why not on this case, it wasn't there beforehand anyway.
I spend a lot of money for a service on my car since I bought it, from 5K service now to 105K, but recently I just do the oil change. It is not my fault that I had a lifetime oil free change - it was offer when I bought this car. And don't get me wrong - the car was really great had no major problem since I bought it.
But sometimes I got a feeling that since I had lifetime oil free change, I feel like the service department wants me to spend more for the service and this is one way of doing it.
Intentional or not, but this is what I feel right now and seems like what it turns out to be, the way just happen right now.
I am not sure if writing this review will do me good in the future, because for sure I will be coming back for 110K and beyond oil change service, but I am hoping the ""Lone Star of Toyota Lewisville"" will not take this review personally - just a disappointing service today (July 13, 2015).
I am hoping the dealership will do something about it and improve how you guys do your service.

167,"July 10, 2015","Test drove Corolla on Tuesday; told salesman very interested but needed to return next day so spouse could test drive as well.  Started falling apart Wed. morning.  First, receptionist called me that morning to say she was sorry we had decided not to buy and wanting to know what they could have done differently.  Had to explain we were planning on returning.  Tried calling salesman's cell-he said he would be there Wed.-but he sounded pretty out of it.  Eventually determined he had oral surgery, wasn't working, and was confused.  Understand if he was out, but absence wasn't handled well.  When we arrived new salesman was never able to find the keys to the first car I'd driven before.  Took more time to find keys to any other vehicle.  We spent at least fifteen minutes standing outside in the parking lot (in July) without being invited to wait inside; granted, we could have walked in, but I wanted to see how long it would take for him to offer.  Salesman said a certain feature wasn't available on LE model (it was) and that my specific (commonplace) interior and exterior color choice combination would need to be special ordered and that it would take 60 days.  Tried to call dealership later for another question, and receptionist did not know who the salesman was; took a while to find him.  We initially told salesman we would buy Nissan instead, but after realizing we were choosing Nissan based on Lewisville's service we decided to at least try Toyota of Plano.  LE model did have the extra feature and our specific color choice was on the lot.  We drove it home the same day.  If Lewisville can't close a sale even though I liked the product and would accept the price, something is wrong.  It also made us question whether their subsequent service would be so sloppy-a key reason we left.

Relatives had almost identical experience in Lewisville 4 years ago.  Salesman had trouble finding keys to showroom model.  Eventually found keys and the car wouldn't start.  They actually jumpstarted the car in front of the customers.  That's when my relative saw the ""new"" showroom model had 5000 miles on it.  They (including a manager) tried to talk him into buying that one even though he was clear he wanted a new one; they didn't seem interested in selling a new one anymore.  High pressure sales on someone far too experienced in business to fall for it.  He drove to Toyota of Plano and had a good experience.  Knowing this story, I only tried Lewisville due to location, but I should have driven to Plano first.

One last thing-I had left a minor personal item in the car we test drove on Wed. (my fault).  I went by Lewisville on Thursday to ask about it.  No one could find the key to the car we had driven.  After 15 minutes of waiting I decided it wasn't important enough to wait for.  While I was waiting I heard two salesmen telling receptionist they were going on break and I saw one other one sitting with their back to the entrance, playing on their cell phone the entire time.  No one ever actually let us into the car to look for the item under the seat; I was told all the salespersons were with customers.

To be fair, both salesmen were friendly, but I think training was an issue.  Don't know what might have happened if first salesman had been there on Wed.  Dealership only getting a ""2"" since the price was good (Plano matched it)",2.4

203,"January 08, 2015","We recently visited Toyota of Lewisville and had an extremely disappointing experience. My husband and I were shopping for a new 2014 Avalon XLE or XLE Premium. We were in Lewisville, TX and decided to visit the dealership and we met one of your car salesmen, Jack Mitchell. During the initial conversation, we told Jack that we were looking for an Avalon XLE with either a white or black exterior with an almond interior, and we also briefly inquired about an Avalon XLE that was on the floor which met our preference of a black exterior combined with an almond interior.  Jack did not acknowledge our interest in the Avalon model on the sales floor, instead he hurried to get the keys to another vehicle. On his way out to bring the car over, he advised my husband that he found ‘OUR’ car, and my husband asked about the color, and while walking away from us, he stated ‘You will see when I bring it over.’ 

To our surprise and disappointment, Jack brought over a grey colored Avalon XLE Premium with black interior, which was close to being the opposite of what our stated preference was. We also advised Jack that the car that he brought for us to see was not within our price point, and we would not want to pay that amount for a car that did not even meet our preference.  At that point, Jack asked for the first time in our interaction with him what our price point was, and we advised that our price point was around $28,500.  Immediately, Jack got noticeably agitated and said to us twice, “WHY WOULD YOU INSULT ME LIKE THAT?”  My husband and I were taken aback by having such a rude comment and reaction directed to us.  Although we felt insulted, we attempted to continue our conversation with Jack as we were extremely interested in the black Avalon with almond interior that was on the floor and would have been willing to consider raising our price point to a negotiable amount.  However, Jack was not even willing to speak with us anymore, and discouragingly said he did not have any idea what the price was for the Avalon on the floor.  We proceeded to advise Jack of the rates in the DFW metroplex that we had found for 2014 XLE Avalons, and Jack became even more agitated and said to us “WELL, GO AHEAD AND GO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEIR DEALS”!  At that point, we were thoroughly insulted by Jack, his tone, his behavior and reaction.  We forgot at that point that Jack had given us his card earlier, and we asked Jack for his name as we forgot it, and Jack responded “IT DOESN’T MATTER AT THIS POINT.”  

I cannot imagine that I would have come across such a disrespectful and unprofessional person as Jack.  Both my husband and I are professionals who work with highly recognized global firms, and to have experienced such misconduct from a brand that is highly respected was most appalling, disappointing and simply unacceptable.  My husband and I decided to report this incident to the dealership management the day after visiting the dealership, and we spoke to Rebecca Robinson.  We requested the email ID of the General Manager from Rebecca, and instead of Rebecca providing this information, she sent us an email stating that her Sales Manager wanted to speak to us and if we could call him. We attempted to call the Sales Manager, Tom Vodicka, twice and never received a call back from him.  Please note, we also never received the email ID of the General Manager.

Needless to say, we are beyond disappointed with the customer service experience and how our issue has been handled from everyone we have had interaction with at your dealership.  Is this the level of professionalism that is expected from your dealership?  Is this an acceptable method of conducting business at your dealership?  We have had positive experiences in the past at other dealerships, and because of this we currently are the owners of two Camry SE vehicles, and throughout our family, we drive Toyota vehicles.  Toyota is known worldwide as a respected brand with the highest level of service and quality, and I can undoubtedly state that your dealership is most definitely the worse that I have ever visited and not a true representation of the Toyota brand.  We will not be recommending this dealership to any of our friends and family, or to anyone reading this post.

You try to get the best price, but they have to make a living too.  Jack worked with us and was friendly throughout.  The finance officer was named Ermin Komic and he was a pleasure to deal with.  I told him what I wanted and what I didn't want, right up front, and he honored my situation totally.  He was a pleasure to talk with.

Jack was professional from the start.  I shared the homework I had done on the Highlander so did not need a ""sales"" speech.  He approached me with wanting to understand exactly what was important to me on the Highlander so he could find one at the price I needed.  After listening to me, Jack came back with Tom ONCE (none of the back & forth) and provided me a fair, reasonable price that I took.

Seriously, 5 people to help me find a car.  While each had a specific role, it gave me a sense of cattle being herded at a sale barn.

The service has always been top-notch; repairs are performed correctly the first time, on-time, and explained in a professional manner.  And the service representatives have always treated me as an intelligent customer.  For more extensive repairs, the dealership provides loaners for free.  Other nearby dealers do not provide such a service.

This week was a first: I purchased a new vehicle from this dealership.  My sales representative was Harry Cross.  Harry is the first car salesman I've ever met who made me feel like he was my advocate in selecting a vehicle and trying to get a fair price (which I did).  Over the course of several visits, while I was gathering information on cars, he never pressured me to ""make a sale"", but rather was a fountain of information about the vehicles themselves.  He was very friendly, and very low-key with his follow-up.  When It came time to actually work through the sales process, he remained friendly and low-pressure.  I highly recommend Harry as the sales person you should try to work with if you intend to buy a Toyota from this dealership.

The financial representative who served me with my new car purchase was Dustin Moore, a very pleasant, energetic, and efficient fellow.

253,"March 26, 2014","Dear Mr. Brennan,

Thank you to you and Mark Gonzales for, again, making my buying experience a good one.

We have been customers of Mark's for several years, beginning with the purchase of a preowned vehicle for my oldest daughter. That was a major purchase because her car had been totaled and she needed a vehicle to get to work and to school. This happened at a time in our lives when our personal business failed (2010) and we were not able to help her out financially or even use our names/ credit to help her get into a working reliable vehicle.  She was a student at Texas A&M and was working her way through school without any help from us. It was a very stressful time for her and for me. Mark put us at ease and you could just feel that it was his desire to find something that was reliable and affordable for her. He accomplished that and even today, it is a great vehicle. 

Last year, finally my youngest child gets his license and we needed a new vehicle for my husband so he could hand his 2003 Toyota truck down. That was hard for him because he loved that truck. Wow, he loves his new Tundra even more. Mark worked hard, knowing we were still on a budget. 

About 10 days ago, it was my turn (about time!). I had been driving a 2004 Toyota Sequoia for 10 years. I loved it. It kept my family safe and was absolutely always reliable. Thanks to Mark, for his guidance. He found a Camry Hybrid that I love. Going from 14 miles to the gallon to what looks like will be mid 30's, anyway, is definitely something I can get used to. I truly believe that Mark was almost as giddy as I was. That just makes you feel good. I had been in and out of your dealership for several months and Mark always made time for me… that was free. It may have cost him a buying customer. I don't know but I feel sure he knew that when we were ready we would come back. 

Please give Mark a pat on the back for not making me feel ""sold"" but making me feel ""cared for"". 

Your forever customer,

I met with Faisel  (I'm sorry if I mispelled his name) with the hopes of securing a loan to purchase the 2007 Dodge Ram 1500.  I had received a ""pre-approved message"" from Capital One (of which my current vehicle loan is with).  After driving the truck and also my soon to be son-in-law driving it, I decided to go forward with trying to get a loan.

Unfortunately we were not able to come together with a comfortable monthly loan payment so I had to turn down the offers.  But I wanted to commend the work that Faisel did trying to get this to work for my.  I have been to several dealerships trying to work on getting into a truck but NOT ONE of the other dealerships went to the lengths that this young man and your finance officer did to help me.  I am most appreciative of the effort.  My credit isn't that good but no at no time was I treated less than someone with a perfect credit score.  Your finance officer (Dustin / Justin?) was open and honest with me.  He was encouraging, explaining that I really needed to ""blow the old loan away"" and start over with a new loan to help my credit.
  
At this point I will continue to pay down on my loan on my present vehicle and in a couple of months perhaps your dealership will have a vehicle that I may be able to purchase.  

Thank you for having a dealership that treat customers as customers.",4.8

257,"March 15, 2014","I made an out of state purchase, via the internet with Toyota of Lewisville. This was my first purchase via the internet and was a very positive experience.  I must thank Jack Mitchell from Toyota of Lewisville for picking me from from DFW airport, taking me to the dealership.  The vehicle had been detailed, oil changed and tank full of gas in preparation for a long return home.  I have never experienced this level of customer service, professionalism, friendliness or attention to detail as I received from Toyota of Lewisville and Mr. Mitchell. 
I will be telling my friends of my great experience and hope they do business with this group.   I'll look forward to making future purchases here.  Again, thank you again.",4.8
258,"March 12, 2014","We recently purchased a 2014 Toyota 4Runner Limited fully loaded. Since the new owner of Toyota of Lewisville dealership purchased it, it is the difference of night and day.  My husband and I got an outstanding deal, plus they matched within $250 the trade-in Sam Pack Lewisville offered me on my 2010 Escape Limited.  Our Sales Professional Sam Mahdi was great to work with as was the General Sales Manager Mark Bedell.  Business Manager Angel Calix processed my financing which I was able to get 36 months “0%” interest and it went very smoothly and quickly as they knew I had a dinner to attend.  Bud had visited with Sam Mahdi a couple of times before just looking at the 4Runner and really likes him.
 
While we were there I noticed a military person who was there to purchase a vehicle also and Sam told us they like to hire our heroes.  If you go to their website you will they have it on the site.

On the 3rd Thursday of every month they have an Owners Seminar and dinner (and I understand it’s a really good BBQ dinner) 6:00 to 7:15 PM followed by an informational seminar about using your vehicles, service, the dealership, etc. which we plan to attend.
 
Just wanted to let you know what a great experience we had with Toyota of Lewisville because I know under the previous owner it did not have good reviews and service.  The new ownership and management have really changed the dealership into a wonderful car buying experience.

259,"March 08, 2014","I was in the market for an SUV, but I initially felt that the RAV4 would be beyond my budget for a lease. Jack Mitchell met us on the sidewalk upon arrival. He invited us in and after discussion of our needs he explained the lease options. He was very knowledgable of the products and services and we discussed various specific vehicles. His goal was to find the common ground that we were comfortable with on price, equipment and payments. Jack was able to complete a package that was near target of our payment budget and Manager Preston Biard was able to fine-tune our trade-in allowance and an adjustment that truly fit our needs. Dustin Moore put us greatly at ease in the financial portion of the transaction and was instrumental in discounting some additional extended coverage that did not exceed our budget.

The RAV4 is a terrific SUV (more roomy than the Honda CR-V, and a pleasure to drive. But, the joy of doing business with the professional, courteous, and caring staff was the most satisfying element of all. We were in and out driving the new RAV4 in 3 1/2 hours. 

A great experience!

261,"February 26, 2014","I went to Toyota of Lewisville at the end of November 2013 looking to trade in my old truck for a new, reliable vehicle.  I was nervous that I might get manipulated in negotiations as I am a single female and went alone.  I was nervous also because the vast majority of reviews I had read online about this place were horrible.  However, I am very pleased to report that I had a great experience which surpassed my expectations!  My sales rep, Steven Sylvas, made the process simple and painless and was a pleasure to work with.  He informed me that the dealership is under new management... I could tell as it was nothing like the horrible reviews.  The new dealership owner even introduced himself to me and personally took my trash (I had a muffin and soda while I waited).  I ended up trading in my truck for a leased brand new 2013 Toyota Rav4.  They handled and paid for the tax / title / license, and I paid nothing down but my first month's lease payment - which is under $200/month (for a 36-month lease).  Plus, as I am now saving $100/month in gas, my brand new SUV is actually costing me only $100/month (for what I am used to).  I was well taken care of and got a great deal!  This was an answer to prayer!",4.8
262,"February 26, 2014","I have been the proud owner of a Toyota Avalon for the past 7 years, which I bought at Toyota of Lewisville.  Every experience I've had at this dealership, from my initial purchase to all service visits have been extremely satisfying.  Whether under prior owners, or the new owners, I have always felt well taken care of and have always dealt with extremley professional, helpful, honest, professionals.  My most recent visit was no exception, on Feb. 15, 2014, to get my oil changed.   My Service Tech was Asian Craven that day, my first time to do business with her.  I have to say I was extremely impressed with her.  Just as I suspected, she came back to me in the very luxurious waiting room at TOL to let me know that my brake pads were getting to the low point, in need of replacement.  I knew I was about due for that and their inspection confirmed that.  There were also a couple of other items that were in need of attention.   Asian was very helpful in our discussions in determining which maintenance items were important (such as brake pads) and which were less critical and could wait.  I feel like she was very honest and professional; she even brought me print outs with photos of the repairs that my vehicle needed.  We made an appointment for the brake work and 1 other repair to be done on Monday.  I let her know that I might not be in at the crack of dawn on Monday and I would have to have a loaner car in order for me to leave my car there, and I was worried that if I was too late in the morning, all the loaner cars might be gone.  When I arrived Monday, I was pleased to see that Asian had saved keys for one of the loaners for me, to ensure that it would be available when I arrived.  A very nice touch!   She also did an excellent job of keeping me informed of the status of my vehicle while it was there, even calling me after working hours to let me know where we were in response to a message I had left for her.  I appreciated her thoroughness on my vehicle and her diligence in taking care of a customer.  This level of customer service is rare, but at Toyota of Lewisville, regardless of whom I've worked with over the last 7 years, whether the new owners or prior owners, I have always been treated with the utmost professionalism and the highest level of service and care.  I appreciate their commitment to the customer.  And I appreciate Asian Craven's level of professionalism and knowledge.  ",4.8

We have since been back due to some minor flaws with the vehicles, but have found all our needs were met by your Internal Service Advisor, Russell VanMeter, and his team.  I was initially disappointed with the notion of a new car requiring such immediate attention, and didn’t look forward to returning to wait in a dealership lobby where I anticipated being thought of as “just another number” now that the purchase was over.  However, Russ came and greeted me and made the service a very personable experience.  With his background and qualifications he assured me reasonable levels of effort and time frames for the jobs, and after that I knew things would go smoothly.  I have since called upon Russ for information and service requests, and each time he has given my needs consideration and immediate attention.  You have a superstar in your midst, and I encourage you to do what you can to keep him onboard as long as you can.

I had literally spoke to salesman at over 20 dealerships, and I can now fully understand why the joy of buying a new car is quickly replaced with disgust at the the car buying process, but if they treat every customer like I was dealt with, then I'm sure they will have a lot do satisfied customers.",5.0

She took the time to explain everything to me without showing frustration or arrogance, and made every effort to keep costs low and not upsale or push me to do work that wasn't absolutely necessary.

270,"February 01, 2014","2/11 Update to my review
I am glad to report that the top management of Toyota of Lewisville takes customer satisfaction seriously. Chris Brown the service director called me up and wanted to make things right. I went to the dealership and the GM Jack Brennan personally apologized for my experience and since I had already purchased a Toyota from another dealership, they gave me a service credit to use at their dealership. Both Jack and Chris are very personable and it was a great pleasure just talking to them. I hope their commitment to customer service and satisfaction starts to flood down to the sales floor. Yes, they have to run a business and make money but if they treat the customer right, more customers will come.


2/1 I hate working with dealerships and this experience shows why. I did everything on line, price was agreed on, then when I get to this dealership , they start playing games. Made me wait, another guy shows up and shows me a different price, then the guy who is supposed to be my consultant comes back with a better but still different price. All the while making me wait for nothing. They finally come back with the agreed on price but the ADVERTISED certification is now gone. The manager tells me they made a mistake. I decline, one saving point is that he did fill my tank for my trouble but the 2 hours wasted on an agreed on deal still upsets me and I won't ever go there again. STAY AWAY",5.0

Rene Isip was by no means the best, but things sometimes have a way of getting worse when switching hands.  With that said, Chris Brown (Service Director) went out of his way to extend an offer to me which no other dealerships service department could or would.

275,"January 27, 2014","I purchased a Toyota Highlander in 2006 from Toyota of Lewisville, so I was familiar with the dealership and service department.  I did not know they were under new ownership.  I first met with my sales person Jack Mitchell.  He was very professional, informative and very pleasant to talk to.  I knew exactly what I wanted and he found a vehicle that met my exact needs, a 2014 Toyota Highlander.  We test drove the vehicle on a Saturday and he answered all my questions.  I was not ready to purchase on Saturday but asked for a ""ballpark"" figure.  He did just that.  I told him that I was going to drive a 2013 Explorer.  I asked if I wanted to drive the Toyota 2014 Highlander home to test to see if it would park easily in my long driveway, only to have to sharply turn to get the car into the garage, and he said yes.  I drove the 2013 Explorer- it did not touch the smooth drive of the 2014 Highlander.  I called Jack and said I wanted to drive it to my house and test out all the ""perks"" on Monday.  They had it clean and ready with plenty of gas on Monday.  It fit perfect and an easy fit in my garage.  I loved all the features.  I knew the price I was willing to pay and not a penny more.  I was not in a hurry to purchase.  My 2006 ran just great, we were giving it to a friend when we decided to buy a new car so we could have waited another 9 months for the price to come down.  I gave my # to Jack.  He got the sales manager and GM involved but I got it for my price.  There really wasn't any back and forth on pricing.  I absolutely was willing to wait but am glad we were able to agree on a price.  Jack was never pushy!  He answered all my questions and spent plenty of time with me after the purchase on going over all the features that the SUV offered.  He got my cell connected via Bluetooth to the vehicle.  He always had a smile on his face and never tried to be intimidating or say some stupid sales hook that I am so familiar with.  I own a small company and have been in sales for 30 years!  He treated me like I treat my customers.  I have already referred the dealership and vehicle to a friend of mine.  I put a ""shoot out"" on facebook recommending Toyota of Lewisville and how pleased I was with the process.  Jack made it an effortless process.  He is a great asset to the dealership.  Angel, was the new Credit Manager.  I don't remember his last name but I really enjoyed working with him on the paperwork.

He showed us the used corolla we had found online but we weren't too fond of some hail damage on the vehicle.  He was so patient and showed us many more options online and in the lot.  It was FREEZING outside that day so I really appreciated his extra effort.  We were very hesitant to make a decision that day and told him we would be back the next day.  Saif made sure we met his manager before we left and set up an appointment for the next day-it was all very professional and not too pushy.  We shopped around at another Toyota dealership the next day because they had a pretty unbelievable deal listed on their website, this dealership turned out to be a mess! The manager of the used cars department was manipulative and lied to us several times.  We immediately left there refusing several persuasions to earn our business back after that manager ruined their chances.  We were frustrated with the whole experience but decided to stop by Lewisville and check out the car I had my eye on.  Saif was there as soon as we arrived and immediately got the keys to show us the car.  We were concerned about some scratches and he took it and ran it through the wash, I test drove it and really loved it.  He was really great throughout all the negotiations, but we were still a little concerned with the price.  He took the initiative to get a manager involved and we ended up finding a BRAND NEW 2014 Toyota Corolla that was in my price range.

We used to live in Lewisville area before 2006 and moved to Plano however Selena serviced my car in such super detailed that i just could not compare other Toyota dealers service against level she took care of our car problems. At that time both of our cars were Toyota. I kept bringing my cars for service to TOL because of her. We moved away from area and since 2008 my car did not need much service since i do not drive much. I was so glad to see Selena during my recent visit for repair need.
We have been having all major services and repair work done only with TOL with Selena being our service manager. Sometimes it takes time to drive in Lewisville traffic on 35 but it is well worth drive to have it done correctly

Selena has been always taking care of our cars like her own. She takes time to understand the issue and work with mechanic/technician to understand problem and correct it. Sometimes i just tell her that whatever she thinks is good for the car do it. I am so confident that i use her judgment rather than mine for repair decisions. I do not worry about any unncessary repairs or serivces when she is in charge of my car. I simply live it up to her.

Other trivial facts that helps: She honors most coupon requests form other toyotas when possible. Also getting loaner car is important for me since i live almost 40 miles away. 

Just recent experinece: Other Toyota service has advised me that i needed to replace read drum (i gave the service note from the other toyota to Selena) but she was able to work and resurface the drum. Just a small example but i will only buy Toyota as long as you Toyota hires such an ethical service managers.

She is an exceptional employee with great customer service friendly approach. She services my Toyota just like she would does her own car. Selena is trully an asset to Toyota of Lewisville.

Amazing customer service team you have and such an exceptional and incrediable customer service manager in Selena.

293,"December 20, 2013","On December 4, 2013 I went to Toyota after looking through their website to test drive this Mini I really wanted. Right away I was helped out by Saif who was friendly and eager to help. Not only did I get to test drive the car I wanted, he spent the time to answer ALL of my questions thoroughly  and helped me get a reasonable price through finance even with all the obstacles and hoops he jumped through to get the price I desired he was still happy to help. After explaining to him that even though it was a good deal I would  still have to talk to my dad to talk it all over, Saif offered to talk to my dad if he had any questions which really helped me out because it made it so much easier than having to remember everything and relay the message. He helped me through the weekend and at my Dad's and my convenience.  He was never pushy and I never felt rushed. I felted like I had plenty of time to think it over and was VERY pleased with the help, service, and deal that he gave me. When I finally got all the money together and financed the way I wanted it, I was finally getting my car and I was excited. He filled up the tank , moved other cars to bring me my new 2011 Mini Cooper while I signed the paper  but then it started sleeting. I didn't feel comfortable driving my new car in that weather and he let me keep it there and come back when the weather was better even though he had just done all of that to make sure I drove away in the car that day. I felt bad but he was more than happy to do it and was very understanding. He made everything easier on me no matter how hard it made it for him. I came back Dec 11, 2013, put down part of my down payment and drove away in my Mini and came back the 14th with my dad and paid the rest of it. I am pleased and appreciate everything Saif and the other employees did for me. I am thankful to Saif for being so helpful, nice, and understanding through this long process and when I hear someone needs help getting a car I will recommend Saif in a heart beat. Again I'm thankful for their time and help.

 I LOVE MY MINI!",5.0
294,"December 20, 2013","On Saturday December 14th, my fiance and I went to Orr Toyota since I saw online they were having a clearance sale on 2013 Toyota Tacomas. I had spoke with the general manager a day earlier and he told me they had plenty of Tacomas. I told him we were looking for a 4x4, TRD sport package, he said yes we have those too. When we got to their dealership we met with a salesman and told him what we were looking for. He went to get a truck, but they didn't have any 4x4s and they were going to have to get one from another dealership. When we started working out the deal they offered an extremely low deal on our trade-in. I had printed the trade-in values out from Kelly Blue Book, NADA, and Edmonds and showed him the copies. He brought in the used car manager and gave me a copy of the ""wholesale"" value of the car, and disregarded the ""trade-in"" values. We walked out.
We left there and went to Toyota of Lewisville. We met Warren Outlaw and told him what we were looing for. They didn't have a 2013, so he showed us a 2014 Tacoma, double cab TRD sport package. We test drove it and went in to workout the deal. He came back with a low trade-in as well. I pulled out my trade-in values papers and showed him that the trade-in values on a car in good condition was considerable more than their offer. Warren looked at the values and wrote them down on a pad and left. He came back in the room with a much higher offer and we accepted it.
Warren took the time to listen to us and worked for us at giving us a fair deal all the way around from the price of the truck to the trade in. He was courteous, friendly and explained everything in the process and went over the operation of all the equipment of the truck. We are going to refer my future father-in-law to Warren Outlaw and Toyota of Lewisville since he is considering buying a new Camry.

While deciding to buy the car, we started noticing how nice the Tundras were and needed a truck. We thought of getting them both but my wife prefers a vehicle with the Blind Monitoring system but the 2013s did not have it. Michael explain all the features of the 2013 Tundra and promise to us that the 2014s were coming soon and he could reserve one for us with the new Monitoring system. We waited and sure enough he called and we brought our Tundra home and love it. Michael is a stand up guy that means what he says and things could not have happened any better for us.

298,"December 18, 2013","First off, I never thought I would ever write a review, and if I did, it would not for a car dealership. However Toyota of Lewisville deserves every star that I rated them. I had been there before and had a bad experience, but thought I would give them one more shot.  I have never been so amazed. I actually asked right before I left and found out that they are under new ownership since August of this year. 

First impression, The dealership was immaculate, the employees were well dressed, and not the ""seedy car salesman  well dressed,"". It was refreshing and seemed to be a very high class operation.

I went to the dealership in my 2010 Tundra crewman and was shopping for a Prius.  They asked me 1 time and 1 time only if I wanted to trade in my current vehicle. I said no and that was that. Then I asked about the different Prius models and what would be the best fit for me. Never experienced this before. I have always been pushed to trade-in.

My sales person was intuitive and understood that I was there to buy a car, buy it at invoice price, and not B.S. with negotiations. After the initial handshake and pleasantries my salesman brought over the sales manager. The sales manager asked me what my top dollar would be for a 2013 PriusC4, he walked away 1 time came back and said if I financed through Toyota I had a new car. Today I drove away in my new 2013 PriusC4.  After I left I realized that the salesman and I both overlooked the fact the car did not have the home link system. This was an important feature to me.  I did not realize this until I was driving home and I got that pit in my stomach, feeling like I did not get what I paid for, it was going to be my fault for not checking before signing, and I would be out of luck.  I called my salesperson immediately and his exact words ""I am so sorry about that, bring it in and we can get that installed for you!""  I was dumbfounded. No screaming or yelling was necessary.  Again, they surpassed my expectations

I have bought 10 cars in my life, both new an used, and this was the least amount of drama I have ever experienced. Not to mention, all of my interactions with the employees at every level of the car buying experience felt transparent and honest (This is the truth believe it or not). The staff overall were all consummate professionals, not pushy, and they did not bombard me withe the usual "" I'm doing you a favor attitude.""  I would highly recommend this dealership to family and friends.

It's not every day you can leave in a brand new car, feel like you got a great deal, and not feel like you need a shower from all the B.S. 10 out of 10 experience.

- very satisfied costumer

P.S.

The sales manager had a very nice Toyota pen that had a stylus on the end of it for use on your tablet or iPhone. I asked if they had others and they didn't.  This was a sad day.  In the Christmas spirit, right before I drove off, he pursued me and gave me his pen. Truly a class act.

304,"October 20, 2013","First let me start by saying I moved to Lewisville from Pittsburgh in 2004.  My 1999 4Runner only had 25,000 - 35,000 miles at the time.  The first time I went in 2004 the service manager Rich was outstanding to work with along with Selena Coffman.  The main reason I choose this Toyota was for location and a loaner car provided while my car was in the shop.  My vehicle has only been serviced by Toyota of Lewisville  (ALL TOYOTA PARTS) except for Discount Tire for tires to this very day.  The reason I returned was because Selena was the service supervisor each visit.  Unfortunately Rich and Selena at one point no longer worked at TOYOTA of Lewisville (TOL), my visits then varied from okay to ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE  because of the people working there. It was lack of follow through from the staff that led to the frustration and negative experience.  My other car, 2012 Highlander was worked on for hail damage April 2012 (purchased brand new in October 2011), unfortunately it was a nightmare of service. Let me just say It took until end of July 2012 to get my car returned.  At one point my vehicle was the talk of the service area because of what happened while the vehicle was in TOL possession. 

Selena returned within the past year, a positive re-addition to Toyota of Lewisville and much needed to restore my confidence in them.  I took the Highlander in for an oil change/tire rotation yesterday.  I was a little confused at first because the oil change spot was blocked by trucks.  TOL changed their entire service procedure.  ALL vehicles get logged in by service supervisors each time.  This allows for customers to have access to  a much bigger waiting area, snack bar, wi-fi, and many other perks.  I feel NEW OWNERSHIP and Selena returning TOL is making a change for the better.  Selena has the right mindset when it comes to ""CUSTOMER SERVICE."" She provides you with all information upfront and will keep you informed about your vehicle if something changes.  I will continue to have my cars serviced by TOL, yesterday's visit was a little longer than normal but I understand when change takes place in any operation there are growing pains for continuous improvement.  I hope new management strives to always put the customer first in sales, service, and all other areas to let other see the changes I got to see yesterday.  ",5.0
305,"October 19, 2013","I want to send my gratitude to you and your employees for the wonderful way that i was treated when I came to look at the vehicle, which i ultimately purchased, on Friday, September 13, 2013. 

The scenario began Wednesday, September 11th, while looking on your website, which, by the way, was very easy to navigate, I found a vehicle that I liked.  I decided to telephone to inquire about it.  I was refereed to Stefan Walton and we discussed the vehicle I had seen on the web site, he answered all questions as courteously and completely as possible. I told him that everything sounded good but I couldn't drive down from Oklahoma City until my Dallas granddaughter was born very early Thursday morning. Later that morning, I called and asked for Stefan; his first words were, ""Has the baby been born?"" I replied, ""Yes, I am coming to Lewisville on Friday morning."" He said he would have the vehicle ready for me to test drive.  I was impressed that he remembered me.

My husband and I drove to Lewisville on Friday and arrived around 9:30 am.  I asked for Stefan who came and greeted us quickly and professionally.  He said that he needed to turn us over to Trevor, since that was his area of expertise.  Trevor was very informative, kid and respectful.  Before the test drive Trevor showed us everything about the inside of the Highlander. It was a lot of information to process but he was very patient and understanding with my questions.  He was very thorough with his answers and once on the road with the test drive he continued to answer any and all questions or concerns that I had.  I was impressed with the knowledge he had of the Highlander. 

The next step was the financial part and even though it is the ""dreaded"" part, Jennifer Luu made the process go smoothly and quickly.  

Finally, Trevor went out of his way to help get my new Highlander to my sons home, which is about five miles from the dealership. (My son could not make it to the dealership to drive my ""old"" vehicle due to the being at the hospital with his new baby.) My husband has Alzheimer's disease and therefore could not drive either vehicle.  This was such a help to me! I could go see my new granddaughter at the hospital without worrying about running back to the dealership later that day. 

Your whole team is made up of very professional people who are courteous, kind, thoughtful.  I could go on and on.  I can see why Toyota of Lewisville is a huge dealership; people love to purchase vehicles there! I have bragged to my Oklahoma friends and coworkers about how wonderful an experience I had purchasing my vehicle there.  I am sure that my son will also tell his friends and coworkers about your dealership.

306,"October 16, 2013","Amber gave me a quick quote on a battery as I pulled up and told her about the car's electrical problems. She explained the troubleshooting that the team would perform and the service department was able to diagnose the problem and replace the dead battery in less than thirty minutes (I arrived at 7:30 right after they opened). No line; no wait.

They were kind enough to offer my girlfriend a ride to work in their shuttle and called while enroute to tell me that we simply had to replace the battery and that it would be ready when I got back. 

My cashier, Natalie, was able to get me in and out in a flash, despite challenges with their new CC system.

The only thing resembling a complaint was that management wasn't able to exchange passing pleasantries or salutations when addressed directly. Must have been super busy. Totally minor hiccup as both Amber and Natalie were both well trained and professionally courteous.

All told, in and out within an hour and a half, only delayed by the drive to get girlfriend to work which was a great relief.

Mr. Brennan has stayed in constant contact, kept us informed who would be handling each step of the process, and everything was handled in exactly the manner and within the time frame promised.

310,"September 26, 2013","Yesterday, I had my Toyota RAV4 serviced at the Toyota Lewisville location. I have avoided going to any Toyota because of my low opinion that came from my last two experiences in Grapevine. The location in Grapevine was actually shocking to me (compared to my experience with a Toyota dealership in CA) because the service waiting area was small and crowded, with cheap office style seats sitting right next to one another, without room between them. The room was poorly ventilated, had old industrial carpet and was downright unattractive. Their idea of refreshments for their customers were two vending machines, one for drinks and one for snacks, in the same close, small area as customer seating. The machines made noise and emitted heat on a hot summer day with a weak air conditioning system.  Their restrooms were dirty and the door would not lock properly.

I took a chance and went to Toyota of Lewisville this time and I am very glad I did.  It was extremely clean, with shining floors and aesthetically pleasing decor. There were 2 waiting areas with comfortable couches, loveseats & chair seating, a separate work area, and a cafe area for refreshments. The music playing was at a comfortable level and I was able to do some work while I waited. My experience was a pleasant one and improved my opinion of Texas Toyota dealerships.

Sam knows all the ins and outs of the vehicles - and, he is capable of instructing the buyer (a skill in itself).

Great job Sam - I know you must treat all your customers well.  That has certainly been the case in my personal experience.

M.J. Karim has handled the financing aspect of my last two vehicles and he demonstrates a wonderful expertise - plus a compassion for the needs of the customer.

To keep the story short - I went to buy a Toyota Highlander and each time I visited, no one helped us.  We saw a vehicle online and stopped through and had the pleasure of meeting Caleb.  He was a used car sales person.  He greeted us and was extremely nice.  He showed us all the car options and just when I thought they did not have a car of interest he stated that a manager was driving a car that was for sale.  When he went to get the keys, the sales manager did not appear happy that he had to remove his items from the car.  We test drove it and really liked it.  Because of the price we wanted to see it side by side with a new vehicle.  Before we could even see them side by side, Tom wanted the keys to HIS car back and asked if we were buying the car that night.  Caleb kept his cool and continued with the sales process.  We decided we liked the limited - the one that Tom Baty was driving and wanted to get the numbers on the car.  When we went inside Tom Baty became EXTREMELY RUDE and BELLIGERENT!  My fiance was so upset by his actions, Caleb mentioned it to the Sales Director and as we were leaving, my fiance stopped to talk to the Sales Director.  i proceeded to my car and Tom was looking all around his vehicle as though something was missing or he could not find something.  As my fiance comes out to our car to leave, Tom comes up to our vehicle, I let down the window to see what he wanted and he asked us in a very NASTY tone if we had the keys to the car - the one we test drove.  We both replied, excuse me.  My fiance asked are you trying to accuse us of stealing the keys as though we wanted the steal the car - his reply was if you have the key!!!!!!  We were both PISSED!!!  My fiance got out of the car and they got into a very heated argument.  We were so upset that I called Toyota USA to file a complaint and spoke to the General Manager.  

Now with all that in mind - I am going to rewind to let you know that my fiance and I were there weeks ago as he was looking to buy a Avalon (which is bought from another retailer) but a very nice guy - Thomas Matthew  helped us and tried to sell us other vehicles.  I told him then that I would be back for my car really soon.   Caleb O was extremely nice and tried to help us.  We both had or have Toyota products (I had a Lexus up until a couple of years ago that I maintained and serviced at Sewell - they are fabulous.  They had our drivers license to test drive, we went in and filled out paper work to get $ details on the car - so Im sure on every security camera, and now being accused of taking the keys to the car - by the way the General Manager apologized and yes they have their car keys . . . . . . He offered to make a great deal to make up for the experience.  I instead paid a standard negotiated price with another dealer!!

Anyway - I still love the Highlander and am now the proud owner of one (not even 2 weeks later).

As I sat in the waiting room, I and the other customers waiting were asked if we wanted a bottle of water not just once but twice.

325,"January 22, 2013","We had been doing quite a bit of internet searching for our commuter car and had very bad experience thus far, until we experienced the support from Amanda at this dealership.  Buying a car over the internet exclusively (without physically seeing it or driving it) is ""unnatural"" but a reality of the world we live in today.  My wife had made many enquires to multiple dealers and we had everything from no response to multiple e-mail offers and counter-offers, but nothing worked out. We even got called constantly from other dealers trying to ""make a deal"".

Our experience with Amanda and this dealership was nothing like that at all.  We had provided her with our initial request for information and told her of our budget (as this was our commuter car).  She came back with an honest response telling us of the lowest price they could go and then provided us with some very viable options.  One option we had already noticed on their website and I had requested additional pictures of the car, as the website only had one.  Amanda quickly took the pictures and sent them to me within a hour.  We then decided to call her and work our deal over the phone.  

Amanda was wonderful as she remember our budget amount and verified that amount.  She told me she was not sure they could get to that price, but to let her go try and call me back.  She did and they were able to meet that budget amount.  We provided a deposit payment, via the phone, and she sent a e-mail with our agreed price, car and lot identification number.  I got on a plane that next morning and flew up to the Dallas and they were able to pick me up, take me to the dealership, and I spent no more than 40 mins there completing the sales paperwork (which was primarily ready).

The car was cleaned and ready to drive off the lot, which I did, and returned to Galveston.  The experience was extremely rewarding and I thank the good Lord we were able to meet up with Amanda and this dealership.",5.0

340,"August 31, 2012","Complaint Description:
Purchased a car that had repair issues prior to leaving the lot. My husband and I purchased a 2005 Toyota Avalon on 08/04/2012. During the test drive, I clearly stated to our salesman that the A/C was not cooling as I believe it should. He continued to comment that, due to the heat, it would take awhile to cool because the temparature being over 100. The car colled but not to degree I would expect being that the temperature was down to 68 degrees. Not even 15 days, the A/C was not working. Now granted, I purchased the car with no warranty but I would have gathered that being through a major dealership and them doing their due diligence through the inspection the cars go through and reconditioning surely I would be ok in purchasing the car. My husband felt led not to pursue the purchase but we a pushy salesman that kept trying to get a deal, and the ""need to have a car"" we went forward wiht the purchase. So I notified the dealership of whay happened and they had me bring the car in, they diagnosed it as having a hole in the condensor and this they would not repair because this is something that is accident related. The sales manager went as far as telling me to try to get it repaired by using my insurance for their rate of $800+ dollars not inclkuding tax. Anyhow, being that we could not afford this, i picked my car up and took it to another repair place for a second opinion and they are certified and the technician is a master tech that has worked on Lexus and Toyota for 20+ years. After looking it over it was found that not only did the condensor need replacing but so did the compressor because there was a leak that had to be ongoing for quite some time, before purchase that would have created this. So we have had to come out of pocket $1500+dollars in repairs for a car we have not had for even 30 days. This is insane, there is no way that due diligence was done on this car to ensure it was quailty leaving out the dar. I will never by from them again and I will tell everyone I know about this ecperience. This is a rip off.

Your Desired Resolution:
Unless they are reimbursing me, I don't see what can be done but to file this complaint to let other consumers what to expect. I wish I had read reviews on them before going to by and I could have avoided this all together. What a huge disappointment!

Test drove a second car and the silly car had no AC. Salesman didn't know it i told him to roll the window down this was going to be a hot test drive.  the car was a 2007 Rio with 36,000 miles and they were asking $8,000.  WOW!  that car new in 2007 sold for a little over $9,000.

Having a nice building does not mean they are the best.  Toyota of Lewisville lacks good management and honest pricing.  If you what to talk about how good your service department is.  Don't let a customer drive a car you offer for sale that has mechanical issues.

I was looking for an '07 Mazda3 for my daughter and saw an eBay auction from this dealer online for one. I went in and test drove it on my way home one evening and tried to make a deal. The sales manager and I were about $900 apart and I decided to think about it. Candice the marketing manager  called me a couple of days later to see if they could do anything to make the deal work and I told her I would raise my offer $500 and that I would come in to buy it if that was acceptable. She checked with the pre-owned sales manager Chris, called me back 5 minutes later and told me we had a deal. She even called back again a few minutes later and spoke to my wife and said Chris wanted to make sure we understood the $12,500 did not include tax and title, etc. and my wife told her we knew the tax and title, etc. was extra. By the time I got to the dealer an hour later, Chris the pre-owned sales manager told me that they could not sell the car to me at the $12,500 now, nor at the $12,900 they had countered with earlier that week, but only the full asking price of $13,433 and not a dollar less. I asked for an explanation and all he could say is we are loosing money at the asking price. I asked him why did you call me at home, solicit my best offer and accept it, and he had no real answer. This is not a ""no haggle price"" dealer by the way. The marketing manager Candice told me she was very sorry for what had happened, and said that her manager really had approved the deal, but for whatever reason the main sales manager Steve DeWitt was the one that had overriden that decision. I asked to meet with Steve and after explaining to him what had happened to me, all he would say is that they wouldn't sell the car for one dollar less than the asking price of $13,433. No apology, no acknowledgement that they had accepted the offer an hour ago and now changed their minds, just here is the real price, take it or leave it. I told him that deceptive wasn't a strong enough word for what they did and all he would say was that no employee was authorized to agree to an offer over the phone and he would not do anything to make it right. I finally told him in the privacy of his office that this was the kind of BS that makes people hate going to car dealerships and he asked me to leave for the one time use of the word BS, and that I was not being professional. Evidently their definition of professional behavior allows them to agree on an offer on the phone and then renig on it when you come in, but if you don't take it and go away happily, then you are the one that isn't being professional. 
This is the management of the dealership that lives up to the worst tactics that you hear about in the car business so stay away from Toyota of Lewisville if you don't like to be treated as I was.

My wife got a quote on a car over the phone from one of their sales associates. After the offer was made, she took our baby twin girls to the bank to get a cashier's check, and we drove 45 minutes to get to the dealership.

We show up, check in hand, and tell them exactly what we were told on the phone. They say, great, why don't you test drive the car before you buy it. And then, after my wife had driven the vehicle, they explain that they were NOT WILLING TO HONOR THE PRICE THEY OFFERED OVER THE PHONE!

And then the sales manager proceeded to lie through his teeth, claiming the sales associate who made the offer ""wasn't answering his phone"". But the guy who made the offer was clearly in the building--we were told as such by other employees.

This was a massively painful ordeal, shuttling our baby twins around to get a cashier's check and driving up to the dealership, and WE WASTED FOUR HOURS THAT I WISH WE COULD HAVE BACK.

These people DON'T SEEM TO CARE AT ALL that they wasted our time.

They don't care that what they're doing is UNETHICAL.

When my vehicle was returned to me, I heard a loud rumble from the engine, approaching the exit to the dealership parking lot.

They put the cap back on, cleaned off the engine and returned my car. As I drove off the lot, I continued to hear the loud rumble as the engine sounded like it was wheezing & sucking in air, and a plastic buzzing / grinding / vibration upon acceleration. I took the service manager for a drive and he confirmed my observations. They took my car back in. Hours later, it turns out, the tech hadn’t put on the engine air filter back on correctly, as the buzzing was from the filter (put on only half way) vibrating plastic on plastic, under the hood. In summary, I was charged $85 for parts & labor for the engine air filter and cabin filter (excluding oil change), intense aggravation, several hours lost of my valuable work time, and a crap job on what is a very simple and basic routine service.  When my car was returned to me the 3rd time, it appeared to be okay. I am hoping there was no engine damage from this dealership mistreatment of my vehicle.  At the very least, if there was any desire for building customer relationships, they would have offered me my money back to compensate for this mess (I did ask for this and was denied). I am extremely disappointed and terrified of the express lube operation. This is entirely unacceptable for high-priced dealership service.",1.6
361,"April 11, 2009","I was greeted when I entered the lot with a smile and a handshake. I was asked what type of car was I interested in and at that time I explained that I wanted an 09 Camry. He asked about what colors and features. I explained what accessories I wanted and we found a unit on the lot that worked for me. We took a test drive--it is a Camry after all and it had a smooth transmission.  
 
He explained gas mileage, features and after driving it for a while I came back and he gave me his business card.  I came back three days later and negotiated a reasonable price--less than MSRP--with all the accessories I wanted. 
 
The salesperson was friendly, non-aggressive and very helpful. I had an excellent experience.",4.6
362,"April 09, 2009","I'm a very cautious and meticulous person, and did my research in depth for the past 2 months about getting my new highlander. I don't know about the other guys at the place, but you cannot go wrong with Son. The guy gave me no run-arounds, and was the most inter-personal kid i had yet met. Both figuratively and literally, Son delivered me my ideal car/package! I couldn't be more pleased.",5.0
363,"April 06, 2009",Best buying experience I've ever had.  My salesman was very patient and professional.  I didn't feel pressured at all during the entire process.  The entire staff seemed to all be excited about working there and made me feel very welcome.  They have a deli there that has some great coffee.,5.0
364,"March 17, 2009","Don't come to this dealership. The manager in charge of the service department has a bad temper and he has given me and other customers a horrible attitude. He needs anger management classes. Also the rest of the people that work in service are rude, unfriendly, unhelpful and will try and swindle you if you aren't paying any attention. Stay away from this hole!!",1.0
365,"September 30, 2008","1. They are the most dishonest dealership I have ever done business with. They misrepresented facts about the vehicle and packages installed on the vehicle.
 
2. They changed the sale price on the vehicle when it went to financing.
 
3. They changed the contract, forged my name and resubmitted it to Toyota Financial.
 
Stay away as these guys are the scum of the earth.",1.0
366,"December 20, 2004","When I found this website one day before I visited the dealership, I felt pretty depressed as I was very likely to buy a 2005 Camry LE from this dealership if they did not play game with me. Luckily, the deal went smoothly.  Here is my story.We had two Honda for the past ten years and were interested to see how Toyota can compare with Honda. We first decided the 2005 Camry LE with silver color was our top choice. Then sent out a quote to all Toyota dealer within DFW area. Within one day, almost all dealerships returned emails, some with quote and some required more information. As we had a bad experience with a Honda salesperson who just could honor his quote when we arrived the Honda dealership, I specifically mentioned in my email: DON'T play game and give me the final price to drive out of door. I also did not like dealership bother me and left no real contact phone number. Still surprisingly I got a call from Steve McKoon at Toyota of Lewisville. Although I don't like to be disturbed, I was still appreciated his persistence. From my experience, this kind of salesperson is always pretty good as he/she can go extra mile to find out what customer want. After discussing with Steve what our expectation, he emailed the quote meeting our expectation a couple of hours latter. I am sorry I am not going to reveal this price as Toyota $1000 rebate may disappear and their price may change. I just don't want to give you a wrong expectation when you see my posting. But all I can tell you is the price was quite competitive in the market. My way to do business is if salesperson treats me well and I will bring him my business. The next day, my wife and I went to the dealership. To my surprise, the car we were interested had been parked in front of the door. After short test drive with Steve, we decided to buy the car and sign the contract. When Steve gave me the final price of the car, the real price was even a little bit lower than the price he quoted me. Usually we don't want to buy any additional option whenever we bought a new car. As he did such excellent job not to play game with us, we added a couple of unnecessary options to the car just to give back them some profit margin. From the time we drove in the dealership to the time we drove out with the brand new car, it took about one and half hours and we felt very happy with the whole transaction. Overall, here is my suggestion if you try to avoid painful hassle process to buy a new Toyota.1) Quote online via email. Always request final drive out price. You won't bother to contact the dealerships if they can not provide a good price.2) Know you exactly what you want and what you expectation. For most of people, it is always a bad idea to try to buy a new car without extensive research to know what's are standard and what's a good price.3) Go with standard options. 4) Finance through your credit union or bank. It will be long process if you decide to finance through dealership, not mention so many miserable stories from Dateline or 20/20.5) Bring your own calculator. Luckily, my math is good enough to calculate some key numbers just using my mind. 6) Make an appointment and always be on time. Every customer hates to see his/her salesperson to take care of two different customers at the same time. Finally, we felt good in our Camery purcharse experience and wish good luck to every one.",4.3
