 DO NOT DEAL WITH THIS DEALERSHIP!!!  
 SCAM.ARTIST.. MULTIPLE LEGAL ISSUES!  RUN",1.0
1,"May 29, 2019","This dealership is under multiple county & state investigations. DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THEM.
Literally, HUNDREDS of customers have not been given titles or license plates for purchased vehicles. Their Texas dealer license is up for renewal on 5-31-19 and I cannot imagine it being renewed.  Capital One Bank has filed a lawsuit against them.  Hyundai refuses to shut them down, so the state is certainly going to.  RUN AWAY.  ",1.0
2,"May 17, 2019","DO NOT BUY FROM THIS DEALER! Go somewhere else, anywhere else. Abysmal customer service and follow-up after the sale. Shorted me a key and owner’s manual on brand new Santa Fe. Had to drive from Austin to get key and still have not received owner’s manual. Have had car for 5 months with no license plates or registration. DMV has over 100 complaints about this dealer. Dealer has been featured in multiple local investigative reports for not issuing license plates, titles or registration for months or paying TTL on purchases. Dealership is being sold and they do not care about customers. Also, the Santa Fe broke down before 10k miles. It’s at another dealer having the engine replaced. BE WARNED! AVOID this dealer at all costs or it will cost you time and money.",1.0
3,"May 17, 2019","I was not asked for input about the vehicle as the service tech was trying to find out information about it. When waiting, I was not told the status. Upon completion, I did not receive records. I do not know what is next in the process.",1.3
4,"May 14, 2019",I have been with the Fenton Group for five years. I alway hear that you may me closing.  I my favorite Service Manager is gone.  Makes me very SAD!!,5.0
5,"May 07, 2019","Tim did an excellent job in helping us. Even though we did not have an appointment, Tim attended to us promptly. The repairs were made at reasonable cost. We have been with this dealership for 9 years and we will continue to do so.",5.0
6,"May 02, 2019","I had an appoint to have the oil changed in my car.  When I arrived, I had to go inside and find someone to help me.  I was told to wait in the waiting area, and that someone would come get me when it was finished.  The waiting room was very warm to the point of uncomfortable.  No service person came to let me know my car was ready, but I received a voicemail on my phone two hours later.  That really isn't good service.",2.6
7,"May 02, 2019","Brought car for oil/change and inspection.  Oil change completed in about 40 minutes.  It wasn't until i was about to pay i realized inspection wasn't done. Had to wait a little bit longer to complete inspections which i have to go back as the part department didn't have blade in- stock.      

My husband remind me , when i got home. I may have needed scheduled maintenance which wasn't even mentioned by the service advisor. ",2.4
8,"April 29, 2019","Went in to have an oil change was informed that the dealer did not have the specific oil for my car, and they would have it in a week or so. I called 2 weeks later to see if they had the oil in, and the service department said yes. I took my vehicle in on 4/17/19 for  an oil change and multi point inspection. After I pulled out from the dealership, I noticed I had a auto zone sticker in my window from the oil change, they did not put one of my Genesis caps back on my tire stem, one was very loose almost lost it was not screwed on good. I called back to the dealership (service), asked for a supervisor. The supervisor was not available left 3 messages no return call from anyone. I called service again and explained to the receptionist the problem and that the supervisor never reach out to me. She told me to come in and they would take of it, ( I explained to her in advance that I have the Genesis Wings Tire Stem Covers). I went in and unfortunately they did not have them and could not order them right now because finance would not release money or check to replace things, because the dealership was in the process of being sold and they were not ordering anymore supplies,. They were only using what they have in stock. They have lost items on your car while in service and will not replace it, that's unacceptable and not good customer service. I did not receive a multi point inspection sheet, according to Tim was because everything checked out good. I went back and pulled my previous multi point sheet from the previous service and it had a few things on it. I have not had any repairs, so how did it go from needing some repairs to everything and no repairs was made...… I don't trust their work and will never return.  Then after getting home to find out they are being sued, amongst others things ",1.4
9,"April 29, 2019",I wouldn't recommend this place to somebody that I didn't like very unprofessional people here lie constantly did some work on my car they did not do the work correctly and my wheel fell off behind the work  they did...gave me the runaround like they were going to take care of it ..... they didn't do xxxx had to get me a lawyer,1.0
10,"April 29, 2019","The Man That Had to come out to begin the inspection of the car was not a friendly person at all no customer service skills, once he returns to me in the waiting room to tell me the car the inspection he only tells me about the wiper blades is why it failed, i wasnt pleased with that answer so i got a little upset but not to disrespect him just disappointment on my behalf i replaced before winter, moving forward he hands the ladies at the desk the keys and paper work walks off as i ask if that was the only thing that caused it to fail, and tell them ill be back its already late in the evening so im needing to push it so i can get the tags, i come back he sends another man out to talk to me i tell the other man no he needs to come check the windshield blades so i can get the passed inspection and leave all to find out he never hooked the car up to the machine for the inspection so he is telling me to take a seat on the inside i asked why? then he tells me the truth that he didnt do the full inspection but before i left i was charged with no paper work that showed a failed inspection only paper work that said need wiper blades.....this is not how business is conducted anywhere on inspections had i not returned to your company i would have had no papers other than his hand writing stating i need wiper blades- now i can join teams with the news media in understanding exactly why they are putting this Mesquite location in the spotlight as they are the company has changed within just the services ive usesd in the past as this so i will find me another Fenton Hyundai Dealership to do my oil changes etc. not even sure if i can trust this location anymore i rather drive a distance than to be treated less than a customer whom attempts to get car repairs through the dealership because of wanting value!!!! In Ending My Review I Don't Have a Desire to speak to any manger supervisor or no-one in charge at this location that will only justify the wrong actions of this employee, because my job is customer service with millions of people daily because of my occupation i drive for the city so i know its not easy but we still must remain positive kind and respectful despite our encounter with the public this man didnt smile and wasnt friendly at all he in the wrong area to deal with customers Nice Day!!!

11,"April 24, 2019",I had to bring it back in for an inspection.  The first time I brought it in they did a software up date first and then couldn't do the inspection..  I always use Anibal for my service man.   I like his  personality and he knows his job.,3.6
12,"April 23, 2019",Everything was going fine until I wouldn't purchase  662.53 worth of work. I was told rotation would be free then I was almost charged 65.00 until I brought up that it came with my contract. No car wash offered... I Luv this dealership but this visit wasn't as smooth as it usually is. ,4.0
13,"April 22, 2019",Not good at all.he made me feel like I was not going to get my car look. And he didn't want to wait on me. He gave me the worst help I ever had at a car dealership.,1.0
14,"April 18, 2019","Called to make an appointment. Julie, who said she was the rental car manager, was rude and unfriendly. She argued about whether I qualified for a free rental due to 2 recalls, and finally agreed but told me I could not pick it up the night before and would have to wait until 8:00 the morning of my appointment.  When I arrived for the appointment no one knew I was coming and the friendly cashier and helpful service person had to scramble to accommodate me.  When Julie arrived she was curt and unfriendly and denied having spoken with me at all, pretending to be completely unaware.  It took 40 minutes to get me in a rental car. 

The work was done as promised and I received a phone call to let me know my car was ready. First time in 40 years of car service that my car was not washed. Check out was easy.  It was confusing to get an email the next day telling me my car was ready for pickup as I had already done so.

The grounds of the facility were overgrown, I never saw any sales people, and there were considerably fewer cars than usual.  The asphalt is cracked with grass growing through the cracks. It appears it is going out of business or else no one cares enough to take care of it.

This is my third new car purchased from this facility in the last decade and despite regular maintenance visits for all these years, only once have I had a positive experience with the service department. I live less than a mile away and that's the ONLY reason I return - but I'm done being treated like an annoyance and having to deal with people, such as Julie, who gives me an appointment but does not tell anyone else about it (two separate times now).",2.2
15,"April 15, 2019","I brought my car in for an oil change, tire rotation and repair of 2 tires with slow leaks. I told the service person that I was not able to get the tire pressure regulated in the 4 tires and it was driving me crazy. He told me they would take care of it, This took about an hour and when they were finished, I paid and left.. My receipt stated that the pressure on my tires were adjusted to the manufactures specification so I looked at the tire pressures and they stated one tire pressure was at 34, the other was at 36, the next one was at 37 and the last tire pressure was at 40! I'm not sure they even patched the two tires because nobody told me anything. I told them they had slow leaks.When I finally got to talk to somebody, he told me I could bring it back in but at the moment I was stuck in traffic on IH 635 and I didn't have time because I had taken off work to get this stuff done. I bought my car at Van Hyundai but I live in Garland so you were closer to me but the service was not good so I will have to go out of my way and look elsewhere.",1.8
16,"April 11, 2019","This is was not my first visit to the service center, however this was the first time I felt a bit underwhelmed. I am usually offered a car wash, but I wasn’t this last time. I am usually consulted about the status of my car (my tires, air filter exchange) but again this time no one took the effort to recommend any maintenance. Also, no food or water was available in the waiting room. I don’t expect a buffet, but at least have some bottled water available for your customers.",3.2
17,"April 10, 2019","I’ve been to this service center many times because it’s the only one in Mesquite that I am aware of. This time, the service was on time and completed in a timely manner. However, my car was not washed noer was it vacuumed, as every other time I’ve had service. Then 2 or 3 hours after I had left the dealership, I get a tet saying my car is ready. ",3.6
18,"April 09, 2019","Notice that my car is missing some pins around front bumper was told it not their responsibility, when I took my car in for oil change, brakes and turned rotors.  My bumper was not missing the pins when I came in feeling discourage and unhappy with Fenton.  ",3.4
19,"April 09, 2019",Took awhile to even be greeted by service tech. Received email service was complete and after 30 mins of receiving email technician finally came out. Have a maintenance program and was still charged for the air filter. ,1.0
20,"April 05, 2019",Went in for oil change; did not have any oil.  Had to go back a second time.  Waiting room needs serious update. The service was quick.  There were not many customers which made me think that something was going on with the dealership.,3.0
21,"April 03, 2019","This dealership has yet to send me my license plates, I have called, left voicemails and emailed several times with no response.  The sales people were ok, that's not the real issue, the problem I have is that I have been driving around with temp tags, on my 2nd set, and they have yet to let me know that my plates are ready or a time frame when they will be ready.  I should have done more research on my end, reviews on yelp, google and facebook complain about the same issue and customers are having to come out of pocket to avoid any negative repercussions.   ",1.0
22,"April 02, 2019","I am upset because nobody told me what work was performed on my vehicle, all i was told ""Vanessa, your car is ready you can pay here at the front.""  
When i went before i was given a summary how my battery was doing the tires everything and now oh yeah pay here and have a nice life. So I took my vehicle else where and they told me my tires are bad so guess what i will getting my tires and oil change from them. thanks for nothing",2.0
23,"April 01, 2019","Not as professional as before.Seemed to not be interested in taking care of the car. There was still grease pencil on the window. Car had not been washed, it was rainy, not vacuumed...no concern shown",2.8
24,"April 01, 2019","The office needs a paint job and a good floor scrubbing.  Otherwise, the experience was pleasant.  I still need some touch up repair and my license plates.  I do wonder when the oil was changed last.  I will get that checked when I come in for the plates.  If you would, have a talk with employees about being on their personal phone while with a customer or when customers can see and hear the entire video chat from another office.  Gary was very pleasant, happy and when he did not know the answer, he said so.  Tell the ice cream man to stop selling to Gary.  Tell Gary to not buy ice cream when he has a customer.  ",4.6
25,"March 30, 2019",This dealership is awful from Service to Sales. I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy. They don't do anything but LIE!!! Vehicles that suppose to be certified are not!!! DONT BUY A HYUNDAI NEVER!!!,1.0
26,"March 29, 2019","Stay far away from Fenton Hyundai!! I purchased a new car there five months ago. I still don't have the title and plates for that car. According to the investigator assigned to my case with the Texas DMV, there is now little chance that Fenton is going to provide the title and plates for my car or any of the other multiple complaints they've received. I have been advised that I will quite likely have to obtain a bonded title, which will cost $500+. They're hopeful I won't have to pay the sales tax again, but no one is sure about that. So bottom line is that I may be out in excess of $2000 more than what I've already paid to *finally* get the title and the license plates for this car. So be advised that if you buy a car here you will quite likely find yourself in the same situation.

32,"March 25, 2019","My daughter noticed that after she filled her tank the gauge registered only 1 quarter tank, so we took it in to be fixed.  Bless their hearts, the sensors are under the back seats, and her car always has so much trash in it, I'm sure it was not easy to dig out the back seats, but they did!!",4.4
33,"March 22, 2019","I made an appointment hoping to be priority. A few hours later, I finally get a confirmation the car is ready. Timeliness is not a strong priority for this shop. My visit before this was about 3-4 hours as well. If you plan on visiting, plan for at least half a day stay... ",3.6
34,"March 21, 2019","I made an appointment to have my radio fixed. When I arrived, I was told they were in a buy-out, could not order parts, so could not help me. Complete waste of my time. Go to Hyundai in Rockwall. Maybe they won’t suck. ",1.0

36,"March 20, 2019","First, I chose Leslie to be my service technician and some other guy checked me in. This is my 2nd time dealing with him and each time he has failed to come get me when the vehicle is ready. I saw my vehicle being pulled up and allowed him additional 5 minutes to work out paperwork. 20 minutes later, he never came! So, once again I asked Jessica, the lady up front to see if the vehicle is ready and it was!  If it’s not for a recall for my wife and I vehicle, we will have our vehicles serviced somewhere else. Jessica, the receptionist was very helpful!",2.8

38,"March 18, 2019",Always treated great at Fenton. Service is great with explaining detail to car and call in a timely manner. Anibal always takes good care of my needs for car issues and provides great customer service. Thanks! ,5.0
39,"March 16, 2019","Terrible service. I purchased my vehicle December 8th, and have yet to receive payment for my trade. I have left numerous voicemails with Vicente Vargas in finance trying to get the check to payoff my trade. Never calls back, I went up to the dealership and he didn’t even come out of his office to tell me what was going on with my loan, just sent the receptionist to give me the news that it might be a another week, possibly a month to get the money. Absolutely unreal. I called to talk to someone in accounting, then sent me to yet another voicemail for the Finance Director. Pretty sure I won’t hear from them either. I tried to walk out and not purchase the vehicle because the numbers weren’t lining up, they came running after me in the parking lot to make the deal. Well, time to finish your side Fenton, I did mine. I will NEVER purchase another vehicle from this dealership and I will make sure no one I know does either. After reading several reviews, I’m worried about getting my license plates as well. We’ll see how long that one takes.

Update: I received a call from Ryan and within 24 hours he had a check ready for me to pick up and apologized for the run around I was getting. I am very thankful for his hard work and speedy response to my concerns. If you want things done right, call Ryan. I do want to give credit to my salesman Jesse as well, I know this was not his fault and I appreciate his help and the time he took to make sure I loved my car before leaving the dealership. 

Updated #2: Here we are 3 months and week after I purchased my car and still no license plates. Also, my windshield leaks when it rains or I go through the car wash. I called and text Ryan Cannon who told me previously to only deal with him and have yet to hear back from February 23rd and yesterday, March 15th. When calling the location the phone just rings and goes to voicemail. Never will I recommend this dealership. There is no redemption even though I love my car and got an amazing deal.

41,"March 15, 2019","The dealership advertised a long bed truck which is what we were in the market for. That was one of the important factors in purchasing new vehicle. When my husband tried to load his motorcycle in his new truck, we realized that is is NOT a long bed after all. Dealer is not going to do anything about it. Make sure you look over the vehicle very carefully and NOT depend on the dealer or their advertisement. ",2.2
42,"March 12, 2019","Over the weekend my check engine light came on.  I called the shop that normally does my oil changes and was told the best thing to do was to go to a Hyundai dealership as they would be more helpful.  When I arrived I was told the process would be several hours so I decided to rent a car so I wasn't wasting a work day in a waiting room.  I received a call around 3 PM saying that they had found ""sludge"" in the engine and that I'd need to replace the engine for roughly $3600.  I was shocked as I was thinking whatever the issue was, it wouldn't be this bad as I wasn't having any engine problems nor was I hearing any knocking coming from the engine.  After much thought I decided to get a couple of second opinions.  The first mechanic that looked at it, popped my hood and said that there was no way anyone looked at my engine as there was a build of dust/dirt on the engine cover that was completed untouched and undisturbed.  He continued with his check and said my engine looked completely clean and found no sludge at all.  I took my car to a second auto shop and was told the same thing.  I find it hard to believe that 2, unbiased auto shops, also looking to make money would've said it was clean, if it wasn't.  I also find it hard to believe that anyone looked at my engine yet didn't disturb any dust or leave a smudge or a fingerprint.  Overall, I'm completely dissatisfied and offended.  I feel like they thought I'd be an easy woman to deceive and boy were they wrong.  I might not know much about cars but I know when I'm being taken advantage of.  I explained all of this to one of the service managers and instead of doing the right thing, he offers me a free oil change.  That tells me he knows exactly what's going on and wants to hold on to every penny made, whether legit or otherwise.  I will not be doing any additional business with this dealership.  Karma will bite you in the butt for this type of dishonesty.",1.8
43,"March 12, 2019",I had an appointment for an oil change and to have my transmission looked at. They also performed a recall service I knew nothing about. Everything went smoothly and they didn’t need to keep my car as long as they told me they would need to.,4.8

45,"March 11, 2019","The center console tray door was not closing and the upper tray cover assembly had to be replaced and required the removal of the center console.  The estimated repair time was 2-2.5 hours.  The actual time for the repair was 5 hours.  A loaner car was provided after 3 hours to allow me to make a meeting.

The repair appeared to go well with no issues until I later discovered the AUTO HOLD button was stuck and not operable.  I contacted Service to let them know.  They asked me to bring the car back and they would fix it.  Why was this not checked after completing the repair to make sure all console controls properly functioned?

I scheduled valet pick-up for the following week but later cancelled when I fixed the stuck button.  The trim between the shift lever and buttons had not been pushed down.  Once it snapped in place, the AUTO HOLD button functioned.",3.0
46,"March 11, 2019","As always, Anibal provided excellent customer service! We always try our best to schedule service appointments when Anibal is working.  Trust him completely! We hope the dealership understands how valuable and important employees such as Anibal are to us customers!!!!!!",5.0

Purchased vehicle on November 23, 2018. After my trade in was not paid off by my next payment due date (December 21, 2018) I checked my online account. It showed that a check with insufficient funds was submitted for my payoff and sent back to the dealership. I started calling the dealership. I could not get anyone that knew anything to call me back until I finally called and pressed the button to speak to sales. After a lengthy discussion I finally got proof that a cashier check was being mailed to my lender. Fast forward to March 4, 2019 and I have STILL not received my permanent plates, my title has not been filed for, and my sales tax has not been paid. I have been calling for weeks checking status and was assured they were just waiting for them to come back. According to the DMV as of today (3/4/2019) the dealership has not even filed for them yet.

On November 29, 2018, I traded in 2 cars and purchased an Ioniq.  It has now been almost 90 days and my trade ins have not been paid.  The GM even emailed copies of the checks that were dated December 7th!  Too bad those checks haven't been mailed.

Fenton sold my cars that I traded in within 2 - 3 weeks.  My friend used to work there.  I have pictures of them being driven off the lot.  Yet, Fenton still has not paid off the loans.

Mr. Wartley will not take my calls.  Mr. Walker, their controller, won't return my calls.

67,"February 17, 2019","BUYER BEWARE!! fenton Hyundai is selling cars and collecting money to pay the tax title and license fees but are not sending the money in!  They are selling the dealership and say the tt and l fees are in limbo.  They have done this to several customers and as of February 16, 2018, I do not have the registration or title to a 2018 Sonata I purchased there on November 17,, 2018.

I have called numerous times and have asked to speak to the title clerk, managers, and the General Manager, Patrick Davalos.  I have not received a single call back.  Read other reviews, others who bought cars from Fenton Hyundai are going through the same thing!

68,"February 14, 2019","1st issue: Would not honor the internet advertised price.  I ended up paying $2k more (talked them down from almost $4k more)

2nd issue: I was paying cash for the car because insurance paid to replace a totaled car and I was in the middle of refinancing my house and did not want to touch my credit.  They continued to pressure me to finance and kept changing the cash price.  At at least two points they tried to sneak credit check agreements into other paperwork.  

3rd issue: After leaving with the car, I discovered that one of the interior panels (over the passenger seat belt) was loose.  It had been fixed enough to not show on a walkaround and test drive, but the clips underneath were bent and it popped off after one day of driving.

Despite all of that, I would not have written this review.  I got the car I wanted and could afford and was just going to write them off as a shady used car dealer to avoid in the future.  But now, 5 months after my purchase, they still have not applied for my title or registration. I have tried calling and emailing the sales and finance people at the dealership, the corporate office (Morgan Payne who is in charge of titles, and her boss Vic Walker the controller) - no response from anyone, and I'm not able to get through to anyone other than receptionists.  The last person I talked to on the phone once I threatened to complain to the TxDMV explained that the dealer's accounts had been frozen since October and no titles had been applied for at all. So now, I've complained to the DMV and have to wait 15 business days for them to respond, and I MIGHT get a title and plates after that, or I might have to take them to court.  

Save yourself months of hassle - stay FAR, FAR away from this dealer. ",1.0

I should have done my homework before giving them my money. I bought a used Nissan in September 2018. It had 20k miles. The finance manager told me that as a condition of our loan, we had to buy the extended warranty. I called the bank the next morning to confirm this and of course, they can not and did not make the requirement, as it is illegal to do so. Shame on me for believing the ""professional."" I called the finance manager, Gerson Gamero and he said that he would send me the cancellation form. I never received it and I called and emailed until I did receive the cancellation form. I sent it back and he never cancelled it. My husband went up there this weekend and spoke to the new finance guy Robert Spivey (since the one we were dealing with no longer works there) and he said he would cancel it...except this is not the full refund that we were promised, it was for half prorated based on the date and mileage. I tried to cancel the warranty that was dishonestly forced on us from the morning after we purchased the car, but he processed it using this weekends date and mileage.
 In addition to all of this, the first finance guy told the car had never been in an accident and showed us the Carfax, which indicated that it had not been. We take it to the Fenton Nissan dealership when the engine light comes on and you guessed it....it has been in a FRONT END COLLISION. Texans work HARD for their money and deserve honesty!",1.0

84,"October 04, 2018"," - This was my sixth vehicle purchase and the only one that's been done brand new.  I would therefore think it should've been better than all the other used car purchase experiences, especially after informing the staff that I am active duty military.  I bought a Hyundai Sonata Hybrid while on deployment in Texas (I live in Montana) and drove it back.  
 - There was hassle at the dealership from the very beginning.  My husband and I got there and they literally COULDN'T FIND THE CAR.  I'm unfortunately not making this up.  We left, and had to return later.  Then there was the issue of pricing.  We worked with Larry Green, almost exclusively.  Not only was he not straightforward or clear in the details, but he kept changing them!  We finally got to finance, and Larry had made that guy look horrible by not doing his job and telling us what we were already supposed to know before getting that far.  We ended up leaving the dealership a SECOND TIME.  They later called me and confirmed that they would indeed honor a military discount and confirmed what the price would be, so we went back a THIRD TIME and finally purchased the car.  While the hassle at the dealership was incredibly annoying, it was nothing compared to what happened afterwards.
 - The dealership never sent the title to the state of Montana, so I still haven't been able to register the car.....over three months later.  I had to pay out of pocket for a secondary temporary plate, after the first expired, call the dealership and tell them how to do their job.  They explained that they'd be overnight mailing the title to the DMV as well as a reimbursement check to me.  I still haven't received that check....over 2 months later.  The very first oil change and tire rotation for the car was cut short because the car has locking lug nuts, and I was never given a key.  I called the dealership again and spoke with the manager, Larry Green, again.  He was incredibly rude and unprofessional, again.  In the end, he supposedly agreed to overnight mail me the locking lug nut key, as well as the reimbursement check I hadn't previously received.  That was over a month ago, and I still haven't received either.  I later reviewed my credit report to find that this guy farmed out my finance application to SIX additional creditors.  I specifically requested, and was approved for, in-house financing done through Hyundai but for some reason had to suffer SEVEN hard inquiries to my credit.

-Prices did not match online.
-rebates didn't match what was shown online.
-received just $500 for trade-in.
-nothing was straight forward, no straight answers on price ...only talked about car payments
-took 3 hours after I was already pre-approved 
-wanted a sunroof but they said it would cost more and never tried or attempted to show me the actual cost.
-I was asked for Gap insurance which I declined but secretly the loan officer added extended warranty.
-called to cancel the warranty and was passed on to 3 different people to be told I had to come in and could only talk to the loan officer.  I requested a manger and they responded they couldn't help.
-I arrived and was told to go to used cars to talk to the loan officer, by the time I drove to the next building he was in a sudden meeting and I waited for 1 hr on my lunch...only talk to him after I requested a manager. 
-he didn't want to point blame on the warranty but he could cancel and wanted me to email him to remind him to check up on it.
-2 weeks later I called the warranty company and nothing had been canceled so I emailed him about it and he said thanks for the reminder.  No apology. 
-I called the following day and was told I was charged a $50 cancellation fee on a warranty I never agreed and I also had to pay taxes on a loan amount that should have been thousands cheaper.
-6 days before my tags were due I called and talk to a unprofessional lady, no they haven't arrived.
-surprising 2 days later they arrived and I was told to pick them up, no offer to mail them
-I went to pick up my tags today, the lady was nice ...go to my car and an employee got out of a car he moved  and spit on the pavement...

Every time we tried to speak, they cut us off mid sentence and seemed like they didn’t care that we were trying to address our concerns... treating us like they thought we were ignorant. Secondly, they snuck in both a higher apr without letting us know and a $4000 warranty plan that we never agreed to/weren’t even notified of. BUNCH OF CROOKS!! We luckily caught both.

The salesmen printed off the ""we owe"" letter and i took it to the service manager and for 3 weeks after that he (William Walker) did this song and dance about no one following up with him about this and he would look into it.

I made an appointment with Park Place Mercedes and several days later, I dropped off the car with them, they gave me a loaner car, and the work begun. I informed them that Fenton cut me a check to cover the cost of the parts and labor. A few days later Mercedes contacted me back with how much the actual parts and labor cost, A difference of over $700. I took this info back to Fenton and spoke with Mike the new director who said that he would relay this info to William Walker and they would make it right. Spoke with William again the next day and he said he was never told of this. He said to give him a day and he would get back with me. Two days past and no call from Mr. Walker. I again went to the dealership and Mr. Walker said that he has a call out to Park Place service manager and is waiting to hear back. Absolutely did not believe him.

120,"November 05, 2017","I showed up to this dealership because it had the car make, model and year I was looking for.  I already had a letter of credit from my own financial institute and was ready to buy right then.  The gentlemen assigned to me was Camden Young, prior service Navy vet.  I'm a prior service Army vet so we immediately hit it off.  Camden disarmed my ""BS"" meter that many of us would usually show up with at any car dealership.  He was personable, candid and genuine, not trying to grease me or use any of the typical ""used car salesman"" (no pun intended) tactics or antics.  He simply listened to my situation, what I wanted from the deal and was authentic and compassionate in how he could assist.  My chief complaint was not with Camden but I wish whoever he had to go back and talk to that day would've listened to him half as attentively as he listened to me and I might not have had to drive around several other dealerships in Austin and Houston!  I knew I wanted a 2013 Civic EX for my daughter; after our first impression, chat and test drive, I knew I wanted THAT 2013 Civic EX.  Despite having some back and forth with the upper management holding out and wanting my financial business, Camden was the sole reason I called from another dealership's parking lot in Houston to try and close this deal with Fenton Hyundai in Mesquite, TX.  Veteran or not, if you see the car you want at this dealership, ask for Camden Young.  The guy is honest and genuine and will work through any issue to find the right solution for the customer.

138,"September 01, 2017","After a bait-and-switch at another dealership, I communicated with Fenton Hyundai repeatedly to ensure they had the vehicle I was interested in. Sure enough, it was there on my appointment day... or so I thought. Keeping my keys after evaluating my trade-in, the dealership kept me there past an appointment I had elsewhere. However, we reached a great deal on the car (hence the 1-star review), and I started the paperwork. Before heading to financing, I entered the car again. Upon opening the glove box, I discovered the folded window sticker; it was the only vehicle on the floor without one on the window (suspicious). I discovered it wasn't the vehicle I was promised. After voicing this, the dealership tried to evade the issue by sending me on another test drive (after it took 5 employees to jump the battery) and acting as if I was still going to purchase it. When I returned, the general manager implied that I was wrong and this vehicle had the package I requested. I showed him on Hyundai's own website that he was wrong and offered to produce the emails with all of my correspondence with them. He apologized and said they would look for another vehicle while I waited. Having been there for about 3 hours without lunch, I left and told them to contact me. They did the next day but wouldn't honor the same deal on the new car. Not only did they want me to pay more, but they wanted me to pay more than the additional features were worth (according to their own site). Even if they had honored the deal, how could I trust them to handle any future interactions with them (like service calls)? I will never do business here again.",2.3

The one I really wanted was in the showroom and Nick helped move that vehicle out of the showroom so that I could test drive it. He was no pressure sales. He was super polite, courteous and professional. He really helped me get the car I wanted at the price I wanted. Nick really took great care of me and I really do appreciate his amazing customer service! Vicente Vargas was the finance manager who processed my paperwork and he was super helpful too! He was also very professional, friendly and made the paperwork signing process an easy one. I'm very impressed by the level of customer service I received.

142,"August 09, 2017","I purchased a used car on 05/29/17 which needed some repairs/parts replaced based on just looking at the car. These items were included in their ""I owe you"" sheet. After purchasing the car it literally took 14 phone calls for them to order some of the parts and install them. The car had a few small dents which I was assured would be taken care of and still haven't. They refused to order one of the parts that the car needs. The biggest headache of all has been/still is getting the license plates/title of the car. It has 2 1/2 months and I am still waiting. They sold me the car without doing an inspection, which should have been done. When my temporary license plates were 2 weeks from expiring I called and talked to the sales manager, Will Schmidt, who said he would look into it and call me back. He never did, we spoke a few more times over the weeks and he ended every conversation like that but never called. I was able to speak to the title clerk at another dealership and she told me that the car needed to be brought back in for inspection, which I performed immediately. Now it has been 1 month and after many more calls I found out that the title clerk is no longer there, my application wasn't submitted until 10 days ago and yesterday it came back with some items missing.

202,"March 28, 2017",Enjoying the car and not really having to worry about different things needing too be fixed or looked at. Even though the price is out my range the car is worth it.

203,"March 26, 2017","The sales staff is friendly.  Unfortunately they don't keep their commitments and their service staff is way overworked so quality takes a hit.  Sales and service do not communicate effectively as one item (a rim on a new car) was ordered 3 times.. over a period of 2 months, still don't have it and now they question if it was originally promised.  Sad, as I really wanted to rate them high with my initial experience (Eric Summersett was great!)",2.4
204,"March 25, 2017","The car buying experience started out great as I was told that the car I wanted could be ordered and is currently on a ship headed to the states. A month later, we were told that the car desired was not available. We decided to continue with the sale and changed the major thing we liked about the car which was the outside color. 
We were told the car was available and we could get in two days. Almost a week later, and many calls to the salesman, we finally got to see and buy the car.  Not to mention the salesman left before providing us the required temporary car tags. 
We bought extra items that are to be installed by the local parts department. We were advised that we would get a call the next day once the salesman was able to schedule a time with the parts department. We have yet to get that call and the salesman will not return our call. 
I received a call from the front desk that my tags are now in (one month later) and we can come get them. That is great to know. Now when can we get the rest of the items we bought. And not to mention, we have other items we want to add and very unsure we will get them at this location. That will depend on the service from the parts department. 

Needless to say, be cautious when buying a car from this location unless you know you will not need to go back for any follow ups. The top priority for a particular salesperson is to get the sale and move on. This is not the usual reaction after getting a brand new car. I am used to the salesperson making an effort to keep my business by sending thank you letter, follow up calls, etc. ",2.0

213,"February 25, 2017","On Friday, February 17, 2017, I was shopping on line for a used vehicle for my family. We needed something bigger because we have foster children. I was able to find a 2016 Chrysler Town and Country Van on the Carfax website at Fenton Hyundai in Mesquite, TX. I called and spoke with a salesperson Edwin Hawkins. He confirmed that the price on Carfax of $18,700 was correct. After driving the vehicle, he called me back and said that it was in pristine condition. Being that we were going to drive 2 hours from Longview, TX to the dealership I wanted to confirm all of this. After my mother-in-law and wife got off of work we drove to the dealership. When we arrived at the dealership they advised us that Mr. Hawkins was busy with another customer and had us work with another salesman.
After checking our credit the dealership advised us that my credit or what we owed on our trade would increase our payment considerably. My mother-in-law agreed to sign on the deal by herself. While in the finance office I wasn’t able to stay with my mother-in-law due to helping my wife with our two tired 2-year-old foster children. I was able to be in the finance office long enough to hear the finance man John Davis say that he and several other employees of the Fenton Hyundai in Oklahoma were brought to Mesquite. He said the Oklahoma dealership was the number one Hyundai dealership in Oklahoma and they were brought to Mesquite to straighten out the Mesquite dealership.
On Saturday, February 18, 2017, my mother-in-law asked me to look over the paperwork on the deal. I looked at the 3 pages she received and first of all thought on a car deal that there should be more pages. The papers stated that the total amount financed was over $26,000. I thought this was more than it should be for a vehicle costing $18,700, even with tax, title, and license. We had nothing stating the actual price of the vehicle or any itemization of the charges.
That evening I called and spoke with the finance man. He stated that the price of the vehicle was over $21,000. I was connected with a Mr. Bustos and he told me that he would look into it and assured me that he would call me before he left that evening. 
On Monday, February 19, 2017, I called back and spoke with Phil the general sales manager, who I still don’t know his last name. After speaking with him he said I can’t speak with you due to privacy laws because your mother-in-law signed the papers. I questioned this because the staff of the dealership didn’t mind talking to me Saturday night. Phil stated that we could bring the vehicle back during this conversation. He also said that this deal didn’t make any money so he wasn’t willing to refinance with the $18,700 price. 
Later that same day I spoke with Phil again. As I was talking to him he handed over the phone to the manager that was working on Friday night when we bought the vehicle. I don’t remember his name. He stated to resolve this he would ask permission from his General Manager the next day and get us a $1500 check when he returns from being out of town. He said that Mr. Hawkins wasn’t there that day to verify if he told me the $18,700 price. 
After speaking with my mother-in-law, she wasn’t happy with the deal that he offered. She said that the $1500 wouldn’t change anything or change the price. She decided that she wanted to return the vehicle unless the dealership was willing to redo the deal at the $18,700 price. When I called the manager back that offered the $1500 deal. He said I thought this was settled and began to refuse to speak to me anymore. I said we are going to just bring the vehicle back. He said if you bring the vehicle back he would report it as a repo. He said he was going to let “corporate” speak to me.
I called Phil back and told him that after speaking to my mother-in-law we had decided to bring the vehicle back. Phil then told me that we couldn’t bring the vehicle back. I questioned him as to why he was telling me we couldn’t bring it back when he said earlier in the day that we could bring it back. Phil the general sales manager began to get frustrated and began to yell at me. He said that “I don’t care about this car deal. I will sell numerous other vehicles.” He also said during his rage, “I don’t know what kind of hillbilly math you use in that town where you’re from but your wrong.”
I finally spoke to the General Manager David Pattel on Wednesday, February 21, 2017. He said he’ll look into it and call me back. I finally spoke to him after calling him the next day when I didn’t receive a call back. He offered me a $1000 check and said that was what he was told that his staff had told him they offered me. I said no they offered me $1500. He said we can’t bring back the vehicle but we can come back and trade it in and get another vehicle. Why would we want to make another deal with this dealership when the first one went like it did? 
So, he is supposed to be sending someone with the check and paperwork this Monday or Tuesday. We are still not satisfied with this money. I feel that this is just hush money to make us drop this and not take it any further.

218,"January 26, 2017","I called to make an appointment in the afternoon for 7:30 am the next day. I arrived just before 8 and drove right in and a service writer was talking on the phone, and helped me after getting off. I told him about appointment for recall. The woman took the appointment said ""she don't know nothing about any recalls"" when I asked what the repair time 'might' be. I was listed on the appointment board hanging from the ceiling. I asked to speak to parts after making the appointment, as I have written service at a few dealerships, to make sure the part was available. The service writer was checking on recall and wondered what engine it had as that would matter for the recall. I know the VIN gives a person the engine size. After calling to check on it at 11:30, he wasn't 'available', and no one else could tell me if it was ready. After calling back to have someone else get in the Adams OS to check if parts or labor had been billed out, No one could tell me, which is no right and bad customer service. After calling back within thirty minutes to speak to service manager, he was 'in a meeting', my service writer called saying the recall was completed. After getting the car, and RO(repair order), I see that the RO was opened at 10:53 and ready at 12:27. I wonder why it took three hours to write/open the RO? Poor service!",2.2

230,"December 17, 2016","After buying 3 cars from this dealership and about to buy a 4th this spring (but NOT from here), I thought that they could fix their own  brand of cars. I have warning lights on the dashboard that they can't figure out why they are there and how to fix them. After being at the dealership for over 3 hours for an oil change, tire rotation and getting the warning lights taken care of, the next day they are still on after being assured that they would go off after a mile or two of driving. I called the service manager ( who assured me) after I got home, and then again this morning, and of course got NO return call. They don't know what to do and have chosen to ignore the problem. I had an appt. at 2:30 and was there at 2:05. I didn't leave there until nearly 6 PM. If a Hyundai dealership can't repair a Hyundai car and just gives up without doing whatever it takes to fix it then they shouldn't be in business. This car is under warranty and should have been fixed. When they were told it wasn't, I should have gotten a call back with a plan to get it taken care of.",1.4

252,"November 07, 2016","My wife and I purchased a 2014 Buick Regal from Fenton in Sept 2016. We have a warranty on the vehicle but they don't want to fix anything we keep getting the run around. Everyone wants to pass the buck. When we were in the finance office we were told we would receive our second set of keys once they received payment for the car via the bank, that's never happened. Since I've been told the key was ordered by 3 different people just to be told a fourth time that it hasn't happened. Second, we purchased a front bracket from the actual buick car lot in Garland. Buick wanted to charge us 60.00 to mount the bracket. I took the car back to Fenton to have it installed and was told to return the bracket and they would supply us with one. I returned the bracket to buick, as of today I still don't have a bracket on my car.  Third and most importantly, our vehicle is a standard transmission,  my wife and I both drive 18 wheelers well we have had issues with the clutch since day 2 we've taken the car back several times just for them to say we don't have a warranty that we have.  We've called, we've been there in person and still we get the run around. If your going to buy please go somewhere that appreciates and values their customers.  I feel like they ate waiting until the warranty goes out so they want have to fix anything and we'll be forced to buy another vehicle or come out of pocket for the expenses. Either way is just not right. I think you should treat people the way you want to be treated. But I guess that doesn't apply at Fenton. ",2.6

289,"August 25, 2016","We were greeted right away as they opened the door and had two cars available though I did request three. The salesman Terry Williams was super super nice along with the finance officer but the sales tower gent seemed to be kind but at the same time doing just what he needed to? I will say that it was a pretty good experience. I did leave the dealership with a incomplete feeling. Service is to be determined as I will need to contact them about routine maintenance and look at my owners manual a bit further. I am still questioning my finance rate as I was never notified about lower rate so that lowers my rating for the finance officer. I do not know if they are short staffed but the online communication could have been a bit better and more complete as I never received pricing and finance info when online? In this day and age of constant connection and fast passed life, we have become forced to live in. I find it vital for the online information to be complete as requested by a customer. This issue with lack of info almost lead me elsewhere. The online sales manager was super nice and I gave him the benefit of doubt as to why I did not receive much info. The reply that I received upon asking about why such lack of response was that he was tied up selling cars! So Fenton Hyundai if this is the truth then may I suggest making your online sale team a bit larger. 3.5 stars",4.3
290,"August 24, 2016","Keeping in mind that it's a dealership's job to get the best price they can from you, it wasn't that I didn't get a reasonable deal buying a car from these guys. It's that, at every opportunity, rather than say ""we won't take that deal"" or ""we will take that one,"" they would make something up about why they wouldn't match this or that dealership's price.  I don't mind that they won't match another dealer's price. No reason that they have to. But the lines they'd come up with about why rely on your knowing nothing about how dealers pay manufacturers for cars.   Our sales guy was just polite and responsive - it's always the 'sales manager in the back' who breaks the unfortunate news. I get it. Drive a tough deal if you need to -- I was an out of town customer so I didn't make it too hard on them. It's just tiring to be treated like you're an idiot.  Even that would just be a typical rather than bad experience but for the finance guy. I asked up front for one thing: please respect my time and don't pitch me on any extended warranty car care blah blah.  Not only did he ignore me and go on for some time about why their extended warranty was so great, he asked me to justify my decision not to buy it -- as if I owed him some justification.  Finally, they didn't give me a copy of my sales contract. When I wrote to them to ask for one, they sent over one page as part of the financing deal (not the sales contract) and then both the salesman and finance guys stopped answering emails. I guess ""attach file"" is too much to ask.  I'm glad I was an out of town customer - I wouldn't go back here for any reason.",2.0
291,"August 23, 2016","First things first: I hate buying cars.   I went with my husband to test drive the car he was interested in, a 2017 Hyundai Elantra. The representative, Larry Green, was informative, helpful, and polite, and he really listened to our questions so he could give thorough answers. The test drive was wonderful, and the financing part was so simple and straightforward that I didn't feel drained when it was all over. When my husband drove us home all I felt was jealousy that he had such a wonderful new automobile.  Did I mention that I hate buying cars?  Well, I liked this car and this experience so much that less than 24 hours later I contacted Larry and said I wanted to buy a car exactly like my husband's! He found another one on the lot that was set up the same way, took me on a test drive, got a fair trade-in price on my old car, and took care of me through the whole sale.  So...now I don't hate buying cars anymore. And as someone who has loathed the car purchasing experience for over 30 years now, that's a HUGE change of opinion. I've been recommending Fenton Hyundai and Larry Green to everyone, because they have turned me around on what to expect when purchasing a car. It was a pleasure!",5.0

I tried doing a approval for a loan and finding the car I wanted but ones I found something they went up on my interest rate and was trying to get me to pay a car note over $300 a month for something that was about 6 years old. I refused to pay that much. My oldest daughter told me about Kevin Beasley and mention he was really good.

My husband was straight forward and told Scott we wanted to know what Hyundai would offer us for the Sonata and that I wanted a Genesis.  At this point we were not looking to purchase a new car, the 2015 Genesis was fine with us.  Scott gathered our information and within 30 minutes or less had a deal that we could not refuse.  We received the full trade-in value for our 2012 Sonata and we drove off with a 2016 Genesis- AWD...DID I SAY FULLY LOADED!!!   The finance process went smoothly the deal was finalized just as Scott had told us, there were no hidden fees.

I have purchased vehicles from other dealerships in the past and did not have near the OUTSTANDING Customer Service as I have had with Absolute Hyundai.

Most salesmen are pushy and just want to try and make a sale but he wasn't like that at all. He was very patient with me and by time it was all said and done he found the perfect car (and color) for me!

After this news, I felt devastated, despondent and down-right disgusted. ""YET with God all things are possible,"" I remember these words vaguely as Kevin spoke them. At the dealership, I informed him of my situation and he went right to work.  Knowing my credit was poor, a current graduate and no money down, I still had my doubts.... HOWEVER he assured me once more that ""everything is alright."" My parents and I waited quite some time for the financial specialist to crunch the numbers, even then Kevin made my car buying experience pleasant, practical, and low pressure. Once the word came back, I received news that I was approved for a  2015 HYUNDAI ELANTRA SE w/ Sunroof, Bluetooth, rearview camera, gray in color and tinted windows!!! The only thing that I could do was to thank God (and Kevin) because as I stated previously I  had no money down and poor credit. For those who are apprehensive about buying a car with no down payment and poor credit; I'm a living testament that ""ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE"" if we walk by faith and not by sight. Thank you Kevin and the generous staff at Absolute Hyundai for making my dream of owning a new car come true. 

God bless you, KB! May God continue to bless you. ",5.0

Kevin Beasley assisted us and he was phenomenal! My husband was looking to get an Accent of Elantra. He test drove the Elantra, but this was only our second stop and we wanted to check out other types of cars. Matt and Kevin spoke to us about the dealership and gave us some background information, but we never felt pressured. Prior to Hyundai, we stopped at Kia. We looked around, but no one acknowledged us so we left. After Hyundai, we went to Chevrolet. That was a no. My husband stated that if he were to get a Chevy, it wouldn't be from that dealership. After Chevrolet, we went to Honda. They were actually cool, but not in our price range. Next, we went to Toyota. We liked the car and the price was good, but there was something about being ""pressured"" to purchase a car right then and there. Again, that was a no. I won't disclose the names of the other dealerships, but I will say that they weren't far from each other. 

It was getting late, but we went back to Absolute Hyundai. I wandered off looking at Mitsubishi while my husband waited for Kevin to finish helping another customer. We ended up purchasing a Mitsubishi Outlander. We didn't realize the two dealers were connected and Kevin was able to assist us with that purchase. He drove us around and we asked him some tough questions about Mitsubishi. His confidence gave us confidence, which was why we drove out that same evening in a new Outlander. Even though we had all our paperwork and ready to purchase a vehicle, we didn't think we'd get one the same day.

They were extremely patient with me as I test drove at least five different vehicle types from the Veloster to the car I bought. They also were patient when my wife test drove two different cars.

After my purchase, that concluded after closing hours on Saturday night, I decided to have tint installed on my car. I met them on a Tuesday, dropped my car off and they gave me a loaner for the duration. After the tint was done they delivered my car to my workplace...again, great service. That's not the end of it though. Upon delivery the salesperson handling my needs at the time, David ""DJ"" Jones, noticed the windshield had a few pockmarks on it. Instead of assuming it was my problem, he took my car back to the dealer and had the windshield completely replaced...all the while I stayed in the loaner car without disruption to my lifestyle or schedule.

I got my car back at the dealer, they went over any of my further questions about the features of the car and off I went...COMPLETELY satisfied with my purchase and my experience at Absolute Hyundai.

510,"April 27, 2013","Very unethical, dealership attempts to take advantage of people who have poor credit.

1. How do you tell someone they are approved for car and allow them to take the vehicle?
2. How do you not disclose that car was a demo?
3. How do you charge a new car price for a demo with over 6000 miles?

My daughter has some major credit issues, she selected this dealership because they state that can finance anyone.  She called and they told her that even with her credit score they could get her approved.  My daughter took her 2006 Mazda RX-8 which has some body damage to dealership as trade.   She selected a 2013 Sonata with a sticker price of 27K, they presented a deal where gave her 4K as a trade and selling the Hyundai for 25, they also told her they were giving her a 1000 rebate from the Hyundai Motor Corporation.  She was told that she had been approved and that she could take the car. and her payment would be around 563.  The dealership did not disclose that car had 6K miles, which mean this was not a new car.  When she called no one could give any type of explanation.  When she return to finalize the deal they told her she had only qualified for car with a payment of $450.  When she provided research on her trade and pointed out that they were not giving her a fair price and that based on research the Sonata should be discounted by several thousand for the mileage.  The Sales Manager came back with a deal where they were now giving her 5k on her car as-a trade in but the price of the car which the finance person acknowledged was demo was now $28000.  In addition they told her the bank was charging $1500 to process her loan.  When she asked for the loan company/bank name to verify they refused to give to her. At that point they got very ugly and told her they were done because she did not qualify for a 30k car and to take our business somewhere else.

After being rude and telling us to take our business somewhere else the sales guy had the nerve to call and ask us to turn around because he left his sun glasses in my daughter’s car.  If this was the last dealership in Texas I would walk before buy a car there.  I would not recommend this dealership to anyone.  They are about taking advantage of people especially people with poor credit scores and making the most profit because they think people cannot do research.

511,"April 23, 2013","To be honest I came to the dealership Saturday night to win a prize. I had received a promotional piece in the mail and can not turn down a freebie. I am very familiar with this dealership as I leased a Hyundai Elantra at this location Aug 2011. I was introduced to Kevin Beasley and he was so warm and inviting with no sales pressure. I did have a few questions about my current lease and he was very kind to take the time to answer those questions even though he had not sold me the car originally. As we talked more he told me there was a strong possibility I could trade up into the Sonata for the same lease payment. I have to be honest I did not think it could be done. I had originally wanted the Sonata when I came to the dealership in Aug 2011 but for the features I wanted it was simply out of my price range. Kevin explained how the 2013 Sonata now came with the feature I wanted most which was the heated seats and asked if we could run some numbers and just see what the options were. I agreed half hearty thinking there is no way. Within a few minutes the Sales Manager ( I believe his name was David) came, introduced himself and said sure enough he thought we could make it work. Kevin found the exact car I had wanted and we took it on a test drive. He showed me all the new features and benefits of the vehicle. He knows that vehicle well since he himself drives a Sonata! I am now the proud new owner of the 2013 Sonata! I could not be more pleased with the outcome.

513,"April 16, 2013","Last Tuesday  my husband talked me into trading in my Suzuki Forenza for a new 2013 Hyundai. I was very hesitant at first, as buying a new car is a very intimidating thing! Or at least that is what I thought BEFORE coming into contact with Kevin Beasley. He came in at 7:30pm, on his day off to meet with us. See, we had been referred to Kevin by one of our really close friends. 

When we arrived at Absolute Hyundai Kevin had the cars we wanted parked up at the front and ready to go. My husband wanted the 2013 Genesis and I wanted the 2013 Tuscon. We took the cars for test drives and during the rides Kevin explained all the features to us. He was very intersesting and informative but not overwhelming or over powering.

So, the fun part was over and it was time to talk about finances. Kevin promised us he would get us the best deal he could and he would work with the financial team to get us into our new cars. Normally the waiting period is horrible, but Kevin kept us engaged in conversation and being very hospitable. We got nervous waiting to see what deal they were going to come up with and I ended up with a 4% interest rate!

We ended up with a great deal and got our two new cars! We left around 10:15pm, talk about great customer service! They stayed open to get out car buying completed and no one looked annoyed or frustrated that they were there so long. This was such a great experience!

Because it was so late and the dealership had technically closed at 9:00pm we were offered to come back in to get the cars detailed to perfection! Friday we came in (since it had stormed so bad) and Kevin insisted on being there while we got our cars all beautified. 

Kevin sat down and went over both of our owner manuals and educated us on all the special features. My phone was dead at the time so I was not able to hook up blue tooth but he did get my husbands hooked up for him. And, I know if I were to come back in today that Kevin would hook  mine up for me as well. Because, that is just how awesome he is!

Even after we left the dealership Kevin has been in contact with my husband checking in on us to see how we were doing and how the cars were. I work in customer service so I take how I am treated very seriously. I can either be your best critic or worst nightmare. I expect exceptional customer service and that is what Kevin Beasley brings to Absolute Hyundai. 

This weekend my mother and I had to go in for her to provide her driver’s license, as she was a cosigner on my previous car and I even recommended him to a man who just walked off the streets!

Everyone we dealt with at Hyundai has been nothing but nice. And not just nice but honest, true and genuine. I will never use another car dealership and will refer all of my friends and family to Kevin Beasley.  God Bless Kevin Beasley!!!

Absolute Hyundai in Mesquite, is definitely dedicated to customer satifaction and doing the right thing when it comes to their customers. Kevin Beasley, is by far, the most personable and spirit filled salesman that I have ever encountered. He was up front, and made my car deal a very easy transaction.

516,"April 07, 2013","First of all I would like to thank God for Blessing us with a salesman like Kevin Beasley. We have been searching for a car for the last month or so but certain obstacles stood in our way. Second, I would tell you how we talk about how so important customer service is and that it can make or break a person/business. With that being said, we would like to say after some many years of dealing with salesmen this young man Kevin was one out of many that was the best. The first thing that we received from him is that he was up front from the start. Second, he informed us on the type of cars we were focused on as well as what others were available. And last but not least we were satisified (which meant the most to us) he even threw a couple of incentives in. I've also read several of the reviews/comments on Mr. Beasley. They sounded great but I am and always will be the type to experience things for myself which I did and people I promise by the way this young man talked, handle business an gave great customer service you won't go wrong with coming to see him if you want to purchase a car. What was funny is when we drove up a few salesmen were standing outside and said that they bet we were coming to see Mr. Beasley by the type of car we were driving (which we were) the guy told it to my husband as he got out of the car. So if the salesmen knows, then???? While in the dealership and even after we made it home I was telling my husband (which is also an Alumi of Mr. Beasley) that I really liked him and he seemed to be guinwine to me. The finally straw for me was when we were about to take the car home for the weekend just to get a feel of it Kevin stopped us and said the deal is ready and that the car was ours if we wanted. So we signed the contract and walked out of the door with a 2011, little down, a payment to fit our budget and very happy customers. Again we would truely like to Thank Mr. Beasley and Absolute Hyundai for the great customer service and for making us happy ""at the same dang time"". P.S. Please keep Kevin Beasley in mind when purchasing a car seeing for yourself is believing. I will definantly tell everyone that wants or ask me about our new car that Kevin is the go to guy.

518,"March 25, 2013","Kevin Beasley is the best! I never thought I would walk out of Hyundai with a brand new car that I absolutely LOVE!! He worked out the best deal he could for me and kept it real from the start. Kevin is a great dealer and a nice guy over all. He isn't all about just a sale or how much money he can get out of you, but about getting to know the Client and finding out what car is best for them. I know it was a blessing from God sending him my way helping me out the way he did. I have already referred him to some friends who are in need of a new car and will continue to do so. This was by far the best experience I've ever had at a car dealership and will continue to do business with Kevin in the future. Once again thank you Kevin!!!! Now picture me rolling in my brand new Elantra!! Whoooop Lol ",5.0
519,"March 18, 2013","My daughter, son-in-law and I had the pleasure of working with Kevin Beasley. Kevin is very professional, courteous, dedicated, persistent, patient, honest and knowledgeable. The best qualities a car salesman can have. Kevin took great care of my daughter and found the car that was right for her. The added bonus was that it was both her and my favorite color - blue. The entire experience was wonderful and it didn't take long at all. I will definitely recommend him to others who are seeking to purchase a vehicle. I have dealt with several other car dealerships in the past, but this was the best car buying experience I've had to date. ",5.0
520,"March 17, 2013","What can I say about the man who already has so many great reviews, except that they are very true!! I went to this car dealership today because I felt like my car was on its way out of commission. Kevin Beasley came to me very highly recommended, so I looked up his reviews. After seeing so many excellent reviews I decided to give him a try. I've bought cars before but I can definitely say this was the best experience I have ever had. The bonus was that I wasn't stuck there all day (one of the reasons I dread buying cays). What I love even more is that Kevin is a Chrisitian man and tries to carry himself as such. He was straightforward with me about everything and breaking things down for me to understand. I almost wasn't able to get a car, but if I tell you my God is Awesome!! The team at Absolute Hyundai worked so hard in esuring I didn't leave the same way I came. I went with the intention of getting a preowned vehicle but left with a brand new car. I would like to thank the gentleman who helped me and pray God shows them favor. I would definitely recommend this dealership and salesperson to everyone in the market for a vehicle. If you want to be around people who care more about great customer service than having money in their pockets, this is definitely the place for YOU!!!!!",5.0
521,"March 14, 2013","I walked out of my house on Monday 03-11-13, looked at my car in the drive way, and decided I could not put anymore money into repairing this vehicle.  I called Mr. Kevin Beasley ""The Magic Man"", and said I am on my way to get a new car. I arrived at Absolute Hyundai and received such courteous treatment.  I had no idea what car I was interested in, but Mr. Beasley took the time to have my car appraised, while he walked the lot with me to find out what I wanted. I told him all of the features I would like for the vehicle to have, and he certainly found something I liked.  There were a few issues that arose, and I have to admit I started to get a little discouraged.  After every great effort by the Absolute Hyundai team, I left on that day without a vehicle.  Mr. Beasley did not give up.  He called me the next morning and said "" I have an Idea"".  I returned to  the dealership and to my surprise ""The Magic Man"" had a vehicle the had every feature I wanted and I drove away with a new vehicle and a HUGE SMILE!  Thank you Kevin for not giving up, and thank you to Justin for all of your help.  I would recommend Absolute Hyundai to anyone looking to purchase a vehicle.  Just call ""The Magic Man"" Kevin Beasley.  To God be the Glory, Be blessed. ",5.0
522,"March 11, 2013","My credit was great and my bank gave me a 4% interest quote for a  car.  I have always bought cars I can pay cash for, so this was my first financed car purchase.  It is totally my fault for not having enough information when I walked into Absolute Hyundai, but I was sold a car with a deal that would match my banks offer.  Well the deal was so horrible that Absolute Hyundai shopped 10 banks for financing before they had a taker.  WOW !!!  10 Hard Inquiries on my credit.  Inquiries make up a significant 20% of your credit.  My own ignorance got me suckered into a horrible car deal, but they KNEW I already had my banks approval BUT made sure I didn’t take this to my bank to find out what a scam on the car was.   I NEVER KNEW until the next couple of days when notices for hard inquiries started being sent through my credit monitoring service.  Day 1 *Inquiry -ABSOLUT HYU, *Inquiry - FIFTH THIRD, Day 2 *Inquiry ABSOLUTE HYU (again!),  *Inquiry - FIFTH THIRD (Again!!),  *Inquiry - COAF,  *Inquiry - BMO HARRIS B, *Inquiry -WELLS FARGO DEALER SER, *Inquiry - CHASE AUTOMOTIVE FINAN, *Inquiry - CAPITAL ONE,  & *Inquiry - CAPITAL ONE COAF   This shouldn’t be legal,  and if anything else, I don’t think a reputable Dealer would make their customer the victim of such bad business practices that affect the customer so negatively.    ",2.0
523,"March 09, 2013","I arrived at Absolute Hyundai frustrated and exhausted, that is until I was greeted at my car by Kevin Beasley! He shook my hand and after listening to me rant and rave about how other local dealerships had treated a female customer, he assured me that Absolute Hyundai was going to be my last stop. Shortly after arriving, my father joined us and it was like I was in the company of family. Kevin was very professional, knowledgeable of the vehicle that were in stock. He kept us laughing while we waited for the finance department. It was a long wait, but I didn't care because it didn't feel like the usual car buying process. Kevin was there from beginning to the end. Our finance manager was also kind and knowledgable. While my father and I waited, I asked another Salesman how long Kevin had been employed with them, and he said about a year and a half! Really? Unbelievable!!!!!
Kevin is a wonderful asset to the dealership! As a female, dealers tend to fast talk us, give us the runaround, and we end up pissed and confused. Kevin took time to answer my questions and explain his answers! I felt like I was in total control and at ease. Kevin and the Absolute Hyundai family just added 2 new members, my father and I! I drove away with a cranberry colored 2013 Hyundai Tuson!!!!! Kevin even took my soroity plate (Order of Eastern Star) and put it on the front of my new vehicle!!! I will return for future purchases, but until then I would highly reccomend Kevin Beasley and Absolute Hyundai to my family, friends, and co-worker's!!!!!!",5.0
524,"February 04, 2013","It is hard to beat what has been said before in so many reviews about Kevin Beasley and the other key people at Absolute Hyundai in Mesquite. They are pros at this dealership.

First of all, I have been spoiled over the years having leased six consecutive Lexus vehicles at Sewell Lexus in Dallas. My 2013 CT Hybrid is the other car in the family. The people at this dealership treat me like royalty.
 
So, when my wife and I drove up to Absolute Hyundai we really didn't know what to expect. We wanted to look at the new Veloster to see if it lived up to the reviews it had received in the media. We were met by this smiling, well-dressed young man who greeted us warmly. He talked to us in his office and then showed us the line-up of Velosters in the lot. We test drove the Turbo, talked about colors. We then discussed price on a 36-month lease and eventually met with Kevin Lines, the new car manager and later drove the non-turbo home for the weekend to see if that model would work for us. On Monday, we returned to the dealership, told them we wanted the Turbo, found a red one and went inside to seal the deal. We met with Spencer Davis, the finance manager and Johnny Gomez, the service advisor before driving home happy and excited about our cool car. I have named it, ""Crouching Tiger"". The name is derived from a movie with this name in the title and, of course, it has an Asian theme. The car looks like it is in a launching mode, ready to attack the road, or that's how I see it.

Throughout the whole process we were handled in a very professional manner and never received any high-pressure sales tactics. The gentlemen we worked with are all ""good guys"" and radiated a feeling of honesty and conviction abut serving our needs. Our salesman, Kevin, has a wonderful sense of humor and is a joy to be with. You can't miss him, he alway wears a suit.

In summary, if you want to buy or lease a Hyundai automobile go to Absolute hyundai, ask for Kevin, Justin, Spencer and Johnny and you will come out with a great deal on a great car.

I saved the info on my laptop and I wasn't going to go in until after the new year. Well my father persuaded me to just go look on new year's eve and I did. It was truly an awesome experience! It was no pressure and great customer service. I had visited another dealership before Absolute and the salesman there didn't want to do a test drive due to the rain, so we left. I headed over to Absolute thinking the same thing but Kevin Beasley went out in the bad weather still to show me cars and even pulled one around for me to test drive and to top that off....I noticed he was sick! I received nothing but the best! I only went to look but I left there with my first new car...2013 Hyundai Elantra! Thank you Kevin!

Initially looking to purchase a cash car, unaware that I could have possibly financed for a new 2013 car at a reasonable price, Kevin guided me through the process with confidence in my abilities to make this investment in my automobile choice and a level of professionalism not to be surpassed! He was very personable, and I didn't feel like I was dealing with any sales person, but someone who was concerned about what would be the best and safest choice for a new car buyer traveling long distances across the nation.

533,"November 02, 2012","so this morning I posted a review and this is what I wrote
""Well since me and my wife (then Fiance) bought our new Hyundai Sonata hybrid about 3 months ago we have had issues with this dealer ship from the finance to the service department. We have had been called liers from the finance department to being charged for tire rotation and the tires not being rotated. Well Yesterday (11-1-12) I took the car in to get a part that broke replaced and oil changed got there at about 3:45 at about 4 a little after Tomi comes out and says it will be a couple of hours to replace the part this annoyed me because i made a appointment called the week prior to see how long it would take and then being a ase certified mechanic for years and looked at the part that was broke I knew it was not a 2 hour repair and mind you I live 45 miles away from this dealership so they do give me a rental car had to leave a 50 dollar deposit for it and I went home not even 45 minutes later im almost home Tomi calls and says your car is ready....really because just the part that had to be changed was going to be about 2 hurs not to mention the 15 minutes to change the oil ,now i had to drive all the way back to get my car so I didnt have to rearrange my schedule to go pick it up today and on top of that they tell me to bring the rental car back with the same amount of gas , so that cost me another 11 dollars to bring it back to the second bar past empty and 2 hours of my time. This dealership cant get paper work right...we have called and told them me and my wife got married changed her name everywhere and thy still call and ask for me with my wife's maiden name even after I signed everything that day with my name. When the part was ordered they I gave them my phone number yet they called my wife`s job and left a message there because they said they didnt have a good number for her, really they wrote my number on the service form when I came in. And then to add our Sonata will say service required on the dash so we go to myhyundai and it says a oil change is needed so we call blue link and they tell us its only as accurate as the info the dealer puts in so they arnt even keeping those records up to date. All not very significant stuff but when added up and time after time having to deal with this what i call I dont care attitude I think its time to do my own oil changes again and find a new dealership for warranty service. Did i mention this is the 5th Hyundai we bought from this dealership ""
About 10 this morning i was in a meeting got a call from absolute I couldnt answer and forgot my voice mail was not set up so they couldnt leave a message at 3:41 I get a call from absolute again and its Tomi, his words where you sent a email to my boss complaining about the name what name would you like on it. Really out of this whole complaint all you got was the part about the name no wonder why there service isnt that great. funny how they can find my number after reading my post but when the part came in and Tomi wrote my number on the order request they couldnt get in touch with is called my wifes job because that was the only contact number they had. I told Tomi if the general manager wants to call me back and discuss my experiences with his dealership then thats fine but they dont need to worry about the name because at this point they wont see any more business from us",2.0

As we were pulling into the parking lot Mr. Beasley was coming out the Door. He introduced himself and answered all questions we had and he was not pushy or when we told him we wanted to look around the lot. The Part that stood out most was his friendly personality and his knowledge of the cars and trucks. Needless to say My Brother Left with a New Car. As we were waiting to get insurance added to the new ride, Mr Beasley didnt complain or remind us that the dealership was closing he actually was telling us Jokes and feeding us snacks while we waited, And once we completed the process well into after hours he came out to the car and showed us all the features of the 2013 Sonata and Made sure My Brother was comfortable with his Purchase.

I felt that this other guy was trying to throw me into a used car, that 1) had too many miles... 2) a car that i didnt want... 3) a car whose payments were too high. Kevin told me... ""Dont worry about that. You are now at Absolute Hyundai... And you are in good hands. How can i help YOU get into a vehicle that YOU want?"" I told him i was looking to get a used car. He then asked... Have you ever thought about buying a new car? I was shocked by this question because i have NEVER bought a new car! While i was worried about my shortcomings. He told me... ""Thats not a problem! Lets look at your options."" And to make a long story short. I left Absolute Hyundai in a BRAND NEW 2013 HYUNDAI SONATA!!! Even a week later... Im STILL shocked!!!

Kevin was extremely knowledgeable about the cars and was able to give me insight that I could trust.

They worked with our schedules and I never felt rushed or pressured. (We ended up closing the deal over 2 days.) I feel that we were able to get the very best possible vehicle for us for the very best possible price. After we closed the sale, Kevin was extremely thorough at walking me through all the car's features, making sure that I understood how to do everything from connect my phone to set the clock.

546,"July 31, 2012","It was such a great pleasure to be able to walk into a dealership and not feel like I was just the next ""sale"" coming in the door.  Kevin Beasley is one of the most customer service-oriented, professional, caring, knowledgeable and most positive person that I have ever had the pleasure to meet. He goes the extra mile to make sure you feel right at home, and that your experience with Absolute Hyundai is ""absolutely"" a professional and positive one. This will be the third Hyundai (my sister, niece and I) have purchased from Kevin. My Elantra is absolutely gorgeous! I've only had her a little while, but she fits like a glove. When my other sister is ready for a new car, she already wants a Hyundai, just from hearing us rave about how professionally we were treated and how special we were made to feel. If Hyundai made a pick up truck, I'm sure my husband would buy his next truck from Kevin.  I've already recommended Kevin and Absolute Hyundai to three of my co-workers. I can't say enough nice things about this very caring and awesome individual.  Thank you again, Kevin for making our car buying experience such a pleasure and actually exciting and fun. 
Sincerely, Susan and Dennis Warters

555,"July 13, 2012","My wife and I bought an 2011 Hyundai Genesis, CPO w/ 23k miles from Absolute Hyundai in Mesquite, Tx on June 2, 2012.
1. Absolute Hyundai tried multiple times to back out of a price that was agreed upon price through the internet sales rep.
2. Sale tactics to include pressure, trying to make us feel guilty(the dealership is losing thousands of dollars on this deal / I hope I don't lose my job on Monday...), etc were used at the time of sale.
3. We arrived at 730pm for what was suppose to be a quick sale since we had already agreed upon the price but we didn’t leave until 1130pm!!!!!!!!!!! 
4. The cruise control didn't work on the way home...I'll get to why this is.
5. My wife and I woke up the next day to discover the car had leaked transmission fluid all over the garage. We had no way to prove we bought it with a transmission problem  so we had to make an insurance claim. I put up a bunch of bad reviews since the dealership wouldn’t respond to us. So finally the managing partner, Ray Monks, agreed to split the deductible with me, as well as FINALLY send me the 30 days temporary tag which they failed to give me at the time of sale and FINALLY mail me the Certified Inspection report. He asked me to remove the negative reviews, which I did. Email me and I'll send you a phone shot of Mr. Monks requesting that I remove the reviews  along with his personal cell phone number if you want it.
5. So I thought I just had bad luck because of the transmission pan. But guess what? That cruise control problem was because the car was WRECKED before we purchased it. It was the Smart Cruise Control module located on the passenger side behind the bumper( which had been removed and painted!!). I never noticed it because someone did a nice job, but the technician at Patterson Hyundai noticed it when the repair on the transmission pan.  In addition, the radar core(support bracket) was also damaged.
6. Absolute Hyundai wouldn’t help me so I contacted Hyundai Consumer affairs. The dealership I bought it from(Absolute) is saying that I wrecked the car. A different dealership, Patterson Hyundai(awesome people) where my car had resided for the past MONTH is saying there is no way I could have wrecked the car. So what does Hyundai Consumer Affairs do? Nothing because Absolute is saying it’s our fault. 
Why is it impossible that I wrecked the car? Well, I bought the car on Saturday at 1130pm!!! Drove it 2.5 hours to my home town, slept 8hrs, and had it towed the next morning due to the transmission pan leak, NOT the radiator problem(I didn’t know it had been wrecked yet) on Sunday at 12:30pm. So I would have had to  have found a body shop to remove the bumper, paint it, and replace in early morning hours of Sunday morning....are you kidding me.
Doesn’t make sense? Well I tried to condense 5 weeks so please feel free to email me at: Charles.connell@gmail.com if you would like to know more.

On both visits, we were assisted by Martin Rubio.  He was very friendly, very informative, and very helpful each time.  He did not pressure us nor did he rush us which we very much appreciated.  It was obvious that he knew Hyundais frontwards and backwards.  Martin was very courteous and made us feel welcome whether we bought the car or not.  I don't believe there was one additional thing he could have done to assist us that he did not do.

564,"July 01, 2012",We didn't get very far into the sales process. The people at the dealership were very courteous and friendly.  The only aspect that I would caution folks is that they add a protection package and tint to all their vehicles.  This increases the MSRP by about $1500.

568,"June 22, 2012","Our granddaughter was purchasing her first car. A relative referred us to Kevin Beasley. He was wonderful. He made us feel comfortable immediately. It was clear he was knowledgeable about the company and its products. We started by looking at a pre-owned vehicle and, though we believed the deal on that vehicle was good, we decided to look at a new Hyundai. We were amazed by the price,the package of accessories and the warranties. Our granddaughter is going off to college in a couple of months and it was very comforting to know that she will be problem free and if by some chance there is a problem absolute Hyundai will be there for her. Additionally, the road side assistance was a key feature with her being on the road frequently.

Also, the appearance of the Accent sedan was a big seller for her. In addition to being a great vehicle, it ""looked good"" to her. And, of course, that was very important. She is so excited.

Then, to put the icing on the cake, Kevin sat in the vehicle and and walked her through all the features and he programmed her phone to the Blue Tooth for her. He took her around to the service dept. and introduced her to the service manager who assured her he was there for her if there were any issues.

All in all, it was a good experience and much less stressful than any car-buying experience we've had before. We'll definitely buy there again and wouldn't want anyone but Kevin to take care of us.",5.0

I returned this past Saturday, 3/31/12, just to test drive some vehicles. My husband and I had decided that we needed a vehicle that got better gas mileage than our Ford Expedition.

598,"March 05, 2012","This is a dealership that KNOWS ITS BUSINESS!  Compared to other manufacturer's showy showrooms, when I first walked into the ABSOLUTE HYUNDAI showroom, it didn't WOW me, but it only took a few minutes to know that I'd walked into a QUALITY DEALERSHIP and the team at Absolute know that PRETTY IS AS PRETTY DOES!  And, my experience with Absolute was indeed a HAPPY and BEAUTIFUL thing!

ABSOLUTE has top-notch sales professionals--TROY COX is KING among them!  ABSOLUTE has: great inventory, sincere and business-forward management, and an overall attitude of a We Are Here to Serve YOU mentality.  From what I've learned about Absolute's Service Department Team (to whom I was kindly introduced as a function of the purchasing process...and something that I found both charming and REASSURING)...they are a fully functioning professional team as well, with expertise and senior experience in their field!  I look forward to getting all maintenance needs expertly attended to!  This start-to-finish part of the buying process solidified my trust in ABSOLUTE even more.

The exact model + color combo I wanted took a while to find, but Troy communicated updates on the search with me regularly...and with stellar manners.  In point of fact, TROY COX is the best automobile sales professional I've ever met.  (When his number popped up on my phone, instead of groaning inwardly (as I did with several other salesmen at otherealerships) when I viewed who was trying to reach me...I always thought to myself: Oh, it's TROY!  Good!  TROY made me feel attended to and  informed.  I was appreciative of his pleasant nature, his relaxed but factual updates, and his obviously sincere customer-oriented persona.  This was a win/win auto-purchasing experience!  Make sure you ABSOLUTELY visit ABSOLUTE HYUNDAI!!!  (And tell TROY I sent you.)",5.0

I couldn't believe how helpful they were how friendly they were and we showed up close to closing. When I found the car I couldn't live without we settle on a price instantly! They out beat all the dealerships selling a ford mustang. I got on my phone before the test drive to compare prices and they had the lowest by far! When I go to get the car fax they lowered the price even more!! I could not believe a three to four hour process was done in an hour and a half!! This includes my test drive and negotiations! Not only did they beat the price they beat my banks interest rate by almost two points!! I love my car and I love Absolute!! I will forever be a customer of theirs! I want to thank everyone involved with my experience Omar Justin and Gerry!! You all are truly amazing most honest caring salesman I have ever met!!!

Byron gave us a few minutes and then asked if we had any questions which we did and it was great that he was not ""HIGH PRESSURED"" that we are all used to.  Byron then got a key for a couple of the cars so we could compare options!

   Being a mechanic I ask him several pointed question and he was able to answer most of them and on one question that I asked Byron he said "" I do not want to mislead you with a wrong answer so lets go to my service manager for clarification"".

We got the necessary info, after driving the cars and worked numbers.  After working the numbers they needed to locate the color and equipped as we desired.  After a week we were able to make a great deal, and we love our car!!!

I thought we had everything worked out regarding me test driving a new Elamtra to help me make a decision on if this car was the right one for me.  I can honestly say I was appalled at the way I was treated by your so called sales manager who needs to be in South Dallas or on Buckner selling used cars.  It was obvious from the time I walked into the front door I was at the wrong place.  This treatment cost you the commission on a sale as I am buying a Hyundai - just not from your dealership.  Working the numbers and getting a trade inoffer  on my vehicle was not a problem at all as that would be very beneficial to me on making a selection - the way it was handled was.  Obviously your dealership is use to a lower class customer.  I am so glad I saw this dealership as it actually is as the consumer reviews are not good at all and this one will be added to the list. Also I am going to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and advise all the news channels of how Absolute Hyundai operates.  With all this said, maybe you should get a job at another dealership.

After we decided on the car, Jeff made sure there was no dealer stuff plastered all over it. (yes that was a deal breaker for me.) But I do think they need to ramp up the finalizing the sale part and cut out all the good guy/bad guy bs. It’s pretty see through. I mean I know you are there to sell me the car at the dealerships best price, not mine. And I hate waiting. I have better things to do than sit in an office and wait.

Because of the car's popularity, I had been informed by several other dealerships in North Texas that they are selling at MSRP. Although initially bummed that my negotiation leverage was gone, I accepted that fact. 

However, when I asked Absolute Hyundai for the price, as a previous commenter stated, they wouldn't tell me but instead suggested I come ""sit in the car and make sure it's everything I want"". After seeing the ploy and flatly refusing their tactic, I continued to be contacted by the dealership trying to be lured in. Suddenly they were able to produce a price - $3000 above MSRP! Yes the car is popular, but you do not have permission to gouge. I'd also been informed that they have been trying this on several other customers- getting them in the car, wasting their time and then telling them the exorbitant price after wards.

Since purchasing my 2010 Santa Fe I've had the worst customer service and vehicle experience of my life.  Just let me say that I have a 12 year old Ford F-150 that I feel safer in than the Santa Fe I puchased one month ago.

Upon purchasing my Santa Fe the dealership would not tell me it would take A WEEK to be ready, so a friend and I drove to the dealership every afternoon at 3pm to pick up my new vehicle only to be told each day it wasn't ready.  They could have told me from the beginning that it was not going to be ready for a week!  And, they didn't offer a rental car.  

Second, the new Santa Fe I purchased broke down after a  month of having it!  The oil was leaking and the serpentine belt busted.  Here we go with customer service, noone at Absolute Hyundai has offered a rental car, any suggestions to trade in for an absolutely new model instead of the lemon I purchased.  Or followed up with phone calls to let me know what is wrong with my vehicle.  My brother, whose been in automotive for over 25 years called and found out for me.  He has never seen anything like this happen to upon purchasing a brand new vehicle.

The Santa Fe was purchased on June 24th and broke down July 24th.  Lovely!  I have a ""new"" car that I am not enjoying.  I've told several friends, family, co-workers, employees about my experience and they all say they will never shop at Absolute Hyundai.
