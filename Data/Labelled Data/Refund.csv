6956,01-Feb-04,"My wife went in looking for a car.  The dealer who assisted her (Cliff) said she had to put a $500 deposit down before he would even help her find a car.  She was naive, granted and they saw her coming.   I had to go back to get her check back on the same day and they had deposited it already!  The manager tried to placate us but the damage had been done.  Fast forward to two weeks later and after numerous calls we received our refund in the mail.  So we went to Thomas BMW in Oxnard/Camarillo.  They were the best!Advice:  Avoid Rusnak BMW in Thousand Oaks at all costs!",0,1,190
7994,14-Nov-13,"I attempted to purchase a certified used Avalanche. The salesman's position on wanting to make a deal with me that day was that it was a slow day and they had not made their quota for the day. We agreed on a price and prepared the paperwork. I could not take the car that night, we prepared the paper work with the finance department and I put a down payment on a credit card. We came back to the dealer a couple days later to finish the paperwork and pay for the car.We wrote a check for the entire amount less the credit card payment and the finance department told us they could take a company check event though they knew a company check was going to be used.  I truly believe I gave them every opportunity for them to sell me the car with the goal of providing customer service. In the end I was not able to purchase the car and ultimately had them refund the credit card charge they had on the car to hold it.  I was never informed or called during this process to have me understand the policies that they have in purchasing cars. Whenever I talked to somebody the story changed and I felt very confused, frustrated and dismayed.  At the end of this process, one of the floor sales managers told me their policy is they cannot take company checks, personnel checks or money orders. If that is their policy, I do not know how you can purchase a car from them without having a car to trade in and/or financing the entire amount? It appears that customer service is not a part of how they want to do business. Companies like this may be in business in the short term but in the long term, they will put themselves out of business,

7999,17-Sep-19,On 9/10 I went to Penske Chevrolet of Cerritos and bought a certified pre-owned 2015 Camaro RS at what I considered a great price. I never test drove it on the freeway and as I was driving back to WLA I realized the engine noise is way to loud at freeway speed. My wife confirmed it the next morning when I started it up and it rattled the whole house. I realized I made a mistake and went back to the dealer the next afternoon. Apparently with certified pre-owned cars you can trade within 3 days or 150 miles for another certified car or a new one you cannot get a refund. I  cannot afford to spend 35k plus for new and this dealer has maybe 6 pre-cars so I made the only choice that made sense and had to pay 5k more for a 2016 Chevy Colorado truck. I couldn't make a good deal  because I had no leverage.  Compared to  Chevy Colorado  certified trucks from other dealers on the internet which were priced lower and had more amenities I was over charged. My only choice was a WT model which stands for work truck. It came with scratches inside the bed which was very dirty upon delivery. The carpet in the back seat was worn away to the base in one spot. I was was only given one key and remote instead of two which is the norm. This truck only has 18k miles and the rest of it was clean. How could this truck be considered Certified? One thing I will say my sales woman Leah Sneed was wonderful and did the best she could under the xxxxty circumstances. 25k for a work truck. I was ripped off. Penske Chevrolet you owe me at least $1500 to make it right,0,1,-1
10154,13-Sep-17,"I initially gave them 5 stars, but they messed up BIG. Unfortunately, the service contract that I purchased was misrepresented to me by Michael ""B -something- ian"" in the Finance Department and I had to edit my review. The service contract was supposed to cover the cost of all my oil changes and when I took it in for service I had to pay roughly $56 to get the service completed and get my car back. The service plan cost me $1,300 at Orange Coast ($56 (14) + 1300 = $2084). So let me break down the numbers, $56 multiplied by 14 -oil changes- on top of the $1300 I paid for the service plan. Compare $2084 at Orange Coast to $585 at Glenn E. Thomas. I have canceled my service contract through Orange Coast and will repurchase it through Glenn E. Thomas Jeep in Long Beach (Cherry/Spring off 405) which is only a couple miles from where I live and well worth the drive for an estimated savings of $1,500. The service plan only costs $585 for my vehicle at Glenn E. Thomas Jeep and it covers synthetic 100%; about 25% of the cost of doing business through Orange Coast Jeep. I will never do business with Orange Coast again. They rip you off with a smile. Orange Coast Jeep sold me a service contract that only covered conventional oil when my vehicle requires synthetic at $1,300 which I cancelled and then repurchased at Glenn E. Thomas for $585 that covers synthetic. If you experienced this, you can go into any Jeep location as I did and cancel then repurchase a contract somewhere else. They lost my business for life. If they tell you they don't handle cancellations that's misleading because I called Mopar and that's the guidance I received and when I went in and explained everything to another dealer they were happy to cancel their contract when I clearly expressed that I would repurchase it once it cleared. I was sent a check pretty quick for the refund. They messed up because this post will have an immeasurable impact on their sales. You don't do that to individuals that work hard for what they have.

11013,30-May-18,"There's a reason most people dread going to a car dealership. Imagine you negotiate a deal, come to an agreement, and then afterward the seller changes the deal and tries to charge you more. That's the system in place at this dealership.

I worked with a salesperson named Manny Avendano, who was pretty easy to work with, and we negotiated a fair deal to purchase a used car and for a trade-in.

When we moved to the finance office and talked with Don Vuong, that's when things went south. There were $509 in total fees added to the purchase contract that were completely ridiculous. 

1. $250 'insurance fee' that gives the right to return the car within 48 hours for a refund. This is ridiculous. There's no way this is a real insurance program that is underwritten by an independent third party; this is simply the dealership adding pure profit to the deal on the back end, and changing the terms of the purchase price through a deceptive add-on. Don insisted that this is a required part of the purchase contract, standard on all deals this dealership makes, and could not be removed.

2.  $179 NitroFill 5 year subscription. This is a standard add-on also, which pays for nitrogen in your tires and 5 years of roadside assistance. Of course, there's no good way to evaluate whether this program is any good while you're sitting there in the finance office, but between my auto insurance and a AAA membership, this is completely unnecessary. It was a xxxx of a fight and probably a half hour of arguing, but i did get this removed from the purchase contract. At first, Don insisted that this is standard requirement and could not be removed, but in the end he was easily able to delete it from the contract in two seconds.

3. $80 document processing fee. Every dealership charges a doc fee, and it's usually around this cost range. It's a BS fee that I've never had successfully removed from a purchase contract. But there it is, now you know how much this dealership charges. Keep in mind that all the docs are processed electronically. What is this $80 for? Software subscription? Am i paying for the labor hours for the finance manager? This is paying for dealership overhead, not my problem, bake it into the car's price.

My back rear tire had a red stamp on it from a valet.. the red stamp was still on my back rear tire when I picked it up. I had to call and speak with a service manager, Phan, he refunded my money,  but never offered anything else, had to make 2 trips there. Not to mention the rude customer in the waiting area, playing her phone very loud, when I asked her to turn it down a verbal exchange ensued, at no time did a Honda employee come over to calm the situation.

29097,14-Feb-16,"This dealership will take fully advantage of you. Why would the sales manager ""John"" and the finance guy throw in a 1300 service contract on my vehicle for a power train warranty ( they made it seem like it was free and they were doing me a favor) when my car was already covered with it!!! And on top of me calling the finance manager out on his xxxxxxxx, he tried to tell me I needed that OPTIONAL warranty In order to get approval from the bank, he even told me he will take my car back if I tried to cancel the warranty. The warranty is fully refundable within 60 days. Complete lies when everything is in the contract. I wouldn't be surprised if they gave me a higher interest rate just to make more money off it it. ( dealers do that, research it) , if they can do this type of lying for a used 8k car , please do not trust them with a 20k car, my payments are higher because of this warranty and even if it's refunded the refund is applied to the principle of my loan, which will not make my payments go down. I will advise everyone to get a preapproval from another bank/credit union. Oh yea I forgot to mention when I came to the finance manager to cancel it within 20 minutes of dealing with me he let multiple customers cut in front of me which had me waiting 3hrs and I left without even getting it cancelled, now I have to cancel it VIA mail.

buyout was not the same as the written quote.  The finance guy told me the price was from Ford Motor Company which was lie since I had already spoken to Ford Motor Co.

Of course, there's no good way to evaluate whether this program is any good while you're sitting there in the finance office, but between my auto insurance and a AAA membership, this is completely unnecessary. It was a xxxx of a fight and probably a half hour of arguing, but i did get this removed from the purchase contract. At first, Don insisted that this is standard requirement and could not be removed, but in the end he was easily able to delete it from the contract in two seconds.

3. $80 document processing fee. Every dealership charges a doc fee, and it's usually around this cost range. It's a BS fee that I've never had successfully removed from a purchase contract. But there it is, now you know how much this dealership charges. Keep in mind that all the docs are processed electronically. What is this $80 for? Software subscription? Am i paying for the labor hours for the finance manager? This is paying for dealership overhead, not my problem, bake it into the car's price.

tl;dr  Negotiated a deal with sales person and was happy. Then got to finance office and was hit with $509 more in fees the sales person didn't mention and were not part of the price we discussed.",0,3,-1
54933,19-Jan-15,"This is a review of the parts department.  I purchased my 2014 Toyota Avalon in November.  Costco offers a 50% coupon off parts and/or service up to $200 for going through them.  When I attempted to use this coupon in December to purchase illuminated door sills I was refused.   I was told by the parts manager they since they are running a 20% off parts I could not use the coupon (although the coupon clearly states you simply cannot COMBINE discounts).  I was told to return in January.  Today I went in again.  The 20% sign was still up and I imagine it is always there.  Again there was a lot of time spent verifying the coupon.  After checking with a manager I was then told the price of the part had gone up and they would ONLY charge me $200.00.  That, of course, would mean this item retails for $400.00.  I questioned them but in the end decided to purchase the item.  Then I was directed to the service department to get a price for installation.  After someone chasing after about five different people I was quoted $390.00 for installation only.  REALLY!!!   After leaving I quickly called Thousand Oaks Toyota.  They quoted the part at $299.00 which I later determined is the retail price for this item.  They also quoted me $125.00 for install.  Let's see ... that is $175.00 LESS than DCH quoted me with my coupon.  This is nothing more than a scam and a rip off.  I returned to DCH, cancelled my order and got a refund.  I advised them to never go into their lunch room and start complaining about government dishonesty and being ripped off because DCH contributes to the same culture that creates angry, disgruntled citizens by their dishonesty.  I came home.  Purchased the part on line for $245.00 with shipping and will have a body shop install it.  I don't care if I paid more because I would never give DCH the satisfaction of getting any money from me in this manner.
Recommendation.  yeah...don't buy parts from DCH.  Shop around, dealers, body shops, on line, anywhere but DCH.  And if this is indicative of the dealership I guess you need to be very careful of your purchases and service as well.  Such a shame that people continue to make decisions to work for dishonest companies thinking saying I'm sorry covers it all.  Uh huh, sorry you got nailed no doubt.  Things will never change until people stand up and refuse to accept it or perpetuate dishonesty.",0,3,13
66543,30-May-14,"I bought my new Toyota Highlander at the end of December. I waited to review this dealership because I wanted to be fair and hopefully my attitude towards them changed. It has not. First, for the last 2 years, my 2008 Highlander Hybrid limited had been having problems with the gas tank (won't fill up) then the braking system was malfunctioning. After numerous attempts to repair & thousands of dollars spent, the vehicle still wasn't repaired. Refunds were not issued in hopes to ""eventually"" figure out the problems & repair them. The braking system went out on a weekend evening, leaving me & my children stranded. We had the vehicle towed to Carlsbad. 

I requested the Sales Team & Services department work together because of all of the problems I had over the last 2 years. They did not accommodate. They knew ""they had me"" because my vehicle was in the shop. It was not worth repairing. The sales team wouldn't budge in price; I had to show them vehicles at Mossy to get them to budge. Moreover, once we had finally made a deal, I requested new car mats to be included, that was denied, and they wanted $200 for my old car mats. They ended up reducing the value of my car because I refused to pay for more all weather mats, a cargo net and my surf racks (that I already owned!). When I was transferring my 6 year old car mats over to my brand new Highlander, I requested my old car mats be sprayed off. The salesman looked at me like I was crazy-why should I even have to ask to have dirty old all weather car mats sprayed off before I put them in a brand new $37,000 vehicle? I was shocked that I would even have to ask this! I had to threaten to walk away from the entire deal, have my car towed elsewhere (Mossy) just to have clean car mats. They finally sprayed off my mats. 

Since purchasing my vehicle, I have been working with Mossy, and they have given me excellent customer service. They have taken excellent care of my vehicle. I regret not towing my vehicle & just working w/Mossy. Lesson learned. ",0,3,53
4568,14-Nov-13,"Tried to order the 2014 BMW X5. The most prevalent mistake was that the sales manager made a mistake on interior color in entering the order which we pointed out and even called BMW North America to point out the mistake. Unfortunately, the mistake was never corrected and we had to cancel the order. Although the dealership says they have refunded our deposit, they have not. Other areas of poor customer service included: very poor communication and lack of appropriate paper work despite repeated attempts by my husband and I to facilitate good communication and to get the appropriate paper work. We have bought/leased 6 BMWs in the last 9 years from 4 different dealerships and have never had such poor customer service and follow-through. We will purchase our car somewhere else.

4752,03-Feb-11,"A few months ago, i was interested in buying a m3. 

philip was very professional about everything. everything he says sounds very good, but sneaky and shady people are very good at doing that. i asked him about putting a deposit on a m3, and he said that people dont need to put a deposit down. then i mentioned that i wanted a stripped down very lightly optioned m3 in silverstone II exterior, which is a m exclusive color that is very hard to sell and wildly unpopular. but i like to the color because its a silver with a bit of chrome blue in it, and is perfect for such a sporty car. anyways, so after he found out that i wanted a stripped down m3, he said that he would need a 5 thousand dollar deposit. i was FLOORED! one second he says i dont need to put down a deposit, the next he says he needs 5 thousand. i was speechless. on top of that, all other bmw dealerships only need 1-2 grand to place an order. then i asked if the deposit was refundable. he said no. well, according to california state law, ALL deposits are refundable and I politely reminded him of that law. he then said that the 5 thousand deposit was not a deposit, but actually future payments on the car. wow, he lied right to my face. ive never seen a salesmen create such bullshit so fast in my life. no other dealership in the entire united states does that. to this day, im still astounded that they are capable of this kind of chicanery and deception of this caliber. 

if you are interested in buying a bmw, especially a m car, i would run. these people lie and will try to cheat every penny out of you. here is some advice for people buying a bmw: only pay 500 over invoice, regardless of the model of the car. it doesnt matter if its a m3 or a 328i. a fair dealership will give you that price or lower. dont let someone tell you that they cant give you a better price because you are buying a m car. that simply is not the case. head on over to other dealerships like steve thomas. anywhere is better than here. hell, a crackdealer in compton will give you a straighter deal on a m3 than south bay bmw.

philip khan is also very cocky. he told me to google him on a few bmw forums. well, duh, im on them. thats how i found out about him. he got some gave rave reviews, and others not so. Many say that he is the best south bay has to offer. but after dealing with him, i can say without a guilty conscience that he is a snake in the grass. He appears very nice, respect, mild mannered, and polite, but don’t let that trick you. behind that mask is a dirty salesman trying to squeeze the most money out of you in the dirtiest fashion.  I first checked them out because they said they didn’t need a deposit on a m3, but now they want a future payment of 5 thousand before the car that didnt even hit American soil. His excuse was that they don’t need deposits on m3s that are fully loaded since they are easier to sell if I back out. Regardless, he did not mention that “policy” until after I told him I wanted a lightly optioned m3. You judge for yourself how honest they are.

6259,20-Dec-19,"This is a much delayed review: 

In spring of 2019 I ordered a customized BMW M4-fully loaded. It was a horrible experience. 

Even so, I maintained my composure despite: 

• Being out $110,000+ with nothing to show for it (more below). 

•Amir Khansari screaming at me at the top of his lungs over the phone in March 2019  over asking him about the vessel that the car was going to be put on from Germany. That incident went unreported until I took possession of the vehicle (out of fear he’d yank it out from under me). Moreover, Amir couldn’t even be man enough to shake my hand, introduce himself, or otherwise acknowledge my presence (let alone thank me for my purchase) when I was right in front of him to take possession of the vehicle, and he knew who I was. Amir’s name is on the sale itself and Patrick pointed to me and said: “that’s [me] ” to him when I came to pick up the vehicle. Amir’s response? A scoff followed by a stare down in the parking lot later that day. For point of reference, Amir is the same age as my father, so his aggression was both humorous and sad.

•L. (“Patrick”) Rodriguez could neither keep a single promise nor deadline, yet I never threw him under the bus, including when I made a formal complaint. I will have no problem doing so in the future, however. 

•My J.D. candidacy was mocked by Belnadin (“Belle”) Hormozi; evidently selling cars at a two-bit dealership is more prestigious than pursuing law. 

•My elderly mother was not even offered water nor given directions to the bathroom as she sat in the waiting room for 3+ hours after we had been on the road to grab the car for 7+ hours (14+ for me). “People” who can’t even be nice to the elderly or children, have no soul.

•Jeff Kaltman called me 3 times in a row on a Saturday night to ask about an internal review I left and subsequently made a bunch of promises to “make this [the above] right”, that he never kept. Moreover, he was nowhere to be found and did not return our subsequent calls regarding the recent news. Just like everyone else at Rusnak, his word means nothing and the only schedule that matters is his own. 

•Despite all of that garbage and with my car finally in my possession, the car is now being recalled. But, just like having to hold Rusnak’s hand to put together the vehicle, I had to do so to get the refund (lemon law). Countless calls were made to Shawn Jordan to facilitate the refund and he was standoffish and aloof, at best. 

•Lastly, Al Lemoine was about as helpful as a snow parka in the Sahara Desert and showed no contrition nor empathy sans some canned, managerial slogans. 

•I haven’t gotten a SINGLE apology for all of the inconvenience I’ve undergone. Rusnak cannot control recalls, but they can control how they act, their business practices, and can exhibit basic human decency. If my father hadn’t recently become involved (or if he weren’t an attorney), I’m 100% certain that no action(s) would’ve been taken whatsoever. 

So, yeah, given the above (which is far from an exhaustive list), I’m pretty sure that the Dalai Lama himself would concur that RUSNAK is infested with insufferable, inconsiderate, unappreciative, and unreasonable cretins.",1,3,-1
10153,02-Nov-17,"On 10-22-17 I went to this dealer because I wanted a Ram 2500 4x4 diesel. The first contact was good and when I arrived I met with Rod Mullar. I drove the truck and decided it was the one for me. The price was good and the trade in value was much better than the other dealer locally offered. The problem was the add-ons that were forced upon me. $299 for an anti theft device that I told them at least 5 times that I didn't want. I was told that they would have to charge me to remove it so I might as well just buy it. I knew this wasn't true but I was tired of going back and forth about $299 while I'm spending $65,500. The next thing was nitro fill which is nitrogen filled tires and a ""membership'' to get your tires filled at any nitro fill dealer for $179!! Problem is I need to change air pressure based on the load on the truck and I am not going to drive 30 minutes to the closest nitro fill location. I again told them I didn't want it and was told it was already it the tires and they can't remove it. So $478 in things I told them I didn't want and they just refused to remove. The worst part was on 10-24-17 I took my son to daycare and when I went back out to my new truck it wouldn't start. After trying to start it for 20 minutes I got out and was about to get an uber since I needed to get to work, when luckily I tired the remote start and it started. I was able to use this work around get home. I called the dealer and was told I'd receive a call back about it. On 10-30-17 I had enough and took it to my local dealer because it was not starting with the push to start button still. I got a phone call on 11-1-17 from the local dealer that the dealer install Anti theft device was causing it not to start. They bypassed it (obviously not all that great of an anti theft) and it started fine. I then called Rod to find out if they were going to pay the $220 that I was going to be charged to remove it. Rod apparently called the company that installed the anti theft device and they did come to my local dealer and remove it. I still never received a call back from Rod about my concern about the refund for the anti theft since not only did I not ever want it, it now caused me to be without my truck for 2 days and it had to be removed. I will never understand the thought process of losing a customer that has bought 9 vehicles in the past 5 years for less than $500.",1,3,47

10912,24-Jul-18,"UPDATE: Problem resolved. The day after I posted this review, I received a text from one of the managers, David Nehrir, who apologized for the bad experience I'd had. Furthermore, they mailed a check refunding the fraudulent charges. 

INITIAL POST: The finance staff Leo (I don’t know his last name) and Cisco Mejia fraudulently charged me $628. I explicitly stated that I did not want to buy any optional goods or services. Leo said that the Nitrofill and Etch theft deterrent device were included on all vehicles and that there was no additional charge. That was a lie. I also explicitly stated that I did not want the vehicle contract cancellation, and they charged me for that. 

I have called and left voicemails repeatedly and have never received a call back. I have exchanged 7 emails with the finance staff, but they have not communicated anything with me regarding the fraudulent charges.  

All of their paperwork was on a screen. On each screen, Leo told me what I was signing and then scrolled down to the bottom where I would sign. I was not able to see that he was checking boxes that were the exact opposite of what I had said. They put all the paperwork on a flash drive but did not give me the flash drive when I left. I was not given any paperwork, contracts, or receipts except for a receipt that just listed the $2,500 down payment I gave at the time of purchase. I purchased the car on Sunday, June 10, 2018. Since it was Sunday evening, my bank was closed. When I came back to Huntington Beach (I live in San Diego) on June 14 to pay the balance on my car, I asked for a receipt, and that’s when I saw the extra $628 of charges. I met with Alex Sandoval who said his manager would need to talk to his manager before the charges could be reversed. It has now been over 6 weeks of me calling and emailing them and hearing nothing back. 

The Etch that Leo said was free was $199. The Nitrofill that he said was free was $179. The vehicle contract cancellation option that I said I did not want was $250. 

On their website, their core values include truthfulness, responsiveness, and consistency. I have experienced the exact opposite of these. The finance department has been deceitful, dishonest, unresponsive, and unreliable. These fraudulent charges and the process of trying to get my $628 back have caused a great deal of emotional and mental stress as well as financial hardship. The good experience I had with their salesman T. Wayne and their competitive pricing has been completely erased by their finance team’s deceitfulness. ",1,1,800
10940,22-Jan-15,"My experience with this dealership can only be described as a totally farce.

Having to move from the east coast to the LA area for a new job, I needed to find a car quickly and remotely. After lots of searching I found (on AutoTrader) what appeared to be a great deal at this dealer. Since I lived in Washington DC, I wanted to put a deposit down and secure the car. I called the dealership and spoke with Francisco. He seemed to not really know much about the car or how anything worked at the dealership. Eventually I got the information I needed and made an offer. Matt - the 'internet manager' - called me to say that they'd accepted my offer. After making the deposit (which for some reason took three people to get right and an inability to use the mute button on the phone while they fumbled and cursed in the background), I asked Matt to send me a breakdown of the cost, registration, taxes, etc... and that I'd be in several weeks later to pick the car up. Two weeks later and I still didn't have any of the information I asked for. Meanwhile, Francisco called me several times and asked if I was still interested in the car. After reminding him that I'd already purchased it, I further reminded him that I hadn't received the requested paperwork. At this point I'm already suspecting that these guys are totally incompetent, but couldn't imagine that they'd screw up any more. I was wrong. Very wrong. Three weeks after putting down the deposit and two days before I was to fly out to LA to start my new job, I get a call from Matt: 'We accidentally sold your car.' He said he'd tried calling me a week ago when it first happened but 'for some reason the phones weren't working.' When I pressed him for more information, he tried to sell me a another car for the same price. A few minutes later he said 'Sorry I didn't get back to you sooner but I just found out yesterday.' WHAT? At that point I asked for my deposit back and to call me when the refund was processed. Two days later and I've still not received any deposit refund, nor has anybody returned my calls.

10984,06-May-16,"I went to Huntington Beach Chrysler to get out of my Jeep Compass. I spoke directly with Pete Shaver, the owner of the dealership. He told me that he could get me out of the Jeep and the ONLY car he had that would work was a fully loaded 2015 Chrysler 200C. The car had a price of $34K. He leasaed it to me. Now, being that I am an idiot for buying the car does not take away from the unfair advantage he took of me in the situation I was in, a typical crook dealer thing to do! The car had a substancial discount, easily enough to cover the negative equity I had in the Jeep and tax. I laid down for everything, all the warranties, everything. I wrote a hold check for a $2,000 down payment. All said and done, the balance I walked out with on the lease was over $38K. So I dont know what happened to the discount, I guess it just dissapeared! 5 days Later  when I brought the car back to have the navigation software installed, the car ended up in the shop for 68 days, thats right, 68 DAYS! needless to say we got deep onto California Lemon Law over this car. The sevice departmet was good about it, but Pete was not! I told them that I did NOT want them to deposit the down payment check until I had settled the case with Chrysler, a very reasonable request. Pete Shaver was rude and nasty and treated me like I was some kind of criminal bent on ripping him off for the $2K. I told him multiple times that once the matter was resolved I would honor my commitment. Well, that was not good enough for him. Not only was he rude and nasty about it, and accused me of trying to rip him off, he had his business office deposit the check BEFOR the issue was resolved. I put a stop payment on it. Once the matter with Chrysler was resolved, I paid the $2K. Then, I wanted to cancel one of the things I had purchased, that I did not know I had purchased! Some kind of a GPS trackng thing that cost $995. I remember when I bought the car the finanace guy went over everything so fast, I dont recall him telling me about it. I contacted the dealership to cancel that thing 6 weeks ago, I was told then that it would be 4 to 6 weeks for the refund which goes directly to Ally Financial, the leasing company. So today I noticed that Ally had not rceive the refund. I called the dealership, they said they had no record of it. The manager in the business office told me she would call me back after she did some research. She did and told me that Pete refused to issue the refund, like the crook he is! First he screws me blue on the car and then he wont refund me for something I did not want in the first place. Now I have a car with a horrible repair record that I owe $35K on that is worth, at best, $18K, hows that for a good deal? I'll bet on a trade I wouldent get $15. The car is a piece of junk, as I was told by no less then 2 Chrysler technicians one who works for Mr. Shaver. Way to stand behind your product fellas! When I first spoke to Pete Shaver he assured me that this car because of the model and equipment would be easy to get out of within 6 months, I believe his words were that I should be able to trade out if it in 6 months, he told me that knowing that the payment was much higher then I could afflord, I trusted him, and he burned me. Now I am stuck with a $824 a month lease payment with no way to get out, and he had to know that when he sold me the car, what a horrifically despicable person. People like Pete Shaver are the reason the car business has the reputation it does. Oh, and I inadvertently left a set of jumper cables in the Jeep when I traded it in and when I went back to retrieve them, they were gone, stolen by someone in the Pete Shaver universe.

13713,22-Jan-15,"My experience with this dealership can only be described as a totally farce.

Having to move from the east coast to the LA area for a new job, I needed to find a car quickly and remotely. After lots of searching I found (on AutoTrader) what appeared to be a great deal at this dealer. Since I lived in Washington DC, I wanted to put a deposit down and secure the car. I called the dealership and spoke with Francisco. He seemed to not really know much about the car or how anything worked at the dealership. Eventually I got the information I needed and made an offer. Matt - the 'internet manager' - called me to say that they'd accepted my offer. After making the deposit (which for some reason took three people to get right and an inability to use the mute button on the phone while they fumbled and cursed in the background), I asked Matt to send me a breakdown of the cost, registration, taxes, etc... and that I'd be in several weeks later to pick the car up. Two weeks later and I still didn't have any of the information I asked for. Meanwhile, Francisco called me several times and asked if I was still interested in the car. After reminding him that I'd already purchased it, I further reminded him that I hadn't received the requested paperwork. At this point I'm already suspecting that these guys are totally incompetent, but couldn't imagine that they'd screw up any more. I was wrong. Very wrong. Three weeks after putting down the deposit and two days before I was to fly out to LA to start my new job, I get a call from Matt: 'We accidentally sold your car.' He said he'd tried calling me a week ago when it first happened but 'for some reason the phones weren't working.' When I pressed him for more information, he tried to sell me a another car for the same price. A few minutes later he said 'Sorry I didn't get back to you sooner but I just found out yesterday.' WHAT? At that point I asked for my deposit back and to call me when the refund was processed. Two days later and I've still not received any deposit refund, nor has anybody returned my calls.

I drove the truck and decided it was the one for me. The price was good and the trade in value was much better than the other dealer locally offered. The problem was the add-ons that were forced upon me. $299 for an anti theft device that I told them at least 5 times that I didn't want. I was told that they would have to charge me to remove it so I might as well just buy it. I knew this wasn't true but I was tired of going back and forth about $299 while I'm spending $65,500. The next thing was nitro fill which is nitrogen filled tires and a ""membership'' to get your tires filled at any nitro fill dealer for $179!! Problem is I need to change air pressure based on the load on the truck and I am not going to drive 30 minutes to the closest nitro fill location. I again told them I didn't want it and was told it was already it the tires and they can't remove it. So $478 in things I told them I didn't want and they just refused to remove.

Rod apparently called the company that installed the anti theft device and they did come to my local dealer and remove it. I still never received a call back from Rod about my concern about the refund for the anti theft since not only did I not ever want it, it now caused me to be without my truck for 2 days and it had to be removed.

He came out and told me that honda will cover it.  So, he made appointment on Wednesday and also ordered part for me.  I showed up my appoinment hoping to have my seatbelt replace. Dann was off on that day so I end up meeting this guy (I totally forgot to get his name).  he looked at me and said ""NO..NO"".  we won't fix if you remove the seatbelt from your car.  he made the big deal out of it and yelled around the shop.  he talked to all the big bosses at the shop about my case.  I told him that I will come back to see Dann because he was taking car my case.  So, I went home and coudn't wait to see Dann.  I came back on Friday and met Dann.

So, I ended up pay $150 for my seatbelt.  I thought that was it and would not deal with these guys anymore.  I coudn't beleive when I put the seatbelt in my car, the sensor is not working at all. I went back to the dealer and ask for exchange. They didn't even let me exchange or refund.  I didn't even know the part is a non-refund item prior my purchase. I ask Dann if he could proof the part is good then I will happyily leave the store.  He told me that Honda doesn't need to prove it and gave me all cappy lectures and asked me to pay $150 to diagnose my car if I want to fix the sensor.

My $6K down-payment check was cashed by them on 3/27/19 and I returned the car on 3/30/19 (via the 5-day ""contract-cancellation"" agreement), Upon return, my wife and I were presented with a ""cancellation document"" that we were asked to sign. Trustingly, we both signed w/o reading the exact language (foolish me/us!).

A week later, having not yet received a refund, I looked at the document more carefully and realized that it said, ""I/we hereby acknowledge  RECEIPT of a complete refund of all monies or other consideration previously paid by me/us.........."". HUH?? I called to talk with my salesman ""Moe"" and was connected with ""sales manager"" Chris Gonzalez, who said that it would take 9 days to ""process"" (??) my refund. But, after pointing out the language of the document we had signed, he agreed to ""expedite"" the refund.

Soooo.......ANOTHER week (4/15/19) and FIVE CALLS later, I was unable to reconnect with Chris, but was finally able to get in touch with another so-called ""sales manager"" 'Domingo' (first or last name? DUNNO), who - after I threatened to call the district attorney - claimed he would put the check in the mail that afternoon (today). BUT, even if he does.......apparently I won't actually receive my refund until 18-ish days after signing the document stating that I acknowledged having already received it!!

27204,05-May-19,"I drove out to Ontario after doing some research on a used vehicle i was interested in.  Though a great distance,  I hoped for a good outcome.  It ended up being a long draining day! The price was not what I had seen on line and what was verified prior to the drive. I immediately should have left. I was convinced by Devyn that the added STICKER pricing could be removed.  I was there 4 hours. I promised myself I would not allow this to occur & it did.  As late as it was there was no time to discuss the specifics nor get a feel of the car. Alfonso stated, don't worry we will assist.  I actually believed that he would honor his words.   Alfonso Morales stated that the additional sticker items would all be removed.  They were!  I decided to have him add one item to the contract due to the hassle free conduct expressed and done.  He stated that they did not want me to purchase anything I did not need or want.  I felt confident that they wanted to do business and actually put a change to their deceptive actions.  I purchased the car and soon noticed prior to leaving that the chip was missing and the panels on one of the doors was damaged.  They would not put anything in writing.  By now it was close to 9:00 p.m. I arrived around 4:15. Rocky Edwards promised to fix it.  Devyn promised to send me the chip to the navigation. It has not occurred and they are not being accommodating anymore.  I changed my mind the following day about the paint guard. I confidently sent out my emails and phoned the dealership.  I was ignored.  When I finally received a message from Rocky, he stated that certain items were not refundable never adding the paint guard as being one of them.  I made the long drive notifying Devyn and Alfonso and neither notified me not to come down to the dealership. I arrived only to be ignored and told by someone I had never met that I would not be assisted.  I was Livid.  Since that day, the dealership has not cooperated and I have filed a couple of complaints.  Do not find yourself purchasing anything extra! it is not mandatory and if you do, ask if its refundable and get it in writing.  I found their deceiving tactics distasteful.

29707,07-Feb-20,"Purchased my 2020 Hyundai palisade in august of 2019. Upon walking into the car dealership, my husband and i were the only customers of color. No one came to help us or check what we needed for at least 30 min. Plenty reps were available but too busy helping those that came and didn’t look like us. I had an appointment but they didn’t come to work. I was assigned an internet rep who’d been there over 6 months and never sold a car, likely cause they assumed we wouldn’t purchase. Rep could barely tell me anything about my car or tell me important details about the veh I’d need after purchase like how to let my seats down or open gas tank or that my purchase included warranty/roadside..found that out on my own. They tried to force me to do in house financing with higher APR than my CU that i already told them i knew i was going with. After my purchase i found out i got a “protective coating” that was basically a scam and the next week i wanted it cancelled i never got it applied and it was over $700 in my loan! They refused to work with my schedule to apply it or remove the service from my contract and the service during the time was insulting from the agents there. I was lied to saying if you don’t want it we’ll refund you then they’d say they never said that. Fast forward to my first routine service, due to my complaints at purchase manager said my first routine service would be free. I called to schedule it only to find out that manager never put that in my contract and since i couldn’t remember his name i was told “that’s not our problem it’s not in your contact, we aren’t giving you anything free.” And hung up in my face. I was demeaned and outright disrespected by this company, and harassed by my sales rep for over 2 months saying i MUST fill out a 5 star review for him as part of my sale and that it’s required that i do it..i know that gets him extra pay so i did not as my experience was NOT even 1 star experience! 


I want a refund for the protective coating that we never received and i want my promised oil change. It makes me extremely uncomfortable as a service member who is barely home that if my wife has issues with her vehicle she can’t take it to the place of purchase for service because they yell at her, they demean her, they disrespect her, and they hang up in her face. A purchase so big should not seem like crabs in a bucket to this company and we do not feel like valued customers at all. We highly regret the purchase at the location and $700+ financed into a loan accruing interest on something we couldn’t even receive is absurd ",1,4,-1

33290,24-Jul-18,"UPDATE: Problem resolved. The day after I posted this review, I received a text from one of the managers, David Nehrir, who apologized for the bad experience I'd had. Furthermore, they mailed a check refunding the fraudulent charges. 

INITIAL POST: The finance staff Leo (I don’t know his last name) and Cisco Mejia fraudulently charged me $628. I explicitly stated that I did not want to buy any optional goods or services. Leo said that the Nitrofill and Etch theft deterrent device were included on all vehicles and that there was no additional charge. That was a lie. I also explicitly stated that I did not want the vehicle contract cancellation, and they charged me for that. 

I have called and left voicemails repeatedly and have never received a call back. I have exchanged 7 emails with the finance staff, but they have not communicated anything with me regarding the fraudulent charges.  

All of their paperwork was on a screen. On each screen, Leo told me what I was signing and then scrolled down to the bottom where I would sign. I was not able to see that he was checking boxes that were the exact opposite of what I had said. They put all the paperwork on a flash drive but did not give me the flash drive when I left. I was not given any paperwork, contracts, or receipts except for a receipt that just listed the $2,500 down payment I gave at the time of purchase. I purchased the car on Sunday, June 10, 2018. Since it was Sunday evening, my bank was closed. When I came back to Huntington Beach (I live in San Diego) on June 14 to pay the balance on my car, I asked for a receipt, and that’s when I saw the extra $628 of charges. I met with Alex Sandoval who said his manager would need to talk to his manager before the charges could be reversed. It has now been over 6 weeks of me calling and emailing them and hearing nothing back. 

The Etch that Leo said was free was $199. The Nitrofill that he said was free was $179. The vehicle contract cancellation option that I said I did not want was $250. 

On their website, their core values include truthfulness, responsiveness, and consistency. I have experienced the exact opposite of these. The finance department has been deceitful, dishonest, unresponsive, and unreliable. These fraudulent charges and the process of trying to get my $628 back have caused a great deal of emotional and mental stress as well as financial hardship. The good experience I had with their salesman T. Wayne and their competitive pricing has been completely erased by their finance team’s deceitfulness. ",1,4,-1
33522,06-May-16,"I went to Huntington Beach Chrysler to get out of my Jeep Compass. I spoke directly with Pete Shaver, the owner of the dealership. He told me that he could get me out of the Jeep and the ONLY car he had that would work was a fully loaded 2015 Chrysler 200C. The car had a price of $34K. He leasaed it to me. Now, being that I am an idiot for buying the car does not take away from the unfair advantage he took of me in the situation I was in, a typical crook dealer thing to do! The car had a substancial discount, easily enough to cover the negative equity I had in the Jeep and tax. I laid down for everything, all the warranties, everything. I wrote a hold check for a $2,000 down payment. All said and done, the balance I walked out with on the lease was over $38K. So I dont know what happened to the discount, I guess it just dissapeared! 5 days Later  when I brought the car back to have the navigation software installed, the car ended up in the shop for 68 days, thats right, 68 DAYS! needless to say we got deep onto California Lemon Law over this car. The sevice departmet was good about it, but Pete was not! I told them that I did NOT want them to deposit the down payment check until I had settled the case with Chrysler, a very reasonable request. Pete Shaver was rude and nasty and treated me like I was some kind of criminal bent on ripping him off for the $2K. I told him multiple times that once the matter was resolved I would honor my commitment. Well, that was not good enough for him. Not only was he rude and nasty about it, and accused me of trying to rip him off, he had his business office deposit the check BEFOR the issue was resolved. I put a stop payment on it. Once the matter with Chrysler was resolved, I paid the $2K. Then, I wanted to cancel one of the things I had purchased, that I did not know I had purchased! Some kind of a GPS trackng thing that cost $995. I remember when I bought the car the finanace guy went over everything so fast, I dont recall him telling me about it. I contacted the dealership to cancel that thing 6 weeks ago, I was told then that it would be 4 to 6 weeks for the refund which goes directly to Ally Financial, the leasing company. So today I noticed that Ally had not rceive the refund. I called the dealership, they said they had no record of it.

Call Star Mazda to find out that I will NOT get all of my money back (apparently, it's prorated) and I had to come in (over an hour drive) to sign a piece of paper saying I want to cancel. Is this the stone age?! No reason why I can't sign digitally. Absolutely ridiculous, these people will lie to you and scam you out of your money. Go somewhere else!",1,5,-1
44877,16-Aug-14,"If I could give ZERO STARS I would. I have never written a Dealer Rater eview before but specifically signed up to tell you how horrible this dealership is. Avoid this dealership like the plague. The entire team is dysfunctional from top to bottom and are completely dishonest. Please take a moment to read through this review and ask yourself if these are the type of people you would trust and would want to be spending tens of thousands of dollars with.

Some Highlights:

-Made me drive 700 miles round trip to buy a car that was supposed to be ready to purchase but was in the service bay with no brakes on, front wheels removed, and no service technicians available to put the car back together when I arrived. I had called multiple times to make sure that the car was ready because of my long trip and they confirmed every time to come down. When I asked why I wasn’t told before I came down that the car wasn’t ready, I was told by Tony (Salesman) “that he doesn’t take calls for anyone on his day off” and that I should just “call my boss and tell him I can’t come into work the next day because I needed to wait for this car.”

-Mario (Used Car Sales Manager)  promised to refund me the gas money from the wasted trip, either off the purchase price of the car OR in cash if I did not buy the car. Tony (Salesman) and my friend Erik were there when this agreement was made as well. I did not buy the car and they refused to honor refunding me the money I spent on gas. 

-Went a second time to buy the car and the clutch failed 300 feet after driving it off the lot. Dealership agreed to make the repairs and call me when it was done. Tony called me the following week to tell me repairs were done and come get the car, then 2 hours later Basaam, the General Manager, called me back and said the clutch was actually not engaging properly in 3rd gear. I asked when that repair would be done, and was told they wouldn’t be repairing the car anymore. I was given an ultimatum to buy the car as is or get my deposit back. 

-When I brought up not receiving my gas money that was promised to be refunded to me by Mario (Used Car Sales Manager), the Basaam (General Manager) told me I was lying even though he was not at the dealership that day. He spoke over me and got extremely defensive when I said I don’t like the way he does business, told me “we don’t need to have this conversation” and ultimately hung up on me during the call.

-As of today, 8/16/14 the car has been re-listed for $1,000 MORE than what I was going to buy the car for and its original purchase price. They realized that they didn’t inspect this car carefully enough before accepting it as a trade-in, undertook a large amount of repair costs, and instead of chalking it up as a loss and repairing the car properly, they are now trying to sell it for $1000 MORE than what it was originally listed at. They say there is a 12 month/12,000 mile warranty on the clutch and VVT which is true. What they are not telling you is that the transmission is bad and the clutch will fail prematurely. This will easily be $2,000-$3,000 in repairs down the line. 

-For reference the car in question is a 2006 Mazdaspeed6 Grand Touring. The VIN number is JM1GG12LX61102075. Unless you’re comfortable doing a transmission rebuild/replacement or are willing to spend $2,000+ to have a shop do it, stay away from this car. When I asked for a full inspection report, which should be done by Mazda for every car being sold, they were unable to produce a copy and could only give me a shop invoice for parts from the VVT repair. Who knows what else is wrong with this car!

Again, do these sound like the type of people you would do business with? Do you really want to risk tens of thousands of dollars on dishonest people? THE ANSWER IS NO. Do not waste your time and hard earned money on this joke of a dealership. ",1,5,190
47089,29-Dec-17,"Where do I begin?  I walked in on Christmas Eve to look into getting a vehicle.  I was helped out by a very polite sales rep by the name of Francesco.  This is the only bright spot of this disaster.  Once we test drove the vehicle we wanted, we agreed upon a deal and I signed a lease.  Prior to signing the lease I advised the finance group that my credit was not in the best of shape and ask if this deal was guaranteed regardless of credit.  I was advised by both sales rep and and Finance that this deal was guaranteed and I could come Tuesday to get the vehicle.   So foolish me believing these con artists, leave  the down payment agreed upon to set up lease of the vehicle. 

So I call Tuesday to confirm that I will be there to pick up the vehicle, and I speak to the finance manager ( Jeff) who now states the deal is not valid and they can not do anything without a co-signer.  When I advised that both the sales rep and Financial Manager said that this would not be an issue.  I was told that this never occurred.  So I asked for the refund of my payment and was told by Jeff that this would be ready in the morning for me to pick up.   

So now Wednesday I call and speak to another gem (Steve) who now tells me that refunds are not given until Friday.  When I advised that Jeff stated this would be ready today, I was called a liar.  When I advised that this experience has been dreadful and I would  file complaints, Steve stated that it isn't their fault my credit sucks.   Really classy management here.    

So now today (Friday) around 2PM, I walk in to get my refund check,  and of course it still isn't ready yet.  So basically Dana Ford is holding my cash down payment hostage.  When I asked to speak to the owner, I was advised that I was not allowed to.   Not even 5 minutes later, I have my attorney call Dana Ford and all of a sudden, there's nobody there that my attorney could speak to.   Then my wife calls and speaks to the manager in finance and they tell her that "" had she not called, they were going to make us wait until Tuesday"",  and then has the nerve to call my wife and tell her that unless we take this review down,  we will be waiting another 2-3 weeks to get this check.  Are you kidding me??  Update 3:24PM EST.  Juan has now called my wife advising that now we are not getting our money back and that we can sue him for the check.  


This is the kind of horrific experience that you only read about in magazines or hear about in the news.  Dana Ford is an absolute disgrace and could care less about the hard working people unless they are making money.   I have complained to the BBB and the Consumer Protection Agency.  I will also be using my social media and print media contacts to bring to light what an absolute disgrace this dealership is.  ",1,5,53
47099,10-Apr-17,"Went to go pick up my new car today that I left a deposit for and signed all paperwork last night. I was told that I needed to pay more money because the bank wouldn't accept what joe p. Guaranteed me last night. The finance person- maybe John- was rude and disrespectful- I left and demanded that the gm call me and apologize. Shocking, he didn't, and he furthermore explained that the business he oversees is acceptable, and sees nothing wrong with the conduct. So, it's ok for employees to guarantee something they have no control over. He then tried to assure me that my 1500 deposit was not being held hostage- well thank you. When I called back to get my refund for the deposit I left last night- I was asked again what price I would agree to pay- Thanks but no- I was then told that I have to wait until Friday to get my deposit back- because the owner only signs for refunds on Fridays- and it would another week before the money was credited to my account.

47100,28-Mar-17,My husband and I went in to check out one of the new Ford raptor. After we were given the price and was told we would have to put down almost 30g to get our payments to be $900 we no longer wanted the truck. We looked at an older year of the raptor and we didn't love it but we liked it. So they encouraged us to put down $500 deposit and assured us that it is refundable. When we were no longer interested in the truck they refuse to give us our money back. This is bad business and terrible customer service I would not recommend this dealership to anyone. ,1,5,26
47126,07-Jan-13,"We had a situation with Dana that people should be warned of. We put a deposit down on a car under the pretense that we would be approved for a specified deposit and monthly payment. When the time came to finalize the deal, the dynamics of the deal changed and we had to come up with $5000.00 above what we expected to pay.   Needless to say we decided not to do the deal, as a result, they refused to refund our $500.00 deposit. I understand this tactic is to force buyers into a deal, and if they have a deposit, they can change whats to be paid apparently, or else lose your deposit.  So were out 500.00 and be warned Dana customers... DO NOT give a deposit and DO NOT believe it will be refunded even if they tell you it will. The finance manager Mitch explained that they were keeping it because ""He had to do alot of work to get the deal done""?!?!  Im surprised a company like Ford operates like this.",1,5,26

47138,13-Feb-09,"In March of 2008 I went to Dana Lincoln Mercury to purchase a Mercury Mariner.  When I found the truck that I liked I was asked to leave a deposit and fill out a credit application.  I left a $500 deposit on the truck and completed the credit application.  Unfortunately for me I was not approved for the truck from the leasing company and I was told I would need a co-signer.  Having someone co-sign was not an option for me.  When I called Tommy the sales person and told him that I didn't have a co-signer and inquired about my deposit I was told to come in for my deposit.  When I went in to pick up my deposit I was told that it could take up to 9 months to get back my deposit because deposits are usually nonrefundable.  I was NEVER told that when I was asked to leave a deposit nor did I sign anything stating that I was aware of this policy.  For almost a year now I have been calling DAILY inquiring about my deposit and have been given the run around.  I was told that they are looking into it, that they couldnt find my paperwork and proof of deposit (so I faxed them a copy of my check), you name it I was told it!!  Last week I was told that I was approved for the truck back in March of 2008 and that my deposit was nonrefundable.  That is ridiculous and a lie, I was told last year that I was NOT approved for the truck.  Now all of a sudden I was approved.  I am disgusted by how I was treated by Dana Lincoln Mercury and the nonsense I have been told for the past year.  I ended up purchasing my truck from Sansone Auto Mall where the sales people and managers could not have been nicer!!! I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE PURCHASING A VEHICLE FROM DANA LINCOLN MERCURY!!!  Now I will be pursuing my case in small claims court, it will be the best $19 I have ever spent to take them to court.  They have no business holding onto a deposit for a vehcile that I was NOT approved to purchase.",1,5,419
47152,07-Jan-17,"DO NOT EVER LEAVE A DEPOSIT on any vehicle with Dana Ford Lincoln of Staten Island. 
Upon receipt of my deposit, the salesman Jonathan Taylor and his manager at the time on 10/30/16, claimed that if I didn't take delivery of the vehicle, the refund was totally refundable. It was after 5 pm on a Sunday (the deposit receipt is dated 10/30/16 @ 5:22pm). The manager told me to just leave a deposit. As they were to be closed by 5pm already, and they told me they ""wanted to go home to watch football"". They basically took my deposit and pushed me out the door, with only a receipt for the Credit Card deposit transaction and NOTHING ELSE. No Buyers Order, no nothing.  Without a test drive, they lead me to believe that I needed to leave a deposit to secure the special low price on that particular vehicle with 0% financing. Told me that they will call me tomorrow after speaking to the bank about financing. Need less to say tomorrow came and noone called me back from Dana Ford Lincoln. So after work, I decided to call around for insurance quotes. Upon learning the high quotes I was getting from insurance companies to insurance this vehicle for full coverage, I decided to not purchase any new car at this current time. I called back the salesman Jonathan Taylor that day and told him I was not going to purchase that vehicle anymore. I explained to him about the high insurance quotes I was getting. I told him I will expect my deposit to be refunded. Jonathan then began to try to persuade me to still go ahead with the purchase. After a few attempts, he then tried to get me to drive to the dealer to meet with their insurance agents for a ""better quote""..  I then explained to him that after ten different insurance agents quoted about the same prices, I didn't feel the need to waste more time. Jonathan then tried to persuade me to look into a totally different vehicle that I was not interested in at all. I told him at this current time I will just like a refund of my deposit that they all assured me was possible. He told me he will have  Glenn Mahoney the General sales Manager call me back. After noone called me, I sent an email to Jonathan Taylor at 10pm on November 1, 2016, which to this day he has yet to return. On 12/30/16 while on three way calling with my Credit Card company and Dana ford Lincoln a cashier named IVY at ext.250, IVY promised me I will see a full refund back to my credit card with a couple days.  After not seeing the refund on my credit card, I called Dan Ford Lincoln back yesterday and  Today January 16, 2016 Glenn Mahoney just called and said he didn't know if the vehicle I had a deposit on was still in stock, and after 48 hours after a deposit is taken on it, if it is not delivered by then, he is allowed to sell it. Glenn Mahoney then Claimed there is NO REFUND GIVEN to an APPROVED SALE. How is it an approved sale if I never took delivery ?  Remind you I have a letter dated 10-31-16 in my house from Ford Credit  stating that the sale was not approved. So Glenn Mahoney and his staff at Dana Ford Lincoln of Staten Island believe they are entitled to keep my deposit and they never even started the vehicle up for me, never moved it from the same spot it was in.  Nothing !!!!
DO NOT EVER LEAVE A DEPOSIT ON A VEHICLE, THERE IS NO NEED TO.

47184,30-May-14,"I leased a brand new Ford Taurus - covered already by a 36 month factory warranty - I was sold (full price) on a 100,000 mile protection plan at the cost of $2,495 - with the contention that if I turned the lease in, I would get a full refund.
I never received a copy of the warranty, and turns out, it was only a 60,000 mile extended warranty, running concurrent with the factory warranty - and at lease end - 24 months and 36,000 miles later, I only received $1,000 refund.  
Why would I buy a warranty when I was already covered?  Because I was told it was a ""no lose"" situation - I'd get it all back if I turned the car in.
No response from dealership after complaining about the issue - followed up again - no response again.
I have since leased TWO more Ford vehicles, an Explorer and a new Taurus SHO - NOT from this dealership.
My impression is that this dealership cares about money only, not their customers.

47187,31-Oct-11,"    Recently, I purchased a car from Dana Ford.  A salesperson asked me to do him a favor.  He said in his E-mail, &amp;amp;quot;There's a website &amp;amp;quot;Dealer Rated.come/rateus that folks use to learn about car dealers.  We rely on views like yours to keep us going.&amp;amp;quot;  As for myself, I prefer to take the wait-and-see approach before rating a car dealer.  I am so glad I did.
     Initially, I had a great experience at Dana Ford.  The staff was very friendly.  Frank Curry and Richard Harley helped me with the purchase of my vehicle.  They were very professional, courteous, and a pleasure to deal with.  In short, they did A+ work.  It is too bad the rest of my experience with Dana Ford wasn't A+ as well.
     A short time after the puchase, I realized Dana Ford overcharged the amount of documentary fees(plates and registration) and was due a $152.00 dollar refund. Not a lot of money but still my money.   So I call them up and was told my  money  they overcharged me would be returned to me.  Days and weeks go bye and still no money.  I call up again and I am told my money is on its way.  Finally, I receive my check six weeks later after the purchase.  However, on the back of the check there is a disclaimer on back that states in capital letters:  &amp;amp;quot;IN FULL SETTLEMENT OF ALL CLAIMS AGAINST DANA MOTORS LTD.&amp;amp;quot;  My first reaction was, What's This?  Why would I want to put my John Hancock on something that states, &amp;amp;quot;IN FULL SETTLEMENT OF ALL CLAIMS....&amp;amp;quot;  So I call Dana Ford up and have been told it is their policy to issue their checks this way.  In fact, I was told the checks are preprinted that way but that is clearly not the case since the DISCLAIMER LANGUAGE was STAMPED---NOT PREPRINTED. I point this out to Tony, a manager, and he said there is nothing he could do.  I politely remind him it's MY MONEY-MY MONEY and I would  like it back with no strings attached. 
      In a nutshell, I told them I would sign the check if they were to reword the language as such:  &amp;amp;quot;IN FULL SETTLEMENT AS IT PERTAINS TO THE OVERCOLLECTION OF DOCUMENTARY FEES&amp;amp;quot;  Otherwise, why would I want to sign something that states, &amp;amp;quot;IN FULL SETTLEMENT OF ALL CLAIMS....&amp;amp;quot;  Now hypothetically speaking:  What if I were to find out I was overcharged elsewhere by DANA FORD?  Woundn't I POTENTIALLY be giving up that claim as well? Hypothetically speaking again: What if there was something wrong with the car or something that should have been disclosed about the car and wasn't( FOR EXAMPLE,THE CAR HAD FLOOD DAMAGE AND THEY KNEW ABOUT IT AND DID NOT DISCOSE IT)?  Would I be giving up that claim as well?   DANA FORD COULD NOT ANSWER OR EXPLAIN WHAT THE DISCLAIMER LANGUAGE ACTUALLY MEANT.  I FOUND THAT VERY CURIOUS.  BASICALLY THEY SAID WAS JUST TO SIGN THE CHECK.  In my opinion, if you ever have to file a claim it may cost a lot more in legal fees for a lawyer to determine what was meant bye signing a check which in very general language  states, &amp;amp;quot;IN FULL SETTLEMENT OF ALL CLAIMS AGAINST DANA MOTORS.&amp;amp;quot;   What happens if there is some type of problem with the purchase? If the lawyer sees the money returned was for being overcharged specifically, he or she does not have to worry about the general, &amp;amp;quot;IN FULL SETTLEMENT OF ALL CLAIMS...&amp;amp;quot; nonsence. As a result, and based on principle, I REFUSE TO SIGN SOMETHING LIKE THAT--- AND BYE THE WAY THE MONEY I WAS OVERCHARGED IS MY MONEY-MY MONEY------ DANA FORD---EVEN IF THE AMOUNT OWED IS NOT A LARGE SUM.  
     Consequently, I contacted the New York department of Consumer Affairs and there response was try to work it out--sounds very reasonable to me.  Thus,  I called Dana Ford back, but to no avail.  They did not call, e-mail, or fax me any information.  Dave Dioro, a manager, said he could not help me.  So I had to contact the New York Department of Consumers Affairs again. In short, HORRIBLE HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE  --IN REALITY HORRIBLE HORRIBLE MANAGEMENT SERVICE.   To put the situation nicely: SHAME ON YOU DANA FORD-SHAME ON YOU!!!!!  To be quite sure, I would like the return of my money without any general discaimer language that states...IN FULL SETTLEMENT OF ALL CLAIMS...&amp;amp;quot;
     If I have to go to court I will, although i think the situation is very unfortunate. I was told by management their lawyer said this disclaimer language was appropriate for overerpayment but I disagree.  I asked them to fax or mail me information as to what IN FULL SETTLEMENT OF ALL CLAIMS ...actually means by their lawyer but they said they WOULD not do it. The obvouis question is why not? I firmly believe this was a reasonable request.  In a nutshell, to make you jump through hoops to have them return your own money is plain---WRONG.  So if you are going to purchase a car from Dana Ford or any other car dealer, I would wait-and-see before you rate them.  Initially, they are very happy to take YOUR MONEY.  Also, know what you are signing.  Time will tell if you are truly happy with a dealer. For example, What happens if you are overcharged, or car has some mechanical issues and you need servicing? Their reponse and actions are critical to overall dealer performance.  I sincerely hope this letter will help future car purchasers. REMEMBER, A DEALER'S RATING MAY BE ENHANCED IF THEY ARE AGGRESIVE ENOUGH TO  ENCOURAGE YOU TO WRITE A REVIEW SHORTLY AFTER YOUR PURCHASE WHEN YOU ARE GENERALLY HAPPY AND THE DEALER IS HAPPY TO HAVE YOUR MONEY.  YOU WILL NOTICE THE DEALER-RATER BROCHURES AT DANA FORD AND THEY MAY ASK YOU TO RATE THEM.   IN MY OPINION, YOU SHOULD TAKE A WAIT-AND-SEE APPROACH. THUS, THE DEALER RATING MAY BE POTENTIALLY MORE ACCURATE.  HAD I RATED DANA FORD INITIALLY AFTER PURCHASING THE CAR THEIR SCORE WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH HIGHER.

51806,02-Nov-17,"On 10-22-17 I went to this dealer because I wanted a Ram 2500 4x4 diesel. The first contact was good and when I arrived I met with Rod Mullar. I drove the truck and decided it was the one for me. The price was good and the trade in value was much better than the other dealer locally offered. The problem was the add-ons that were forced upon me. $299 for an anti theft device that I told them at least 5 times that I didn't want. I was told that they would have to charge me to remove it so I might as well just buy it. I knew this wasn't true but I was tired of going back and forth about $299 while I'm spending $65,500. The next thing was nitro fill which is nitrogen filled tires and a ""membership'' to get your tires filled at any nitro fill dealer for $179!! Problem is I need to change air pressure based on the load on the truck and I am not going to drive 30 minutes to the closest nitro fill location. I again told them I didn't want it and was told it was already it the tires and they can't remove it. So $478 in things I told them I didn't want and they just refused to remove. The worst part was on 10-24-17 I took my son to daycare and when I went back out to my new truck it wouldn't start. After trying to start it for 20 minutes I got out and was about to get an uber since I needed to get to work, when luckily I tired the remote start and it started. I was able to use this work around get home. I called the dealer and was told I'd receive a call back about it. On 10-30-17 I had enough and took it to my local dealer because it was not starting with the push to start button still. I got a phone call on 11-1-17 from the local dealer that the dealer install Anti theft device was causing it not to start. They bypassed it (obviously not all that great of an anti theft) and it started fine. I then called Rod to find out if they were going to pay the $220 that I was going to be charged to remove it. Rod apparently called the company that installed the anti theft device and they did come to my local dealer and remove it. I still never received a call back from Rod about my concern about the refund for the anti theft since not only did I not ever want it, it now caused me to be without my truck for 2 days and it had to be removed. I will never understand the thought process of losing a customer that has bought 9 vehicles in the past 5 years for less than $500.",1,5,-1

52610,24-Jul-18,"UPDATE: Problem resolved. The day after I posted this review, I received a text from one of the managers, David Nehrir, who apologized for the bad experience I'd had. Furthermore, they mailed a check refunding the fraudulent charges. 

INITIAL POST: The finance staff Leo (I don’t know his last name) and Cisco Mejia fraudulently charged me $628. I explicitly stated that I did not want to buy any optional goods or services. Leo said that the Nitrofill and Etch theft deterrent device were included on all vehicles and that there was no additional charge. That was a lie. I also explicitly stated that I did not want the vehicle contract cancellation, and they charged me for that. 

I have called and left voicemails repeatedly and have never received a call back. I have exchanged 7 emails with the finance staff, but they have not communicated anything with me regarding the fraudulent charges.  

All of their paperwork was on a screen. On each screen, Leo told me what I was signing and then scrolled down to the bottom where I would sign. I was not able to see that he was checking boxes that were the exact opposite of what I had said. They put all the paperwork on a flash drive but did not give me the flash drive when I left. I was not given any paperwork, contracts, or receipts except for a receipt that just listed the $2,500 down payment I gave at the time of purchase. I purchased the car on Sunday, June 10, 2018. Since it was Sunday evening, my bank was closed. When I came back to Huntington Beach (I live in San Diego) on June 14 to pay the balance on my car, I asked for a receipt, and that’s when I saw the extra $628 of charges. I met with Alex Sandoval who said his manager would need to talk to his manager before the charges could be reversed. It has now been over 6 weeks of me calling and emailing them and hearing nothing back. 

The Etch that Leo said was free was $199. The Nitrofill that he said was free was $179. The vehicle contract cancellation option that I said I did not want was $250. 

On their website, their core values include truthfulness, responsiveness, and consistency. I have experienced the exact opposite of these. The finance department has been deceitful, dishonest, unresponsive, and unreliable. These fraudulent charges and the process of trying to get my $628 back have caused a great deal of emotional and mental stress as well as financial hardship. The good experience I had with their salesman T. Wayne and their competitive pricing has been completely erased by their finance team’s deceitfulness. ",1,5,-1
52842,06-May-16,"I went to Huntington Beach Chrysler to get out of my Jeep Compass. I spoke directly with Pete Shaver, the owner of the dealership. He told me that he could get me out of the Jeep and the ONLY car he had that would work was a fully loaded 2015 Chrysler 200C. The car had a price of $34K. He leasaed it to me. Now, being that I am an idiot for buying the car does not take away from the unfair advantage he took of me in the situation I was in, a typical crook dealer thing to do! The car had a substancial discount, easily enough to cover the negative equity I had in the Jeep and tax. I laid down for everything, all the warranties, everything. I wrote a hold check for a $2,000 down payment. All said and done, the balance I walked out with on the lease was over $38K. So I dont know what happened to the discount, I guess it just dissapeared! 5 days Later  when I brought the car back to have the navigation software installed, the car ended up in the shop for 68 days, thats right, 68 DAYS! needless to say we got deep onto California Lemon Law over this car. The sevice departmet was good about it, but Pete was not! I told them that I did NOT want them to deposit the down payment check until I had settled the case with Chrysler, a very reasonable request. Pete Shaver was rude and nasty and treated me like I was some kind of criminal bent on ripping him off for the $2K. I told him multiple times that once the matter was resolved I would honor my commitment. Well, that was not good enough for him. Not only was he rude and nasty about it, and accused me of trying to rip him off, he had his business office deposit the check BEFOR the issue was resolved. I put a stop payment on it. Once the matter with Chrysler was resolved, I paid the $2K. Then, I wanted to cancel one of the things I had purchased, that I did not know I had purchased! Some kind of a GPS trackng thing that cost $995. I remember when I bought the car the finanace guy went over everything so fast, I dont recall him telling me about it. I contacted the dealership to cancel that thing 6 weeks ago, I was told then that it would be 4 to 6 weeks for the refund which goes directly to Ally Financial, the leasing company. So today I noticed that Ally had not rceive the refund. I called the dealership, they said they had no record of it. The manager in the business office told me she would call me back after she did some research. She did and told me that Pete refused to issue the refund, like the crook he is! First he screws me blue on the car and then he wont refund me for something I did not want in the first place. Now I have a car with a horrible repair record that I owe $35K on that is worth, at best, $18K, hows that for a good deal? I'll bet on a trade I wouldent get $15. The car is a piece of junk, as I was told by no less then 2 Chrysler technicians one who works for Mr. Shaver. Way to stand behind your product fellas! When I first spoke to Pete Shaver he assured me that this car because of the model and equipment would be easy to get out of within 6 months, I believe his words were that I should be able to trade out if it in 6 months, he told me that knowing that the payment was much higher then I could afflord, I trusted him, and he burned me. Now I am stuck with a $824 a month lease payment with no way to get out, and he had to know that when he sold me the car, what a horrifically despicable person. People like Pete Shaver are the reason the car business has the reputation it does. Oh, and I inadvertently left a set of jumper cables in the Jeep when I traded it in and when I went back to retrieve them, they were gone, stolen by someone in the Pete Shaver universe. Stay away from Chryslers, stay away from Huntington Beach Chrysler Jeep, and above all else, stay away from Pete Shaver!",1,5,1028
52985,22-Jan-15,"My experience with this dealership can only be described as a totally farce.

Having to move from the east coast to the LA area for a new job, I needed to find a car quickly and remotely. After lots of searching I found (on AutoTrader) what appeared to be a great deal at this dealer. Since I lived in Washington DC, I wanted to put a deposit down and secure the car. I called the dealership and spoke with Francisco. He seemed to not really know much about the car or how anything worked at the dealership. Eventually I got the information I needed and made an offer. Matt - the 'internet manager' - called me to say that they'd accepted my offer. After making the deposit (which for some reason took three people to get right and an inability to use the mute button on the phone while they fumbled and cursed in the background), I asked Matt to send me a breakdown of the cost, registration, taxes, etc... and that I'd be in several weeks later to pick the car up. Two weeks later and I still didn't have any of the information I asked for. Meanwhile, Francisco called me several times and asked if I was still interested in the car. After reminding him that I'd already purchased it, I further reminded him that I hadn't received the requested paperwork. At this point I'm already suspecting that these guys are totally incompetent, but couldn't imagine that they'd screw up any more. I was wrong. Very wrong. Three weeks after putting down the deposit and two days before I was to fly out to LA to start my new job, I get a call from Matt: 'We accidentally sold your car.' He said he'd tried calling me a week ago when it first happened but 'for some reason the phones weren't working.' When I pressed him for more information, he tried to sell me a another car for the same price. A few minutes later he said 'Sorry I didn't get back to you sooner but I just found out yesterday.' WHAT? At that point I asked for my deposit back and to call me when the refund was processed. Two days later and I've still not received any deposit refund, nor has anybody returned my calls. THIS PLACE IS A JOKE! DO NOT BUY FROM HERE - ESPECIALLY OVER THE INTERNET.",1,5,135
61479,14-Apr-18,"My 2015 Tacoma, which is still under full factory  warranty.  Ended up in the shop for an air conditioning problem and the voice recognition on the stereo not working.   Also you should know the truck only had 27,000 miles on it as well.  The Freon had apparently leaked out of the air conditioning unit.  And I was informed that the Freon was not covered under the warranty.  Now I’ve owned vehicles for many years and never had to have the Freon recharge after 27,000 miles.   The dealership charged me for the Freon. And told me that they could not find anything wrong with my voice recognition on my stereo.    I paid the bill and went on my way.  Two months later the air-conditioner failed again and the  voice recognition is no longer working again.    I brought the truck back to the dealership for the air-conditioner and voice recognition. And they said that they found a bad seal in the air conditioner which they warranted. And told me that they updated the firmware in my stereo so the voice recognition would work now.  The air-conditioner is now working. But the voice recognition failed again three hours later.  The thing that really bothers me is that they charge me for the Freon the first time and did not refund my money after they found the problem was indeed a factory defect. I think they should’ve refunded my dollars that I paid for the Freon the first time. And now I have to take my truck back in again to get the voice recognition fixed. again! ",1,5,-1

They failed in following through with my email messages and locating a 2016 Toyota RAV4 Limited AWD. I found the one I like at another Toyota Dealership. Later, I called the parts department at Roseville Toyota to see what they charge for labor and accessories. They were considerably higher including labor over and beyond Redding Toyota. They wanted to charge 1500.00 for Cilajet. Redding Toyota wanted 795.00. I was referred to sales, Oleg, Finance Dept. He said that he can meet the price of Redding Toyota and had a coupon for 200.00 less. (600.00 for the service--great). I tried working with him and reminding him for 3 weeks on all the above. He failed! Also there was a refund due to me for a Tire/Wheel policy and Dent policy...pro-rated. I sent a certified letter to request the refund. They did not communicate with me. They also sent the refund to Toyota Financial Services rather than sending it to me. I had to work all the hassle and contact their Finance Manager, Jessica. Of Course, she's going to protect the employees knowing full well they really fouled up in a big way. I will not do business with them any longer.

492,09-Oct-18,"I didn't appreciate the treatment I got from one of their sales reps - one Mr. Morales. I had simply and politely asked if he would talk to me about pricing via emails. I am physically impaired and on the cusp of having a major back surgery which will require three months of recovery. Both for the comfort an Audi provides, and the performance of the sporty Q7 3.0, I thought the anticipation of driving this SUV, post surgery, would lend itself to my recovery quite nicely. Beginning the last leg of my long career as a minister, I was also enamored by the notion of providing my long-suffering wife a sort of sybaritic token of appreciation for her faithfulness to me in spite of our simple lifestyle, thus far marked by the deliberate avoidance of luxury and ease. 

Unfortunately, the response I got to my simple request was negative - chalk it up to ""company policy,"" the first email read. I politely responded with:

""I hope that's not the case, but if so, I appreciate your help. Thanks again. ""

The next response was curt and dismissive: 

""That is the case. So call me if you change your mind.""  

So imagine my surprise when a salesperson from Walters Ontario advised me that I had been mislead:

""I am sorry to hear you were told that Terry, that is not correct info. I would love to talk pricing before you get down here to make the process fast and seamless. What is the best offer you have received? Let me see if I can beat it. ""
 
The only logical conclusion was that Mr. Morales did not want/need my business - a determination I passed on to a Ms Kenisha, also of Walters Riverside, when she inquired as to why I had stopped communicating. 

This produced a, seemingly, contrite screed from Mr. Morales, but which also contained false impressions about my pricing preferences that were based on a second-hand conversation he, apparently,  had with his manager. The email also requested my absolute, non-negotiable criteria so he could ""check the inventory."" I responded with four stipulations: black, 3.0, premium plus, and 2018 pre-owned. 

Mr. Morales sent me back one result . . . white. 

This wouldn't have been so annoying if I hadn't already found THREE other vehicles online that matched all my prerequisites from the Walters Auto group's own stock! The very dealer's stock Mr. Morales claimed to represent! 

And if that wasn't enough, I explained this to him and sent him an example of what I had found which was more affordable, fewer miles and - did I mention - met ALL my criteria. 

You would think, at this point, it couldn't get more ridiculous. Well . . . you'd be wrong. In Mr. Morales' endorphin overloaded hubris, he had the temerity to blame me in an email dripping with condescension: 

""Are we switching criteria again? What you sent me is a Premium. Are we okay with Premium now or do you still want a Premium Plus?""

First of all, what does ""again"" mean? I have only had, from day one, a single list of criteria and that list was clearly stated once and only once. Any criteria Mr. Morales assumed he had, could have only come from a second-hand source, and even that source was guessing because I had, up to that point, not been asked. 

Secondly, he was clearly and demonstrably wrong. The fact that I had to send him a screenshot OF HIS OWN CAR - which read in capital letters at the top of the ad ""2018 Q7 3.0 PREMIUM PLUS"" - killed any and all credibility for Mr. Morales that remained. 

Hours later, while surfing through my undisclosed list of Audi's which I had culled from the internet weeks before, I noticed that several of the VINs had dropped in price. Curiously, all the Walter's Auto Pre-Owned 2018, Premium Plus, 3.0, Black, Q7's - the three that perfectly met the requirements I provided Mr. Morales ""to better serve me"" but that he had yet to offer - had gone up in price. One as much as $2,000. 

At that precise moment I began to laugh at the absurdity of it all. I had been duped. I had come in earnest, but I had failed to avoid the cesspool of profiteering, bent sales reps, and stereotypical used-car chicanery.",6,5,-1

Audi took care of the front lic. plate after putting up a fight. I had to actually sent him the ordinance from CHP for them to install the front bracket. I also noticed that the all weather mats were missing so when i requested those Romen in a text replied if he has another used car he would give the one's in that car. He had the car i notices in their inventory but they backtracked on the promise. They offered me a $ 30 discount (hand out of sought) which I refused.

I've given Walters Audi ample times to rectify the issues, and feel completely taken advantage of.  On August 25th, 2017, my husband and I purchased a brand new 2018 Audi Q5––on the way home from the lot a service light came on.  Our brand new car has been in the service department with numerous malfunctions more days then in our possession.  Steering wheel malfunction, rear hatch sensor not working, navigation screen black/frozen, garage door sensor not working, trim piece fell off twice, the list goes on and on...  The car was in the service department for SIX days straight, and after only having it back one day, another malfunction––back in the shop for SEVEN more days.  Our sales rep was Isaac Ordinola; we bought the car without questioning the price or even seeing the actual car.  We trusted he knew exactly what we wanted after we went over the specifications numerous times.  He could not find us a white car with all the options we were looking for ""in all of California"". We ended up with another color but he failed to say it was a lower model with less options. Not only did we receive a defective car, but it was not even the one we thought we were purchasing.  We immediately started calling and emailing Isaac Ordinola, the general manager Jon Kienle, Dan, etc... and have received NO RETURN CALLS NOR EMAILS.   As of today September 21, 2017 we have no answers... To add insult to injury we do not even have the spare key, which they have promised to on six separate occasions to ""overnight immediately"".  We felt it was only fair to replace the car, but quite honestly it has been such a headache and I'm not sure I even want an Audi anymore.  ",6,5,298

1847,30-Dec-19,"I took my 2016 Q7 for a couple of services to Audi Oxnard which is the closest dealership to where I live. The first service was a 10000 mile check. The second was again a regular check and an oil change and an update. Each time they needed a whole day to complete the job. I was promised to be notified after the work was completed. In both instances I never received the call but had to call myself several times to get the status of my vehicle.
In September 2019 I traded in the Q7 in for an e-Tron. As Audi Oxnard is the closest dealership I wanted to give them a chance to get my business. The offer that they gave me was so bad  that I left without buying the vehicle at the Oxnard Audi dealership. Instead I purchased the car from the dealership were I got the Q7 three years before for a much better price.
 A few days ago I purchased another Audi. This time I did not even bother to to go out to Oxnard as their selection of the model was limited. Therefore I ended up getting my A8L at a different dealership. I had problems with the setup of my Audi App and needed help. So I turned to Audi Oxnard. I should have been warned from my previous experiences! Cesar from the service department referred me to a sales person. His first reaction after me explaining my problem was to ask me were I bought the car. He was very unenthusiastic and told me only because he is a “nice person” he would try to help me. After being in the car with me for less than 60 seconds without a result we went inside the dealership to his computer. My App was already set up on the phone and just needed some more input from Audi. Suddenly he decided that his help would stop right here and sent me back to my vehicle advising me I should try myself. Of cause this didn't work as he didn't submit the missing data. I went back inside, the person that I talked to was gone, and again asked for help  in their service department. In a rather brisk tone I was told that Audi Oxnard was not willing to deal with my problem and I should turn instead to the dealership where I bought the car. Cesar was friendly but I am not mentioning the other names as I don't want anybody to get in trouble.

We agreed to speak on Sun am and work out the details. I called him Sun morning at 8 am after my duty and asked him if the car is still available and I'm still good to jump on a train for a 4 hour ride and to see the vehicle and he said yes with 99% certainty. Since they didnt open until 0900 and it's only 8 he was not certain if the vehicle was sold the night before but 99% that it didnt and I should be good. So I jumped on Amtrak @0908 arriving Oxnard 1330. @1138 while I was on the train, he texted me ""I am so sorry. But they just sold the Lexus. I feel terrible."" I texted him saying that I'm on my way to him and even called him since I couldn't believe what I just read. He replied to me""I know. I am with a client now."" The least you can do is talk to me because I'm also your client! I replied to him ""I guess I catch the next train back to Oceanside. I thought we already have a deal. That's just not right"" and his reply ""I hear you. But it is an advertised car and we cannot hold a car legally."" I went and saying that not getting a deal done is part of the negotiations but not even to see or make a deal after making a trip to Oxnard is unacceptable and saying sorry over text is not right....crickets after that.

After hearing this my boyfriend went to the dealership everyday for a week trying to figure out what was going on. Everyday he got the run around. They said things like, ""I was on hold with the bank for hours"", ""I couldn't get a hold of the Finance Dept."" and ""I'll find something out tomorrow."" 

We spoke to Steven Dombrovsky the General Sales Manager and he was the worst. He even went as far as saying to us, ""I'M GOING TO SPEAK TO YOU LIKE I SPEAK TO MY KIDS"" and he called us STUBBORN just because we didn't want to sign another contract for a higher APR and higher monthly payments. After speaking to him we went from doing anything to keep the car, to just wanting to give it back! He said he sold our trade in vehicle to a private auction and that he would give us the trade in value instead. Even though the contract we signed clearly states that he had to give back any down payment and trade in vehicle if there was a breach in the contract. 

The only relief we got was when we finally called Audi Customer Care. They were amazing! They called the dealership to resolve the situation and by the end of the day Ron and Audi Cust. Care called back letting us know that they would be giving back the trade in vehicle and down payment. We were so relieved and finally got the car back on June 24, a MONTH later! 

Ron said that we would get our down payment in the form of a check the mail. We contacted him about once a week to get status on this. He said he didn't know when we would be getting it. By the 3rd week he said we should have gotten it by now and that he would call their Financial Dept. We didn't hear anything from him. 

So we called Audi Cust. Care a second time! They contacted the dealership and Ron called back that same day and told us that we can pick up the check. When my boyfriend got there, Ron began with the excuses and said there was a mix up. 

This was the worst experience we've ever had with a dealership. My boyfriend and I are both in our late 20's, but we were treated and talked to as if we were kids. I don't know how a dealership can run with a Sales Manager like Steven. This whole situation took nearly 2 month and only way anything was resolved was with the help of Audi Customer Care. I advise everyone to steer clear of DCH Audi of Oxnard.",6,5,62
1852,05-Sep-19,"To make a long story short, I was a firefighter with bandages around my neck from a surgery to fix a fractured neck. We brought an end of lease car in and salesman Robert talked my wife into looking at a new car, I needed to be sitting down due to the neck pain, so my wife is looking at cars at night in the rain. Worst time to but a car, but Robert showed my wife a car which he said was brand new. When we went to sign the contract, it had “used”  on the top of the contract, I asked if it as used because it did have 272 miles on it. The salesmanager indicated  that the car was brand new and the used car box was incorrectly marked, I asked about the high mileage and he said that it’s from the test driving. 272 miles of test driving????? When we got home and looked at it in the morning, each corner of the car was damaged and a large oil/ grease  stain under the passenger floor mat. After two weeks of complaining, Manger Steve says he’ll take care of us. Once here they continued to lie, until Robert tells us that a lady bought and two weeks after she buys it, her husband tells her to take it back. Audi accepts it with the 272 miles and sells us this car saying it’s brand new. Robert said he saw the damaged corners and. a floor mat was ordered. Steve said he wanted to make things right and was going to give us a great deal. The great deal was that he was going to use a trade in value from the used car that they said was new and apply it to the a car my wife and I picked out. So Steve wanted us to pay him $11000. In addition to full price. So it would have been $54000. for a $43000. car.  he finally realised that I wasn’t going to take his crap and I threatened to sue he and Audi. People shouldn’t be in this line of business if they are okay in lying   I do not recommend this Audi dealer for buying or servicing. ",6,5,-1

1856,01-Sep-18,"After working out a potential trade-in deal over the phone with a wonderful salesman (Larry Ellis), we drove up 110 miles on a Saturday to get make our choice.  Larry was extremely helpful and patient, and was able to work our trade out on a very nice 2016 Q5 TDI (with 17k miles on it); this is where the goodness ends.

We started in the finance dept. with a young lady, who continually tried to pressure us into purchasing the Audi care package, even saying she ""couldn't believe we weren't buying it"" and that ""everyone buys this"", like we can't think for ourselves.  Financing is about just that, financing. All of the decisions about add-ons are the decision of the buyer, and the finance team should just stay neutral (or remain quiet) if they don't get their commission from an up-sell. Also, finance should never comment on how poor they think a warranty from USAA is; I love USAA and they have been awesome with warranty service for us in the past.

We took delivery of the car and got about 5 minutes of an overview on all of the controls on the vehicle; that part needs a little work as well. As we left the dealer lot, and our low air tire light gauge came on, so we returned to the dealership.  nce we arrived, we were greeted by Andy Sasso (very helpful) and Stephanie Trejo (not so helpful). After explaining our issue (low tire pressure) Stephanie took the Q5 back to put air in the driver’s side rear tire.  After going back and having it looked at, Stephanie came back and said the tire had a nail in it, and that we could stop anywhere on the way back to Laguna and have it repaired. I reiterated that we literally just drove it of the lot. Larry Ellis came out and said he would take it to a few local places, and see if he could get the tire repaired.  I was told that DCH Audi Oxnard would pay for the repair, once I had the tire fixed/patched.
After around 30 minutes, Larry came back and said that all of the tire stores had at least a three hour wait, and he didn't want us to have to wait that much longer before heading home; we had already been at the dealership over 6.5 hours.   Since the service team stated the tire just needed a patch repair, we felt confident enough to drive it back to Laguna Niguel and get it repaired.  We did arrive home, and parked it in the garage until the following morning.

On the following day I drove the Q5 up to a Big O tire store and asked them to review the tire for a repair. After looking the driver rear tire over (and the others) the manager called me out to show me the tires.  The driver rear tire did in fact have a nail in it, but all of the tires were severely cracked, and they said they were so unsafe, that they were not permitted to make any repairs.  I contacted the Audi DCH salesman (Larry) and told him about the concerns.  Since Larry was off on Sunday, he said he would bring it to Management’s attention on Monday.

 On Monday, Larry contacted me and said that the dealership was not going to be responsible for any more costs associated with the Q5; however, the dealership was willing to let me buy my Yukon (trade vehicle) back, and they would buy me a set of tires.  What???? I 100% disagreed with that approach, and pointed to the fact that the dealership signed off on a vehicle inspection report, showing the vehicle was safe to drive, and in good working order; obviously, not the case.
Next, the discussion escalated as I continued to pursue replacement tires, since the dealership stated the vehicle was safe, and in good order.  Larry contacted me again stating the dealership was willing to let me bring the Q5 back, and have my Yukon back (basically tearing up the contract), and negate any right of rescission - since I didn't pay for it in the finance department.  I 100% disagreed with this approach as well, so he took that back to management.  One final call back stated that the dealership was willing to come down to Laguna with my Yukon (and give it back) while taking back the Q5 back to Oxnard - again, tearing up the original contract.  What?????

The dealership has owned their responsibility on two different occasions, but not willing to pay for new tires.  What????

I took it upon myself to call Goodyear directly, since the tires only had 17k miles on them, and they were extremely helpful.  After reviewing the severe tire cracking issue with Goodyear Corporate, they agreed to have me get replacement tires, and only have to pay for the installation.   Huh, why couldn't Audi Oxnard have done this before selling the car; not a very good inspection.
I was able to get the tires replaced, and only had to pay $127 for 4 brand new tires.  I communicated this information to Larry Ellis, and asked for the dealership to pay the $127 to make it right.  I mean, you sold me an unsafe vehicle, permitted us to drive down to Laguna Niguel on these bad tires, and now acted like it was our problem; wrong.

The dealership has gone ‘radio silent' since the new tire installation, and will not own any piece of this poor inspection process; apparently mechanics outside of DCH Audi Oxnard don't know what they’re talking about.  Two tire places agreed (in writing and with photos) that these tires were unsafe.   
I will be filing a complaint with the State of California for the poor ownership of the dealership, and the fact that I had to do the legwork to get the tires replaced -at a minimal cost.  All the dealership had to do was to agree to pay the installation fee on the new tires, and own their inspection process needs work.

I cannot give the dealership (especially management and finance) any kind of rating other than poor; it was exactly that, and potentially life-threatening.  The sales team (Larry Ellis and Andy Sasso) were very good and extremely helpful.

This is very difficult when you have an 8 week old and 2 year old and two full-time working parents. Plus, CarPlay in audi doesn’t work with iPhone X and they claim it’s an iPhone problem and said “oh well we can’t do anything about it.” Pretty BS to me! also they don’t have loaners available for service which sucks when your dealer is 25 minutes away from home.

Secondly after bringing in the car for service within the same day let us know they didn't have the parts and it wouldn't be ready for 5 days. No loaner was offered or given so I ended up with no car for the entirety of that time, and as someone who is hardly home and goes places often, that was a terrible experience. I just can't understand how a company could knowing leave someone without a car for that time and the customer service not do anything about it.",6,5,1117
1859,15-May-14,"I went to DCH Audi to see what they had in used car inventory. I was originally looking for a Ford Edge, but seeing as they didn't have one that they could get in my price range I asked the salesman what they did have in my price range. He looked through his system and couldn't come up with anything when the manager hollered out to show us a 2005 Volkswagen Touareg that was on the lot. The salesman jumped up very eager to show us this car. Car looked nice outside and in, minor spots of use but nothing unexpected. The salesman and manager did their ""number crunching"" and pretty much did whatever they had to do to get us in this car. I thought it was great at first seeing as they dropped the price a bit and everything to get it in our loan range. Little did I know this car was no good. We got the car, loved it for about the first three months, ran fine and is a very strong and sturdy car just like we wanted. Went out to the car one morning and it wouldn't start. We thought we maybe just left a light or something on so we jump started the car and went on about our business. Car wouldn't start again when we left where we had gone. Long story short, I replaced the battery but continued to have the same problem a few days later. I called the dealership and asked what was going on and all they told me was ""you didn't get the extended warranty so we can't help you."" I argued with the service manager for a short bit and he agreed to look at the car but said he would give me two free hours of ""diagnosis"". I took the car and they Completely wasted two hours of my time doing something that should have only taken about thirty minutes then he wanted to charge me $125/hour to diagnose a car that they sold me not working. I told him no and went elsewhere and the car has been through three batteries and over $1000.00 worth of service and still does not start. THEY SOLD ME A LEMON! and did not want to do anything to help me. Now that I look back at it, they weren't ever helping me with price to begin with, they were just eager to get this car off of their lot and I was the perfect candidate due to having very limited loan parameters. I am now stuck with this car upside down on my loan and it has been nothing but money lost and headaches. I would not recommend this dealership to anyone Ever!",6,5,8

2364,31-Dec-17,"I brought my Audi Q7 for a fuel flange recall repair. 3 days later. I went to pick up my car and the driver seat and the side mirrors were adjusted from my usual settings. I went ahead and tried to adjust it back and the driver's side won't budge. It was around 630PM and Natalie, my service advisor was no longer around so I left my SUV for them to check it. Same thing happened about 4 years ago while I was picking up my vehicle. The passenger side mirror had the same issue when I was picking it up. I was told to come back the next day since the advisor had gone home. When I came back the next day, I was told that they won't cover repairs since I took it out from the lot. They said they spoke to Brock Temple(Manager) and there's is nothing that they can do. Ever since then, I had been bringing my car to Audi Circle and for every service, I started a habit of checking my mirrors during pick-up. I never had a problem so far until I had this last service with Audi Pacific. 

I came in the next day and I was let in at the manager's office. I spoke to Brock and Natalie and told them that I brought it in working. The fact that somebody adjusted it means that it was working when the car was in their lot. I was told excuses, susch as “car can break at anytime” and was even told to wait while they check with Audi Circle. Brock made a sarcastic comment ""I hope you're not going to blame me about your battery too!"" Since they were suggesting to replace my battery. Since I need to leave because I still have business appointments, I asked them if they will cover the repair. I was told by Brock ""I'm simply not buying your story"". I don't know why they held me to stay if this was the case. He told me that I can pay for the part and they will install it for me as suggested by the Service Foreman.  I told him that I am really frustrated  since this was the second time that it happened and left the dealership. I left a message with Natalie to call me when the part comes in. It's been more than a week and I still have not received any call back.  I expected a better customer service from this dealership.

I sent a request to test drive a car (Mid December 2016) and they called me the next day and I purchased the car on the same day! Everything was nice, smooth, and friendly as long as they want to take your money! So what was the problem? ....

Episode 0: Finance Rate
I had two options to purchase the car! Cash out or finance! Since I have a good credit score, I decided to finance my car. They offered me 3.9% which was surprisingly high! I asked them to check with CRB or BoA and as I was expecting, the rate was dropped to 2.39%!
At the end of the day, the difference between 2.39% or 3.9% would not hurt me financially and I am pretty sure would not make any difference for the dealership... BUT they did not do their best to find me the best deal and it should have triggered an alarm for me!

Episode 1: License Plate
The previous owner had a customized license plate which he/she took it with himself/herself and the dealer put a placard inside the frame. Since the car did not have a license plate the dealer is supposed to submit all the necessary documents to DMV within 48 hours for permanent license plate and registration! About two months after I purchased the car, I called DMV and they said they have not submitted anything for my license plate! I contacted the dealer and they said that they thought that the license is under the dealer's placard!!!!!!!! That was funny for me because they were the ones who explained me about the customized license plate and all the related fees! They emailed me the ""Application for license plate"" on February 20th, to complete my application process .... As of now, the registration is voided as it is only valid for 90 days and I have to rent a car to go to work!!!!!

Episode 2: Extended Warranty
I paid for the ""Platinum Coverage"", the only extended warranty that they offered to me. About two weeks later I figured out that there are better warranties available in the market. Therefore, I called them and canceled the warranty as it had 1 month free cancellation period! At the time, they told me that it would take 6-8 weeks for the money to hit my account! 12 weeks after ... neither I nor my bank has not received the money yet!

Episode 3: Customer Service
Someone called me from the dealership today (March 18th, 2017) to HELP ME, with all the problems .... BUT he dropped the call in the middle of our conversation! This is indeed what made me to write this long review about my experience! All the money related issues can be fixed, but you cannot disrespect someone and just drop the call!

2370,02-May-11,"BEWARE OF....I purchased (with confidence, I thought)a Certified used 2008 Q7 from Pacific Audi (Torrance)in June of 2010, the car was nice, sales and financing was OK. BUT when I wanted to trade the vehicle in March of 2011 somewhere else, I was shocked to find out that the vehicle had been painted on the right front fender and door,hence being worth $2000 less vs the no paint work value. In disbilief,I went back to Pacific to ask for an explanation. There, the salesman and his manager, without skipping a beat said that ""the car probably had some scratch or something, needing touching up""! followed by presenting a Carfax report that did not show any damage report. This was supposed to make this a non issue, even though they had previous knowledge of it and chose not to disclose it at the time of sale. To make matters worse I had them appraise the vehicle themselves and their figure of $26000, was $3000 less than CARMAX offered me on an outright purchase, just 1/2 mile down the road. I contacted Audi customer relations for assistance and after a week of ""investigation"" all they had to say was that as long as the Carfax is OK and there is no major structural damage, this would not be a disclosure item. Here I am, having paid good money for damaged goods which I cannot re-sell or trade in without taking a beating for what I had no knowledge of. If I had my guards up as if I was buying from any corner car lot then I would have had it checked by a third party but the ""Audi Certified"" thing, ended up to be the catch.

3252,08-Sep-18,"This recent service was managed quite poorly - not the physical repair, but the actions around it. A4 was first brought in Mon AM 8/27 for airbag recall. I typically worked w/ Johnny Borjas but he’s no longer an option. When I dropped off A4, I also reviewed a number of other maintenance items w/ Anthony and I made it clear which ones were required to be done and which were to be checked and reviewed with me before proceeding. The one specific item that had to be repaired was the fuel filler door (any car that you can’t refuel is pretty much a one-ton rock. I rec’d first feedback late Mon 8/27 afternoon, and as the airbag was going to require repair into Tues, a loaner car was offered. Everything was great to this point. When I returned on Tues 8/28 to pick up my A4, I reviewed the papers and I saw that the fuel filler door wasn’t repaired. I reviewed this with service advisor (my apologies as I didn’t catch his name), and I was given an extension on loaner until that repair was completed. The estimate was completion on Friday 8/31 - perfectly reasonable. 

There was no communication from Rusnak service prior to long weekend but one extra service day wasn’t unreasonable. I did make inquiries on car’s status via text msg replies to the original push notification sent by Rusnak Audi but none were answered. The first significant notification of status during Week 2 was a call on Tues 9/4 to say that additional parts were required and had to be ordered. How was this not known the prior week when the “work” began on the fuel filler door on Tues 8/28?

Overall, this engagement was sloppy. The numerous handoffs amongst 3-4 advisors, the parts ordering, the lack of replies to my text inquiries. The one thing that masked much of the troubles was that I had the loaner car, but even that was “returned” on 8/28 and had to be re-issued 30 minutes later (see above). 

So while the repair was apparently completed correctly, the overall experience wasn’t anywhere near the level of service that I’ve previously had at Rusnak. This you need to know. There were too many hand-offs and a lack of information throughout. ",6,5,-1
3317,17-Mar-18,Very poor customer service from this dealer. Service is set up for the benefit of the dealership rather than the customer. Hard to schedule appointments. Usually get put on hold and then transferred a few times. Often made to feel like it was an imposition to request a loaner. Several times car was not ready when promised. Service personnel (Gonzales) are more interested in pitching you to give them a good review in dealer and Audi follow ups. So much that the two times I expressed my displeasure with service I never got a follow up from either the dealer or Audi asking for feedback on my experience. Seems kind of dishonest to me to suppress negative reviews. I did not have any of these problems at another Audi dealer (Ontario Audi).   ,6,5,154

Tough review on yelp one star. ""Don't buy a car from Rusnak unless you like waiting for service""

The sales guy David Yee was excellent. After that, service is impossible to schedule and gain a commitment for how much time it will take.  ""Drop your car off for 4-6 hours"" is the basic answer. Don't buy the extended service because getting something done takes 10-12 calls to schedule and 2 trips and great frustration. I can't imagine doing this for the life of the car.

- A second key: As a customer i spent over 5 hours getting my second key? Most people get 2 keys when you buy a nice car, or any car. I had to schedule a day to go back, wait for a really nice guy to come out and say, hey our computers are down you'll have to schedule another appointment to get your key. I asked why he didn't call me and it never occurred to him. That second trip took only 2 hours? 
- Schedule a detail to estimate a scratch: After a cart bumped my car I needed to have it washed and estimated. Over two weeks of calling with no answer and leaving my name and number the answer is from the receptionists ""drop it off for 4-6 hours"". Really

David Yee, who no longer works there, is the only person to return my call.
I spoke to the sales manager Chris P. and ask for a cost to return the car to Rusnak after 8 weeks and 2000 miles. Still waiting for that return call he promised",6,5,-1
3678,25-Jun-15,"Seriously, one star is more than enough for this shop. 

We bought an Audi A3 these days and it turns out the manager is playing some tricks on the price we shake hands on. We agreed on the deal the first day and we did all the paperwork that day. But we didn't receive the car since it was in transpiration from Orange County. That cool, and we just hold till the next day. It was odd that the manager bring up another paperwork to me not mentioning anything but financial program was changed. I sighed the paper without deeply looking onto it because I trusted this team. However, I realized there was 1500 dollars more than the price we agreed and signed the first day. 

Now, the manager Eric explained that it was my problem that my income doc cannot get Audi fanantial approved. Holy xxxx, Audi fanantial? Lucky me, first time to hear of it! 

xxxx happens every time, but this is our recent horrible experience with this store, looks like they don't really care about small businesses. They are lack of professional of explaining things ahead. They are not patient when setting up the price. Dealers are nice and helpful, but that manager is busy of making money.

3687,21-Feb-15,"You be the judge...

Had been trying to work a deal with these guys for a few years. (EVERYTHING you read about Omega Chambers is true. He's awesome)  We called them and the salesperson (Beshoy) said that they had exactly what we wanted - black CPO (Certified Pre-Owned) A3 extremely low miles from the loaner pool. My wife hustled over to the dealership. In the 53 minutes it took for her to get down there the car had been sold. When she asked why we weren't called, he shrugged and said he had been busy. I get there and Beshoy tells us that he will make us a good deal on another car. We settle on another A3 from the loaner pool. It has features we really don't want or need. We ask about a new A3 and Beshoy informs us that he doesn't have any new A3 cars on the lot for less than 36K. He got the sales manager to begrudgingly drop the price of the CPO A3 by 1K. We are told that we will be financed through Audi Finance. We were there from 1PM past 8PM. My wife missed a meeting she'd scheduled. Less than a week later, the right rear tire splits. While Audi roadside is on the way, I contact Rusnak Audi service and our salesperson Beshoy. The service manager says there's nothing they can really do and that I probably ran over something in the road. He tells me to drive around on the spare (small temporary spare, NOT full sized spare) for a couple of days and bring the car in the following Monday, but it's extremely doubtful anything can be done. I emailed a picture of the tire to Beshoy.  I drive to a tire store and purchase 2 new tires so that I can function. I had a least 100 miles a day of freeway driving that weekend and the spare was not built for that. I contacted Continental Tire and they were MORTIFIED. They asked me to simply go to any tire store that carried their product and they assured me the tire would be replaced free of charge. And they did replace the tire free of charge. This was before they even saw the picture. After I sent them the picture they were in disbelief. When I connected my mobile phone to the car, I lost features that are essential to the way I function, work and even listen to music. I called Beshoy and he told me - twice - that I needed to come in and have another tutorial. I advised him that I am a consultant for the company that makes my phone and it actually is the area of my expertise. When I called Audi customer service and some of my guys in Cupertino, they advised me that those features would not work with MMI navigation plus and Audi connect. We took the car to our detail guy and he asked us about the deep circular scratches on the hood. We were not aware how deep they were and that we would need to get the car wet sanded to get them out. Two body shops and another Audi dealership told us that there was no way the car should have been CPO in that condition. Later we got a letter from US Bank. It was informing us of a loan. Beshoy had told us to our faces that we were being financed by Audi Finance. Of course, that's our fault as we didn't check the paperwork. The person in the finance department never said anything otherwise. We have very good credit and got financed at least a full percentage than we should have. This is all within the first month of ownership. One day, the wife was talking about the car and got so angry we got up and went to Beverly Hills Audi and got EXACTLY what we were looking for BRAND NEW financed through AUDI FINANCE at a much lower rate and the first month was free with much less down and traded the car in to them. And the NEW A3 was CHEAPER than the CPO A3 from Rusnak. My iPhone works perfectly with the different MMI system in the new car and we couldn't be happier. We filed a formal complaint with Audi and never heard from Rusnak Audi. GM, salesperson (Beshoy), finance department, service all SHAMEFUL. But...YOU BE THE JUDGE.",6,5,-1

3772,09-Mar-20,"First, let me take full responsibility as to what happened to me.  I knew what to look out for and it was my own fault.  I am not going to name the sales people but I have nothing against the trainee as he had nothing to do with the beating I took.

Leasing a new BMW was a 5 hour ordeal with high-pressure sales tactics and expert manipulation on their part.  My head was starting to pound and I fell for it.  I got a bad price on the car under the guise of it being the ""Costco"" price, was ""mislead"" (I won't say they outright lied but knew how to dance around my question), and then padded BMW's money factor by about 20%, which I only discovered after the papers were signed.

I have had experience with other BMW dealerships and was never treated this poorly.  Whether or not you are able to catch every move they make, dealing with a company like this is unpleasant at best.

Leasing a $50,000 car should not make one resent the xxxx thing and I look forward to my 3 year sentence being over.  I will definitely never deal with McKenna again and, depending on my resentment of the stupid car over the next 3 years, will likely never purchase another BMW.

It's your money; give it to a dealership who earns it.",6,6,5106
3773,24-Feb-20,"To whom it may concern,

I'll start off by saying I have been a customer of South Bay BMW for more than 5 years. I never had an issue with any advisor until 2 weeks ago when I took my car there for service. I had a horrible experience with Jorge Gonzalez. When I was asking him questions, he was giving me 1-word answers, he was not very helpful, he was unprofessional and very rude. 

On 02/11, I took my car in to get checked out for a few things: my car was making noise from under the vehicle on acceleration while while driving, Jorge said it would cost $215 to do the diagnostic and I agreed. Then, the backlight of the odometer was out, he said it would cost another $215 to find out what's wrong with the backlight because it's a separate issue. At first I didn't want to do it because it's a little pricy, but I eventually agreed to get it checked out. Lastly, my left brake lamp was out. I had changed the bulb a month prior but it still wasn't working, so I asked Jorge to check it out as well. Then, we sat down and he had me sign some papers. I agreed on the $430 to diagnose 2 things on the car, then I asked him to call me if we need to change some parts to discuss pricing because I'm a little bit tight financially right now. He said OK, and he also said ""it would take ONE DAY.""

The following day, 02/12, I was waiting for him to give me an update, either a call or text message, but I wasn't getting anything. At around 1:30pm I called him a couple of times but he wasn't answering. I figured he might be busy or having lunch. So I just sent him a text message. He didn't respond until 3:00pm and all he texted was ""vehicle is waiting to be diagnosed."" Then, I asked him when does he think it will be done. He responded with ""looking at tomorrow"" I still have the text messages to prove this. At this point, I started to get upset because of poor communication that was being displayed by Jorge. He also promised one day, but that was not the case. I understand the shop can get busy but if you're not certain, please don't give false promises. 

On 02/13, he called me at around 4:00pm advising me of what's wrong with the car. He said the noise that the car was making was caused by emergency brake line rubbing on drive shaft and it would cost around $1,600 but I declined. He said I also need to change the carrier and the socket for the left brake light and it would cost $400, but I also declined.. I'll be honest I'm not really a car person, so most of the things he said to me on the phone seemed indefinite and unclear to me, so I asked him if I could come and meet him so I can get a better explanation. I live near South Bay BWM, I told him I can be there by 4:15pm, but he said he was leaving soon, and that it would have to be the following day.

Friday, 02/14 (3rd day), Jorge texted me at 8:06am saying that the car was ready. I got there at around noon. He knew I was going to ask him some questions, but as soon as I got there, the very first thing he told me was ""just go to the cashier and pay"" and he points towards the cashier's direction. Now, I want you to please understand how RUDE and UNPROFESSIONAL that was. Then, I told him I needed to ask him some questions but before I get to finish my sentence, he gave me the ""give me 1 sec"" finger and picked up the phone and made a phone call (or maybe pretended to call someone to avoid me). I waited about 8 minutes until he hung up, then I sat in front of him and I started asking him questions. Just by watching his body language and hearing the tone of his voice as he was giving me 1-word answers, I could tell he didn't want to talk to me at all. Then, I asked him if you provide a copy of the diagnostics and he said ""whatever paper the cashier gives you, that's the only paper you're going to get. What I told you is what's wrong with your car."" At this point, I didn't see any point of talking to Jorge anymore. I just went to the cashier and paid $430. Then, I asked the young lady from the cashiers if I could speak to the service manager and she introduced me to Charlie Kim. I explained to Charlie the situation and I told him I was really upset and disappointed, and he patiently listened and apologized. Then, I asked him the same questions and I asked Jorge and Charlie patiently answered all of them, then he gave me his business card afterwards. I was impressed with the way Charlie handled the situation. 

Overall, it was a very bad experience. Jorge Gonzalez was rude and unprofessional and I had never seen or experienced anything like that at South Bay BMW.

3775,13-Feb-20,"I’d like to bring my worst experience I had from your service team to your attention. The incident just happened today during receiving service from your dealership. 

I made a service appointment a week before and my appointment was at 9 am today. I showed up in your dealership’s driveway on time. However, my service advisor didn’t even come out until 30 mins later. In fact, he sent someone else to check me in. I finally got checked in around 9:30. 

Your team made me wait in the car for 30 mins while other people who came after me got checked in as soon as they arrived or no longer than 5 mins. Once the service was completed, I was advised to go to the cashier to sign the paperwork. I got to share my worst experience with the service manager, Charlie, as he happened to stand there chatting with the staff. 

When I was ready to give the paperwork to get the car pulled out in the driveway, I was asked if the car hadn’t been washed, would I still take it as is. Don’t you think the car should be ready before the customer was advised to go to the cashier and signed off the paperwork? Also, I was asked when I checked in if I wanted the car to be washed and I said yes to the service advisor. 

So I went back inside to speak to Charlie again and explain my frustrations and all of a sudden, one of the cashier staff wanted to join the conversation between me and the service manager. Once I responded to her comment, she got mad and asked me not to talk to her since she wasn’t the one who serviced the car with a rude tone. The service manager had to stop her from misbehaving to me. I didn’t remember her name otherwise I would let you know her name as well but I’m sure you can find out from Charlie.  

This was the worst experience I’d ever had but most importantly I didn’t expect this type of experience from a BMW dealership. This was also my first time getting my BMW serviced at your dealership and your team couldn’t even give me a good first impression. 

I’d had BMW for the past 4 years and I’ve never had to write any complaints to Long Beach BMW. They were always fast and treated customers with respect. Clearly, some of your staff haven’t been trained to meet BMW’s standard. Sadly, I decided I will not go back to your dealership again. 

Thank you for your attention. I hope you understand my frustrations from the experience I had today and I hope you will address this with your staff.

3784,10-Nov-19,"I came into the dealer willing to learn and ready to buy on a CPO i3. Settled on two cars with an agreed upon price, but I needed my wife to drive and experience it herself the next day before selecting one of the two that were identified.  One car was dirty and the interior had a few noticeable stains.  
While the sales person, Wael Gad, said he would get the exterior washed for the next day, I also asked to get some of the interior stains wiped/cleaned.  He stated that they could only do that during a car detail of which only would happen if the car was sold to me!  He was not really motivated to try to help out even though he wouldn’t be physically be cleaning the car himself, as someone else from the cleaning crew would be doing it.  I wasn't asking for a full detail, but simply try to wipe some of the stains off the upholstery to see if the stains could come out or not.  
Plus, Wael wasn't knowledgeable of some of the questions I had about the car (which can be understandable to a point on an electric vehicle) but more importantly he wasn't willing to find someone else there who could answer them.    There are several other examples of my poor experience that I can explain but am leaving out for now. 
The next day when my wife and I decided to settle on one of the two cars, I was ready to buy the vehicle based upon the price we had discussed the day before.  Then Wael came back and told me that that price he gave me was only if I financed the car even though I had specifically asked the day before if the price was for either all cash or financed, which he said the day before that it was the same either way.  I realize that sometimes dealers can get incentives for customers financing, so I asked ahead of time.   
Finally, I asked to speak to his manager, so he brought me to Harlan Seyton, who was sitting behind the counter along with a number of other sales people.   I asked Harlan if I could speak to him in private.  He looked at me and said he was too busy to get up from his chair and speak to me on the side!  What horrible customer service with that attitude.  I do want to acknowledge that Jeff Samhat, who was sitting next to Harlan, got up and we spoke professionally to each other.  However, Wael and Harlan should not be in sales.
I left the South Bay BMW dealership ready to buy that day (on a car that had been sitting in the lot for two months) but left discouraged and disappointed with the lack of customer service from the sales team.  
It doesn’t end, as the next day the CPO Manager, Christian texted me asking if I had any questions.  I texted back asking him to call me back.  However, no response.   What does that tell you…
I ended up buying another BMW at Auto Nation BMW who was very straightforward and trustworthy.  Save your time and don’t shop at South Bay BMW.

I stopped going there years ago but had to bring back my BMW because of a poor tint job( water under tint)They claim I bought a cheaper tint which I would of never done and on my receipt I have no proof because product is NOT written anywhere. They want to give me cheaper non UV blocking tint! This dealership lies so much about everything. They only care about the money, NOT the customer. Service is always trying to get money out of you for anything, tires, alignment, things you don't need, etc. Turnaround Employee rate is high. Wait time for your car is ridiculous.

I asked for a quote on a car, then comes back and says I’m going to quote a payment on a different. What??!!! I asked him to bring me the numbers on both cars, which he did. And that’s all sheet wrote. I asked is that the best you can do, and he said yes. One pass to the manager and that was it.

3802,12-Jul-19,"First off, I have a lot of experience buying and leasing cars, including BMWs. I have also leased a car from this particular dealership in the past and everything went smoothly. However, my most recent experience was very disappointing and I won't be returning unless they make some personnel changes. 

I had a poor experience with Marc Cleary. My lease was coming due and one of Marc's jobs is to review the car for damage. I had an appointment for 10am and arrived a few minutes early and checked in. The receptionist couldn't find Marc and I waited. She paged him again, no response. 20 minutes later, I see Marc talking to some other associates and I had to approach him to remind him of the appointment. He then proceeded to review check the car without an apology. Review goes fine and then he starts to try to sell me a car. 

I let him know what I was looking for and the approximate monthly payment others were quoting me. He scoffed at the payment I gave him and started aggressively asking which dealership I was working with. He then proceeded to have me ""prove"" to him that I had actually received a quote. He was basically insulting me and suggesting that I was lying to him. I proceeded to show him the text message from the other dealership and he became irate and flabbergasted and said there's no way he could come close to that payment. That's all fine. I get it . You can't match the other dealership but there's no reason to get upset and be unprofessional. Maybe he was having a bad day or maybe he's just unhappy with his life in general but he certainly should be treating customers this way. 

I will not be returning unless Marc is no longer there. This dealership lost a customer due to Marc's unprofessional behavior. I ended leasing the vehicle from another dealership, my third BMW lease.

We checked out X2 and he had great recommendations and advice to wait for X1.  We then asked to test drive the X3 and this is when it became clear he just wanted to get rid of us.  He left us on 3 different occasions to go get keys to test drive, each time he came back to clarify what features we wanted the third time we waited at his desk for 20 minutes, it became clear he disappeared so we just left.  We went to another BMW dealership and got the X3 within 2 hours.  Don’t know if the sales person thought we weren’t serious, but we needed a car that day and didn’t have time to wait.

To be clear, I knew this deceptive practice existed, as I had been a victim of it in the past, but I thought it was only executed when the victim/customer arrived at the dealership. South Bay BMW proved me wrong. I had been in talks about a specific CPO car for about a week. We agreed on a price, and I made arrangements to visit the dealership in person later that day to test drive it and buy it. Well, as I was getting ready to head to the dealership, I noticed that some unclear verbiage had been used by the salesperson. When I asked him to clarify that the price we agreed on would be upheld, he pulled the bait and switch. He said that our deal wasn't in fact available, but that he had another vehicle on the lot that I might like. Word to the wise, bait and switch doesn't work--not in person, and not telephonically.

3812,25-May-19,"Be so careful with this dealership.I bought my car yesterday from them, and I regret it so much. This dealership did not take the responsibility, and I believe public should know about this dealership, which their customer service/ professional manner does not fit their ranking.
1) I had seen some other car at Beverly Hills branch, and then called this dealership to ask of they have the same one with keyless option too. The guy checked, and told us they have the same car with all the packages + keyless entry. We went there, took a look at the car, and did not test drive it, just checked the keyless to make sure.On the way back home we found out the guy did not tell the truth and we trusted him, but the car does not have blind spot/lane change amenities which we had clearly told him we wanted. Now we can do nothing just because we trusted them.

2) In finance section, they had changed the  numbers so that we would have to pay $600 more for the drive off, and it was not an honest mistake. Because when we understood and told him, he first made a call and then corrected it. We also had to pay almost $300 extra for a warranty, and we asked so many times why we had to pay, and the finance agent told is this is how the computer calculates and he does not know!!! 

3) Unfortunately, the existing manager was not a supportive one to go to and let him know all about that. When we were talking to him how we have gone a far distance just to see the car and  agree on the price, he told us He would never do do as he respects his own time. I got angry when he told that, but “?” Brought us back, and tried to make the deal, that I wish I had stepped out, or never had gone there in the first place. Even the owner did not respond our claim.

I regret leasing a 56k car from them. Recommend you be careful with theses guys too.",6,6,-1
3813,23-May-19,"I wanted to become an x4 owner, I was forwarded to your dealership through the True Car online app, and was contacted via text, by Will in sales.
I described the model of car that I was interested in, and how much I could spend,  new 2019 X4 and that I would pay $46,000 in cash respectively + tax and registration
Will responded that he has a vehicle for 46,445, with the options I requested Convenience Package and driver assist package. I responded that $46,000 was as much as I could spend. Will replied back with $46,000, so we set up an appointment for 05/22/19.
I arrived at appointment and was greeted by Will, we sat down and Will began completing the paperwork.. to make a long story short, he came back with the following:
-Price of the car would be $46,445.00 + tax and registration
-I cannot write a check for the vehicle, I would have to finance close to $50,000 and make at least 4 payments
I was dumbfounded that he had blatantly lied to me, just to get me to the dealership.
I asked him why he mislead me previously via text, he said that""... me saying that I would pay cash for the vehicle could also mean financing..."" Really come on now. In regards to the financing part, he said that he failed to mention that via our previous texts.. "" I walked away with out a purchase.. A short while after Will sent me an apologetic text saying that he did in fact fail to provide me accurate information, and that he did mislead me, and understands if I don't return to SB BMW.
This type of business tactic is completely wrong, unjust, and should not be condoned by any business owner.
I am also going to send my experience and very poor business practice, along with additional  concerns to BMW America,and the local BBB.

3817,27-Apr-19,"At the end of 2018, I purchased a New BMW from South Bay BMW . The my sales person (not listed here) was amazing. I got the exact car I wanted with the perfect payment to match. Things went down hill from there. Once in finance, I worked with East Lin. Things went ok until I said I didn't want to purchased additional warranties or coverages as I didn't see the added value. His whole demeanor towards me changed. He started talking to me in a condescending way and it was to the point I almost backed out of the car deal. Nonetheless i stuck it out and moved on.

I came in for the ""VIP"" car wash approximately a week later. During that visit, my BMW struck another car or object. I didn't realize it until i pulled it into the sun. I notified the valet team who moves the cars back and forth. They told me they didn't know if I did it when i pulled out. Frustrated, I asked for a manager when I was instructed they didn't work for BMW but an outside contracting company. Not much was done to rectify that situation.

Now the last issue. I had my car towed in for service early one morning with an appointment. After writing up my car, I was informed there wasn't any loan cars available and Id have to rent through enterprise. When I went to the counter, the lady was rude and loud with my personal business and at the end of the interaction told me I couldn't rent a car. I spoke with upper management about the issue and notified my service advisor I would wait for a loan car to come in. Danny McKenna told me everything would get sorted and I'd be on my way.

Farthest from reality. I was contacted by an unknown person at the dealer who told me I would be handled soon. Six hours after sitting at the dealer, I was notified that i was banned from receiving a loan car because I didn't live close to the dealer. That's false, It was a miscommunication on their part. John Hall and Enayat Sharaf were the only one's who could lift that and wouldn't. It was ok to take my 1,500 to service my car however not provide me transportation because they misunderstood something. 

I reached out to Enayat myself to resolve the issue and maintain a business relationship with the service side of the dealer and he didn't return my calls. 

Their VIP program touts free service loaners and car washes however my car always ends up scratched and dirty and clearly loaners are reserved for special clients. I was very loyal to this dealer because the service advisors and sales have always been good to me. Management however, is a different story,

East, Enayat and John Hall need to come off the high horse and see things from the customer side. It's easy to bark orders when you don't know both sides of the story. Loosing one loyal customer might not mean anything however a lot of business comes from word of mouth. My views on BMW as a brand are tarnished.",6,6,200
3819,08-Oct-18,"
Four years ago I went to SB BMW to purchase a car but they gave me a terrible price so I bought it from Riverside. However, I decided to service my car @ South Bay BMW.  Then last year I was looking for a new car for my wife. I contacted the dealer and they never followed up with me. I purchased a car from Keyes Audi.  Everything was fine till my factory warranty and maintenance expired recently. Last week I went to for an oil change. The service adviser told me that I also need spark plug replacement and oil change. I knew about the spark plugs because I already changed them.  I was quoted for $450 (vs $100 for labor and $80 for OEM parts @ 3rd party shop). We moved forward and the service adviser ""Kyle Robinson"" told me that they have a ""service special"" for oil change @ $99 (down from 250). Great? He started working on the paper and when I was about to sign it I've noticed a charge ""Client states perform standard scope per key reading"". I asked what does it mean because the price was higher than the actual oil change. He explained that they need to reset the computer readings after the oil change for just $116 on top of the $99 oil change. (I'm not a car expert but I usually research about cars and I knew that resetting the oil/brake interval is a matter of holding a button for few seconds and then holding it for few more to reset the service interval). I asked him if he wants to charge me $116 for probably 30 sec of work and he said "" Yeah, but it's still cheaper if do that than if you go will the full price oil change $250... I confronted him and he was pissed and he scratched it from the invoice. (I was promised a complimentary loaner when I scheduled the appointment, however, he called an Uber to pick me up. That's fine ... Then a few hours later he called me to tell me that my car is ready. My wife dropped me at the dealership and I paid the invoice. I gave the valet the invoice and 15 min later I asked what happen with my car. Few mins later the valet told me that my car is not ready. It'll take an hour to wash it.

I have owned/leased multiple BMW's including two currently and this was the worst experience so far ... the client advisor that I was directed to even went so far as to tell me incorrect information regarding the BMW wholesale money factor for July (aka buy rate) when in fact such information is well documented in the public domain and verified by other dealers.

4061,13-Mar-18,"He made unprofessional comments throughout our meeting with him the night of March 12, 2018. I came in with my husband and a friend who graciously offered her help to negotiate, since I am not understanding the negotiating process. 

It was already 11:00pm and Alex Shin made us wait for a very long time because he was ""busy"" with another customer according to our salesman, Martin. We understand that but we were expecting that he will be considerate enough that when it was our time to meet him, he would not waste so much of our time since we all want to go home at this point, again, it was already 11:00pm, we were at the dealership since 8pm, we came straight from work, no dinner!

Since we have negotiated the price with our salesman, Martin Dino, we were then referred to Alex to sign the papers. We waited for a long time before we were able to see him. Alex did not even apologize for making us wait for a long time. 

He offered a couple of add-ons such as: Warranty and Wear and Tear. He continued blabbing for such a long time about the add-ons and why I should get it. I told him I would ask my husband and my friend for advise. My husband and my friend both said no, not to get the add-ons and I agreed. I then told Alex that I am not getting the add-ons. 

He then criticized me and said: ""Why are you asking your friend?"" ""You're the one paying for your car not her!"" I was shocked by his rude comments. Embarrassing me, my husband and especially my friend who was just there to help. But he did not stop there. He further continued to tell me that I am making a huge mistake not getting the add-ons trying to make me feel guilty and stupid. At this point, I said ""No, it's fine"", he then said, ""Ok, just make sure that your friend here (looking at my friend w/ a smirk), will pay for your wear and tear!"" 

I was flabbergasted by his comments. I answered and said, ""Well, this is not the first that we are leasing"". I looked at my friend and she was flustered by his rude comments. He saw our reaction that we were not happy with his comments but he did not even apologize.

First of all, he has no right to tell me not to ask friends and family for advise and then telling me that I should have my friend pay for the wear and tear. If I want to get advise from friends and family, that is my prerogative!

He was very unprofessional and his comments are rude and uncalled for. Had it not for the good service by our Salesman, Martin, I would've not signed the papers and took my business elsewhere. Next time, I will think twice before taking my business to your dealership. You also loss a potential customer because my friend was also in the market for an M2. She is going to BMW Long Beach instead. 

It seems that Alex only cared about making a sale and if he doesn't get it, he decides to be a ""jerk"" and an ""xxxxx"" to the customers. Instead of coming out of your dealership happy, we came out upset and disappointed.

I hope that Alex Shin gets reprimanded as his attitude is detrimental to your business. I am giving 2 stars because our salesman Martin was ok, or I would have given it a 1 star rating.

4297,27-Oct-17,"We got called by the dealership to come back and review our new car inside and out, and since we are first time BMW owners we decided to take them up on the offer. We scheduled an appointment, however everything after that point just got complicated and annoying. The rep we initially scheduled the appointment with kept changing it. We got a text the day of and said he worked earlier so asked us to come in earlier, which we did. We live an hour from the dealership and as we are moments away from the dealership, we got a text saying no one will be there to help us.....  with that being said in the 9th hour Kevin came in and saved the day and ran through the car with us.  We were also told we could have a car wash but by the time that was communicated it was too late for us to get back one. 

Overall I find this dealership to be a pain in the xxx and complicated. I think the Ford dealship by the LAX Is more organized than these folks..... and more welcoming.  Also what's the point of offering a free car wash to find when shown up for your scheduled appointments they are not offered.

Bottom line, as we handed over our lease car to obtain a new one, and after negotiating a deal, they told us we could not have the car that we negotiated. Apparently their sale person was unaware that it was not available to lease. ( There is more to it than we are aware of). At that point since our car had been turned in we were carless.  After they tried to get us to take another  one.  of which we said no, they had to give us a loaner and order one for us. While waiting for the car they flunked the course in customer service.

I called into South Bay Bmw and was asking what's the best lease they are offering on the 2016 -7 series. I was connected to this sales man Mike Yaokim  said I can get you this number on this model: over the phone I appreciated the number he offered to me and he was saying how he can make it happen. (My brother has the same exact car just in white at the same price Mike offered)  All I had to do was go to the South Bay Bmw website and fill out an application to get approved or not. I live in Van Nuys which is about an hour drive from South Bay. I specifically told him to tell me if I got approved or not before I drive out. I was in contact with him through text as well. I submitted- I wasn't able to see on my end what the result was so I just asked Mike. He said you're good to go bro come on in saying ""The application is ready for you to sign when you walk in, Im getting the car washed"". I got there and the whole team looked at me all skeptical just because I am young of and Armenian. I even over heard the finance manager- Chris Smith- saying ""this guys gonna get that car"". I was stunned to have come across an issue like this at a Bmw dealership which I am a loyal customer to. They went back and forth looking for a reason to not give me the car. I'm assuming my application was approved when Mike told me that its all good come on down. I asked Chris why I'm not being handed the application to sign and he said it was my call.

 I wasnt expecting this encounter at a BMW dealer.

I took the car to South Bay and the service adviser ignored my complaint.

4541,27-Apr-15,"This is my third BMW dealership due to moving. DO NOT take your BMW to this dealership.  Outside the warranty you will be ripped off, and that’s saying it lightly.  If you are still within the warranty you will be constantly fighting with the commissioned service advisors on covered items.  EVERYTIME  I took it in I had to fight with the service advisor. 3 out of 4 times I had to pull out the warranty paperwork,  Call BMW and had them explain that items were covered.  They finally agreed and repaired it but every time I went in for warranty work they wanted to charge me $1000 for something that was wrong.  Most people would just pay.  Even one of the BMW customer service people said that they shouldn’t be doing that. 

Forget about taking it after the warranty.  I took it in since my check engine light was on and my car was barely running.  According to the service advisor, since my car was over 100,000 miles I had to do some routine maintenance work.  When the service advisor called me back he said the repairs would total $8,245.  That was just for routine maintenance.  I asked the guy why I would spend that much on a car that is barely worth $10K.   I had to get my spark plugs changed and coil since it wasn’t running right.  $1,600 to change the coil and 6 spark plugs.  The spark plugs themselves were $650 for 6.  Bosch plugs are $70 for 6.  The coil was $600 . Again a bosch one, $125.  

Funny thing is the next day I got a call asking about my service.  I said it was too expensive and I asked why the spark plugs were so expensive.  She said that the service manager would call me back.   No call back probably because the guy knows it was a rip off.

Against my better judgement, I made an appointment for October 29th because several items had to be repaired on my vehicle. The advisor was nice and the service seemed smooth until I was told several items where on backorder and that my oil pump control solenoid needed to be repaired because it was leaking. She told me that they would need my vehicle for at least a day. I asked her to keep me posted when the parts were in so they could do everything at once. Over two weeks passed and they claimed that front mats were still on backorder but could do everything else. I called Tammy Hernandez and said it is an hour each way for me to come down again to do a half job. She offered to pick up my vehicle and drop me a loaner on November 14th. I told her that day would not work and that I cannot be inconvenience any longer. She said the only other choice was the following week but that she would get back to me. On November 11th, I received a call from Mark Brodkin and Tammy Hernandez on a conference call. I explained the situation to both and Mark Brodking promised to call me the next day (November 12th) by 5PM. Waited all day for Brodkin to call so I could get the vehicle serviced. At 5:15PM I called another Mini dealer (Universal Mini) to see if the floor mats were in fact backordered. The parts manager said they were not and that I can come and pick them up as he was familiar with the problems with them. He said he would leave them with his assistant as he was leaving for the day. At 5:35PM I picked up the floor mats and they kindly installed them. I dropped my vehicle off at the service desk and asked them to perform all necessary service as South Bay didn't. They smiled and said they get several customers per month who had customer service issues at South Bay Mini. At 5:54Pm Mark Brodkin finally called but I missed his call that stated he would call me later. I returned Mark Brodkin's call a few minutes later but missed him. Called Tammy Hernandez on her cell phone and explained to her my dissatisfaction with South Bay Mini's lack of urgency to provide descent customer service. She told me she would speak with Mark Brodkin and call me today (November 13th). At 11:23AM November 13th, I received a call from Mark Brodking and Tammy Hernandez again on conference call. Mark Brodkin was unwilling to discuss South Bays failures and primitive so called customer service and went on to accuse me lying about leaving messages for Kim (Kelley) Skovold Service Manager regarding a BlueTooth issue back in March. In the middle of the conversation Brodkin started patronizing me and my family and that they could no longer satisfy me as a customer. I told him that he and his staff had an EPIC FAIL in Customer Service and that he was trying to turn things around and accusing me of making things up. He was in fact making excuses for his falures as a manager. For the record, Kim Kelley Skovold did get two calls from me back in March of 2013, in fact she called me on November 11th to discuss my review of her and her department on this very website. Seven months after the fact? She must be kidding. Not only I left her messages in march I stopped by and also called Jeremy Guenther. Never a response from either. I have phone records to prove all of the above and will provide for a personal apology by Peter Boesen and Mark Brodkin. Also left messages for Peter Boesen but according to gate keepers like Brodkin ""he doesn't get involved on this level"". Well, may be that is the problem with this culture of substandard customer service.

4571,06-Nov-13,"Mark Brodkin now owes me TWO detail jobs.  The first time they left my one of a kind historic concourse condition E31 outside overnight next to a series of sprinkler heads.   THE DEALERSHIP NEVER MADE GOOD ON THIS PROMISE.  the next time, they backed my special order 535 into a pole and it took months of pleading before they would take care of that.   Last time I went there, they returned the car to me with grease smudges all over the interior, so I said never again.  It gets worse for this dealership.  All very avoidable too.  Never thought I would find any place worse than Long Beach BMW, but this is it.  And the zoo effect by the nonsensical porters is a total joke -- too many games.

The guys in the Parts Department have always been great though.

Brodkin's job apparently is to go around appeasing people without taking responsibility for anything - obviously it's about eliminating cost and liability for them, and customer satisfaction is not relevant.

So this is now the worst BMW dealership I have experienced in my 20+ years of ownership and 35+ in the family.

4743,31-Jan-12,"Had many service problems that I brought my new car in for. Obsurd problems that would never happen on most any other vehicle that I could purchase. Most of these had to be repaired during the extended warranty which cost us a minimum of $200/visit regarless.  Module to light the headlamps went bad, they refused to fix it cause they could not find the problem. I drove for years on an intermittent headlamp until I found a private repair shop that would bill the insurance. The dealers excuse, was that when I brought it in they didn't see anything wrong. In the process the ignitors headlamp burned out the lamp given that it continued to fire when the lamp would not light which I had replaced. The tail lights shorted out and both assemblies had to be replaced, which they said was not covered by warranty even though I was well within the timeframe.  BMW came up with a ground wire fix to keep it from happening again, but they never took responsibility for it.  The sun shade broke twice during ownership. I was told it was not covered by extended warranty and is still broken today becuase only the dealer can fix a sunroof and I would never go back for any service, unless BMW is paying for it. Other issues: various engine leaks, front left and right window motors, engine mounts, sunroof leaks, overflow coolant container cracked, washer motor failed, returned after service with a loose spark plug wire which caused it to misfire, all belt tensioners had to be replaced and various over charging for maintenance service that cost 2 to 3 times the independant shop rates.",6,7,7

After innumerable email communications and hiding that fact my salesperson was MIA for weeks, they said it was not their problem and refused to reimburse me for it.

4747,20-Nov-11,"I am torn.  I think their service department is great, but their sales department is horrendous.

Long ago, I leased an X5 from them.  A couple days after I drove the car off the lot, they called to say that they screwed up the lease and charged too little.  We buckled and just paid the difference per month when we should have given the car back.  This was in 2002, and I forget the name of the salesperson.  It wasn't Tim.

September 2011, I test drove a car with Tim, and we talked numbers that were way too high.  I thought I was an informed consumer, so I was really offended when Tim made a snide comment about how a lot of consumers do not know how deals work.  Whatever.  I was in no hurry.  And he was right, I knew MUCH less than what I know now.

So now it's time to shop for a car, and I contact Tim to help him out because he helped with the test drive.  By this time, I made my own excel sheet that allows me to expect a range of lease rates based on the MSRP, selling price, MF, etc.  With sites that tell me how much the car costs to the dealer, I was ready to negotiate.

Tim calls and tells me he doesn't have the car I want.  In the previous contacts, I clearly told him what an ideally equipped car is for me and a range of acceptable options because I figured their inventory would be limited.  Anyway, Tim offers a lease rate, which I thought was appalling.  So I told him politely that I would go another direction and make a deal with another dealership.

Tim comments, &quot;Well, I can assure you that you will have a much less delightful experience there than at South Bay.&quot;

While I appreciate the pride he has in his dealership, I cannot work with someone, who trash talks another dealership.  To me, that is unethical.  Of course, this isn't the only reason.  Ironically, the Internet sales department cannot answer and communicate through emails.  I had to repeat some information when my initial contact already had everything they needed to know.  He insisted we talk on the phone when I wanted to just communicate through email before the deal got more serious.  Why claim being an Internet salesperson if you can't work through the web???



As far as the service department goes, they are phenomenal.  Free car washes, any time, as much as you want, is something new I think.  They didn't have this 3+ years ago.  I brought my X5 and 530i here all the time.  They gave free loaner cars, but now, I think they give out any free loaner BMW model.  DEFINITELY beats BMW SF (at least 3 years ago, don't know about now), which loaned me a little Corolla.  I serviced my 530i and received a Corolla for 24 hours.

They also wanted $265 for an oil change.  Are you kidding me?  They wanted another $265 to replace my micro filter.

Today it was 45 minutes WITH AN APPOINTMENT, just for the service rep to take the mileage and accept the keys.  Don't some independent shops actually change your oil in 30 minutes or less?  Ridiculous that someone would have to wait 45 minutes to just drop off a car.  It's not like we pay a premium for the brand or anything.

The wait for a rep would not have been so infuriating had not others, arriving without an appointment, been serviced first.  That defeats the whole purpose of making an appointment.

What really got me upset was that they said that the car needed all kinds of other repairs totaling over $4000.  In addition to the alternator, they recommended the following:  new power steering hoses, new water pump, thermostat, radiator, expansion tank, control arm and other miscellaneous work.  They even said that the tires had some wear on them and they were brand new!  Oh and get this, I recently had changed the battery and got a non-BMW battery since it was 1/2 the price.  They said that a non-BMW battery could even cause problems.  Come on, it's the same voltage whether it comes from a BMW battery or other brand.   

This is a BMW and is supposed to be built to last.  It's why I paid $45k for it.  If it needs $4000 worth of repairs for a 4-5 year old car, something is wrong.

He explained everything they checked and told me that I don't need to change the brake pads yet.However, a month later, I noticed some screeching noise when backing up the car. Called the dealer, they said it might be some dirt stuck in the pads. Since it was on and off, I thought they might be right. It became more frequent and I finally decided to call the dealership.. again. Turned out that I need to replace all 4 brake pads and rotors!! Could've told me that a month ago and saved my rotors, idiots! Not only that, when I picked up the car, it wasn't ready. Plus I had to wait for almost 1 hour just to find out they need to clean the car first. AARGH!! They said they didn't know I was there. What did they think I was doing in the waiting area?? D-OH! BTW, the svc. advisor's name was Jeff, and guess what. He wasn't even THERE to explain about the work being done. I had to READ my copy of bills (which I didn't pay, thanks to the warranty). Later on I noticed they lost one of my tire bolts. Sure made me feel safe driving it. However, they put a new one on as soon as I call them.Third time I brought it in was for oil service. As usual, they found some things need to be done, and what a coincidence, they're all not covered in the warranty! After an hour of discussion and inquiries, I finally agreed to the service. When I took my car (in a dark evening), they forgot to reset the oil change indicator. The next day I noticed that emblem on the hood was chipped and there's a new scratch on my door (driver side). Called them and I brought it in a couple days later. Jeff was really nice in getting me into a loaner, but I was quite annoyed when he said it must be from a rock. Well, the chip was really big and there was a scratch mark on the rest of the emblem. It must've been a HUGE rock and how come I didn't see/hear it?Finally, got a new emblem and the scratch fixed. Took it from the lot on a rainy day (DARN!) and the next day found a new scratch on my driver side window. I'm in a dilemma whether to bring it back and get it fixed but get a new problem, or just don't bring it back at all. I chose the latter.Good thing about this place: free loaners, friendly advisors (when you get a hold of them).Bad thing: poor quality of service (which I think is more important than nice customer service and a free loaner).All in all, I'll never bring it back there. Not after the third, ridiculously expensive visit.",6,8,4
4921,29-Jan-04,"This was the first place I went to when I was shopping for my BMW, since I live like 15 mins away. I just graduated from college and got a job that pays well so I wanted to get myself a nice car. Being young and all, I was there for a good while before anyone wanted to help me. Some of the sales literally saw me but they wouldn't even bother to come over and help. Then Brian came up, whom was quite friendly and helpful. However he wouldn't budge on the prices. I'm a reasonable guy and I just wanted a fair price on the car. The sales gotta make a living too right?! But he was unwilling to budge so too bad. I found another dealership whom was willing to deal with me fairly. Ended up getting a '04 330Ci (fully loaded) and later got my mom to buy a '03 745Li from the same sales guy at the other dealership.

I took my new 330i there for it's 1st service, some minor warranty fixes (trim) & key programming of vehicle functions. I dropped the car off 1st thing in the morning & they barely finished it before closing, and decided to charge me $162 to program my key settings (which I was told would be free initially). Also, they returned the car unwashed & with mechanics greasy fingerprints all over the console, doors & gray headliner (everything was immaculate)!!! I picked the car up at close when it was dark, so unfortunately didn't notice the dirt until the next day. My neighbors receive better service from their Acura dealer... ridiculous. I called the Service Dept. Mgr. the next day (Dan) & he did say they would clean it, but I have to leave the car there most of the day. Nice gesture after the fact, but with the hassle to leave it there, it's easier for me just to detail it myself.",6,8,318

4930,30-Sep-19,"I wanted to write a complaint to BMW North America and wherever I can write complaint to correct how Mckenna treat customers, but I decided to start from here.

I made an appt for Friday(9/27) for my fog light malfunction notice. One of the representative checked the vehicle and let us know the detail of our warranty. Maintenance warranty expired at 36k mileage, but the fog light might be under the regular warranty 50k mileage as long as it wasn't due to any damage. I completely understand how the warranty works so I let him know it's fine.
He let me know that I can pick up the car the next day (Saturday) and offered to provide UBER ride.
I unfortunately needed to get the car back on Friday, so decided to reschedule for Saturday morning.

Something came up and I couldn't go on Saturday, but rescheduled for Monday(9/30).
When I got there, Claudia helped me and she checked the vehicle and let me know the same warranty detail other representative told me, so I let her know that I understand the coverage.

The main difference was that she went to check with the Service Manager Armando and told me due to some damage under the fog light, in order to run the diagnostic I would have to pay $95, and if the malfunction was not due to damage, I wouldn't have to pay. When I let Claudia know that previous representative didn't need me to pay that $95 to run diagnostic and the only reason I didn't leave the car was due to needing the vehicle on the same day. She then tells me that he might haven't seen the damage, and that diagnostics are usually $180 but I'm only doing it for $95 in case it was due to damage.

I was so upset with their service and asked for the manager's business card, and he didn't even come out to explain or give the card himself. There are closer BMW around where I live, but I went to Mckenna, because that's where I purchased my vehicle, but this service made me realize they are not consistent with their service, and seems like they try to charge customers every penny they can.

The scratch below the fog light is noticeable, but the first representative was willing to do the checkup and let me know if it's covered under the warranty, but Claudia / Armando wanted to charge $95 for just doing the checkup before even finding out if it was covered under the warranty or not.

Funny thing is I just came to BMW in Buena Park where it's closer to my house, and they are checking my car as well as fixing the fog light. Much more friendly service, and the manager is actually on the floor checking with his employees and customers to make sure they are getting treated right. Much different environment then Mckenna where the manager is just in his office.

Hope this review helps Mckenna give better service to other customers moving forward.",6,8,77
4931,16-Sep-19,"I bought a 428 from Mckenna about 5 years ago.  I was given inaccurate information from Mckenna's staff which led me to purchase a useless warranty that frankly I am shocked they would even offer to see in the first place!  This 'extended warranty' would add basically zero value or benefit beyond the CPO warranty.  So why would a reputable dealer even offer this to a customer if they're seeking to treat a customer right and create a long term relationship?  Wouldn't a reputable dealer recommend Against a customer paying for a warranty of such little value?!  

Recently I've come to learn that the extended warranty they sold me did not extend the CPO  warranty even though I specifically discussed that point with their staff, who confirmed it would be an extended warranty above and beyond the CPO warranty.  They also confirmed I could transfer it with the car when selling it to another.  I purchased it There would have been zero value in purchasing it otherwise.  

I've attempted to address this issue with McKenna believing it was possibly an errant mistake by their staff who didn't understand what they were selling.  In response to my query, McKenna replied they could sell me an additional extended warranty!  How exactly is this treating a customer properly?  A business gives inaccurate information, and then expect the customer to pay more?!    Incredibly disappointing!  

Maybe I should have scoured the paperwork me intently, but when working with a reputable group you hope to have some reliability in their guiding you with accurate information through the dozens and dozens of pages being signed.  Be wary!",6,8,172

We had arranged financing with our Credit Union prior to our purchase, and let them know of that fact. We filled out an Option Contract, and figured the Credit Union and the Dealership would get everything handled. One week later, and my Credit Union has been leaving messages, and not a single reply from McKenna BMW. The Credit Union knew of the timing of the Option Contract, and Certified mailed the check out. Still no call back from them. For comparison, our last purchase at Porsche Irvine was set up the same way, and went with out a hitch, Dealership and Credit Union worked everything out, and I did not have to lift a finger. Maybe due to the Porsche being a new car and this purchase being a used car? Does not seem like good business to me.",6,8,-1

4950,18-Feb-19,"Much like going to our physician or dentist, many people possess a strong disdain for purchasing a new vehicle or going to the mechanic.  A shared feature of all these professions relies on a large asymmetry of knowledge. Essentially any information told to you we assume to be presented honestly and in good faith, because speaking for the public majority, we wouldn’t really know the difference. What mechanics and a large proportion of the automotive industry unfortunately lack, however, is any sense of integrity or fraction of honesty, as highlighted by the series of unevents unfolding over a period of three months with BMW Mckenna located in Norfalk, CA. 

My  2018 X5 was delivered to my apartment in West Hollywood on November 19th, 2018, right before Thanksgiving. Prior to delivery, minor damage noted on passenger side of bumper in front. Because they were in “such a rush” to sign for the car, car was delivered before I was leaving town for a week, and it was told to me that car would likely be fixed by time I get back (and it would be picked up as mitigate any inconvenience this would pose to me). 

However, this was delayed because it was Thanksgiving.

Then it was further delayed because then they only picked up vehicles on Thursday. 

Proceeding forward through Christmas/New Years, then it was getting further delayed because they didn’t have an adequate amount of staff and didn’t want to “spend the $500 towing it on a flatbed out here and indicates that he (I) don’t care if that’s what Victoria told him.” (Victoria was the customer sales manager, no longer works there….hmmmmmm wonder why?)

I then sent a tactful, yet politely constructed message to Danny Mckenna, which btw, went unanswered by all parties copied in on this message for OVER 48 hours…

“Prior to addressing my most current issue, I would like to highlight I was told to reach out if help ever needed and that my business through McKenna BMW was appreciated shortly after getting my 2018 BMW X5 just a short time ago.

To follow up on that, please refer to content within text message below sent to Danny’s cell phone below on 2/1/2019. I did not receive a response or phone call, so perhaps e-mail as a medium for communication will achieve better success. 

""Good morning Danny! Apologies should this message find you too early, but I did want to relay a bit of feedback regarding the recent leasing of my 2018 X5 xDrive40e. First and foremost, I absolutely love the car. It is my third BMW to date, and is by far my favorite. However, I would like to relay that prior to being delivered, a bit of damage was noted to the front of the vehicle, and even prior to delivery, I was told by various different parties--sales manager, the broker I utilized--that this would be fixed at a time of my convenience, where the car would be picked up from my apt and an equivalent or better loaner car left, while the repair was being completed. I was more than understanding, and with the implied urgency of the deal agreed to these terms. Following this, I was away for several holidays (Thanksgiving, XMAS, New Years), and was told the day of car pick-up would be on Thursday. I have been in excess of 7 calls to the number on the slip provided, only to be bounced around from department to department, only to reach dead ends and have no one return my calls. It wasn’t until my broker reached out, that any sort of response was given, where I was told the car could not be picked up for repair with a loaner swapped as promise. Suffice to say, I’m unsure as to why no one in sales/repair/etc could get back to me, despite numerous attempts to touch base, and also, why the dealership is not honoring what was promised and agreed to both prior and during car delivery? Thanks in advance for clarifying. Apologies for lengthy text message prior to regular business hours. Regards, Dr. Dylan Sallerson”

Subsequently, my broker has spoken with Calvin and GM, who did say, should I drop off vehicle myself, they would provide a rental car at minimum equivalent to mine, or better, to accommodate for the inconvenience and that things would be handled appropriately. 

What is NOT appropriate is providing me with a smoke-infused Cadillac, well below what would be considered equivalent to my current vehicle. 

I subsequently went through the trouble of finding an enterprise location that does have an equivalent BMW to mine (or better) and provided Calvin with the contact details to confirm that it would be OK for me to swap cars. 

Calvin proceeded to say that he was unable to do this, and could only provide a BMW X1 or X3 at best, if I drive back out to dealership to swap. 

Is an X1 or X3 an equivalent vehicle or better?

Please advise as to why this solution seems appropriate, and suggest how this is a reflection of business that is appreciated at your dealership.

Your prompt attention and response to this matter are greatly appreciated. 

Thank you in advance.”

Following this e-mail, communication was extremely sparse, always initiated by me, and I Was frankly meant to feel like they were doing me some HUGE favor, by merely completely something they promised they would do. I’m well aware this car is no an 8 series or 6+ figures, but it’s still an $80,000 which is not an insignificant amount of money. Service should at least ATTEMPT to parallel the product. 

They did manage to delivery an x3 to me in Hollywood. One day later, a tire went flat (Run flat) and they THEN tried to charge me for that. When I looked for a spare tire in the car, the customer or staff member utilizing the loaner car before me felt the need to leave a lovely set of doggy training piss pads along with an assortment of Legos. At this point, I couldn’t help but laugh at how comically ridiculous the whole saga was.

When collecting car, the saga came to a hilarious end as Danny Mckenna the president and owner’s son I presume (Hutton) was on standby only to say they would “let the tire thing go” if I promised to never return there again for business. 

This clearly didn’t have to be stated, which made the situation that much more of a joke. I absolutely LOVE BMW and have been a loyal customer for years, but it really is unfortunate when you get people that have to represent your brand and put such an incredible tarnish on your name.


With a dealership that clearly does not appreciate business from it’s customers, and fails to provide a tolerable level of customer service, save yourself the time and effort and go to ANY other BMW dealership.

A succinct summary to consider before wasting your time--Unprofessional, disingenuous, dishonest, lack of attention to detail, poor communication, misleading, arrogant, and a strong lack of product knowledge. Why bother? I can only imagine what this experience would have been like without my broker (Brandon@insiderautos.com)…thank god for him.

4979,14-Dec-18,"My coworker told me to call McKenna BMW because he leased there and I was looking for my 4th BMW and needed it quick.  In other words an easy sale for a $50,000 car.  I called and spoke to Miguel who told me he would search for the car and payment and get back to me in 20 minutes. I called him back after not hearing for an hour and fifteen minutes and also never receiving any text from him he told me he was spending with his number. I had to leave a message because he was busy.  I called back another hour later, still not hearing and was told he was at 7-11 getting a drink but would be right back. No call back the entire night, but even better yet, no call back the next day either. He just wrote the sale of a BMW SUV off because apparently Miguel sells more cars then he needs to and didn’t need another sale. After not hearing back from Miguel I called and asked for a manager and was given the voicemail of Calvin Lau, the general sales manager, so I left a message stating I was not called back and need to buy a car very quickly if he could help me out. Apparently Calvin sold too many cars today too because he never called me back either.  It’s funny, it would have been my 4th BMW and I really wanted the car, scheduled time today to go buy it, but McKenna BMW doesn’t want to sell cars I guess and they had all the business they needed.  Well, like I said, I need to buy a car quickly so I went to a dealer that wanted to sell cars and bought myself that car that was $51,235, I feel like the owner of McKenna would probably be sad that happened as they lost a good sale today but more importantly they lost a multiple owner BMW customer to an Audi dealership that they have nothing to do with. As a manager of sales people I would be really upset if I heard a customer called to buy and my sales people didn’t call back losing the sale. ",6,8,101

5218,20-Jan-18,Sales department is great. Service department is the most disorganized service department I've ever worked with. Car has 2000 miles on it. Check engine light comes on. Call next day for an appointment and they scheduled for two days out. Take care in only to be told they have only a few technicans that can work on the hybrid cars. They also told me that they had others that had been waiting for over 7-9 days for repair and I'd be after that. After talking to the assistant service manager because the service manager never returned my call I was basically told this is a common problem with the hybrids. I said why didn't the sales people tell me this before I bought the vehicle? He said sales team doesn't always knows what goes on the service side. I said then why when I called to make an appointment that there would be this long of a delay. Once again the excuse was they are just paid to answer phones and take appointments. Sounds like the BMW McKenna family needs to collaborate more. The only thing positive out of my experience so far was I was given a loaner. The loaner nowhere compares to my 5 series lease.

5227,08-Jan-18,"I am very disappointed with the service I received from McKenna BMW. 
1.	I was told by my friends not to go to McKenna dealership because of the bad experiences they had. I still went to your dealership despite what they told me. I regret that I ever went to have my car serviced at McKenna dealership.
2.	I asked Daniel (Service Advisor) and Armando (Service Manager) to call the BMW corporate and ask them if they can replace it without any charges. I purchased additional service and maintained the car according to BMW’s recommendations. I know enough to know that a water pump does not go out within 5 years unless it is defective or has a problem with it. I also owned a Lexus and a Mercedes Benz and have had no issue with the water pumps for the last 10 years. 
3.	I told Daniel that there was a recall on the 2011 BMW and that maybe I got a bad water pump. (I did not get any support from your service manager in trying to get BMW to resolve this recall on my car). Instead, from my understanding, Armando refused this recommendation to the BMW corporate.
4.	When I went to get a rental, I was told they do not have a BMW. I was given a Maxima. This is the 1st time this has happened to me regardless on which car I have serviced (BMW, Lexus or Mercedes Benz).  I am usually given a loaner car that was either better or equal to what my car that is being serviced. (Note: I did see an BMW at McKenna)
5.	When they asked to check for dents or scratches, it was so dark that I had to trust what they were telling me.
6.	I asked the service manager if he could give me a discount and Daniel told me that they would give me 10% off.
7.	When I asked Daniel to match the quote that I got from another BMW dealership, Daniel asked me give him the information so they can match it. After I sent him the information thru email, he still did not match it and charged me more. I told Daniel and Armando that they did not include the promised 10% discount that I would get.

a.	Daniel and Armando did not match the quote that I gave them. If I had a choice on which dealer to go to, why would I go to the dealer that does not match the best price?
b.	Daniel and Armando did not give me the 10% discount they promised me.

8.	When I asked Daniel if I could have the rental car until the decision is made by BMW regarding coverage, it was refused. Rental car would not be covered he claimed.
9.	I was promised that the car should be done by December 14, 2017. When I called to follow up, they told me that it won’t be done until December 15, 2017. When I called on December 18, 2017, to let them know that I would pick up my car at 11:00 AM. I was informed it won’t be done until the evening.
10.	When I took the car in, there was no check engine light but after the service was done, there was a check engine light and they told me it was the oxygen sensor. It seems like your dealership broke it and fixed it temporarily so the light would not appear. How can an oxygen sensor go bad in 5 years?
11.	Armando (Service manager) never responded to my e-mails nor even gave me call back to give me updates. Is this the type of service BMW is giving?
12.	I e-mailed Daniel if I he could send me your e-mail address. I still have not received a response from him. I had to search for it on the website.

McKenna dealership has taken advantage of the situation because I did not have a choice once I brought it to your dealership. With my Lexus and Mercedes dealership, they usually would help me resolve the issue by looking at recalls and try to assist me with probable cause of a possible defect. McKenna dealership did not even spend time to look into it.  It is very disappointing that BMW customer service is not even up to par with any other luxury car dealership.  It does not seem to match with your advertising.

5275,28-Nov-17,"BUYERS BEWARE!!!! This is a very shady dealership. I've been in the Norwalk BMW a couple of times and have been appalled at the customer service in this dealership. I made an appointment with one of your salesman on my first visit only to be ignored for about a half hour. There were many other salesmen and no one acknowledged us.  On our second visit, the car that we negotiated and was promised got sold right before we arrived at the dealership. We fought traffic on a Friday afternoon to come to this location. The salespeople made us sit around for about an hour only to eventually inform us that the car ""just got sold"". The unethical business practices of your salespeople are disappointing and disgraceful. 

I will also be contacting the corporate office of BMW to inform them of the unethical ways of this dealership. I hope that their management team will correct and remedy the behavior of this sales team. 


Just want to let everyone know this is what their GM sent me after I emailed him back. You can judge for yourself if he cares about his customers. 

BTW, the response you see below is an automated response to any negative comments towards the dealership. I would assume they don't have time to really read their unsatisfied customers' comments, which is in line with how they handle their customers.

This is their GM responding to me:

I certainly understand your feeling about the treatment you got at our dealership.
I can see based on your Yelp review and your  
Contacting anyone that will listen, that you get the satisfaction that you are seeking.

- the low oil lamp came on.  This vehicle calls for changing the oil every 9,500 miles.  It's been only 4,000 miles, yet the low oil light came on.  

I fear there was little or no inspecting that took place on this vehicle.  To add insult to injury, they charge a $50 fee every time warranty service is performed.  Really?  I have had other manufacturer's certified pre-owned vehicles and never been charged a fee for warranty work.

One last point is that they will not do any work or even check something without you leaving the car for 24 hours.  That means a rental car each and every time, even for an oil change!  It always took an hour and a half to take my care in and get a rental car, then it took a minimum of 45 minutes to pick it up even when the work was already completed and they knew I was coming in.  They do not respect the value of people's time.

I don't know if the lack of quality of service exists across all BMW dealerships or if this one is just particularly bad.  I will soon find out as I will not take my X5 back to this dealer for any future work.",6,9,2589
5479,07-Dec-16,"I would give 0 rating if I could, specifically because this is a BMW and I expect exceptional service from them.

I bought my certified pre-owned BMW car from this dealer and it has been OVER 4 months that I have not received spare key for the car or the licence plates. I called up number of times and they keep promising in few weeks but that never happens. 

Really BMW? Do I have to follow up so much on such simple stuff? This is surely not the customer service I expected from a BMW dealer!

Also, they were supposed to offer me a tire warranty when i bought the car. That is BMW policy as per another dealer. But they didnt offer any. I tried calling the finance dept to double check that and request more info on it, I left a voice mail and no one has called back till now.
I ended up paying 400$ for changing my car rear tire instead of a 50$ deductible because of their shoddy paper work and screw up.

I am never going to go back to this dealer or recommend anyone to them anymore. ",6,9,1011

The next morning we called in b/c they quit responding to our emails (ironic?) and we were then told the price was $3k more than the price listed on all three sites we saw it on the day prior. Initially they made us sound like we were crazy but luckily I had a screen shot of the price from the night before to prove it. They eventually admitted it was a listing mistake and REFUSED to honor the price they had it listed at. Then they made it sound like giving us a military discount made up for it (do they not give this to all military members??)  Even with that it still was not close to the original listed price. They told us they would see what they could do and call back, but they never did! We called the next day and were told they just sold it. TERRIBLE BUSINESS ETIQUETTE... If I misquoted a client I would never go back and ask for more, I would honor the price because it was MY ERROR.

They are great on the phone and over email, but in person everything changes. They did not honor a written deal when I came in to complete the purchase, and just let me walk right out the door.

5494,26-Sep-13,"I have bought a CPO BMW 2011 328I back in April 2013 at McKenna BMW in Norwalk, California. Since day one the sales advisor was unable to do a check list with me, a bad start. I had to go back three times and ask the service advisors on how to work my vehicle. Then, not even a month later I went back for the bottom trim on the back windshield that was coming loose. McKenna repaired the trim and not even a week later it came out again. I took it back a second time, repair it again and here we go, not even a week later the trim is loose. Finally, they got it right the third time around. Now, the trim is fix,   lets move on to the brake light inside the car that came loose. The car went back to the dealership for that repair.  Two week later I found a loose plastic in the bottom part of the passenger seat, so here we go again to the dealership, they got it fixed. Not even a month later I noise started to come out from the front of the vehicle every time I exited my drive way. I took it to McKenna three times and finally the foreman Richard was able to identify there was actually a noise from the suspension. McKenna kept the car for more then a weeks without any follow ups with me, I would have to call to know an update and every time I was told they were unable to duplicate the noise. I told the foreman specifically on how to duplicate the noise, and they kept saying we can’t hear it. I called BMW of North America and a Field Technician came down to the dealership and check the vehicle and I was advice unable to duplicate. Keep in mind all of these problems in less then five months with my car. All McKenna had to say is we cannot do anything about getting you into another car, we are sorry you are having problems; there is nothing we can do for you.  I have been talking  to Alexander Buchta Executive Consumer Care from BMW of North America and all he has to say is keep the car if we can find the noise before your 50k the warranty will fix it, but if not  you are liable for the cost of repairs.",6,9,-1

After agreeing on a final price, and indicated that I will be paying all inception fees (first payment, acquisition fee, reg, ttl, etc), they still tried to stuff a bloated  BMWFS acquisition fee ($925 instead of $725) in two places, capitalized cost and inception fee). Also they lied about not able to use currently published lending rate for X5 35d, instead, need to use a higher one because I'm putting down deposit to lower the rate. And of course when I mentioned their ad about $2500 off on memorial day weekend, they said, that's on selected cars only (which are? on a secret list?). 

Long story short, after agreeing on the sale price, they still tries to sneak in ~$1400 margin into the transaction. I could stay there and grind until they stop playing dumb on these childish tricks, but I simply cannot support this level of unethical business practice. Walked away and got a better and straight-up deal on the same car else where.

5518,20-Dec-10,"I had a pretty frustrating experience visiting this dealer with cash on-hand ready to buy a certified pre-owned 528i.  I test drove a beautiful car that had everything I wanted, including GPS (which is a must for me).   

When I sat in the car, I asked the dealer why I did not see ""Navigation"" on the screen, and he said it's because the DVD is not in.  OK, fine, I drove the car, loved it, and after a little back and forth, I was able to get a decent price.   I have to say though that unlike other dealers I had visited, Adam would not negotiate the price with me, until *after* he got all my information, including social security, income, address, family information.  That already gave me a bad impression of the place, but I wanted the car, so I stuck through it.

I went to sign the paperwork with the finance folks.  I was ready to put down $22K and finance the rest, but apparently, this particular dealership has a policy where they can only accept $5K on credit card, 5K on check, and the rest would have to be a cashier's check.  Banks being closed (it was now 6:00pm on a Saturday), I had no choice but to finance the rest and put down $5K/$5K.    

The finance guy did not give me the time of day, rushing me through the process to get me out the door fast.  I even commented to him that he made me nervous, and he didn't seem to care.  I seemed like just a faceless customer to him, and quick sign these 100 documents, and don't ask me questions (although he did answer any questions I did have).

In any case, the deal was done, I paid up, even though the customer experience wasn't there, or I should say despite of it, I had my new car.  I reminded Adam to put the GPS DVD in 3 times before and after I signed all the paperwork.   I go to get my keys, and Adam tells me the he made a mistake, the car did NOT have a GPS.   The whole day was a waste!!  

I left very disappointed, all because the people working at McKenna try to rush rush rush, and don't give customers the time of day.  

My advice to them, slow down, and take the time to connect with your customers, in an honest, non-cheesy fashion.  The whole time I was making the deal, I was wishing that car was at another dealership, where I had really connected with their sales guy who was very honest.

In any case, thank you dealerrater, I am visiting a 4.9 rated dealer today (Steve Thomas BMW), who already on the phone were amazing, and have the car I want.

Edit: I just bought my car at Steve Thomas BMW, you should read my review of the experience.  That's what a car buying experience should be like!  They even took a check for over 22K no problem at all ( I have a very high credit rating ).",6,9,-1

Considering all of the recent negative publicity that BMW has had regarding the machanical issues with very expensive BMW's you would think that they would do everything possible to keep the current ""happy"" BMW customers happy. They are from from this. Jacques Riley, Service Representative at Mckenna BMW is rude and disrespectful to the customers. Mr. Riley, we (the customers) are not stupid people.

After i bought the CPO car i noticed a week after that the driver seat had some play. So it being under warrranty i took it in and told them about the problem and they said they would take care of it. They did not have a loaner for me (i love BMW driving experince but MBZ will destroy them in customer service) they said i have to give them a 1 1/2 week notice.

After all this i got a call the next afternoon and they told me the seat frame was damaged during the delivery, so they would need to reorder the part (now its going on the second day the car is there) I called today to see how everything was going, and they told me that they got the wrong seat and they need to reorder but it wont be in for alm ost a week.

AHHHHH!!!!!!!!!! I told them to get my car ready and call me next week and have a loaner ready for me. After this problem is fixed i will never use anything to do with MC Kenna.

5530,03-Sep-08,"I came in to the dealership in response to an online for a brand new Alpina B7 for $105,000, about $10 below MSRP. While all went well in the beginning (no high pressure sales tactics, sales rep got me 0.9% APR which I didn't even know was available for that model etc.), real horrors began two days after I drove off with the car.

1. I became suspicious the day of the transaction because they would only give me one key, and the car did not have bumper tow caps, manual, or navigation DVD with it. They said that someone had taken the key from the storage room and they could not retrieve it, even though it was still early afternoon.

2. Sure enough, two days later my sales rep calls me to come in because there is ""some new paperwork"" I need to sign, acting very shady and not telling me any details over the phone.

3. It turns out that they overshot my financing amount that I was approved for by a whopping $25,000! I can understand a few extra thousand, but 25? Of course this is speculation and only they know the real truth, but my gut tells me they knew I would have bought that car if I knew I had to shell out $35 up front, which was not my intention. So they let me drive it with $10, knowing that I will love the car enough to come up with the rest when they called.

So they pretended to ""help"" me by giving me some money off on the car, and giving me some more on the trade in. I spoke to Michael Ball who is their main finance people. What Michael failed to tell me is that he conveniently changed my APR from 0.9% to 8.6% and wanted me to ""take this deal right now or it's off the table"". I was so apalled by the way he carried himself that I said I have to think about and will come back later.

When I came back the second time (mind you a week had passed from when I bought the car), THEY BLOCKED OFF THE CAR so I could not leave, and WOULD NOT LET ME DRIVE TO BANK OF AMERICA TO GET A CASHIER'S CHECK FOR THE EXTRA $17,000! They degraded me even further by making me sign a statement of facts that I will not dispute my initial deposit with American Express, as if I am some kind of crook! For Christ's sake I came in with my MOTHER to buy the car!

I now wish I had just given the car back to them; I have a very bad aftertaste in my mouth after this ordeal, I feel taken advantage of and above all very insulted. I am one of those people that have never written a negative review about a product or experience because usually I just let things go.

After that run around, got fed up and picked up the car....service incomplete, tools left in my car and access panels still exposed,... and still waiting for the TCU.

5535,18-Aug-07,"I had my independent BMW mechanic inspect the 2004 330i CPO car I chose before I made an offer.  He found a number of things wrong.  I gave my friendly salesperson a list of the items to be fixed, along with an offer.  We agreed upon a price based upon their willingness to fix the items.  A due bill was made listing the items to be repaired.  This included repairing a bent left front wheel and providing a spare key, among other things.

They kept the car for a few days after I bought it to fix the agreed upon items.  About half were fixed, the other half ignored.  The spare key, promised to be Fedexed to me a few days after purchase never appeared.  Turns out my salesperson forgot to order it.  After driving on the fwy, I discovered the bent wheel was not repaired.  I spent the next 4 weeks hounding my salesperson to follow up per our agreement.  I asked her to provide me with a key to the wheel locks, feeling very uncomfortable driving without a way to remove the wheel - she didn't understand what wheel locks were, if you can believe that.  I also discovered a missing wheel stud, which again, she did not understand what a 'wheel stud' was.  I finally placed a call to the CPO manager, Anthony, which was not returned.  Ultimately, I went in person and raised my voice in the showroom.  Manager Anthony was summoned and after significant amounts of b.s., finally agreed to give me a loaner at no cost while they replace the bent wheel.  A spare key that they had finally given me was not programmed and did not work in the ignition.

The car was returned to me with a 'new', straight wheel - but it was scratched, dinged, and dirty - obviously pulled from another used car and not cleaned up - it felt like a final ""F-You"" from my friendly salesperson.  The key was programmed to unlock the doors, but still didn't work in the ignition.  I bypassed my sales agent and asked the parts dept for help.  They were great - got the key fixed in no time.

5541,10-Jul-04,"This was originally a pleasant experience. I leased a 530i from Nick. Dealt with one person throughout the entire sales process (a pleasant alternative to haggling with an entire “team” of sales reps.). All of the numbers were revealed up front (money factor, price, etc.). I had to haggle with the Finance & Insurance guys a bit over add-ons (as I did not want to purchase any additional insurance products), but otherwise, the experience was flawless.Unfortunately, the ""smooth"" deal came back to haunt me a month later. Apparently, the dealer calcualted the payoff on my previous vehicle (2001 Audi A4) incorrectly (which is ridiculous, considering that McKenna is an Audi dealer, and can access the Audi Financial Services system to calculate payoffs on the fly). As a result, they needed around $1000.00 more than they originally planned. When they realized their error, they let the vehicle sit on their lot for a month while they attempted to cover their losses by negotiating a lower payoff with Audi Financial Services (even though my new vehicle had already been financed, and I'd already made the 2nd payment!!). When I finally contacted them about this (after receiving several calls from Audi Financial Service's collectors, who had no record of any payoff), they gave me the run around, claiming that they had indeed paid the vehicle off, and that Audi's records were incorrect. After receiving additional calls from Audi at both my home and work numbers, I lost patience and called one of McKenna's Finance Managers (Robert) to tell him that I was coming down to the dealer. He explained the situation, (i.e that Audi Financial (not Mckenna), had miscalculated the payoff). He then told me that the only way that they'd pay the vehicle off is if I paid the $1000.00 when I arrived. Upon arrival, the amount changed from $1000.00 to around $1350.00. I refused to pay the additional $350.00. Finally, I was able to speak to the General Manager (Greg Conners) who was apologetic and sincere, but not very helpful. I ended up giving them a check for the original amount ($1000.00)....I understand that the customer is responsible for any payoff discrepancies; however, there was no excuse for the previous vehicle sit for a month while they decided what to do (and never contacting me about this). Had I not received the collection calls from Audi, I would have spent the next 7 years getting rid of the adverse credit information caused by the past due account. Again, Greg was apologetic and sincere, but he could have done a lot more to correct this situation (I shouldn't have had to wait a month to get him involved in this).To make matter's worse, I asked them to program the BMW Assist while I waited (they forgot to do this on the day I purchased the vehicle). They claimed that this was a 5 minute process. After 45 minutes of ""playing around"" with the IDRIVE, their service staff could not figure out how to do this.",6,9,-1

5669,05-May-19,"Most impersonal dealership I’ve ever dealt in 50 years of auto service.  I regret buying a car from you and dread service.  My prior dealership treated me as a loyal friend.  I bought a new car from them and thereafter my service rep knew me by first name and was on top of details about my car.  My experience with your dealership is once you get the car sale closed there’s no need for trustworthy personal service.  Big disappointment.  I took my prior BMW to you for service for 5 years, experience was better then.  Big change after I bought a car from you.  Makes no sense.  After the purchase a part failed under warranty and I was accused of causing the failure and not being truthful in my presentation.  The service rep and I carefully examined the conditions around the failed part and found nothing unusual, just the failed part.  He said he’d have the shop look at it and advise.  30 minutes later I was told the problem was caused by a “collision” with scuff marks and a scratch around the failed part as proof of collision.  The service rep and I were dumbfounded when we saw the paint damage that appeared after the shop inspection.  He could not explain what had happened but offered to talk it over with the shop.  He returned to tell me a decision was made to replace the part.  I’m 100% certain someone in your dealership sabotaged my car to make it appear I had caused the problem.  Shameful.  It took me almost an hour to rub out the paint damaged in your shop. No one took responsibility for this and I assume the service rep facilitated a face saving solution.  Too inconvenient to drive to San Jose for service or I’d never return to your dealership.",6,9,-1

5838,30-Sep-17,"Review of service department:  Undoubtedly the worst experience I've ever had in any service industry. Late, rude, broke my windshield and accused me of being a liar.  On arrival (10:35) I waited for 10 minutes for a service technician to check me in.  After going inside to find somebody to help I was told to wait at Mike's desk. He was with another customer and would be ""back soon"".  Another 10 minutes past and an alternative service rep asked what I needed. I explained that I was in for a air bag recall and had requested the shuttle into town whilst the work was performed.  He said the work would be 2-3 hours and shuttle pickup would be at 2pm (which I explained was important because I needed to be back home to pick up the kids from school). No proper check in, just a scribbled note ""to mike""  [this turned out to be a big mistake on my behalf..]

At 2:20, no shuttle, so I called to remind them of pickup. Back at the dealer at 2:50 (now running very late for school pickup) I asked them to expedite checkout and payment of my service inspection fee.  At 3:15 I had the keys to my car and was finally on my way, or so I thought...

I realized that the windscreen had been cracked (a big 12"" crack right above the steering wheel)!  I reported to issue to Mike, who was too busy to help, so another rep took and look and promptly called the manager. I explained that the windshield was not cracked when I brought the car in and it must have been done during replacement of the steering airbag or on test drive.  They told me I had obviously not noticed the crack when I brought the car in.  Not noticed!!! I had just driven 35 miles to the dealer with my girlfriend and it would have been impossible to have not noticed such a large crack RIGHT ABOVE THE STEERING WHEEL!  After some discussion, the manager of the service department point blank refused any responsibility and said that the intake paperwork showed the windscreen as existing damage.

It was at this point that I realized my check in mistake... in a rush to get on to the shuttle, the proper intake procedure was not followed. Why didn't I take a couple of photos of the car [something I routinely do when renting, etc]. Given the chaos that morning, I bet the car was worked on, test drove and then all the paperwork completed AFTER the window had been cracked. I didn't have time to argue anymore, it was 3:30, my girlfriend and I were already way late to fetch kids. I was disgusted and angry -- I was accused of lying about the state of the car. I felt like I was being treated like some punk kid that was trying to cheat the system [I'm over 50 and my integrity and fairness is fundamental to my life ethics].  My girlfriend was physically sick, worried about her son and speak-less about how a supposedly premium car company could treat repeat BMW buyers like this and accuse us of fabricating a story.

What am I going to do now?  Eat the $1000 cost of a windshield replacement, I guess.  And make sure that everybody is aware of the suspect practices and quality of Monterey BMW service department.

In summary, steer well clear of this service department -- Steven's Creek (San Jose) BMW is much better.  Always make sure you properly document the state of your vehicle prior to handing over the keys, treat time estimates with a pinch of salt, they are not concerned about your time.

5841,15-Aug-17,"Recently ( 2+ weeks ago) bought a CPO  BMW  535i

The car was sold as CPO BMW, which meant that all required processes and parts must have been checked and if defected then should have been fixed/replaced.

But, upon driving it the first day, I realized:
* Door seal was torn.     It should have been in good condition  being a CPO car
* Missing air-conditioning vents . There  should have been in good condition  being a CPO car
* Left lift was missing.    It should have been in good condition  being a CPO car
* The brakes and rotors   created a vibration when one pressed the breaks
    No vibration should have been present, since the car was a CPO
* The dealership gave me just the first page of the CPO document.
Thankfully I brought the car for full inspection to another BMW dealership who detected all of the above problems.

  I FIND THIS (concealing the pages of the CPO document) a deceitful practice. It seems that the dealership wanted to hide information.

I complained the next day.  Mr.  Paul Giovino (General Manager), told me to bring it back the next week for the service department  to look at it. We made an appointment.

I brought it back. I was told that I will get an update in 20 min.  Already 50 min elapsed, no update.
 I have to go and demand from the service manager to go with me for a test drive to  be convinced that the car vibrates upon pressing the brake. Initially I was told that breaks and rotors are fine.
   ONLY after the test drive (on the highway), the service manager acknowledged that indeed there was an unacceptable vibration.

 The above behavior (not believing the customer, initially claiming there is no vibration, selling a CPO car that the brakes/rotors and vibrations should have been checked, AND only after my insistence for a highway test-drive to admit there are problems) is  UNACCEPTABLE!!!

I was asked to wait 4.5 hours. Of course I had to drive from San Luis Obispo (time, gas, cost) and spend most of the day in the dealership.

The fixed the seal on the door, put back the missing air-condition vents, and missing lift pad.
The surfaced the rotors, and the vibration subsided. I asked to replace the rotors, the dealership refused.

I requested couple of very  low cost items to be given as a gift/token appreciation  for my huge inconvenience,  BUT the dealership refused.

All of the above made me to believe that the dealership ONLY cares about the sale of the car. Absolutely they refused to negotiate.

In conclusion, I give:
* good reviews to the used sales person  Eldar K.   
      I believe it is NOT his fault.    Even though he should have known all the issues by checking the details in the CPO report.  Not Acceptable.  
* Poor review to the USED SALES MANAGER  (I do not recall his name)
 Bad attitude, NOT willing to negotiate
* Poor review to service manager.  Not believing that the car has issues. 
    NOT acknowledging that his service crew made big errors in producing a faulty and not accurate CPO report when the car was put on the lot to be sold as CPO Pre-owned.

I will NEVER recommend this dealership to anyone!!!!

5967,01-Mar-15,"I really didn't think that dealerships, in the age of social media, operated as if it was 1985. I was naive. 

Back in January of 2014, I put a $5000 deposit down on a BMW i8. I was the first one at Monterey BMW to do so. 

Let me be clear that my situation is a complete ""first world situation"" to have. I'm not angry or disappointed. In fact, I'm slightly amused. The reason for my writing is so you can make a choice as to where you give your business too. 

And I also want to take my salesperson, Charles Joseph, out of the equation. He works for the management, he is not the management. I personally think he's a pretty decent guy, in a not so decently managed dealership. Of course, that's just my opinion. As is this review.

Back to the story. After many delays, my i8 was finally built and was going to be delivered around March 12th. I was not going to be here, so I went in before I left on my trip to pay for the car. 

They had put a $75,000 mark-up on the car. Think about that. That's more than 50% of the MSRP of the car. 

Charles and I never discussed a price for the car. I had assumed that since the car was in demand, I would pay MSRP for the car. Of course, after Charles showed me the paperwork, another sales manager came out and insisted that Charles had told me that the car was going to be marked-up by $50k to $100K over sticker. Ah, no he had not, because if he had, I would have asked for my deposit back a long, long time ago. 

The manager took me into his office (Tom Myers old office) and after some small talk, offered to sell me the car for only $25,000 over sticker. He was gracious enough to keep this offer open until tomorrow, in case I changed my mind. 

I won't be changing my mind. Nor will I buy another car from them or refer anyone to them again. I'm a pretty fervent ""car-guy"" and people ask me what and where to buy. Monterey BMW is off my list.

As I said, a ""first-world problem"" to have. But if they think that they can so easily gouge someone buying a $140,000 car, think of all the ways they have to take advantage of many people, buying $40,000 cars. 

Buyer beware, be careful and spend your dollars at ethical places of business.

Gary is not punctual and efficient person; I had to wait in the lobby for 35 minutes, although, we agreed to meet at a specific time to test drive a few BMW models. I felt disrespected and not valued customer at all. I was given a different impression about prioritizing his business items and about his customer service. I was very disappointment. The second reason, he asked subtle questions to gain better feeling of whether you have the money to buy lux car. I felt he was sizing me up; he also look at the way you dress from bottom to top - scanning. His energy and his questions are irrelevant for buying cars. Associating place and dress with selling cars is poor assessment tool; Furthermore, When I requested a quote about 135i, his answerer was vague and he said that my Q is very contradicting and then asked for clarification then he changed the subject and start to wrap up. 1st impression is always very important.

Salesperson was quick to respond to my email inquiry regarding when they'll have their first E92 coupes in the showroom, but when I followed up with asking about the time-frame for European Delivery, he didn't bother responding anymore. This must have been his way of telling me that the dedicated European Delivery section on their web site is just for decoration purposes. To be fair, he did volunteer an invaluable piece of information before ending the conversation: they don't have any mark-ups on their cars. Hear, hear! I guess this is what they mean by ""low prices every day"".

What should have made me suspicious from the start is that they advertise the outgoing E46 model with the respective old prices and data alongside a picture of the upcoming E92 coupe. That's rather misleading, to say the least.

I scheduled an appointment after hearing a strange noise in the rear of my SUV.  I thought perhaps it was related to some previous work that was done and asked if it could be looked at. The dealer associate assigned to me explained that the noise I was hearing was coming from items that were located in the front pockets of my door.  Inside my front door were a CD case and a pair of sunglasses. I explained that the sounds could not be from those items, as I had heard the sounds prior to putting these items in my car.  He then suggests that due to the rain, the diagnostician could not assess properly and suggested if I hear the noise again to return and they would take another look at it. He then proceeds to tell me that the charge from removing my CD and sun-glass case was 90$! He then say that my warranty was expired and I needed to make the payment for today's service. I explained that I purchased the extended warranty, to which he then suggests, ""that doesn't apply to your CPO."" I then explained that I was assured that the extended warranty covered my car from bumper to bumper, as per the BMW  employees and manager that sold the car LESS than one year ago.  He again responds that this information was not accurate and explained ""They (meaning BMW employees) get people to  buy those warranty's but they don't cover CPO vehicles."" He continued, ""besides, I have to pay my guys for looking at your car.""  I was furious and again pleaded my case that the cases in the front door of my car were not responsible for the sounds I heard from the rear and further more, if the rain impacted the assessment, an honorable associate would have suggested I come back when weather conditions were more permitting. He then agreed to lower the price and again suggested that the technicians needed to be paid. I did not argue, but did let him know that I felt insulted and taken advantage of. 
And to top of my experience, my front license plate cover was bent and hanging off the bumper when they returned my car. He offered half of an apology and stated, ""we have new workers up there..."" Not sure how that is related to the damage done to my personalized plate cover. He says, they bent it back into place the best that they could...

6575,28-Mar-17,"Short version regarding ONE of my issues with Rusnak service. 

My 335 convertible has been leaking for over a year w/o a solution. I have brought my car in 3 times with 3 different service advisors in the last 13 months with pictures. Two out of the three times I have been told the leak cannot be replicated. 

This last time there was a rude comment on my discharge papers, ""If the roof is wet and the door is open water will get in. That is normal & expected."" I have explained this leak multiple times. The roof is not open, the door is not open. The roof does not leak when driving in the rain. The leak occurs when the car is parked for a long period of time (12-15 hours) during a rain storm; therefore, just spraying the roof with water will not replicate the leak. 

My past visit I was blown off and not even contacted from my service advisor other than a text my car was ready. My car was not ready, it still leaks! 

I live in Santa Monica and the 45 minutes each way to not be taken seriously has to stop. I have recently contacted BMW since Rusnak service does not seem to take my concerns seriously. 

In addition, there is a clear issue with courtesy cars at this dealership. I was made to feel guilty for asking for a courtesy car during 2 or my 3 visits. During the 2 visit (December 2016) I was sent to enterprise, where I paid to upgrade because the allowed amount would have covered a kia. Once I returned to Santa Monica I was asked to come back to Westlake, return the rental and pick up a courtesy car.

6808,18-Jul-15,"I purchased my 2012 BMW X5 last November with 18K miles and a factory warranty. I brought the car in for its first service (in June) ( the computer told me) and oil change and to fix the tire air sensor.   After the oil change was completed and supposedly the air tire sensor ""was fixed"",  I was told to call the service rep if I had any more issues.   Well within a few minutes of leaving the dealer the light flashed on and off and has been doing this ever since. 
Well I took it in today for another schedule service apt. rear brakes (the computer told me too.) and to again check out the tire air sensor. I was told this would take one or two hours, so I waited (I was told they were out of loaners) (note: work is over an hour away and home is  1/2 hour away).  After over 3 hours,  I got the car back and was told  that I would have to come back yet again to fix this complicated tire air sensor - a couple of days will be needed to troubleshoot this issue.  Which I don't really care that much about.  Air sensors are problematic on a lot of cars.  I got in my car and the car said service check (computer) in two thousand miles (about maybe 6 weeks for me).  So back at the dealer soon.

Well  I regret buying a BMW.  It is an excellent ride. I didn't realize I would be spending so much time at the dealer for service for a late model car with relatively low mileage.  So not worth it unless you live within a few minutes of the dealer.  And yes the dealer will give me a ride anywhere!  

I work for myself so every hour I am sitting in the dealer is an hour I am not getting paid for.  I wish BMW would take some consideration for our time and realize not all of us have time to visit the BMW service dept. every month.  I hope to get rid  of this vehicle soon.

Anyway, I authorize to replace my battery after We went over the price which was mention to me the price will include the installation and programming because this battery must to be reprogrammed.

Before I came to Rusnak BMW - Service Center I called them and confirm the price of the services and battery also called few other places to compare and everyone told me I must to program the new battery.

My SA came and brought my invoice and key and said go head to pay.. after I paid I request to talk to technician because I had few more questions.

my 1st question was to Tech guy if they put the AGM battery? He was not sure so he left back to the shop to check.. while I was waiting I asked sale person in parts if the part # on invoice is AGM and he said yes and there is only one battery available. ok, Here is Tech guy came back and telling me We made mistake and put the AGM battery in your car and charged you for AGM battery and did not program it but your car needs the different battery because I had original battery not AGM and I have 2 choices now.
1. replace my battery with original type batter none AGM and it cost of the battery about $100 less.
2. I can keep the AGM battery but need them to program it and it will cost me more now but I already paid for installation and programming as we discuss before authorized the replacement of the battery in the amount of $187.50 that is about 1.25 hours. of labor they told me. and I am already there for over 3.5 hour.. 
Tech guy the programming might takes few hours now because they would need to program all modules may be etc.. it's more complicated stuff. but I did my homework before coming there and I know what has to be done to install the new battery and I know what it takes.. I also confirmed before coming with part department there is only one battery fit my car and its AGM and he said it must to be programmed and the same SA told me it must to be programmed but why the story changed now? 
SA and Tech guy start to make me believe that I am wrong and the previous installation price of $187.50 does not cover programming.. SA told me They can remove the battery and put my old one and I can leave.. and it's after over 3.5 hours wait there.. 
After some explanation to them They agreed to try to take my car back to the shop and try to program it if that will take less than 20 minutes then they will do it at the above price. Guess what? yes, they could do it . SA show me page with show there is highlighted AGM battery program instruction.. and why it's needed but when I asked her for copy she refused to give me.. but then she went to talk someone and came back and said ok she can give me the copy.. and I got my key back when I asked to talk to tech guy my AS said he is gone for lunch and rest of them are busy so come back next time oil change and car checkup.. hmm.. Do I want to come back? 

I am not sure now if the car really was programmed or not.. and if my car was really tested? I did not see full report of the test.. the only way to check to take for another diagnostic to another shop which cost $150 - 200 again. 
Do not come to this place!! they're careless to your car and safety of your life. Be careful!! they only care that you pay more !!! and come back for more service..

p.s. I had the battery tested before coming to this shop few times in 2 different shops and both of them told me my battery is good !!! no need to be replaced.. and I have a copy of their test .

6854,29-Dec-12,"The worse experience of my life. After spending 2 days of negotiations and finalizing the price on a used car (X6 2009 listed at $40,882) , The salesman (Frank Poor) got the approval from the management to sell us the car at the agreed price ($37.250). 

After driving back to the dealership to close the deal, the General Manager (Niel) doesn't want to sell the car at this price.

We were outraged and offended by this and asked the salesman to see Niel. He came and treated in a very unprofessional and arrogant way. I showed him the written agreement that we exchanges through text messages back and forth. But he kept  denying and saying that this is not an agreement.

After seeing Niel's arrogant's approach to treat his customers I told him that even if he tries to sell me the cat $10.000 less, I won' t buy it from this Dealership

Anyway I used to be a very happy customer of RUSNAK for years and I was bringing my family who moved from overseas to buy cars at this dealership. But after this horrible experience not only I won't be back anymore but I don't recommend it to anyone unless RUSNACK takes some serious measures to train his employees and teach them on how to be honest and respectful towards customers.

6860,09-May-12,"I purchased a certified BMW from Rusnak in Westlake California earlier this year.

Following an inspection from another dealer, I found out the radio needed to be replaced at an expense of $1,000.

The main menu feature of the electronic controls will not work. I am afraid to find out how much that will be.

There is a crack in one of the wheels and it looses air quite often. Obviously this is a safety issue in addition to an inconvenience.

I have contacted Rusnak many times and cannot get the consideration of a return call or an email acknowledgment.

Knowing what I now know, this is what I should have done.

- Go to a dealership that will stand by what they sell.

- Buy closer to home so you can expect dealership support.

- Thoroughly inspect the car or make sure you get a profession opinion on the vehicle.

- Get a 30-60 day warrantee on big ticket items.

I travel a lot and was unable to take the car and have it checked out. My mistake.

6868,09-Feb-12,"These guys are horrible.

Purchasing the vehicle:
I negotiated the price on a CPO 535 over the internet (fine).  Sight unseen, they offered to match a trade-in quote I had from Carmax (I faxed in advance) on my Land Rover Discovery.  Fine--more convenient for me than arranging a ride to the dealership.

When I got there, the whole process took 4 hours.  Unbelievable.  Price, trade-in and financing were settled (in writing, via email) in advance.  For 60-90 minutes they appeared to be haggling about the trade in.  No excuse.  I bought a new 5 the same way from South Bay BMW and the process took less than 1 hour.

Follow ups:
As a result of my feedback on the sales process, the Sales Manager, Drew, made several promises (free tank of gas, free full car detail, partial reimbursement for a blown run-flat less than 1 month after I drove off the lot) which went unfulfilled.  I sent 2 notes to Ken Christ--the overall SM for all of Rusnak.  First time Drew called me back immediately--and again did not follow through.  Second time, nothing.

The car:
Has been great, I love it.  But the day after I bought it, the passenger power seat went out and I was back at the dealership.  Also it turns out the tire I replaced twice in one year was due to a cracked rim.  CPO indeed.

The bottom line:
I had a friend recommend these guys to me after he bought two cars there.  I will never buy a car from them again, and I would go out of my way to stop any friend from buying a car there.

It's a poorly run sales office, a poorly run service team, and anyone who believes this dealership's CPO inspection is reliable, is a fool.  This dealership is terrible and is to be avoided at all costs.  I have said as much to BMW also (this was my first CPO, and my second overall).",6,9,76
6934,27-Apr-11,"I was told the vehicle I purchased was a ""brass hat"" and was explained that meant it was driven by an employee of BMW for the 8000 miles it had on it. Thus it had to be sold as used. They said however that I would receive the full 4 year 50 thousand mile warrantee from the day I purchased it from them. I brought the car in at 40K for work needed, I was informed now still under three years from my purchase, that my warrantee had in fact run out. Seem those that sold the car to me had not only lied about it being a ""brass hat"", but they also misled me in the length of the warrantee. Also beware of exorbitant pricing for goods and services. I called in to see what a chipped front windshield would cost to replace. I was told $1780.00... for a 3 series windshield! I called 3 other business and requested original OEM glass and paid a premium and still was never quoted higher than $580. Guess they use real special bonding cement. Shame on you Rusnak. ",6,9,117

I have had to replace the fuel pump on the my 535i 3 times and most recently came in to change the fuel injector which was has been on recall.  The service advisor was going to give me a non-BMW rental even though their policy was to give a BMW for recall situations.  I brought the car home and didn't touch it the whole weekend, and Monday am, the car won't start, multiple alarm lights were on, from transmission, tire alarm, steering wheel, engine malfunction, etc.  It was also in low power mode, and the windshield wipers would function all the time and couldn't be turned off.  I bring it in, and the advisor doesn't apologize once and gives me a non BMW rental. Later he tells me its because water got into the trunk, which is a bunch of BS, because the trunk would have completely opened up it it was open. Also he doesn't let me know whats going on until after 6 pm everyday when you're trying to make plans about picking up the car.  The 3 year free maintenance is misleading because unless you have the time to keep bringing in your car to get fixed and deal with pathetic advisors, its really not worth it.  ",6,9,17

Made an appointment  for 8: 30 a. m. Friday to fix a Bluetooth  problem on BMW 5 series.  Arrived on time and waited 45 minutes to meet a service rep. The RUSNAK rep then told me BECAUSE IT WAS A FRIDAY they would need the car overnight. I asked why RUSNAK didn’t tell me that when I made the appointment?  Got the usual 'dumb-look.' I said OK and asked what time tomorrow it might be ready; he then said well it won’t be ready until sometime Monday!  I said that's not overnight.  His reply: Well it is because RUSNAK DOESN'T work Saturdays. 

My family has owned five (5) BMW's over the years and have very often encountered similar problems with this dealership's service department. I could never understand their ‘Sell and Go to Hell’ policy regarding service. I decided to give RUSNAK one more chance to because I thought it was a simple problem and they are local. The service stinks, people are aloof, RUSNAK dealership is an embarrassment to BMW.  We would rather drive from Westlake Village to Calabasas or Camarillo for service at another dealership than waste valuable time and our sanity dealing with RUSNAK!
How they stay in business amazes me.  By the way, my wife's car, a Jag, was purchased from RUSNAK JAGUAR and they do dot seem to have the same service problems as BMW. Maybe the JAG service manager can train the BMW service Manage the meaning of SERVICE.

His attitude was pessimistic and I felt like he was trying to get rid of me even though it was pretty much a guaranteed sale since they were the only dealer that had the vehicle I wanted.

6939,23-Feb-10,"In in 2008 I purchased a preowned 2005 525i. My first experience was to have my car in the service department 21 days of my first 30 daysn of ownership...all due to window tinting issues that I had to solve myself by calling other window tinting shops and telling the Rusnak service people how to fix the tinting issue. Eventually I had to call a sales manager to help me because I knew that they would care more about customer satisfaction than the service department.  This was my first experience (not good), BUT anyone can make a mistake.

My second service experience (other than regularly scheduled rountine maintenance), was last Friday night, I lost my keys.  My husband drove to my office (45 miles) to bring me the spare key.  The spare key did not work.  I called BMW Roadside Service and after carefully explaining to them what had happend with the key, they sent a service provider to jump the battery.  BUT MY KEY DIDN'T WORK so the jump guy left.  I called BMW Roadside Service back and they told me that I would need to be towed.  By the time I got home it was five and a half hours later.

I went to the service department the next morning (a very unhappy person)and asked the service manager if it was reasonable for me to expect my spare key to work...he agreed, everyone agreed, except for one service man (Andre) who explained to me that the battery in the key would go dead if the key wasn't used.  He explained that the battery in the key recharged when in use.  I told him that he was the FIRST person who had expressed ANY KNOWLEDGE of this and the ONLY person to explain it to me.  He assured me that everything would be OK and that he would have the key sent out immediately and arrange for a loaner car for me.

My husband picked up my car today and the service man (Andre) told him that our 50,000 mile warranty was no longer in effect because we had 56,0000 miles and charged us $50 for the deductable against my 100,000 mile warranty. I don't care about the $50.  I care that I am tired of chasing good customer service.  They all knew I was about to cry.  They all knew that I AM A CUSTOMER.  And none of them cared enough to VALUE me as a repeat customer. One poor experience is just a single experience.  I have only had two experiences with them and both were unacceptable, uncaring and certainly short sighted.  I am a tired Rusnak customer.  They wore out my nice. I wonder how much they spend in marketing for a new customer.  They had me and gave me away to another BMW dealership.",6,9,99

It took him 3 weeks (!!) to finally contact me after I called literally 10 times. Ken never apologized for his rude salesman, and always seemed distracted and like he could not care less. I told him I was a returning customer (!!) and had never been treated this way before when the OLD GM was still running the place. Ken Christ just did not seem to care. No apology. No 'how may I make this a better experience?' No 'I am shocked to hear this.' Nothing. This made me wish I'd never given Rusnak my business.

Bought a certified pre-owned BMW 3 years ago from them and purchased extended warranty. Under warranty, had both seat mechanisms, all door locks, alternator, AC accuator (spelling?)fixed at less that 50000 miles (FYI: this is my first and last BMW). This summer took it in for a mini oil change one week before my warranty expired because an oil warning light was on and was told they would look for stuff wrong since I still had a warranty. It wasn't time for Inspection II yet (had a few hundred miles to go).  Said everything looked great! 2 months later took it in for Inspection II  not worrying too much since they did a ""visual"" inspection at the mini oil change. Keep in mind this is a low mileage car (55,000). They found 3000 dollars worth of stuff wrong with the car (oil around here, this torn..etc...etc..) Stuff they should have ""seen"" at my mini oil change while under warranty! Two weeks later, after paying them thousands of dollars, the inspection light came on and they said I had to pay for the diagnostics test as it wasn't related to Inspection II. The guy I spoke with was super rude and defensive. He must be used to my kind of phone calls. My husband has a newer BMW with warranty and we will NEVER take it back to Rusnak! It's Steve Martin in Camarillo or Beverly Hills BMW from now on. Also..if you are going to buy CPO BMW...look on the internet on used car websites. We did this with our 2nd BMW.

7025,04-Feb-19,"They ordered the wrong parts for our new truck 3 different times, put off getting our side steps installed for almost 4 months, and have horrible communication skills. We purchased our truck back in OCTOBER. When purchasing it, we paid for side steps that we wanted on our truck. They said they'd call when they came in. At the time they said it might be up to a month. On December, we called to check on them and they told us they had nothing there under our name. We called back again and were told they did have them. So we made an appointment for 2 weeks later to have them installed and the truck detailed as promised (since the truck we purchased was never detailed). We took the day off of work to drive up there early in the morning (the dealership is 2 hours from our home) and have the work done. We sat there from 9am until 4pm when we recieved a call saying that the parts they had for our truck were for the WRONG truck. We were obviously upset, considering we had been sitting there ALL day and NOTHING had been done with our truck. We were told there was nothing they could do except order the correct parts and make an appointment for the following weekend. So we did that and made an appointment for the following Saturday. On Friday evening, we hadn't heard anything confirming the parts had come in and the appointment was still on, so we called Josh (the sales manager we've been working with) and he said he ""had his hands on the parts"" and they were the right ones for our truck. Since being inconvenienced so many times at this point, they said they would come pickup our truck from us, leave us a loaner, and take our truck to get the work done. I was also told the work they were doing would most likely be finished in one day, the same day they picked the truck up from us. So the truck was picked up at 11:45am Friday. By 2:45pm on SATURDAY we still hadn't heard anything. We had to call them again to get an update on the work and an ETA of our truck. Josh informed us 45 minutes later that the parts they had for our truck were SCRATCHED and they couldn't install them!! They said they couldn't order the parts until Monday and now we're looking at our truck sitting at the dealership all week. Being upset, I tried calling the dealership to speak with another sales manager named Eddy that I had spoken with the previous week. I was told he was busy and would call me back when he had time. I tried asking for any other manager I could speak with and was told they weren't available. I then tried calling Josh back and he wouldn't answer my calls. I literally couldn't get ahold of anyone to figure out what was going on. So I called the service department to figure out what was done on the truck and what exactly was scratched. It was then that I was told the parts that came in were not scratched but they were parts for the wrong truck AGAIN! What the xxxx!!! I couldn't believe it. At this point, I felt like I was lied to and honestly was sick and tired of dealing with the dealership any more! I called the dealership again asking for Josh and was told that he would call me back. He called me back almost 2 hours later.

He said he would have to talk to some higher ups to get the ""okay"" and he would get back to me. MONDAY at 3:45pm someone pulls up to my house with my truck. I recieved no phone call saying he got it okayed or that they would be bringing our truck back. They had done NOTHING with our truck in the over 72 hours they had our truck.

They insured someone  would call us the next morning to work everything out but no one has called us. We are starting to wonder if they are even going to fix our car! One thing is for sure, when we do get our car, we will NEVER be going back.",6,9,283
7331,19-Oct-16,"So i originally was asked By my salesman to give a riches right then and there, actually asked me severally times before leaving with my car if I went back and approved the review in my email. Very eager. But now I'm giving my real review. I don't feel like Terrance really cared about my experience at all or my satisfaction with the car or my satisfaction with the transaction. I was withheld from the information that my car had a delinquent notice on it , I understand negligence of the law is no excuse however they new I was from out of state and would have no idea how the registration process in California worked. I was just rencently slapped with a $500 registration fee which was hidden within the paperwork I signed while I was so excited to be receiving a new car. Terrance was more worried about what he was getting for lunch than he was about my understanding of how the car worked or how my sale would unfold. I had to fight tooth and nail for a second key I was verbally promised, which I did receive. He never once followed up with me to see how I liked my car but they were sure to call my boyfriend who bought a newer Cadillac that same day. Very disappointed with this dealership as a whole thus far. The only decent person I've come across there was rich the salesman I originally was interested in doing business with and jackelyn in the service department is very customer oriented and nice. The rest of them seem to think they are above you, and your calls don't deserve their time. ",6,9,-1

August 4, 2016 - John McMurdie, dies.

August 23, 2016, we took the Toyota Camry in and got an offer to purchase the same used car from Kuni motors for $7,000 after their inspection.

Purchase Date:  04/06/2016       Owned for: 4 months 17 days.

Loss in 4.5 months:  - $ 4,595.     - 40%

Kuni already made $ 5,000 from the 1st sale to John McMurdie.
They will make another $ 4,000 selling the same used car.

------------------

Kuni should buy the car back for at least $9,000.
They will have made a profit of $2,595.

When they sell the car again for $11,595, they will make another $2,595.

Needless to say, we will never buy a vehicle from Kuni and we are telling all of our friends and bridge club members to STAY AWAY from Kuni.",6,9,-1
7357,05-Aug-16,"Kung charged me for items that weren't broken. I also never got the parts back that were removed from my vehicle. They played this game of changing parts to see if anything changed with my vehicle. The second time I drove off from their facility after paying a total of almost $700 Kuni still hadn't fixed my problem. Prior to me driving off each time I showed the tech adviser Gary that the problem wasn't fixed but that they had no problem swiping my card. I was having a difficult time understanding why they would give me my vehicle back without correcting the problem. It became obvious to me that I needed to challenge the integrity of the dealership at this point. The service department failed miserably here. The service advisor was embarrassed and advised me that he was going to try to get me my money back. I advised him I paid to have my car fixed thats all I wanted. Why are you guys giving me my car back after not fixing it. Completly upset with this, I took my car to to a friends dealership @ BMW Roseville where the tech there (Rocky) found the problem in less than 5 five minuets. Needless to say I was fuming after Rocky found the problem. I had also noticed that Rocky was quite embarrassed by my situation. When I asked him why he looked embarrassed he replied to me "" the Kuni tech should have been able to find this issue without much problem...this is a pretty easy fix."" On my way back to Sacramento I called the service advisor and service manager to complain and set up my final meeting with Kuni. The service tech (Gary Goings) apologized to me but the service manager, Vince Cortez was a on the phone asking me repeatedly, ""What do you want us to do, fix your car for free?"" I asked him to look harder and he might notice that I've paid almost  $700. He said that he had read all of the invoices and had spoken to the service tech and all he could do for me was to give me my money back. I told him not to worry about getting my money back I can handel that myself without his help. It was apparent to me the he didn't have the juice to make the proper call regarding pissed off customers. I told him If he couldn't fix my car I got no use for him or the mechanic who thought he was fixing my vehicle. He had no answer for the tech in Roseville who found the problem in less than 5 minuets. I told him I will be seeing his boss tomorrow so he might want to read the work  orders again to be familiar with this case. The next day I called the GM and asked to speak with her and her service manager about this problem. The GM invited me to come in a tell them what happened. When I sat down in the office of the Service Director I soon realized that I had not spoken to the service director at all over this matter  (yet another layer of protection). He didn't act surprised by my complaint which leads me to believe that this maybe a normal occurrence here. I have never experienced this behavior before at this location and I have lived down the street from them  since the 80's when Mike Daugherty owned the dealership. I was a customer then but now I will go to out of the arear for any more services for this vehicle. Kuni kept my car for a total of 7 days total and only fixed my car after I showed the service manager where the problem was located. The service director finally decided to ""start over"" as he called it. He got tired of hearing me berate the service department. He said would put his senior technician on this. They would give me one hour free to diagnose the problem. I told him it shouldn't be a problem as I will show Vince where the issue is located. The final straw on this caper came when the service manger looked me dead in the face and said he would call me after the hour is up to let me know whats up. Four hours after leaving my vehicle there and after showing Vince myself where the problem was he had nerve to call me to tell me ""I found your problem.""  I was so pissed off I wanted to reach through the phone. and slap him for being an idiot. However, I remained silent knowing they still need to fix my ride. After a long pause he said ""I'm going to fix it for free"". The next day they kept my vehicle for the entire day and called me to pick it up at the end of the day. What a bunch of knuckleheads. The service manager was obviously getting back at me for insulting his intelligence and making them look bad This took almost 2 months to get right. Brought my car in on the 16th of May and got it fixed July 16th.  This dealership is in dire need of some help. Since my last visit I was told by a friend that the GM is gone....now if they could just fix the service dept.  Vince needs to get more training on service and go to charm school to learn how to deal with customers. The Director of the service department needs to retire. He obviously was not happy to see me and due to his poorly run service department he couldn't back their play because they screwed up big time. All he could do was tell me that my vehicle had many issues and after 41 years in the business he knows what he is talking about. He said that I should have been charged separately for each issue that my vehicle was having. They should have charged me $150 per hour to look at several differs things and they are not related. This is where I had a problem with him. $450 just to look at the problem. I told him that all of the issues were related and that for him to say that they were not was ridiculous. This was obviously a way for Kuni to run the bill up.  In the end once the vehicle was fixed all of the other so-called non related issues stopped. Imagine that. Bunch of money hungry losers...Corporate needs to fix this place! Corporate, feel free to contact me if you have any question about this. By the way Kuni needs to STOP putting ""world class vehicle inspections"" on their work orders. It makes the customer pissed off and makes Kuni look bad, especially when the customers realizes nothing has been fixed. ",6,9,96
7358,05-Aug-16,"OK so if you are a buyer looking for a car, do not come to the Chevrolet dealer on Fulton!!!!!! First, I was trading in my car for a new car which I thought was perfectly fine. A great gentleman by the name of John Meyer helped me out with this. It was smooth sailing until I had to pay $2000 for a down payment. So I did and I was also told that wells Fargo had picked up my loan. So the next couple of weeks are great. I have a new car everything is wonderful, until I get a TEXT, not a call, from one of the women working there. So she tells me I'm going to have to put an extra 1200 to keep the car. I'm like excuse me, keep in mind I've already signed paperwork for this car so it is definitely mine. She proceeds to tell me that the bank ALLY needed more money. I'm like well I'm with wells Fargo, or at least that's what she told me. She said no you must be confused you are with ALLY. So she basically lied about everything so I had to put more money down. The thing is though, I just told them to give me my old car back then because putting down 3200 for a 24 year old is really hard. They refused to give me my car back and proceeded to try to work out a deal with me, which should have been done when I signed the paperwork the first time!!!!!!!!!! So now I'm really pissed and even though I still have the car, I will not be going back there to trade or buy a new car from the so beware people.",6,9,-1

7368,26-Jul-16,"I made an appointment to have my screen fixed along with taking care of a recall issue.  I arrived on time and was greeted promptly.  I got checked in and was shown to the waiting room.  I was told the repairs were estimated to take up to the whole day, so I was offered a shuttle ride, which I accepted.  Expecting my car to be ready, I called later that afternoon to check on the status of the repairs.  The phone service at Kuni is horrible.  I was bounced around and told I needed to speak to the person assigned to my vehicle to get an update.  I had to leave a message and call back numerous times until I was finally able to get a hold of the service person around 5pm.   I was then informed my car would NOT be ready that day and that he would call me the next morning with an update.  I was offered a rental car which I then needed to make last minute arrangements to go get before Enterprise closed at 6pm!  I never received a call the next day (Friday).  I even followed up Friday around noon and had to leave another message.  I never received a phone call back.  I waited all weekend for a phone call and update.  I had to call again Monday morning and still had not received a response.  I did not get a call back until Monday afternoon informing me they had to order a part for my car and that it MAY be done that evening.  Since there were no guarantees it would be done that evening, I asked for them to keep it until the next day so they could ensure it was complete and I could arrange things with the rental company as well during their working hours.

My husband and I have purchased two vehicles from Kuni.  After this experience and from reading other online reviews, unfortunately we will never return to purchase from Kuni again.  We are very disappointed with the service department.",6,9,-1

I was told it would be ready as soon as the wash it.  When I got there, I was the last customer.  After paying the bill and went to get in my car and noticed it HAD NOT been washed.  Staff wanted to know if I still wanted it washed!  I said yes and they did it.  Can't understand why it took 10 hours to complete my work order and why they couldn't have had the car washed by the time I got there, which was 15 minutes after I called them!!

7381,18-Jul-16,"As soon as I got to your dealership, I drove to the far right bay to park, It took me a while to figure it out in what bay you go in for service, since i did not see where to go to service i pulled in I guess in the incorrect bay. One of your guys (do not know his name) tells me please move your vehicle to this bay, that is for the out going vehicles, So I moved my vehicle to the other bay,  Another guy asked me what I was in for, I said service and repairs, he asked me if a had an appointment, I said no, You will need to make an appointment for repairs. I brought my vehicle for repairs knowing that you may not even have the parts but we need to find out the issue first, so instead of so much resistant to your clients. I will think your service writers or whoever those two guys were,  should be more like, great to see you today, How could we help you today, So you have repairs, lets find out what is wrong and then we could schedule for repairs. That would be so much easy to digest from the beginning. 
After all this I got to talk to Eric about my experiences already, he has good customer service skills, anyway we got to talk about free car wash and I was happy to get it since my Denali is very dirty.  
Ok all service gets done, I get a call that my car is ready.  While I was paying I asked Eric if they wash the car, he already had someone getting the car and radio him to check if the car was washed, 10 minutes later waiting for the car we found that it was not washed at this point I was very unhappy for two reasons, if you tell your customer you will do something and you dont do it, your satisfactions is not good, I mentioned to Eric that he should not tell customers your vehicle is ready, and wait for last minute while the customer is there to wash the car.  We all have things to do and places to be, I dont have time to wait for that, especially since you had the car for 3 days.  
Now lets talk about your repairs.  I had you guys replaced the passenger window switch. You guys replaced it but failed to put my door panels in the same way they were.  They are loose and they are not fitted correctly.  
I guess is my fault for keep bringing my vehicle to service to your dealership since this happened before with other repairs, I have not been very impressed with your work and sometimes your customer service.
One time before I showed your service writer that my driver door is all scratched inside and it was not like that before I brought it to you, and I was told that your guys did not do it.  
Another time my car was leaking oil after your company did an oil changed, I brought my car to your  oil lube department and mentioned to the service writer that my car is leaking and that it was not leaking before I brought it, I know for fact since my driveway is fairly new, 
After few minutes I was told that my steering system was leaking and it had nothing to do the oil changed, I told him that it was not possible, I checked it my self and your mechanic was wrong, I was told that your Master tech is the one that checked it.  So I asked them to show it to me. So we went down the pit and he showed me the leak, yes it looked like the steering was leaking but he fail to check that the oil filter was in top of the steering dripping oil to it. So they replaced the oil filter and I went home.
Here are some experiences with your company.  Now I have to bring my car back to fix my rear door panels before they come off.



Anyway I had to show your Master Technician that the oil filter was left loose. The correct the issue and then

7392,08-Jul-16,"After getting several reminders via email and text (which I appreciated), I scheduled service at Kuni EVEN THOUGH THEY ARENT GEOGRAPHICALLY CLOSE because the salespeople were so great. Big mistake. Rude, threw his hands up at me when I came to pick up car and he denied receiving a message to proceed with the work. Other service guy witnessed it and called mgr without my having to ask (thank you for YOUR professionalism!).  Victor or Vincent (supposed manager) came over, said he'd ""talk"" to him and call me back. That was two days ago. I haven't heard from him. Huge time waster and disappointment, not to mention I made special arrangements to spend the day helping a friend at work JUST SO I could have a ride to take and pick up (single mom---no one else to help). Kuni knows I have a nail in the sidewall of my high-performance car and did not fix it nor follow up. It takes a lot to make me angry, but total failure in their part. Had my car ALL DAY long and changed the oil and installed LoJack.  I thought I was coming to pickup a car with new tires. I was trained in customer service by B of A.

7404,30-Jun-16,"My story goes like this.

I called because I knew that I needed a new alternator or car battery asap but was not scheduled to be seen until 48 hours later. I expressed my urgency at all times to the front desk by phone and was habitually transferred to the service department where nobody answered the phone and I had to leave multiple messages. 

After calling and talking to multiple reps I found that my car battery was not covered by my warranty and I decided to buy a new battery and install it myself at a local Autozone. 

Then, my alternator completely dies the next day and when I called for help finding a tow truck it took 3 different representatives at the front desk to finally advise me to call a different agency when I was lead to believe that Kuni would arrange all the leg work for finding me a tow truck company that could work with my vehicles make and model to tow it to KUNI. 

After 3-4 hours waiting in 100 degree weather trying to establish a tow to KUNI the service department was closed and I had to leave my powerless vehicle overnight in the front of the service departments parking lot. 

I was never offered a loaner vehicle or informed that that was even a possibility during all my contacts nor the next day when my car was at KUNI, I also had to call to follow up once my car was at KUNI and after 2 long days the alternator was replaced free of charge but only because of my warranty.

I took the car home without realizing that the technicians never even bothered to put the cap back on my battery that is located in my rear seat when they checked to see if the problem was with my battery after I had told them that I replaced the battery before I even took it in. 

I had to then take the time and screw the battery cap back in place. 

Overall I was not pleased with the whole experience and felt frustrated from beginning to end.  

The interesting part about all of this is that I've been dealing with KUNI for over a year and this is the first time that I have been truly displeased with their service. 

I hope this an anomaly and not the norm moving forward.     ",6,10,-1

The ""manager"" who we negotiated with was basically a jerk, which I get is his role, but what a terrible experience. Why car dealerships still operate in this confrontational way is confusing. We went to CarMax, and they had TONS of customers. We went to this Kuni dealership and we were the only people there on a Saturday evening. I tend to think it is because of the improved and low pressure experience at CarMax. In total, we got a nice car at a price we are happy with, but the 6+ hour process is just too ridiculous.

7410,27-Jun-16,"The price of the car we purchased from Kuni was excellent.  However we made the mistake of allowing Kuni to process our loan paper work with the Golden 1 Credit Union.

When we bought a BMW at another Dealer also certified used and a 2015 vehicle there was no ETC.  After processing our paperwork, I had to demand that they fill the gas tank to full; otherwise they were just going to fill the tank to half full.   If I were to buy another vehicle from Kuni, I would get pre-approved from Golden 1 again and then have Golden 1 write the loan paperwork.  This way Kuni will not have an opportunity to add un-necessary charges to the paperwork like they did with us.

7416,23-Jun-16,"I came to Kuni in hopes to find a reliable car. The first day that I went in, the bank that Kuni was attempting to go through would not accept our offer after all the wonderful help from Angela Ivey. We received a call the next day with great news that one of the banks came through due to Kuni working with me, I was beyond excited. We drove away in a newer car after trading in my old car, there was an annoying squeak in the car when backing up and Kuni told us to just make an appointment to come back in to get it checked out. We made the appointment a few days later in the service department. When we took the car in, they told us that it would be a few hours that we would be seen even though we had an appointment and that it would be a $50 deductible to get anything fixed. We had to wait a whole week to even get another appointment. During this time, we were driving the car, I received a call regarding a discrepancy in the contract and eventually came to terms. When we took the car in for the re-scheduled appointment, they kept the car overnight without any notice, rental car, or any accommodation, I had to continuously call to get an update and I did not even get to speak with the service advisor assigned to my car. When we planned on going to get the car, they told me I could not get the car until we re-wrote the contract and put more money down. Kuni put me in a complete bind leaving me without a car for 2 full days! We finally went to Kuni and it took them 30 minutes to even tell me what is going on.  At this point, I requested my down payment and keys to my old car back. They told me a check would be ready the next day in the morning. We wasted a trip to their facility to find out the check was not ready nor did they have access to my title. I called to speak with a manager, Elizabeth, to get additional information about this confusion. I requested a call from her to let me know when the check would be ready and she refused to do so.

7448,01-Jun-16,"I was not pleased with my recent appointments for service repairs on my vehicle. Granted, I did not purchase my new car at Kuni, but it is under warrantee, so I wanted to have my repairs done at the nearest dealership. I was experiencing a few problems with my car. First, there was a leak somewhere in the ceiling of the car, plus my rear view camera was not working, The first time I took it to Kuni, they kept my car for almost 4 weeks. When I got my car back, there were screws missing from the roof rack, and the rear camera still did not work. The second time I took it in, they replaced the screws and the camera, but a few days later the camera failed to work again. The third time I took the car in, it was a Friday morning. I called them at 4:30 that afternoon to see if I could come pick up my car, and they told me that it hadn't been looked at yet. (Note: I made this appointment so they knew I was coming in that day.) I called them on Monday at 3:00 p.m., and was told it wouldn't be ready until the next day.
I shouldn't have to call at the end of each day for an update. I felt that every time I called for an update, it was an inconvenience for them to talk with me, much less call me back. Sometimes I would leave 2 to 3 messages before anyone called me back.

I have a 2001 impala and I have had to repair this part once before.  It was a stupid design and could have been much more simple and less costly to replace.

7563,23-Mar-16,"I've owned my 2013 Cadillac XTS for less than 3 years. Last Friday, the car would not start. Saturday at 8am I called KUNI service to have the car looked at. I was told that there were no appointments and I was welcome to bring the car in and KUNI would try in fit me in sometime during the day. I was told that no loaner was available and I'd either need to rent a car or wait. I decided to put the service off until Monday. I left a message for Rick LaTour.
On Monday my service representative Rick LaTour called me back and let me know to come right in and get this checked out. I consider Rick's service excellent. The battery failed the test and Rick advised me that the new battery and service would cost $ 260. and it was not covered because my original warranty was over the 50K miles and the very expensive extended warranty that I purchased with the car would not apply. 
I am very disappointed that a 2013 vehicle with less than 3 years would need a new battery! It's my understanding that most new batteries have at least a 3 year warranty and I can't believe that Cadillac would use a new battery with less coverage than that. 
I buy new Cadillac's from Kuni so I don't have to put up with cars that don't start. Please put me in the column of completely dis-satisfied with the battery replacement policy and re-thinking my next purchase. ",6,10,-1
7569,18-Mar-16,"My experience with replacement of a recalled electronic steering column lock that had been replaced and also failed was about as bad a breakdown in communication as it gets.  From what I was told on the phone before taking in my 2000 Corvette through getting a ride back to the dealership after five days in the shop it was misinformation and lack of communication the whole time.  However, I have to give them credit for replacing the failed recall replacement at no cost to me after I'd been told I'd be responsible for the entire cost when I brought it in.  I found it hard to believe I would have been charged to replace a failed part that replaced a recalled part, so I was glad I didn't have to fight that battle after the work was done. ",6,10,-1

Also, when I picked the car up, I asked if my tires were rotated and I was told they were not because that was an extra expense.  If that is the case, why wasn't I asked if I wanted that service performed?  Finally, the wash job was terrible and the interior was not vacuumed.

The whole process took less than 45m, which was great compared to the estimated time of 90m, but when my vehicle was returned to me I noticed something that was a little disturbing, I lost one of the valve caps on the passenger rear tire and hadn't got around to replacing it so when I received my vehicle back and that darn valve with no cap was in the same place, I quickly bought it to the attention of the service advisor and without any argument quickly took my keys and had a technician actually rotate my tires",6,11,393

I stood in one spot looking around, trying to get eye contact from any of the other service technicians or the lady's at the far end counter and yet still no one said anything to me. A few minutes past, but it felt like 15 mins (I'm sure it was less) and young man that came from the back area to assist someone else asked me if I needed help - I thanked him for asking me and I advised that I was looking for a certain technician, however, as long as I was standing there - I was actually standing by his work space. This young man then went above and beyond to tag my vehicle and advised that my technician will be with me. I thanked him for his service to me and waited for my technician. Once my technician was done entering my information he stated that I could go and wait for a ride. I stood there for a split second and stated, ""wait where""? he then pointed where I could go and wait for a ride. I figured that he could have at least led the way to the waiting area. This is the second and last time that I will ever go to this particular Cadillac facility. I wouldn't spend a cent there due to the treatment that I experienced for the second time.

I had to wait for an available service associate to check only to come back and tell me it was not ready. They offered for me to take it home but could not tell me if it was drivable or still under repair.  I was sent to a rental car shop to pick up a significantly lesser vehicle. I had another wait there as well.  After 4+ attempts for further status they let me know that they do not have the parts and to come pick up my vehicle.  ,6,11,796
7668,18-Jan-16,"I stood at the service counter for at least 10 minutes and not once did a service adviser look up and acknowledge that I was even there.  I do not mind having to wait, I do mind being completely ignored.  This has been my experience every time I bring my car in.  I understand that these guys may be busy but a simple greeting doesn't take any time at all.  I was there for an oil change, and had someone taken a second to ask me, I would have been told that I was in the wrong area.  I had never used the express side before and didn't know it was over there. Again, just an acknowledgment of my presence would have done a lot.

When you buy a car they treat  you like royalty but the minute the papers are signed the tune changes. I've had problems in the past with the service department but went back for a simple recall. Asked if they would check something else, they didn't. They don't seem to be concerned for your time at all and often don't provide any solutions unless you pose them. It doesn't make me want to buy any more cars or trucks from them or even get a simple oil change.

7706,21-Dec-15,"We bought a brand new car. The car needed (2) items to still be installed by dealership. After a great experience with the sales team in buying the car, we had to bring the car back a week later to install the (2) items. At the point of sale we were told this would take only an hour, and they also told us that they would give us a loner car if we needed to for the day. So We made an appointment, and confirmed during the week. They assured us it would be a quick visit, and the loner car would be ready. We show up for our appointment, and they tell us it would be a couple of hours. (No biggie, we are getting the loner car.) however they knew nothing about the loner car. After 20 minutes they came back and said they don't have one to give us, but they called enterprise. We were at the dealership for almost 90 minutes before we were in a car. We had trouble at enterprise also. Took us over 2.5 hours to get our ""loner.""
After about 5 hours or so they call us to let us know it's ready. We showed up about 25 min before closing. They did not tighten one of the items that were installed.  He said there was no one here and asked us to come back again. The guy would not help us, there was no way that there was no on there with tools to fix this. Should only take 1-3 minutes to fix. So we had to bring it back two days later. The guy promised we would be rushed through, and only an hour or less. When my wife took it back it took them 90 minutes to install.

Told him the driver assist need service (read out on panel) and that cruse control was not working all the time.I told him that it works sometime and in the last 8 months 8 to 10 times it has not worked. the dash says driver assist needs service. I also told him it was working normal now. 
Steve got in the car and started playing with the cruse switch. The car was parked in your driveway. He said it is working normal and that it seems to be ok. I reminded him that it was normal now. We did this three times. Well it is not showing a code for it. I told him there is a code for it.  He then asked me ""what's the code"" I said I don't know the code number but when you diagnose it it will tell you what the code is. In a real condescending voice it asks three times 'whats the code? whats the code? whats the code? JERK! I told him I didn't know the code number. You have to hook it up to diagnose the problem to get the code. 
I also told him there was a update for the navigation that needs to be done. I told him it takes 18 minutes for the update. He said ""18 minutes""  ""18 minutes"" as if to say how in the xxxx do you know that.
I asked for a loner car while the vehicle was being worked on. He told me the girl was out to lunch and he can't authorize it. I told him to call her because I had already arranged it with her. He said he didn't  how in the have her phone number. Kuni has to have her phone number.

7763,18-Oct-15,"Although the service department staff was very courteous i feel that my vehicle would have been better serviced had i been taken to the jeep dealer on day one rather then spending two days in a gm dealer attempting to be diagnosed.  on day three is was finally taken to the jeep dealer but brought back to the gm dealer for repairs where the service writer even noted that it was taking them longer as a non mopar dealer to repair. Consequently my vehicle was in the shop for two weeks waiting for parts and repairs because of that issue.
two weeks later i am in need of it going back to the shop as the original issues have returned. 
My other concern is that this vehicle was a Kuni Certified vehicle and the two items found are items that under any certified program would have disqualified the vehicle for certification and where missed during presale inspections. It appears that there is a reason why certification needs to be done by the manufacturing dealer and not the dealer selling the vehicle. I am extremely disappointed by these repairs as the sales staff really pushed the initial high rating the vehicle had received under the Kuni certification.  If these repairs where missed by Kuni and had to be diagnosed by Jeep it makes me wonder what else was missed during initial inspections that i will need to deal with. I also question why the repairs went through my aftermarket warranty when the vehicle had a dealer 1000 mile warranty and the car had not yet been driven 1000 miles.

He said that he ""specifically told the crew"" to rotate the tires. Yet, when I got home, I looked at the tires and they had not been rotated. I know this because the front and rear tires on my car are not the same - two different brands with two different PSI ratings.

Apparently, they were booked solid with appointments through Sept 7, so they could not give me a time of when they would be able to even take a look at the car and try to determine the problem.

Thankfully, Performance Chevy said they would happily accept the car and look at it right away...so, now the car is at a dealership that actually tries to help people.

Kuni should understand that when a person's car breaks down their life is immediately in turmoil.  A service shop needs to make some sort of minimal effort to help or they shouldn't accept delivery of a broken down car.

The guy assigned to my car, Dan, made no effort to move things along and seemed clueless to the concerns of the customer.

For the rest of my life, and as long as the Piece of Garbage Kuni is in business, I will tell people how awful, awful Kuni is...and that we would all be better off it is just went away and died.

Thanks,

7807,01-Sep-15,Communication not good! Telling customers one thing and not doing what they said they were going to do!!!! Waiting for call back and then me the customer have to call to check status of my vehicle. I was told oh Rick didn't call you!!! He was suppose to. Ed should of called back and say hey Rick the service director is gonna call you back because he had to look into what was going on with your vehicle.,6,12,4
7809,01-Sep-15,"Eight weeks ago my 5-year old GMC Acadia was towed to Kuni Chevrolet. After fighting with Kuni and the GMC regional rep on our out of pocket cost to replace the engine in this lemon of a car which has had 12 recalls and 17 additional service visits, AND a new A/C and engine mount out of our pocket, we agreed to pay $500 for a new engine and rack & pinion (note this is the 2nd rack & pinion). Kuni took 7 weeks to do the work - 7 weeks! And, the customer service stunk the whole time. They neglected to keep me updated on the status of the repairs and stuck me with the $375 for the rental car I drove until we settled on a repair price. Then, 3 days after picking up the car, it stops running again, and I have it towed to Kuni. Instead of apologizing for the shoddy repairs, the service manager tries to make excuses saying the vehicle is a ""complicated machine."" Really? I call it ""inept mechanics"". Kuni's customer service and quality of work is appalling. ",6,12,-1
7866,15-Jul-15,"Once again, the service department has me frustrated.  We originally had our car in to have a broken headlight replaced back in June.  The part the dealership ordered and installed was a different unit then what the car originally had.  They failed to let us know the two lights would be different.  We noticed the difference when we got home.  Upon calling the service department, we were told ""yes, I saw they were different"".  Were they just hoping we wouldn't notice and therefore chose not to say anything??  They agreed to order and replace the other headlight to match the newly installed one as they failed to disclose the difference to us at any point when the broken one was ordered and installed.  After a month of waiting, we still had not heard that the part was in.  They were to call us when it arrived to schedule an appointment.  When we called to check on the part, we were told, yes the part had been there.  They just decided they weren't going to call us to schedule the appointment?  Were they thinking we would forget and they wouldn't have do the replacement? 

Another appointment was set for two weeks later to have the new part installed.  I arrived on time and was told to have a seat in the lounge.  I was told to hold on to the keys and someone would come get them.  30 minutes later and I'm still waiting for someone to take the keys so they could begin working on my car.  What is the point of having an appointment if you are going to wait so long for them to even get the keys??  Why wouldn't they take the keys when checking in for the appointment?  

To top off one issue after another, they then left the stock light bulb where the other headlight clearly had a different, and very expensive light bulb in it.  They replaced the stock light bulb with the light bulb that was in the unit being replaced the first time.  Another go around and I finally get the light bulb back that should have been put back in back from the service department.  

Why is everything so difficult with these guys?  Every time we've had to take our car in for service, there is an issue of one kind or another.  It shouldn't this difficult.  The only reason we'll have to come back to the service department is our car is still under warranty.  Thank goodness the sales department is competent and the purchase process was painless and easy.  They make up where the service department fails miserably.",6,12,0
7888,28-Jun-15,"My wife and I went into Kuni to trade in her vehicle. We were helped by Ismael. The deal we made with him was for them to pay off her existing loan and she would purchase a pre-owned car. It was a Sunday so we couldn't call the bank to get the exact payoff so they told us not to worry about it, that they would call during the week and find out. That it would be taken care of. They put down an estimate on the papers. After a few weeks my wife received a notice from her old loan saying she had to make a payment because she was still showing a balance and that they were going to send her to collections. So we come to find the dealer didn't pay the full loan. It seems that the salesperson ismael didn't communicate about finding the exact payoff to his finance guy and instead, the finance person just paid the amount that was on paper. We called back to let them know. I spoke to their finance person toshi (who is very rude and condescending) and said he couldn't do anything for us anymore. I asked him if I could speak to a manager. He said he would have a manager call me that day. The day ended and no one called us back. I had to call back like 10 times to finally speak to a manager because no one ever picks up when transferred. The manager mike basically pulled the 'it's on the papers you signed' card. And said they couldn't do anything about it. I had to tell him to research the situation and at least speak to Ismael about what had happened.  Long story short, they were dishonest and didn't keep their promise. Now my wife has to pay two loans because they didn't do their job. They have lost a loyal customer and our family as well. My family had previously purchased vehicles there but will never go back after this. I hope people don't get in the same situation and stay away from this place.",6,12,79

7918,12-Jun-14,"My girlfriend and I went into Kuni looking for a NEW smaller SUV. We dealt with a man named Dave Forget and initially we were really impressed with how ""UN-carsalesman like"" he was...we tested several vehicles and narrowed it down to one that we really liked.  We left and went to other dealerships to test a few more cars and when we were pretty sure we wanted to go with that car we came back to this dealership.  We came back and he was not there so another woman helped us.  We talked inside about final costs and while inside we asked if this car had a rack...we forgot to look and it was evening and dark out, but we travel alot and we hadn't thought about it when we test drove it earlier.  The lady responded ""Yes this model has a rack, it has the crossbars and the actual rack""  I am upset with myself for not checking it out for myself but at the time she seemed sure of herself and I didn't feel I had a reason to question her.  We left and came back on the weekend ready to pay for it in full.  Dave was there so we dealt with him again.  We got there during the day and noticed there was no rack, no cross bars, and the option to upgrade another feature we were told was possible was not an option either.  When we inquired about it, this guy that seemed so kind and genuine, even to our children, became a different person.  He contacted the woman that gave us the information and said it doesn't have it, he's sorry she was mistaken, and basically there was nothing they could do about it.  So we said, how about we look up the cost that it would take to add one and you take that off the bottom line price of the car...We are talking a $22,000 car and a $300 rack.  First they said no...just no....then after talking for a bit they said once we got the $300 rack put on and we sent them the reciept they would reimburse us $150 of the $300....Are you serious??? Not only were they willing to lose a sale over $150, they became EXTREMELY unfriendly, all of a sudden it was like we were bothering them and wasting there time.  At this point...we walked out.  

After speaking in the parking lot with my girlfriend and her father, in order to avoid starting our search all over again and her father not wanting to travel back out to Sacramento, they decided to go back in and buy (this was NOT my position...as I am very big on morals and customer service, and once I've walked out I'm done!)

They went back in...which I refused to do at that point due to the way they spoke to and treated us.  I got on my phone, and vented to my father about what had happened, as they closed the deal inside.  About 5 minutes later Dave comes out and says can you come in, if your not happy we're not happy.  For a split second he seemed to feel bad about the way he treated us.....THEN he says....You are going to get a survey from General Motors and if we get a bad review it is not a good thing for me or for the company!  Wait...so your only being nice now because you got the sale and you want a good review on your survey???? I couldn't believe it.  I shared with him...my father is looking for a truck, and I will be getting a car in a few months, and based on the mere customer service I will not give you my business.  He then says, I just want to ensure that I won't get a bad review...I wasn't even the one that gave you the incorrect information.  I looked at him, smiled and said yes... you'll be fine, just to get him to leave, and to keep from causing a scene.

He walked away and I am still waiting for the survey from GM to let them know about our experience.  

Last week my father bought a  truck from M&S used car, had a good experience, and I am going tomorrow to shop around for a car for myself.  I will never patronize this company nor would I refer them out to anyone.  Who takes the chance on loosing a sale on a $22,000 car that someone is paying cash for over $150????  

They left a very bad taste in my mouth and anytime I speak with anyone about shopping for a car my first words have been and will continue to be DO NOT GO TO KUNI CHEVROLET!  Then I will proceed to tell them how we were treated.  Good new travels fast but bad news travels at lightning speed!

My fellow google plus viewers...you've been warned!!! There are so many other companies out there that will treat you like a real person! 
I am going to search for corporate info to give GM the survey I have yet to receive!",6,12,-1
7921,07-Jun-14,"I called the Kuni dealership to inquire about the price of an oil change for my car.  The woman who answered the phone said it was $39.95 plus tax for 5 qts of 5-30 oil.  I made an appointment for several days later.  A mechanic friend of mine said I should double check the price because he thought my car took more than 5 qts of oil.  I called Kuni again and another woman quoted me the same $39.95 plus tax for 5qts of oil.  I said I thought my car took more than 5 qts of oil, told her the year and model of the car, asked if she could tell me how much oil it would need and the total price.  She said my car would need 8 qts of oil and each extra qt added $1 or $2 to the base cost of $39.95.  I said I would like the actual cost of my oil change and she said each qt of oil over the 5 qts would be $2 each so I would be charged and extra $6.  When I arrived for my oil change the service guy said it would be $59.95 plus tax for my oil change.  I told him what the women told me over the phone and he said they were very good at their job, but they didn't know the price of oil, that it was actually more than $2 a qt.  He did not apologize about the price difference and proceeded to write up my service order.  I said I didn't think it was right that I was quoted one price on the phone and then a higher price when I came in for the service.  He then said he would lower the estimate to $50 (still more than the phone quote) for the oil change and made me feel like I was being unreasonable to expect the quote I got on the telephone from Kuni employees to be correct.  I accepted his $50 quote and left my car.  

The rest of the experience was fine.  The car was ready when he said it would be, I got a phone call letting me know it was ready and some info about the oil change.  What should have been a simple positive experience was turned into something that felt like a bait and switch experience.  I think Kuni should train their people who answer the phone to either look up the correct information for the customer or transfer the call to someone who does know the answer.",6,12,20

7932,25-Sep-13,"I called Monday to get a cost for an oil change, for my 2006 XLR.  I was asked if the car used synthetic oil, I told them it did.  I was given a price of $79.95, and was told it included a tire rotation, full inspection and fluid check.  I called another close dealership, was told the same price and same service was included. Being that I was a past customer of Hubacher Cadillac, I made an appointment with Kuni.   Big mistake.  When I arrived I was greeted nicely, then the service writer came with my paper work and told me the cost would be $109.  When asked why he said nothing was included, it was extra for synthetic oil and extra for tire rotation,  when I told him what I had been quoted, he said he did not know why that this is what it would be.  I was very surprised that he did not offer to find out why.  After having a fit, he lowered it to $90.   It really is not about the money, I think it is about being an honest business.  I am glad I went there for service before I had work done. I also got a quote for new tires from them.  If I can not count on what they tell me, I will not be back to there dealership, ever!!!  I guess the sale of 4 tires at $325 each, was still not enough for them to care... Being ups old by a dealership is the worst.",6,12,73

7976,06-Dec-16,"Car Purchased: 11/10/16 

I called at 9am to let Art know we needed to move our appointment from 11am to 12pm. Art ended the conversation by stating the vehicle would be pulled up front before we arrived so it was ready. We arrived at 12:15pm (after a 2+ hour drive with an infant). The car was not pulled up and the search for the car began. Two or three employees were ""trying to locate the vehicle"". I over heard Art (in a slightly belittling tone) ask the search committee if he needed to go find it himself, because he would find it quickly if he needed to. Looking back now, I wish he would have helped. One hour later the vehicle was finally pulled up. The car battery was dead and it looked like the car had been sitting in a far off corner for months. The car was covered in dirt, cobwebs, hard water stains, etc. Fortunately we had test driven the car at another dealership and we knew what we wanted so we could look past the dirt. But we were embarrassed for the dealership, although it didn't seem to matter to them.

The one good thing, the negotiation and paperwork with Steven went reasonably fast once we said we had to leave. We had a commitment in the afternoon at 2:30, which is why we arrived at 12:15. Since we waited for an hour, Steven helped rush us through the paperwork. We were 30 minutes late to our previously scheduled commitment. As we signed the $10k check and walked away from our $65k purchase, we were assured the vehicle would receive a ""full detail"" and be delivered the following day. 

Christian - the ""sales guy"" - was really nice. Didn't interact with him much, but he answered our questions and seemed the most attentive. He was great going over the features of the car upon delivery.

At 1pm the following day we decided to contact the dealership about the delivery time because no one had called us with an update. We were told the vehicle was ready, was leaving the lot shortly, and would arrive in one hour. Two and half hours later the vehicle arrived. Apparently when this dealership performs a ""full-detail"", it means a wipe down with a dust cloth. There was dirt all over the car, the paint they use to write numbers on the windshield was still on the glass, the tires still had chalk/paint markings on them, and there were numerous spots inside the vehicle that were left dirty. It's quite shocking actually. 

I suppose our standards have been set too high having dealt with Lexus and Infiniti dealerships in the past, but we really only seemed to matter from the time we agreed to a price to the time we walk off the lot. We live 2+ hours from the dealership, so we'll obviously never go back, but even if we lived across the street, I'd have a hard time revisiting this dealership. 

Steven did offer to detail the car if we brought it back, which is an easy offer when he know's we live 2+ hours away. The better offer would have been to contact a partnering dealership near our home town and arrange to have the car detailed at Penske's expense. 

Overall, we had a pretty rough and underwhelming experience with Penske. Doesn't feel good to leave disappointed after you just spent $65k. At least we love the car.

*****UPDATE #1*****11/29/16:

Penske has contacted me in an effort to improve my experience, and I appreciate their effort. I respect the effort they made to provide detailing services and letters acknowledging their missteps. They recovered well.

*****UPDATE #2*****12/05/16:

We were fooled. We were contacted by Sabrina at Penske, and she offered to reimburse the cost of detailing up to $200 (we live 2 hours from dealer, so they said have it done locally and they will reimburse). We had the car detailed and sent the invoice. We received a call on 12/05/16 from Harout who shared that they were no longer going to reimburse us for the detailing because of the review we gave them. It's fairly evident the poor services trickles down from the top, which is unfortunate for the good guys like our salesmen Christian, who was great, but he is being lead by poor managers. Multiple times, and multiple employees at Penske, we were asked to give a review of our experience, so we did. And our experience was not good. Penske attempted to recover, but they failed again to provide a great experience because they were unhappy with our review. They must cover up a lot of bad experiences and reviews by attempting to intimidate you in to giving a good review. And clearly they have a cooperate office monitoring their reviews, so I look forward to continuing to share how poorly managed our experience was.",6,12,-1

He didn't even bother to open the hood and check where the noise was coming from. He saw me not satisfied and said ""Your car is completely normal, OK!"" and went back to his office, leaving me out there! All he was trying to do is to get rid of me.

7984,29-Aug-12,"I went in to buy a brand new Camaro, everything went well...and drove her home that day.  Two days later, I get a call from finance saying that the financing fell through.  They wanted more cash from me and said that my interest rate was going to increase.  If I did not agree to these terms, they were going to take the car back from me.  Freaked out, I start looking for help.  I decided to post on Camaro fan forums, figured the guys on there would be experienced car buyers and know the pricing of a Camaro.  Come to find out, not only am I involved in whats called a spot delivery scam, I over paid for the car by a landslide.  Jilma in finance, told me that I was paying hundreds under factory invoice and 29,650 was a steal for a BASE 1LT (only option added: automatic transmission).  The finance director Omar, kills me kindness on the phone and talks to me like I'm an idiot.  I am told,  what I'm going through happens a lot at sleazy dealerships.  If I were you, I would take your business elsewhere...there are plenty of dealerships around

7991,07-Jan-20,"Sold me a car in 2017 and never informed me it had been crashed before I bought it. I called Reed in October of 2019 to inform him I found out it was crashed because the dealer I tried selling it to said they didnt' want it because of an accident in July of 2017. I bought it a month later. This means someone they lent the car out to crashed it. He said to bring it down and he'd buy it, but before doing that in December of 2019, I went online to get an estimate. I included the crash to see if some other dealer would at least give me $9,000. One was close, they offered me 8,000 and convinced me to bring it in to get more. They said no because of the accident and informed me that I could've received $9500. I went back to Penske, Reed was not there. I figured I'd see what they offer now and see how different the amount is compared to what Reed said he'd offer. They only wanted to give me $5,500. I had just been offered 8,000 from an entirely different dealer, and these sales people said it's only wroth 5500. They didn't care that I was not told it was crashed previously. They said to wait for Reed. I did for 2 hours. He never showed. I left my number. He never called. I called several times after that, he never called. I called again the next day, he never called. I emailed him twice, he never emailed. Horrible customer service there and on yelp one can see I'm not the only one dissatisfied with this dealership",6,12,-1
7992,10-Dec-15,"After my lukewarm review on Yelp due to Adam West's unctuous used car salesman tactics, I was offered an extra key for the vehicle I purchased from Penske as follows: ""If you can let me earn a chance to redeem this experience for you. We'd love to provide you with a complimentary key seeing as how the vehicle didn't have the extra hub, free of cost, Thanks again for the feedback so that we may progress, but we'd love to help improve your point of view and hope to recieve a positve experience rating if obtainable."" 

When I made multiple attempts via email and telephone to schedule picking up a new key, no one ever responded. I finally went back to the dealership yesterday to see why they had not responded to my multiple attempts to contact them and was told that the point of offering me a new key was so I would take my lukewarm review down although these terms were never explained in the original email. 

Shame on the management for failing to keep their word as expressed in their email. A positive review would have been obtainable if the dealership had kept their word.",6,12,-1
7993,15-Nov-17,"We purchased a brand new 2017 Chevy truck for $56,000 from Penske Chevrolet in Cerritos, CA on November 14, 2017.  The vehicle had 30 miles on it when we took delivery.

Upon final delivery, the salesman didn't walk us around the outside of the vehicle to make sure everything on the outside was ok, he only concentrated on the interior features. The next morning, we discovered a couple of chips in the paint, numerous scratches on the bed, and a screw in the right rear tire.

We went back to the dealership the next morning, November 15, 2017, to show them the damage.  The Sales Manager, Rey Gonzalez, moaned and groaned about the damage and said he'd have to talk to our salesman who won't be back for a couple of days.  He gave us a Due Bill to fix the scratches but wouldn't honor that until he could speak to our sales person.

Mr. Gonzalez flat out refused to fix the screw in the tire saying it could have been something we did, which is true.

What I want prospective customers of Penske Chevrolet in Cerritos to be aware of is that they treated us nicely before the sale was finalized and treated us very poorly the following day.

They could have easily repaired the tire.  After all, they delivered the truck with 30 miles already on it and the tire could have  picked up the screw during those 30 miles.  Instead Mr. Gonzalez completely refused to fix the tire for us, instantly souring our opinion of Penske Chevrolet of Cerritos.  Is that any way to treat a customer that spent $56,000.00 at your business the previous day?  What is wrong with people?

I don't know how smart you have to be to hold the title of Sales Manager at a car dealership but I do know that Penske Chevrolet of Cerritos spends a lot of money on advertising to bring new customers to their dealership.

If all it cost was $20 to repair a tire in order to make a new customer who just spent $56,000 feel well taken care of and appreciated, or even cared about at all, knowing they would likely refer their friends and family to the dealership, then that would be money well spent.

Instead, Mr. Rey Gonzalez has left us not only disliking him, but also disliking the company he represents, Penske Chevrolet of Cerritos.  Perhaps the Penske Automotive Group should send Mr. Gonzalez back to Sales Manager school with a emphasis on good customer relations because we won't buy from Penske Chevrolet of Cerritos again and we certainly won't recommend our friends or family shop there either.  All because Rey Gonzalez, Sales Manager at Penske Chevrolet of Cerritos was too much of a cheap skate to fix a screw in a tire.",6,12,66
7995,24-Feb-13,"My mom and I visited this dealership on Saturday, 23 Feb looking for a 2013 Traverse.  The dealer had only 2012 models and indicated that they would be able to find one in given the large inventory owned by Penske.  After talking with some additional salesmen, a search was done and they were unable (I believe) to find a model that matched the vehicle we were looking for.  The sales manager asked if we would mind coming back during the week when the had more time to help us.  I suggested that Sunday would be better.  They took my name an number and I have not heard from them yet (It's Sunday 8:30pm now).  I continued my search online about 2:30pm on Saturday - found a match at Selman Chevrolet in Orange.  I spoke with the sales staff at Selman and they did not have the exact model we were looking for but they found one in Fontana, had it delivered and that night we bought a Traverse from Selman Chevrolet in Orange.

When they washed the car to give to me they put a dent on it. Not a big deal they promised they would fix it. I bought my car on friday and by monday i got a call to schedule my car to repair the dent. I was at work so I called as soon as i get out. No call back for a couple of days so i called back. Three weeks and four calls later i reached out to my sales rep for help. She was able to get me an appointment. I wanted to upgrade the exhaust so they scheduled their vendor to meet me the day i dropped of my car. I drop off my car at 730 and im supposed to meet with their vendor at 8am. The vendor never shows just wasted my time. Already frustrated one of the service guy comes up to me to let me know my car is ready. I go outside and its not even my car. A second guy comes out to tell me my car is in the back they are just drying it. So i wait and the first guy comes back to let me know my car is still in the back untouched and if I want to wait 15 minutes they can wash it for me. Told them forget it i just want my car and to get out of there. I let them know what happened. To make up for the inconvenience they say they will give me the upgrades I wanted at cost. I thought that was a great deal so i figured give them one more shot. I get the price quote and it seemed high for "" cost"" so I did some research. They actually were charging me more than what the dealer was promoting on their webpage. So to make up for all their mistakes they wanted to charge me more for my upgrades.

I was hoping that my satisfaction in buying a ""Certified"" vehicle would be important to him. It was not. I was very unhappy to have driven over 2 hours to look at a car that was supposed to be ""Certified"". I was ready to purchase the car because it was a good price. But I don't believe that customer satisfaction was the rule for the day. Leah Sneed was great, I think if she were able to she would have done what was needed to make me happy. I left very disappointed. It is too bad that Leah Sneed lost a sale because those around her who have the responsibility to do their job correctly fell short. I would not be surprised that the mechanic who signed off on the ""Certified"" vehicle probably did not even look at the car.

9122,15-Jan-18,"On Dec 15 and 16th of 2017 My wife and I drove our 2017 Silverado 3500 from our home in Oklahoma to Riverside, Ca. Just hours prior to us leaving on this trip, we were notified of a recall by the salesman whom we had bought the vehicle from. The issue with the recall affected the fuel gauge operating correctly. We had not experienced any of the symptoms related to the recall. But that changed just hours into our trip. We arrived at our destination on the evening of Dec. 16th, which was a Saturday. Knowing that there weren't any dealerships open at that hour, I chose to wait until Monday morning to contact a dealership near our location to see about having the issue resolved. 
At approx. 8:00 a.m. on Monday Dec. 18th I utilized Onstar to find a dealership near our location. Pearl, at Onstar connected me with Antonio, who works in the service dept. at Riverside Chevrolet. I explained our situation to Antonio and advised him of the recall that we had been made aware of. Antonia stated that if I could be at Riverside Chevrolet by 9:00 a.m. he could get us in by noon. I arrived at Riverside Chevrolet at approx. 8:40 a.m. Upon my arrival I spoke with Antonio and again advised him of the recall that I had been made aware of. Antonio stated that if the issue that I was having with the vehicle was related to the recall, the dealership should have the parts required to repair it. Because Chevrolet normally sends extra parts to the dealerships to repair vehicles that are affected by recalls. I inquired about a ""loaner"" vehicle since mine was in for service do to a recall. Antonio stated that I could get a ""loaner"" and that he would get one for me. I was then directed to another area of the dealership to fill out the required paperwork for the ""loaner"". While filling out the required papers for the ""loaner"", I was asked for a credit card. I asked why my credit card was needed if the ""loaner"" was complimentary. I was told that my credit card would not be charged, but that it was just put on file for incidentals, or in case in didn't refill the vehicle with fuel. I again asked why my credit card was needed, ""if it won't be charged""? I was then told that it wouldn't be charged with out my prior authorization. I advised that I wasn't comfortable giving my credit card information for no reason, if they are so certain that it will not be charged. I was then advised that I would not be able to get a ""loaner"" vehicle without giving my credit card information. And that I should really get the ""loaner"" vehicle because the dealership may not have the parts required to repair mine today. I then questioned why they wouldn't have the parts if it is recall related and if Chevrolet sent out extra parts to repair issues related to recalls; and that they are suppose to be able to get my vehicle in by noon since I had arrived prior to 9:00 a.m. At that point Antonia stated that they would do the best that they could and directed me to the customer's waiting area. 
The repairs were made by noon and I have not had any further issues to date. 
But I feel like I was simply be told what was required to get me into the dealership, and then to get me into a ""loaner"" so that the dealership could charge the manufacturer for the ""loaner"". I feel like the dealership was more concerned about getting me in there, and then figuring out how to capitalize monetarily however they could. And that the repairs would not have been made in a timely manner had I not periodically checked with Antonio and reminded him of the timeline that he had stated. 
I do not feel that the priority of Riverside Chevrolet is to be honest and forthcoming with the customers; as is getting the customer in, then capitalize on them being there. ",6,12,-1

I was apprehensive to even try a GM product after I lost almost $100k (Retirement Fund/Stock Certificates) in the  bankruptcy/reorganization. My sister wanted a small SUV from the local Chevy dealership, against my better judgement, I agreed. 
It took three salesmen to try and beat us down but when that didn't work, they left us waiting for over two hours to make a cash transaction with finance. Even after we got into the finance department, a man who called himself ""The Director of Finance"" came into the office and interrupted us several times.

After inspecting myself the water pump has some rust on it from when it leaked last year when it was replaced, but not leaking, just showing signs of a previous leak.

I was using a rental car (provided by them) and was forced to bring it back (so it could be sold for the Labor day weekend.  While switching the rental, they tried to put me in an F-150 that was listed at $26,000.  I needed to be around $22,000 for the trade-in and payments would work.  They said maybe they could squeeze it down to $24,000 at the best.  Went home and found the same truck listed on the internet at $22,000.  I hate the BS games.  I was loyal to them and felt pretty screwed.  When I picked up my Captiva it looked like someone had eaten glazed donuts while driving it and was dirty as xxxx.  Needless to say....

When I walked into the service office there were 4 service writers in the office 1 helping someone and 3 pecking away at their keyboards, all 4 SR completely ignored me for about 10 while I stood there.  When I was waiting the 10 minute I over heard 1 of the SR calling on the radio for a Porter to bring up a vehicle he stated to who ever answered that the a lady had been waiting almost 30 minute for the to bring up her car...  Once a SR finaly acknowledged me I told him I was there for an oil change and break inspection and that I was leaving the car.  He said ""ok, but it wont be ready until tomorrow afternoon"" I said ""really?""  He replied ""Yes, we have like 45 appointment"" I then remembered and told him that I had scheduled an appointment for the next morning for 7:30 and told. He replied ""then it will be ready in the morning"".

The next day I went to the dealership to pick up my truck I like the lady the previous day waited over 20 minutes for my truck to be brought up, I assumed it was being washed so I didn't mind.  Turned out that was NOT the case, while I waited I witnessed a gentleman come in to the waiting area and conplain to the cashier of a similar situation she directed him to a manager at the front of the store just as a porter walked in the door he asked what the issue was in Spanish she told the porter the issue and he said to the casher the customer should ""go sxxxw himself"".

I asked for my check back, they mailed it back as promised.   BUT SINCE THEN THESE xxxxxxxx HAVE SENT ME TWO LETTERS SAYING THEY DENIED ME CREDIT, AND APPLIED THE DENIAL TO MY EXPERIAN REPORT !!!!   I NEVER SIGNED THE CREDIT REQUEST.    SO MY 750 + SCORE WAS NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR THEM.

I called the salesman that helped me with the car and he said just come in and we’ll fix it. I came in and talked to a finance officer and she told me it can’t be changed and I should have read my contract and it stated Feb 1st. 

I’ve now had this car for almost a month and still haven’t gotten a call for when I can get the tint put on. I could have saved money and went to a tint shop and gotten it done on the same day. The only reason I did it here is because I was told I would get a loaner car while they do the work, which after reading my contract I see also is not true. 

Now do I love the car, yes. Do I feel like I got cheated, not really.  It’s the inconvenience of it all. I shouldn’t be told one thing and not get it. That’s a real bad sales tactic.

A simple part replacement would solve the issue, and I would be happy, but they refuse to order the part, citing ""compatibility issues"" which, is still not a problem for the customer.  Also, if there are compatibility issues with certain phones and how they interact with their vehicles, then they are at the very least guilty of false advertisement as no where in the vehicle manuals, dealer documentation or advertisements that only some devices may work with their internal systems.
Again, they looked at my under warranty vehicle, ran some tests that had already been done before AND was documented (which they had access to) and the end result was still that they weren't going to fix the issue.

9481,02-Oct-18,"My review is not so much against Crown Dodge, but rather the Dodge vehicle I purchased. 
On August 25th, I purchased a 2017 Dodge Charger. After only 2 days in the car, I got a ""service shifter"" alarm. Also, the service department at Crown called me and said there was a recall on the computer software system, so I brought the car in. After they performed the upgrade, the computer system crashed. That led to them having the vehicle for 2 weeks while they tried to fix it. It required them calling the corporate mechanics because they didn't know how to fix the computer. They ended up having to replace one of the computer components. After I picked up the vehicle, I drove it for 2 days, then began having multiple problems. The check engine light came on. I also had erroneous readings that all of the tires had low tire pressure, and some sort of brown fluid was leaking from under the car. Back to the dealership. They have now had the vehicle for the past 2 1/2 weeks. At this point, I don't even want the car back. As far as I am concerned, this car isn't safe. I just want Dodge to buy the car back and allow me to purchase a vehicle that actually runs. The whole reason I spent so much money on a new vehicle is for the reliability. I am afraid that if they make me take this car back,  the computer system will fail while I'm on the freeway and I could seriously hurt or kill someone if I can's stop. Computers seem to have influence over just about everything in cars these days.  I have an open case on file requesting a buy back option. The case manager is in Texas, I believe, and she is very difficult to contact. This car is not safe, but I feel like my concerns are being ignored or at least allowed to drag on. I bought this car 5 weeks ago and have only actually driven it for a total of 4 days. The car is still in the service department as I write this review. 
The dealership itself has tried to be helpful throughout all of this. Alex, my sales manager has been helpful and is doing what he can, but the buy back option is out of his hands. The service manager has been helpful as well. Also, JP my service advisor has been an advocate. Crown Dodge has provided either a rental car or a free loaner vehicle for me while my car has been out of commission. ",6,13,280
9494,12-Jun-18,"I was excited to finally find a car, I get a Jeep Compass which I was sold from first glance and test drive. Once the ink was signed and I drove it off the lot, the back up camera kept sticking, even in drive. The gas mph is supposed to be 22 in the city and 32 on the freeway. I have pictures now of my gas gauge is malfunctioning and not reading accurately. The radio switches back and forth from Media on it's on. I brought the car back in for other servicing to let them know. I reported both of these problems when I brought my vehicle in on May 7th. The customer service rep told me that I indeed needed a new radio and that they couldn't find anything wrong with the gas gauge. She would order the radio and it could possibly take a day or a month. What kind of timeline is this?! Especially on a brand new vehicle. It is not June 11th and I have yet to hear back from the service department on my radio. I am still having problem with the gas gauge and can show you pictures of the issue. I am very dissatisfied with this service. A new car should now have these issues and before leaving the lot should have a full inspection. A timeline for a part should never be a day to a month. The communication on this is ridiculous. I want my radio and gas gauge fixed! No more excuses. This is disappointing to pay so much for a vehicle to not get what you paid for. I will do a courtesy to call the service department today to see if my radio is in. I have already contacted the manufacturer. If this is not handled I will seek legal counsel.

9501,02-Apr-18,"We had a terrible experience at the Crown Dodge Service Department. I spoke with Kristin on Friday. I made an appointment for Monday morning for repairs to our new 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee. I called at 8 am on Monday to confirm. Kristen confirmed the morning appointment time as between 9 and 10 am. She instructed us to ask for her upon arrival. 

My wife arrived at 9:05 am. She parked the car and went to one of the offices in the service department. She spoke with Monte about the scheduled repairs. He asked who she had been assigned to. She said that we had only been advised to ask for Kristin. He reacted as if there was no Kristin. He took her to a window where there were three sheets of paper taped up listing the appointments for the day. We were not on the list. 
My wife insisted that we were instructed to ask for Kristin. He then conceded that he did know Kristin and advised where she could be found.

My wife entered the main office area where she found Kristin. Kristin asked where the car was. My wife said it was parked outside. Kristin scolded her for not getting in line. We were not instructed to get in line before. 
My wife moved the car behind the 20 - 30 cars that were in line. Why were we given an appointment, then placed in line behind 30 cars? What is the purpose of an appointment?

When she got to the front of the line, a young man tried to help her. He had to find someone who would work her in, since she was not on the list and had no one assigned to her. The young man was going from one person to another, but they were all saying they were busy.

Finally, Monte came to the car and asked what she needed. She told him about the trouble we are having with the car. 
He said he saw on his tablet that we needed “a loaner”, but there were none available. She said that was fine, she just needed a ride back. He told her she would have to take a shuttle, and there was not one until 11:00. She said okay and waited in the cold waiting room.
Luckily a nice shuttle driver came in at 10:25 and offered a ride.

At 3:48 pm Monte called to ask what was the purpose of the car being brought in. My wife had to explain the trouble again. The car had been there all day, and they hadn’t looked at it yet.

I called at 4:45 and asked when we could pick up the car. Monte said they wouldn’t be able to look at it until tomorrow. I was furious. We had an appointment at 9 am! We had been without the car for an entire day, and now they were going to keep it another day. I told him we would come and get the car.

My wife went to pick the car up. She went to Monte who waved her off and told her to go in the office for the paperwork work in order to pick up the car.

The car remains in a state of disrepair.

9553,27-Oct-17,Went to this dealership. I found 2 chargers with 20% off sticker on windshield. Just what I was looking for.. The sales person was jonny.. Which was great at first but then when it came down to price I noticed he wasn't adding the 20% off when I asked he said both cars were a mistake and they should have never had that sticker. He should have owned this from the beginning... How is this my fault? He then came back and said they granted me the 20% off which was still a lie.. he tried explaining how much money 20% off was. It never added up. I pulled out my calculator so I could show him how much 20% really was.. Which he was off by 1k. I went to car and by that time they took off stickers of 20% off.. But they really think we buyers are stupid.. I went to the other car took a picture of the 20% off.. And i took a picture of the car I was trying to buy. This is not the first time they mix up window stickers like this.. I came a month ago and had this same issue.. Also the car was labeled as a 2017 it was a 2016.. WOW.. I still was willing to give them a chance because of the car itself.. Didn't happen though. Jimmy decided to pawn me off to one of his managers.. I saw jonny outside when I was leaving.. Its my fault if you look at the reviews it would let you know about this stuff.. The manager I must say was nice.. Gerardo I believe his name was..

I'm pretty sure it was the second reason.. their service department is atrocious they continue with their lying long after you have bought the car the service people are rude unknowledgeable about what they are speaking about and overall horribly unpleasant to deal with.. basically their thought process is if we make this as an unenjoyable as possible for a customer they will not come back as often thus we will probably save money on warranties... my wife's car is only a year old and has been shutting off as she drives the vehicle when she called service today they told her nothing we can do for you you'll have to come by next week sometime and maybe we can take a look at it... that is absolutely unacceptable.. when I called back they just talk over you don't allow you to speak and then hang up the phone multiple times..

9583,14-Jun-17,"Before I begin, let me say that I take no joy in writing such reviews. As a reasonable, patient and fair person to a fault, I take such reviews seriously. I would much rather submit a positive review (and I have done so for many organizations I have done business with), however, when really bad situations arise, I think it is important to share with those that could otherwise avoid having to go through a similar experience. This dealership is hands down the worst Jeep dealership I have ever encountered. I tried to purchase/lease a vehicle from them several weeks ago. I started off by speaking with Scott Walters, then was passed along to Darren Stewart and finally to Paul Mills. I have been a long time loyal Jeep owner with excellent credit and had many models of Jeeps both purchased and leased from various dealerships where I have lived/worked around the country. I generally always asked the same set of questions to make sure all the figures/terms are clear, so not my first rodeo as the saying goes. Crown Jeep refused to answer very basic questions that I asked verbally and in writing and then gave me attitude for actually asking the questions. Furthermore, I have tried on (3) separate occasions to make the G.M., i.e. Mr. Crown via his assistant Terry Vasquez aware of my experience so they could use as a learning tool to improve customer service for future customers, hence the reason I have resisted writing this review until now. I have never had the courtesy of a reply from her or anyone else at the dealership. Needless to say, I took my business to another dealership and was treated fairly, professionally, courteously while valuing my time. I even contacted the GM of that dealership recently to let him know how positive my experience was with the Internet Sales Manager. Do yourself a favor and avoid Crown Jeep. They are dishonest (deliberately did not apply rebates/incentives I was eligible for, probably to pocket for themselves), unprofessional and just outright rude. The place is dysfunctional and clearly it all starts from the top right on down. If I could give them zero stars I would. These people need to wake up and realize in the year 2017 that many people want to avoid the haggle and complete as much of the transaction by telephone as possible and then go in, sign the docs and be on their way. If you don't want your valuable time wasted, not to mention being unnecessarily frustrated/ripped off, then don't give this dealership your business. Go somewhere that they actually value the customer relationship and appreciate your business.",6,13,69

Apparently, they do not since we DROVE 2 HOURS to see the 4x4 only to find out they do not have any on the lot. We have now wasted 4+ hours in travel time plus gas.

Called 3 separate times. Every time was put on hold for close to 15 minutes average. First time the connection finally just dropped. Other two calls the receptionist came back on and tells me there is nobody available to help me. How hard can this be?Noticed they asked what type of service right up front. Maybe when they know it's a Safety Recall you go to the bottom of the pack (no big money there for them).

I wasted my one chance to get away from that car because I trusted them.

9707,27-Nov-15,"I am a medical student and my husband is an active duty service member stationed at the Port Hueneme Naval Base. I unfortunately didnt do my research before we decided to buy our first car together as a young married couple. I posted a review of my first experience with them about a month ago, but after I posted my horrific experience on 4 different review sites they decided to finally do something about our situation. Long story short- they sold us the wrong car to drive off of the lot. We asked for a V6 4x4 and we drove a 2016 Jeep Cherokee 4cyl off the lot. It wasn't until the next morning that our financial adviser pointed out that we were driving a 4cyl, which was NOT the vehicle I specifically asked for. I returned the vehicle less than 24 hours later and after being harassed by multiple salesmen as my husband and I walked across the lot due to the fact that we were already returning the vehicle, they told us I lost $10,000 in equity and there was nothing they could do for us. Not to mention they lied to us about the cost of window tinting, the rental car agreement for servicing, and the details of the car we drove off the lot. I had the financial manager give false information to us and thankfully my financial adviser educated me before I went in. I had to call Navy Federal representatives twice during the closing of our deal in order to prove that our financial 'manager' was dishing us negligent information. They called me back 4 days later after my detailed and explicit reviews were seen by the entire dealership and bought my car back at full price and I finally was able to drive my 2015 Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk off of the lot. I thought that I finally put my miserable experience to rest, but that was a joke of a thought within itself. I scheduled a detailing appointment with Cassie on Friday, November 21st.I told her in front of my husband that we are leaving for Tahoe next week so we need our car. She acknowledged the information I provided her and proceeded to schedule my detail wash appointment on Tuesday, November 24th. Well, it is November 24th without my car. I called Crown Dodge 4 times today asking about the status of my car. I dropped my car off at 8:45am this morning. At 3pm, they said they didnt even get to my car yet. I called back again and my service manager didnt answer the phone. I called again at 4:30 and my car still wasnt finished. I called again at 5:30pm and my service manager didnt answer again. My husband dropped me off for my friends funeral this even WHICH I LEFT EARLY FOR TO PICK UP MY CAR after service hours. I called them as I was walking away from the funeral to head to the dealership and they said my keys were not available for me to pick my car up that i dropped off to get a DETAILED WASH ONLY OVER A PERIOD OF10 HOURS. I am scheduled to leave for Tahoe at 6am tomorrow with my husband. I am supposed to pick my family up along the way and get there in time for a scheduled event while my husband is taking leave before deployment. They once again said their famous words, ""I'm sorry Mrs. Cann, but there is nothing I can do for you."" I gave them the benefit of the doubt for fixing my car situation and took down my reviews on all of the sites, but this is the final straw. I am now being punished for the fact that not one person called my husband or me to tell us that the car would not be ready by the end of the day WHICH WAS IN FACT GUARANTEED TO US TWICE. I am now xxxx BENT on making sure I can continue to make sure I can pass our experience onto others so prevent them from buying and servicing at your dealership. I already called the Better Business Bureau once and I will be doing it once again tomorrow morning along with contacting Crystler. You have wasted enough of our time. I will be seeing you guys first thing tomorrow morning.

I told the sales guy what I was looking for and he showed me what trucks where the 25k ones and took it for a test drive and came back and he asked if we could run some numbers. We went inside and he took down some information and told him that I did't want my credit ran and told him what it was since I was just at Toyota a month before(just wanted a rough estimate).....He came back and handed me off to his manager because he had another client that was interested in a car. The manager sat down and said that the truck was 35K. I told him that the paper and online said there were rebates that brought it down to 25k not 35k. He said that the only rebate he could give me was a $1500 credit....I explained to him that's not what the paper said and he said ""well if I could give it to you for 25K I still cant get it where you want the payments ""(acting like he was doing me a favor for giving it to me for what its advertised for). I told him that I understand that but wanted to run some numbers and see where we end up but he wanted to run my credit and he said ""if you don't help me why should I help you(being very rude at this point). I told him that I just wanted to run numbers but if it didn't work out that's fine and I just wanted my keys back so I could leave. He couldn't care that he lost this dealership money.

9793,02-Mar-13,"I have given this rating due to the way I was treated in the service department. I took my jeep into this place for warranty work. I was informed they would check out my jeep and call the warranty company and give ma a call by the end of the day. Two days later I had to call and was given some run around and was told there was a Chrysler bulleton out stating the jeeps were installed with faulty trans filters and that this would fix the problem. They made it sound like it was going to be covered it was not. 3 day later I had to call again and find out the status of my jeep now and again was given some run around saying they could not duplicate the problem and would I mind coming down to show them. Took off work early and took jim for a ride and duplicated the problem. 4 days later I had to call and find out the status and I was told they couldn't duplicate the problem that I had shown him 4 days earlier. I informed jim to stop all work and I want my jeep back and that I need it by Wednesday night at the latest he said fine and that he would do it and call me. Wednesday night no call Thursday no call until Thursday afternoon jim calls and says the jeep is done. The total is way to much for something that was played off as warranty. 
So I spent 13 days without a car due to jim not calling warranty right away so they could issue me a rental. This is why I purchased the extended warranty. Now after paying the high bill I get my jeep home and look under it to find the transmission pan is leaking transmission fluid as well as the front shock, control arms (upper and lower) as well as the half shaft and inner fender have a bunck of grease and oil all over them.

The Sales Manager said this is a Chrysler Certified Per-Owned Vehicle that they spent $2,000 getting it Certified. After numerous break downs and phone calls, I found out it was not a Chrysler Certified Per-Owned Vehicle.

Some of the problems:
Broken rear track bar bracket, axle could fall off and roll over vehicle.
Wheel lug nut where undersized and wheels could have fallen off.
Dislocated rear axle spring.
Rear Sway Bar rubbing through break lines.
Transfer case shifting cable broke first time tried to use it.
Transfer Case is bad and needs to be replaced.
Oil press sending unit was bad.
Bad oil leak.

The sales manager agreed to give me $3,000 off, then changed it to $2,000 on the contract without telling me. When I found out it was too late.

I got this 2009 Jeep Rubicon about 6 weeks ago, I have not been able to drive it for the past 3 weeks because it's unsafe to drive.

A few weeks after buying this Jeep I found Crown Dodge where running ads $1,000 less than what I had paid for it, I believe this is unlawful along with some other unlawful things they may have done.

I've been back to Crown Dodge over 20 times trying to straighten this out and just get the run around. This jeep has been it their shop 3 times and I have talked to half a dozen people there.

I contacted about 10 different dealerships, all with the same details: Give me your best price possible and I will buy a car from you today. Also, see what deal I can get on my 2010 Challenger RT. I was contacted by Richard Schwartz since I posted on the internet. We went back and forth. At once, I thought he was rude through email but its hard to tell if he meant it like the way I took it or not, so I brushed it off. I told him, here is a quote on the best price I have been able to find. Also what the best offer on my car as a trade in. He said, I can beat it, just come down to test drive the car and drive home in it. He said, come as soon as possible since I like to leave early since I have the day off. I said I will be there before 5. I even left early so Richard wouldnt be held back too much longer.

I get there and I notice the car isnt where it has been for the past few months. He said, oh, its been moved. We walked around for 10mins. He said, let me see if its somewhere else. I waited in his office for about 10 more mins and he came in to tell me it had be sold. OK, that happens, not happy, but I understand, you can always get another car. Then I am told the price I showed them wasnt going to happen. That it was a low-ball offer and no dealer could ever do that price. I didnt tell him it was a friends dealership that I have done business with in the past, I just told him and some other manager that I have gotten 10k off previous yr SRT8s. I wasnt even looking for that type of deal. Was told I dont know what Im talking about and Im pretty much smoking crack. 

Then as I am trying to leave and get my keys since they tested out my car to see what shape it was in, another manager told me pretty much teh same thing Richard did. Im a liar, dont know what Im talking about, blah blah blah. Well, Im never doing business there again.

I have been bringing my car there for a yr for service and had very good experiences with them, but after this, I will be driving 30miles somewhere else each time I need an oil changed or any warranty work done on my Challenger.

Another manager did call me to check up and see what the status was and from what she told me, this isnt the first time Richard has done this. If this is true, then why keep someone like that? If you know he is bad, why risk having a customer, like myself, be handled this way?",6,14,2292

9816,21-May-11,"I took my vehicle to Crown Dodge starting in January/2011 after Chrysler instructed me to take it to a Dodge service center if I wanted potential assistance with unresolved issues with the car. The initial problem was in regards to an air injection code that had been in the vehicle since a little over a month after purchasing the used 2005 Dodge Stratus. After a little over a week, I was told that my car needed a new O2 sensor and then after opening it up they found that it also needed a cadillic convertor (spelling?). I agreed to replace these parts and the problem was still not resolved and I was up to about $3,000 in repairs. About a week later my service rep told me that there was a special emissions warranty on the car and that I would have to pay for any of those repairs. My car was at Crown Dodge service center for 6 weeks. During that time I got very few updates on what was going on and I finally let them know I needed to go out of town and needed to know if I would have my car. I was told to pick it up and I drove to Nevada. When I got there, my car had an oil leak and the air pump was still staying on. I had to disconnect my battery every day to keep it from being drained by the pump. I called Sandy (my service rep) the day I arrived and she told me to bring it back when I returned. I remained there for 3 weeks and on my way home the dash was glitching (back defrost turning on and off, radio/clock turning on and off) and about half way home the odometer readings started flickering all over the place. I returned home on Saturday and took the car in Monday. I was told there were 2 oil leaks (cost almost $800) and I got those fixed. They told me the dash was flickering initially but they couldn't repeat it so come get the car and bring it back if it continues. I paid for the oil leaks (3 weeks later) and didn't even sit in my car before noticing the dash was flickering. I left the car and then was told that there was a ground issue and they were having trouble finding where it was coming from. Eventually I was told they found it and that cost me $225.00. After I picked up my car there was a loud noise coming from my engine (it was heard over my radio) and the car was still puttering at slow speeds and stops. I took my car back and Sandy advised me to take it to my mechanic to make sure it wasn't the transmission and to let her know what they say. I did that and then took it to a transmission shop, per my mechanic. They confirmed it was not the transmission and that you could clearly hear the noise form the engine. I called Sandy back and didn't get a return call so called again a few days later. I was instructed to bring my car back in to Crown Dodge, so I did and after a few days they called and told me it was a loud alternator (Sandy was not there and I got a new service advisor, Jeff). I told Jeff that I wanted to follow up with Chrysler because I didn't understand how there was a new issue with the car that wasn't there before. I also asked him about the puttering and her told me it may be a core issue inside the alternator, but they wouldn't know until they replaced it and also asked me to follow up with the service manager, David Weber, about my concerns. I left a message for David and never got a call back. I also called Chrysler and after them speaking to David, they agreed to pay for the alternator. After the repair was done, I picked up the car and to my surprise it was still puttering. I left and immediately called back to Chrysler. I also found that a rodent of some sort had been in my trunk (how I don't know) and chewed up some papers and a piece of the weather strip in my trunk. I called and spoke to Jeff on a Saturday and he asked me to leave a message for David on Monday, which I did and he again didn't call me back. Chrysler got a hold of David regarding the puttering of my car and I was asked to once again bring back my car. I did and now they are telling me it needs 4 new motor mounts and the car isn't puttering. I told Jeff not to touch the car because I wanted to follow up with Chrysler because it didn't make sense to me how it now has another repair that wasn't needed before and how the issue it has had all along that was never fixed, suddenly isn't there. He asked me to call David and I said he doesn't call me back so who else can I call. He said Stewart, a new service manager. I left a message for Stewart that Friday and surprisingly David called me back Monday. I explained to David my concerns about the recommended repairs because each time I bring it back there is something else wrong with it that wasn't there before. All he kept saying was ""you need 4 motor mounts"", over and over again. I told him not to touch my car and I was following up with Chrysler, which I did. My rep from Chrysler called me back after finally getting a hold of David and told me that David said they are recommending I replace the motor mounts, but based on the mileage and year of the car they didn't really have to be replaced and they weren't really worn down that bad. For this reason Chrysler said they couldn't authorize a repair that was ""needed"", which is why I questioned it in the first place. Chrysler has offered to send me to another dealership service center for another look. I picked up my car from Crown Dodge on Monday May 16th and attempted to file a complaint against David Weber and the woman I spoke to attempted to address my concerns by bringing David in to speak to me. This was a big waste of time, David told me good I was going to another dealership and I also let him know I had filed a complaint with the Bureau of Automotive Repairs and he said ""ok, good"". I told him I didn't understand how my car continues to have new problems every time I bring it in and how he didn't return 1 phone call I made to him, except that morning after I left a message for someone else. He just kept shaking his head at me. Then I asked him about the weather strip in the car and he told me to have the new service center access it and call Chrysler. I said ""so Chrysler is responsible for damages that happened to my car while at your service station?"" and he said ""yes"". I said that doesn't make sense, how are they responsible for damages that happened at your service station and David said because a rat couldn't get in my trunk. I said I don't know how it happened, but the damage happened while it was at his service station and he told me to call my insurance company and file a claim. I said, ok, so now my insurance is responsible for the damages and he said yes. I said that doesn't make any sense, the damage happened at your service center and he said ""I don't know what to tell you, it's an insurance issues. I told him he didn't make any sense and I needed my key. I was told it was in my car and he walked away. I continued to express my concerns with the 2 women at the counter and 1 informed me that David and another guy looked at my trunk and said it was normal wear and tear and a rodent didn't do it. I showed her the pictures I took before I cleaned the trunk (to make sure a rodent wasn't still in there) and a pillow case with the stuff that was chewed on was in my trunk for them to see (I don't know if David ever looked at it). In total I was without my car for about 13 weeks and was never offered a rental car, except for 1 weekend when I was dropped off to get my ""fixed"" car and had to leave it there for continued issues. I am insulted by David's lack of returning any of my calls to him and his response to any of the concerns I presented to him and my service reps. My car is still not fixed and I have to take it to another service center this upcoming week.   ",6,14,-1

very average, nothing special that you couldn’t find anywhere else at a much lower price, the labor per hour is stupid expensive and the parts are marked up some

When I spoke to the advisor she asked for me to go outside to get the service card And I had to explain what the previous person advised me.  She didn’t even have her name on the paperwork it was another guy who didn’t even help me.  For a simple oil change and tire rotation I took 4 hours to complete.

The Service advisor didn’t know one of the techs went home sick until the end of the day, which made my truck stay another day, no work was done to it on the second day.

I sent an email to dodge corporate with the details of how bad of an experience I had but I have yet to hear back.

9963,19-Jun-19,"After extensive correspondence back and forth with their Online Sales representative, I thought the final price was settled and agreed upon. Originally the sales person quoted me at $923 for DMV fees, which meant they were calculating this 60k truck as if it cost over 150k. I thought this was insane so I used the DMV calculator from the official DMV website to double check and they were indeed up-charging like crazy.  I let him know that as a non-resident, active duty military I would be waved from some fees. Salesman came back with $110 for DMV fees. Sounded good.  When I visited the dealership and it was time to sign all the documents with their finance guy, they changed the sales tax because it was ""miscalculated"". Even though the salesman acknowledged my zip code multiple times in our emails. This I could accept because I didn’t expect them to pay it for me. I signed all the documents and called it a day. About 3 weeks later I get a text from the same finance guy demanding an additional $338 for DMV fees, after going back and forth trying to understand why I would absorb their mistakes, he threatens me with his office manager calling my commanding officer to collect the money. This is incredibly illegal and plain unethical and unprofessional. I then resulted to having the Base Legal Office get involved and rectify. Ultimately, after Legal got involved they accepted their own mistakes. 
Hypothetically speaking, these people could quote you $1 for certain fees and then threaten and demand different amounts. That’s pretty vile.

After checking status on my vehicle for the third time ""two hours"" later with my advisor I finally stood there until I got an update also my vehicle was never washed as I was told it would be. I was called back & credited with a FREE oil change on my next visit.

He told me that a rental was just turned in. What a coincidence! I left my car and took the rental. I explained that I bought an extra package from finance to cover any scratches on my Jeep. Of course he had never heard of it but would look into it. I returned to get my Jeep. They had detailed my Jeep but the scratches were still there. I was told to go out to the waiting room and they would bring my Jeep up in a couple of minutes. I waited over 30 minutes  for them to bring my car to me. They told me there were cars in front of it that they would have to move. In reality, my car was next door in an overflow lot and they didn’t know it.

10048,15-Nov-18,"I had been looking around for the new 2019 Ram Rebel and on a RAM truck message forum (5thgenrams.com), I was referred to Max B as another local forum member just picked up a Laramie trim from Max.

This dealership had tons of Rebels compared to other dealers who had little to none. So I figured they have the most inventory means they know how to get one for me??

So I call Max B. and introduce myself and tell him that I was referred by a forum member.

1st red flag - Max did not care about the referral or his deal - he just wanted to sell me a truck. Max was offended when I told him that of the 35 Ram Rebels in stock that I could not pick one.

So he asks some questions and I give him answers.
I offered to send a build sheet from the Ram website so that he can look for an incoming Rebel that met my needs. 
I email him my build sheet and he calls back and starts to ask questions on package options and such.

2nd red flag - Max arrogantly states that a 3.6L engine (base) can not be had on a Rebel and never will be. That was a lie - there were a couple of 3.6L Rebels popping up in San Diego and Lake Elsinore using the Ram truck locator.  I could tell Max wanted me to just take a truck off their lot and forgo looking for a 3.6L engine.  I felt that Max was lazy and didn't want to pick up his fingers to locate an incoming or find a factory order D1 or KZ status.

3rd red flag - Max says why get a V6 engine when a REAL MAN drives a V8 Hemi. I try to explain that I am not going to haul, not going to tow, and need the truck as a daily driver. 

Max making that sexist remark is unheard of these days unless he came from a trailer trash area of Georgia.

4th red flag - Max would not tell me which is more affordable to lease on a Rebel when we started to talk about numbers.  He just said he has no idea about residuals and money factors.  Huge mistake - all salespeople are taught to give out base numbers when a customers asks - how do they close a customer ???

5th red flag - Max laughs at me when I try to change over to a Big Horn trim with a 3.6L engine and says that a special order will take 6-8 weeks. That was a lie - there were tons of dealers receiving Big Horns with base 3.6L engines. As a matter of fact I just test drove the Big Horn at an Anaheim dealer 2 weeks prior.

6th red flag - When asked about special ordering, Max immediately changed his superior attitude to that of condescending.  Max did not want to do a special order because it means he would have to work.  I could tell Max wanted to sell a truck to me now - not in 6-8 weeks for a special order.  How a car dealership survives without having some of their sales on a custom order is beyond me.

Do NOT do business with this person or dealer - he will lie thru his teeth to get you into any car they have.  
Max lacks basic customer service skills, no knowledge of financial numbers, will berate you if you want a special order, and make sexist remarks.  
Beware females who are independent - Max will rub you the wrong way as he did to me.",6,15,0

When I asked why wasn’t everything flashed as I asked and was written in the order I was told that was all I needed.  

The flash did not solve my problem and when I returned I was told they could flash everything but it wasn’t necessary because only the pcm controller the blower.  I told the service writer to again update and flash everything and was told “That’s a lot more work” and that I would be charged again.  When I asked if that was why they didn’t do it in the first place I felt like I was treated dismissively and I was not given an answer.  I asked for some consideration because the service was not done as I asked and the service writer was kind enough to only charge me 2/3 the price of the original price.  The flash did work and I now have a working truck but a total disregard for the service writer and dealership.  I would recommend going to another dealer and avoiding Orange Coast for service.

10131,02-May-18,"Where do I begin? Saw a sweet online price to get me in, wanted to purchase the vehicle too. After reading all of these great reviews of this dealership I was hoping to have a good day.  I dealt with Max, seems very friendly at first and was quick to write you up for the advertised price to make you happy, but after a while he makes you feel as if your wasting his time and was very condescending. 

After going back to the finance guy, they sneak a lot of things to add up the cost which I did not want, was not negotiated and he was not willing to take off. Also he was not aware of the price that was negotiated upfront. Somehow they were trying to sell me the vehicle at two different prices and clearly not on the same page in the upfront price with Max. I saw the red flag in their fishy process and all they were doing is playing games to con me. The nice discounted price disappeared. All he did was lower my monthly to make me happy since they did not budge on the net cost, but up their interest rate to 8.9%!!  I have excellent credit and should not pay their outrageous rates! As I was walking out, customers were upset in the waiting area. I am just glad I left and purchased elsewhere.

10140,11-Apr-18,"I FILED WITH THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU AND FEDERAL REGULATORS THESE PEOPLE ARE SO BAD. NO JOKE- BUY FROM ANY OTHER DEALER...Spoke to the CFO Armina Mgerian- she is fully aware of their illegal sales tactics and has no interest in discussing any of it because they have numerous complaints against them already and people still buy cars from them- her basic response ""what you gonna do about it""... BUYER BEWARE...Wow. Just wow. Worst experience ever. they did a bait and switch on the APR. Told me I should qualify for 3% interest on the loan. I agreed to come drive the car. I agrree to buy it and work out my trade in. Everythings great so far. Then after he runs my credit he LIES and says I don't qualify for ANY purchase loan and cannot buy the car. BUT he can offer me a lease a 8%... bait and switch. BUT it gets worse. I decline and leave... and sure enough the next day a DIFFERENT salesman contacts me and states he CAN get me the 3%. I respond anything over is unacceptable, but if you can really get me under 4%, I'll still buy the car. He comes back and offers 5.5%... They had my credit history PRIOR to running my credit. Then told me 3%. Then no deal but a horrible lease deal. Then magically the next day he can't swing 3% but can get me a loan for 5.5%. How does it go the night before from NO DEAL you are screwed... to 5.5 % the next day? How? Because they commit lender fraud and try and make you love the car, commit to buy, then state the only deal they can give you is HORRIBLE. IF you won't take the bad lease, they will send you home. Then they finally make a REAL effort for the loan, you grab the 5.5% and they get a kick back from the lender. I'm contacting Chrysler, the state of CA, the BBB and speaking with an attorney. I was smart and got the entire exchange in writing via email and the attorney confirmed they did a blantant bait and switch. Buyer beware and do ALL negotiating via email.

10257,15-Oct-14,"Stay away from these guys, COMPLETE DIRT BAGS!!!! My problem started over a month ago when I contacted these guys about a new Jeep Rubicon X. I was emailed back by a sales person named Garrett. He informed me he could give me 1k off sticker. I politley thanked him and said, I could get at least 3k off sticker at several other dealerships, at which point he became beligerant and typed back in all CAPS. I have purchased 4 different vehciles from this dealership in the past and forwarded his emails to the owner of Orange Coast, Jon Gray. I had his email from him thaking me for my prior purchases. Mr. Gray responded back saying that Garret's conduct was unprofessional and said that it was not indicative of his employees attitudes. I accepted his apology and he got me in touch with a new ""Salesperson"" named Ken. Ken assured me that I would be getting 4k off the sticker of the vehicle to make up for the service, which I thought was great.

It started out just fine. I was going to use OC Motorsports to build the jeep and we were going to wrap some of the cost of the lift into the financing. It took almost 2 weeks for the lift and pricing to be finalized through OC motorsports (Partly my fault since we priced out several different suspension packages). During that time they sold the vehicle they had quoted me on. When I inquired when they could get me another, Ken said yes, but now my discount would only be 2k as it was a new model year (Had I known that I would have been down at the dealership day one). The classic 1990's used car salesman bait and switch!!!! At this point I wasn't happy,  but I wanted to see where the numbers landed. Ken had all of a sudden dissapeared and wouldnt return my emails. After my third email he ""Apologized"" that he had been busy with end of the month (Like he couldnt shoot me a 2 line email letting me know that"" and said he would have my numbers shortly. 

Two days later I get an email, not from Ken, but from the original rude and inept sales person ""Garrett"". There was nothing written in the body of the email, just a screen shot of their computer screen showing a montlhy payment that was $140 higher a month with an additional $1500 down payment. Ken didnt even have the decency to send the email himself to explain why the down payment and monthly payment was substantially higher. This is one of the most unprofessional, classless transactions I have ever been a part of!

I have purchased over 23 new vehicles since 1994. I have never been treated with such contempt or indifference. I have purchased 4 different vehicles from this dealership, so to say I have been loyal to them is an understatement. I bought my 2014 Grand Cherokee SRT8 from Poway Jeep because Orange Coast wouldnt return my emails in a timley manner (Never contacted the owner on this issue). This dealerships service and employees are sub par and define why the general public cant stand the buying process. Buyer beware, absolutley an untrustworthy dealership!!!!!!!!!!",6,15,101

Ok experience. I came 3 times total. End up buy the jeep wrangler Sahara 4 doors here, because I like the car a lot. 
First time I came, no one outside great and show me car. 

Second time I went inside the office, then Cole Jezowski said hi and showed me the car. Test drive with him. I like him. He is not too pushy. It's his job to sale anyway. I asked him all kind of questions about the car and finance. Then I walked away. I told him ""can we do this tomorrow?"" He answered ""sure, I'll keep your file here. So you come back I have all info ready. "" at least he was not rude. 

Next day I came back at 7 pm. Talked to Cole again for price and financing. I got the car for Around $37000 total. Waiting for finance was really long, two hours waiting. Cole is experience seller. He gave me an impression that I had some good discount. This is my first time, so I was trick.

10260,07-Apr-14,"After several test drives of 09 Mazda5 at 4 other dealers, I went to Orange Coast Chrysler Jeep Dodge dealer to test drive one that they had advertised.  I spoke with the Sales Manager-Howard.  I explained to him that the price was fair but that I had seen another for approximately $400.00 less.  I told him that if he was willing to match it and address a ""check tire"" light and a grinding sound that I believed to be a suspension issue, then I would buy the car.  Howard explained to me that all their used cars have been inspected and are approved to be sold.  Nonetheless, he agreed to have the car looked at by the local Mazda dealer.  He specifically told me that a Mazda Mechanic would drive the car and make the repairs needed to correct the problem.  The following day I called Howard to confirm that the car had been repaired.  Howard told me that the car was still at the Mazda dealer but that it should be ready by the time I arrived.  Eventually I picked up the car.  About 15 minutes into my drive home the check engine light went on.  I immediately called Howard to inform him about the light (upon getting of the freeway I started to notice the sound in the suspension).  Howard told me that the car had been checked out and driven by the Mazda mechanic and that ""Leonard"" from the Mazda dealer told him that they had rectified the problem.  Howard told me that he would call me later to give me instructions as to what to do to have the problem addressed.  The next day I called Howard at the Mazda dealer following Howard's instructions.  Leonard told me that he was never told to test drive the car.  Furthermore, he told me that he was simply told to reset the computer in the car.  I relayed this information to Howard.  All he could say was that there must have been some sort of miscommunication.  Initially Howard agreed to correct the problems but then told me that he had given me such a great price that he didn't know if they had room to pay for the repairs.  I told Howard that I was willing to have the car inspected by my regular mechanic because I felt his prices would be more reasonable than that of the Mazda dealer.  After talking to his used car Manager Howard agreed.  My Mechanic inspected the car and wrote and estimate of the repairs.  Howard agreed that the repair cost was fair and would get back to me to arrange repairs.  The next day Howard told me they were only obligated to make repairs to the light issue because it was a safety issue.  Repairs to the suspension would be my problem.  I explained to Howard that quite frankly that was mildly interesting to me.  He had told me that the repairs had been done prior to picking up the car; Howard clearly lied.  Howard told me that they were willing to pay $200 to repair the problem with the light or to spend it any way I wished to.  He also gave me the option of returning the car back.  I told him I would call him back the next day with my decision.  The next day I told him I was returning the car.  Howard then told me that was not an option.  I told Howard we would be resolving the cost in court.  Howard told me that they have their attorneys ready for court.  A day or so later Howard called me willing to pay me $600 (total cost was $643.27) for the repairs. I paid for the repairs up front just as they asked me to and faxed them a copy of the bill.  I asked him to call me to confirm that he received the fax.  He did not.  I asked Howard assured me that the check would be sent that same day first class mail.  Thirteen days later and after several calls and voice mails, no check.  I eventually called Orange Coast (accounts payable) to inquire about the check.  They were quick to address my concerns and I informed me that the check had been sent out to my mechanic.  Clearly the miscommunication  and deception from the ""Sales Manager"" need to be addressed.  Howard at Orange Coast Chrysler Jeep Dodge is the epitome of a car salesman.  ",6,15,-1

One quoted me a price more then $2000 higher than the price they listed on their website for that same vehicle.  When I pointed it out they claimed it was an error so I gave them another shot.  When I went back in, however, the vehicle online had been ""sold"" and they claimed there was only vehicle in the entire region that would fit my needs.  5 minutes, a google search, and phone call later I found a similar vehicle (grand cherokee overland, black, 4x4) down the street for $3000 less than this place quoted me.

10288,27-Mar-12,"I purchased a 2011 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon in November of 2011. After two months had passed I still had not recieved registration, tags, or a license plate.  When I called in February to find out what was happening I was told that November was a busy month and not to worry, my license and tags would be coming. When March arrived I called again and  was told to talk to Alicia the DMV girl but every phone call to her resulted in a message on her machine and not one time in a weeks period did I receive a return call. In complete frustration I went to the DMV and was informed that the car was owned by a woman and they would not give me her name. The next day I called to the dealership and  was unable to get David Reed, Alicia or Brian Cole to answer there phones. When I asked to be transferred to the General Manager Pete Shaver the operator patched me in on his cell phone and I told him my worries and that I needed to find out who owned my car, that I had already paid over 35,000 dollars for. When he called me back the following day he said the DMV girl had accidently sent the pink slip to the woman who they had repossesed the car from.  He assured me that going to the DMV in two weeks he would straighten out the problem. After two more weeks I attempted to find out the situation and was told it might be easier for me to just go the DMV myself and take care of it. But then Pete Shaver said if I wanted he would at least get me the license plates. Well now it is March 27 and I finally recieved my pink slip,registration, tags but still no license plate even tho my pink and registration have a plate number on them. When I attempted to contact them again the exact same thing, message machine and no return calls, when I called the Jeep factory complaint line I was told to go to the DMV  myself and report the plates stolen and just get new plates myself, of course at my own cost. The amazing thing is that Jeep themselves don't care and told me there was nothing they could do and they did not want to talk to Orange Coast Jeep about this. I am wondering if there is some sort of legal issues involving this dealership and the rules of business involving the DMV. I am sure this letter will just be removed and discarded, because not one person I have talked to at this dealership or at the Jeep factory has ever wanted to actually do the job they are paid to do. I can promise you I will never buy another Jeep from any dealer, I am 55 years old and have bought many cars, Toyota, Ford, Chevrolet, and others and I have never experienced anything as horrible as the experience at this dealer.

10312,04-Feb-11,"Brought our 2001 Dodge Intrepid here for service several days ago because the check engine light was on.  They found several pressure leaks and repaired same for 1,000.00.  
The day we picked up the car, I got a call from their service manager asking me to return the car because they may have forgotten to check something. So, they let us drive the car away without verifying that it had been completely repaired.  In the meantime, my wife called me to tell me that the car was running very badly now.  We did not have this problem before taking it in for the engine light; the car has always run beautifully.
We left the car all day again.  They called me and told me that they had fixed the problem, apologized profusely, and told me that there would be no charge.  I picked up the car and everything seemed fine.  The next day, the check engine light was back on, and the car stalled in an intersection and kept stalling every time I started it.

10333,30-Dec-10,"I bought my car at this location -- horrible experience -- my recommendation is to never, ever do business with this dealer.  I received the worst service at this company.  This firm refused to secure my car after it flooded and I was waiting for Jeep to determine if they would cover the defect in the windshield that caused 3 inches of rain to puddle in my car. (This event follows several other instances of  of replacing the same parts repeatedly due to other defects -- which were very costly).  I had to demand that the Customer Service Manager secure the car so that no further damage would occur -- and only after I told him his firm would be legally liable did he take action to secure the car from further damage.  When I asked to speak to the General Manager, the Customer Service Manager refused to transfer the call, stating that the GM was was out of town (I had already confirmed that the GM was onsite that day with the front desk staff). 

When I finally spoke with the GM, he was very condescending when I requested answers as to why I had been given poor service and poor treatment -- he stated that the firm had been in business 30 years and I keep coming back so they must be doing something right.  Are you kidding me???!  I'm not here paying for rental cars (repeatedly) and paying for repairs of obvious defects because I want to -- I expected a higher level of customer service since they sold me the car.

10334,16-Sep-10,"Summary: This dealer employs rude, arrogant service managers who blatantly attempt to take advantage of female customers and their perceived naivete.  This is also the most expensive C/D/J dealer I've ever visited, and I've used at least five throughout California.

The first time I visited this dealer, I was shopping for a Jeep.  The saleswoman thought that the best way to sell me on a Jeep was to take me for a test drive and then turn donuts in a local parking lot.  I left, convinced she was insane.  

The second time I visited, several years later, I had had my Jeep towed in because of a dead battery (jumping wouldn't start it).  The dealer sold me a battery for close to $300.  I had no choice but to purchase, as my truck wouldn't start.  The whole time, the service manager was conversing with his cronies and barely looking at me as he shoved paperwork at me to sign.  I was asking questions about my car's behavior and getting vague, ""you're a woman and wouldn't understand"" answers.  

The third time and fourth times I visited (failed LED lamp and transmission flush), the quoted prices were OBSCENELY high compared to either Pep Boys or other dealers.  I also got the same jerk as my service manager.  Although I no longer live in LA, tomorrow I'm driving 50 miles back to Buerge Jeep who will do the transmission flush for $100 less than Orange Coast. Unbelievable and unfortunate that Orange County lacks a respectable or even remotely competitive C/D/J dealer (Tuttle Click isn't any better).",6,15,-1

I reiterated that I was interested in the red vehicle specified in my online inquiry and asked Adam to send me the exact out the door price, as I intended to purchase the vehicle using cash.

Shortly after driving the vehicle, I was told that my vehicle is more expensive than what I’d been quoted, and that the quote I was given was for a grey vehicle. I had fallen victim to a bait-and-switch and ended up driving over three hours for no reason.

I would also like to add that I have never purchased a vehicle at this low of a price point. I’ve negotiated deals with BMW, Porsche, Lamborghini, Rolls Royce and have never been treated this way. I don’t have much experience working with the lower end dealers and find it disgusting that they treat their customers the way I have been treated.

10350,20-Nov-19,"When coming to a deal on the price for a vehicle I was going to lease from this dealership, one of the things that was instrumental in my agreeing to the price they quoted me, was that i was told the vehicle and the lease terms would qualify me to be able to claim the CA Clean Vehicle Rebate (CVRP).

However after they had told me multiple times during the negotiations, including answering affirmatively when i directly asked them before signing, I found out later that in fact the lease did not qualify. 

Attempting to contact the dealership about this resulted in long strings of being ignored, given a run around, and  being told they would get back to us soon then they never did, over and over. 

At this point they have not in any way attempted to reconcile after their sales team lied to us. If they would at least work with us to reconcile the situation I would assume it was a misunderstanding and be glad to work with them.

- brand new Jeep Compass was not ready when we had agreed I would be there, despite me sending all of my insurance, driver's license info, credit card number, and copy of a $13,909 cashier's check two days ahead of time
- when I arrived I was told I had the wrong day, despite showing emails and text message correspondence that had confirmed December 26 at 10 am
- when my father inquired about the delay (because I needed a ride there), he was told, ""if she doesn't like waiting, she can just leave""
- when I was signing paperwork, the DMV document noted a ""lienholder"" as Chrysler Financing, when I was paying cash for the vehicle. When I pointed this out to Willie Pettaway, he said it was okay to sign it. I crossed it out and initialed the lienholder and he said he needed to redo the entire form because it was a legally binding document."" So it was okay for me to sign an inaccurate legally binding document that claimed Chrysler Financing was the lienholder but not okay for me to cross that out (because it was wrong) and initial it...??????
- purchased a brand new vehicle and it was not clean, and they only gave me a half tank of gasoline (see photos of 63 miles on a new car and only 1/8 of a tank left on Yelp site)
- sent me a text message with a link to the video to explain my new purchase - the link didn't work; emailed three more times and got no response - it finally took another general manager to intervene (see pictures added on Yelp site)
- one of the ""general managers,"" Bob Mann, called me personally and said that, based on what I reported to him, he was going to fire his finance guy for incompetence, then called back to tell me I'd be getting an email apology (that never happened)
- I emailed Scott DePeralta three times to ask for the regional manager and his/her contact info - he never responded
- at one point, Scott emailed me and said I could just bring the car back, but the sad thing was that I couldn't because I had already used a $500 rebate that could not be transferred to another dealership
- I finally found a regional manager named Piyom Ghavimi who said he would assist - forwarded all emails to him and never heard back

I called Browning Grimmett the day before I planned to come in to see a used Hyundai Accent and we agreed upon a 1pm appointment. He asked me to call him again once I was on my way, which I did. Only then did he mention that the dealership would be closing early that day. He told me it was closing at 3pm, when I arrived I discovered it was actually closing at 2pm. After an hour drive, he was completely unprepared to show the vehicle I indicated. In fact I had to remind him which car it was. It was in their sister dealership in Morgan Hill. After wasting 45 minutes to go retrieve the vehicle, we got through paperwork only to be told that we would need to come back the following day to finish financing. Though upset that at this, we agreed, and he said he would meet with us at 11:30am the next day. When we arrived at the agreed upon time, Browning was nowhere to be found. Only after waiting for 15 minutes did we discover he had not come in at all. Tony Truong abruptly came up to me, asking for my insurance documents without any greeting, and did not introduce himself to me until prompted by the fact I was clearly confused. I was then called ""distraught"" when I expressed my uneasiness at not being informed of what was happening. At this point a gentleman who did not give me his name began to intervene. He told me he didn't know what I wanted him to do. I asked if there was any price negotiation that could happen because of how much we had been inconvenienced and said that it does not instill a lot of confidence in me to make such a big purchase when I am being told so many different things. I was responded to in a very defensive, blame shifting manner, trying to make it seem as if it was my fault communication had not been clear. I was told if I did not have confidence in their dealership I shouldn't buy the car. And I didn't. I found the entire experience slimy and disrespectful. I was fully prepared to give this dealership my money, but was literally talked out of buying from them, by their own team. It was clear that because I was trying to buy an economy car that they wouldn't turn a profit on I was not a valuable person in their eyes. ",6,15,-1

We went down in person and they were very rude and said they would help us if we were going to buy out the lease or buy or lease another vehicle, but if not we needed to go to another dealership to turn it in. Finally talked to the general manager and made an appointment to drop it off, but when we came in we waited over an hour for them to tell us that they couldn’t do it today and that we would have to come back tomorrow.

The day we were told it would be ready WE had to call to find out when we could pick it up and they told us the part was on back order and it would be a few more days. Once again, after a few more days WE called to check the status and were told it was going to be even longer. Finally after TWO weeks and little communication on their end we picked up the vehicle. My husbands truck is an essential part of his business so we had to spend money out of pocket to rent another vehicle while they held his hostage and he even had to postpone a very important business trip because of it. After being a really pissed off about the whole situation I thought to myself ""Well they will surely make up for this with at least a small gesture (like a complimentary oil change)"". Not the case what-so-ever. They even had my husband pre-pay for his next oil change. Might I add my husband is the easiest going guy around.

10756,30-Aug-15,"My experience with this dealership is that it is non-responsive and their rating is untrustworthy. After the purchase of Jeep Cherokee Limited last weekend I received the Thank You email from the GM of this dealership. The email states ""You may be receiving a questionnaire from Jeep soon. If you cannot give us a completely satisfied rating for any reason, please call me so we can better serve you as our valued customer"". I responded to the GM’s email and tried directly contacting him to discuss issues and to offer suggestions, instead he directed the sales person to contact me though I wanted to talk to the GM per his email. I find it absurd that despite the GM’s original email he was not accessible and he did not even respond to my several email requests which shows his lack of commitment. Apparently he might come up with the excuse that he had no time and was too busy.

Both the Sales person and Finance Manager were courteous. But I observed during the purchase that the sales person pleads to the customers to give the dealer 10 out of 10 rating when the survey is received so that the he and others can receive bonus. This practice appears to be unethical leading to misleading rating for this dealership. I believe the rating should be transparent without any influence. Apparently his focus was to get him bonus from my purchase that also seems evident from his text message.

I went to the dealer after the Sales person sent me an email with out-the-door price for the Cherokee Limited that I wanted, but during the paperwork in his office for the same SUV he said that I will have to pay $1000 more if I refinance with 0% which shocked me because he did not state so in his email and my preference was to get this refinance but I could not. Also, during the price agreement paperwork with the Sales person in his office he did not go over the option of the cooling-off period which I find misleading. Also he provided illusive response when I asked him why I can’t get the other vehicle from the front lot that was the same make/model with the same year, features and the sticker price.",6,15,-1

It saves everyone time and saliva from speaking and negotiating so much.  They won't deal with you via email because of ""high demands"".  More very old sales car tactics to bring you in.  Lets go back to that, high demands.  In this pandemic where many dealers are closed, lots are overfilled with unsold merchandise, and cars still on cargo ships where they are not unloaded because there's no room on any lots.  Sure looks like there is more inventory than demand.

Then they do the most irresponsible thing and maintain their old car sales tactics by bringing you in when we're in a pandemic and are in a shelter in place.  That is irresponsible on their behalf and comes to show they are more interested in profits than people's health.  I will not bring my wife and I to simply negotiate and possibly get sick.  We can do negotiations via email or telephone, then when we come to a price we both agree to, then we can come in and sign papers with minimal exposure.  Even my last two car purchases way before the pandemic allowed this (Lexus and Tesla).

I would avoid this dealer and if this is tactic is across the board, go to a different manufacturer that actually cares about people and willing to adapt and negotiate online or over the phone.

I hate to do this, but they (HB Chrysler Dodge Jeep RAM) got me. If it sounds too good to be true, with this dealership it probably is... I thought I wasn't getting scammed, but they just waited a week to start twisting everything around. 

First, was the chip in the windshield that they told me would get taken care of and replaced.  A month later, it still hasnt been taken care of.
Then I was given a copy of a clean Carfax, but I got home that night and noticed a basketball size dent in my bumper. I did not hit anything, and after telling the dealer about it, they reviewed their security footage and I was told they are ""not required to disclose damages unless they are a safety concern."" And that's not all...

A few weeks later, I was called back in for a better deal with a better bank and I need to come in to sign the papers or I'd lose my loan. I thought my current loan was decent, but better? Ok, I didn't think I was lied to yet, of course I'll come sign for a better deal. I get into financing and this time it's a paper contract (the first time it was all electronic and I was given a USB with all the files.) The finance manager has every paper stacked on top of one another covering the tops of the pages and only exposing the signature lines because ""the documents are all the same as before, only the finance company changed and we got you a better APR and monthly payment."" 

My original contract: 17.63% APR $368 monthly
My ""better deal"" contract: 22.89% APR $428.67 monthly

I purchased the truck for $11,500 and brought enough to pay off the truck that day. The finance manager told me if I want to build my credit get financing and just put money down. So I put $6,000 down in cash and was led to believe (all the way through driving off the lot) my financing was only for $5,500 +tax and license.  
 
I bought my first new truck from this place 20 years ago and I remember how comfortable and confident I was with all the decisions being made. It was the best vehicle purchase I ever made. When I went back to buy another truck last month, they gave me that feeling all over again. However, Huntington Beach Chrysler Dodge Jeep RAM aka Surf City Auto is not a dealership to be trusted.

I was greeted by Victor, he was friendly and knowledgeable. I told him what I wanted, what I was spending and he found a truck better and still in my price range. Then I met Johnny and he was very straightforward, a ""no BS"" type of guy. There were no up sales, no ""bait and hook"", just a straight forward professionally ran business.

I told him i don’t want any miscommunication or surprises if I’m going to travel all the way up there. But if the price is true, I’m ready to buy it. 

I told him I had financing through my bank already pre-approved. He said yes, that’s the guaranteed price. He acknowledged I have my own financing. 

I show up. He tries to make me sign a credit report per homeland security for OFAC. If you are not financing through the dealership, YOU DO NOT HAVE TO DO THIS. It’s a scam well documented amongst crediting agencies and websites like Edmunds.

He brings his manager over, they say it’s cool you don’t need to to do it. He makes some side comment about if my credit is low and if I’m worried. No, Bryan, I’m not worried, you simply don’t have authorization to check my credit.

He then tries to sell me on this $3900 buy up package with paint protection and security. He tells me it’s already on the vehicle so that’s all he can do. 

Aka, we’re not gonna sell you what we advertised.

TLDR: prices are NOT as advertised. They will lie to your face about checking your credit.
And they will not honor their low prices. Scammers. Waste of time.",6,15,-1

10886,02-Dec-19,"This dealer is a fraud, they want to charge you almost $4000 for stuff that is 'already installed'  and then another charge for extended warranty when you tell them you don't want it they say its mandatory because its already installed. It's like they don't want to sell you the car if you don't get their extras.  Then they want to offer you a fraction of what your trade in is worth.  I got my car appraised at CarMax before I came here they offered $15k this place offered $11k.  

The night before I called in spoke to Mufasa he saide to go in at tomorrow when they opened at 11AM. That he would guarantee the car at the same price. When I got there at 11AM the place had already been open for an hour and someone else had already purchased the car I wanted.

This was THE worst experience I HAVE EVER had with a Dealership.  Prices are discounted but they force you to purchase a protection package that includes panel identification that was mandated back in 1984 by NHTSA (all vehicles sold in the States must have Vins or identifying marks on all panels to deter theift).  What ever the price of the vevicle is they will add $3999.18 to it.  Even if ther vehicle is not on the lot.  They will try to get you to finance through their bank at 7.4% APR, they will tell you that's the  going rate on vehicle loans.

They sold me a brand new Wrangler that had the auto/start stop warning light on. I asked them to fix it before leaving with the vehicle, but I was told ""it goes away after driving a bit"". 250 miles and 5 days later, my Jeep has now had to be towed TWICE to a dealership near me because the secondary battery, the one responsible for the auto start/stop, is faulty and keeps dying - so the car won't start. I live in an area where personal vehicles are required and they knew this, yet have shown 0 empathy or even a molecule of concern. 

Their response? ""Call roadside assistance"". On a 5 day old vehicle?? This is normal?? They have done NOTHING to remedy the situation except have the salesperson send me a half-a$$ed apology email.

Steer clear! These guys are con artists. I have purchased many cars over the years. I called ahead of time about a specific car asked them for their bottom line OTD price, told them exactly when we'd be there, yet the car had to be chased down for 30 minutes. Test drive finished, we were ready to buy the car at the already agreed upon OTD price. xxxxxxx finance guy comes in and suddenly the price is up by over $4000, I told them, as I said before, we weren't interested in financing and wanted to get the paperwork signed for the previously agreed upon price. Finance guy says they can't do that, so we walk. Get a call a few minutes later, again promised if we come back we could have the car for the mutually agreed price. Now a new guy enters the picture and tells me he can sell it for the price listed on the internet, which is about $350 more than the agreed price even before they add all of the additional thousands of dollars of junk they try to force on you. we walked again, right into a reputable sellers store, and bought a the same exact car for less in a nicer color, including the extended warranty. We wasted way too much time at Huntington, getting passed on to several different ""managers"", I think three in all, not including the finance bloodsucker.

I told him if he can put it in writing that he can give me the advertised price on their website plus tax and license I would do the 2 hour drive from northern los angeles to Huntington beach. He keeps telling me I have to come down. I was not going to waste 2 hours of my life driving just to get there for them to bait and switch me.

10893,10-Sep-19,"Too bad I had not read the reviews on this dealership well before wasting my time, gas & effort. Just reading the past 30 days of 1 star negative reviews sum up allot of how this illegitimate place works. Nothing but lies after lies well before you get into this dealership and then they continue when you arrive with the “Bait & Switch” tactics along with more lies. My opinion is that they need to be investigated & shut down for good.

I initially made contact with supposed salesman Androw Mansour on a RAM truck & was told the truck was available. I informed Androw that I lived in Hawaii & that I would be paying cash. He told me that they do not take cash or deposits on vehicles. He also said he worked in finance. I had been conversing with Androw for four days ensuring the truck was available & he confirmed it was. I called Androw on a Sunday & I asked him to please text me by the end of Monday night on the availability of the vehicle. I indicated to him that I would be flying all day & arriving late Monday night & would not be able to receive messages during my flight. I also made sure that he understood that I was driving to the dealership early Tuesday morning from San Diego to Huntington Beach.
   
Androw never contacted me on status and availability on Monday night as he said he would so I called him early morning Tuesday & he enthusiastically said “yes, the truck was still there”. So we started our 77 mile trip all the way to Huntington Beach. We were about 12 miles from the dealership when Androw called & said you’re not going to believe this and that the truck was just sold 10 minutes ago. He said however that there were 2 other trucks available, a Black & White one with the exact same features.

Not believing Androw, when I arrived at the dealership I immediately asked for the desk manager whose name is Jock. I inquired about the vehicle status that I came out to see & was told that it had been actually sold the day before. One of the other sales man Andy did a tracker on the truck and located it in Los Angeles. So I told Jock the desk manager that I had driven all the way from San Diego for this truck. Jock replied that they are the #1 sales dealership in the country & vehicles are continuously being sold. So I told him that this is what every dealership says which is a bunch of B.S. I also told him what he didn’t know and that was if the truck indeed had been sold the day before then why would your salesman Androw lie to me just over an hour ago & tell me that the truck was there. Jock’s reply was that he was going to have a talk with Androw.
 
When I asked Jock about the supposed Black & White trucks that Androw said were available, he then directed salesman Andy to look them up. Sure enough there were no trucks that Androw could produce however there were trucks at a higher price. So I asked Andy to get a hold of Androw & ask him where are these supposed trucks that he indicated on the phone that were available. Andy left & later came back & said he cannot find Androw. So I said to call him on his mobile & he said he didn’t have his number. I asked why is it that I have his number & the dealership doesn’t. He couldn’t provide me with an answer only to say that there are no trucks as Androw described however he again had higher priced trucks. I believe the kicker to this whole scheme is that Androw & Andy are one in the same person who is trying to cover up his own lies & mistakes.

So now it seems obvious that I too are another victim of being lured into this dealership by their false advertised pricing, con artist lies and illicit salesmen tactics all while at my own expense.
 
The good news however is that I did purchase a truck at Dave Smith Motors in Idaho. They literally are one of the highest volume dealerships in the nation with thousands of vehicles and availability to choose from. They don’t lie, are honest and pricing is unbeatable.

If there was an option for negative stars i'd put -5 and beyond. This dealership is filled with a bunch of classless employees starting with the person who answers phone calls to the sales reps and even more so, management! For 2 days i was trying to purchase a vehicle without even haggling the price of the vehicle. They would not send me a written quote, they insisted i come in. Once they found out i was going to purchase cash nobody wanted to talk to me i called every hour to try to talk to management, they were always ""busy"" and for 2 days i never received a call. I was told they do not take personal checks or cashiers checks by a sale rep and that i would have to finance through their bank and payoff loan after first month! I finally got through to another sales rep that said to just come down and within an hour and a half i was there. I walked in and they were slow i mean nobody there and it literally took 5 mins for someone to ask me if I've been helped! So much for the ""busy managers"" that couldn't return  my phone call! Anyhow, i told them the car i wanted to see and they said ""they sold it 40 minutes ago to a sister dealership""! Then i asked what dealership and that i'll go there to buy it. They replied ""they sold it to some family"". This place is a joke! If you have any experience buying cars and they cant sway you, you will be ignored and god forbid you want to buy cash and move a car that has been sitting on their lot for 100 days!

10898,03-Jul-19,"So this is for their Jeep dealership unit ( I have read about the other brand teams- Dodge, Ram- being equally notorious!!), - They had been advertising super low prices on their Jeep Wrangler models and refusing to engage much over the phone- They wanted us to be at the dealership to talk further!

Even though we knew exactly which vehicle on their lot we wanted, they made us sit there for 6 hours!!- going back n forth on prices they had already advertised! Adding some weird unadvertised packages which made no sense at all to their final pricing! When we almost were ready to walk out, they called us back and removed that package amounting to almost 4000$. They sold off the vehicle which we test drove and agreed to purchase right under our nose to another customer!! How could you be so unprofessional in your dealings?
Finally- when the financing phase came, they didnt' realize that we had pre-approved ourselves on Chrysler financing and said that we will have to pay some high interest rate at something greater than 7% even though our credit scores were Tier A. When we brought it to their attention, they realized they couldn't swindle us on that front - so went ahead with the financing aspect. When they realizing we were not going to buy any additional extended care or maintenance packages from them, they got upset and started behaving rudely with my wife.- telling her that they know we are there because of the low prices they have advertised- Ofcourse that's why we were there- I mean isn't that the point of getting customers to your dealership! they were not favoring us in anyway!
 The only reason we purchased the vehicle from them was because, we didn't have time to shop around at other dealers and go thru the process all over again!- But if there was a police complaint i could make for false advertisements and unprofessional attitude,, I would do it right away!.

10908,24-Jan-19,"When you go to a dealership and buy a car new from the lot, you're not just buying a car but you're buying a piece of mine that anything that breaks on it is covered for the next 36,000 miles. You're not expecting them to all of a sudden after a year-and-a-half turn on you and try to rip you off looking for any reason they can. My radio broke a year ago and I took it out oh, this does not void the warranty, even though he's trying to convince me it does and trying to convince me that my air conditioner knob won't turn because I took my radio out of year ago. Not only that, I've been bringing my vehicle to this place for the past year since I got it and the last two times I brought it it didn't have the radio in it and because I didn't get this bearded self proclaimed mechanic as a service provider... it was never a problem and all the issues that were covered under warranty we're fixed. I wasn't asking for the radio to be fixed. This time it was my door latches and my air conditioner knob would not physically turn and he's going to try to tell me that that's because I took my radio out a year ago and it's so ridiculously underhanded and is blatantly transparent they are not out for customer service or do you good because you bought a vehicle from them...they are out to suck as much money out from you as they possibly can even as a loyal customer. I don't understand it because these guys, at the front desk, if they're not getting the money you've figured they would understand and it would try that help you get your car fixed...not try to say $150 to bring it in when it's under warranty. Yes you heard me $150 to bring it in and it still under warranty it's only a year-and-a-half old. I did not install any more systems I did not alter anything electrical inside I simply took the radio out of the dash. They wouldn't even compromised to fix my back door latches on my patch on the back because you know that's directly related to the radio(sarcastic) and makes a whole bunch of sense there. I really wish he wouldn't have been so stubborn with this, it's just not right, taking the radio off does not effect the door latches nor the A/C components and DOES NOT void your warranty... and he kept thinking if he explained it enough  to me that I was going to believe what he said. So basically they are trying to rip me off and weasel their way out of a signed contract warranty...when there's been multiple repairs on this thing...in the same condition as it's in now...so there's nothing really more I can say to get the point across. The Dodge I had bought had broken multiple times within the first year and they had it for upwards of two weeks at a time, 2 weeks and I didn't say nothing I didn't complain at all because they had me covered and they fixed everything that was wrong with it... everything that was DESERVED to be fixed. Now for a couple little things it would have taken maybe an hour and a half to do all of them, they're going to cause me and themselves this much trouble trying to squeeze a hundred something bucks out of me which...I got...but it's not the point. The fact that they serviced before in the same condition and now they're not lets you know that the inconsistency automatically leads to the conclusion that they're ripping us off every chance they can get...any time they can think of. I know this is common knowledge, that dealers rip you off....but I'm not having it this time....you should have just fixed my doors and A/C....I talked to my lawyer friend...my warranty is still valid....stop jerking people around. I'm about too move forward with being a real pain in the xxx for you HB dodge...you maybe enough of of people in HB...stop greed before I start a campaign. ;)",6,15,10
10909,05-Jan-19,"Went to the dealer after they would not negotiate an out the door price over the internet or phone.  Turns out the Ram truck that was advertised was just a ploy to get customers into their door.  The truck is a Ram 2019 Longhorn with a stock number 50505 was advertised as an MSRP of 58K when the actual vehicle was 62K, they then proceeded to tell me that I had to buy 4500 dollars in additional dealer services to get the vehicle at the advertised price.  Makes sense since the garbage they sell as ""extra coverage"" is 100% pure profit and the sale of the truck is a just s small fraction into their pocket. 

The sad part of this story is my wife is 8 months pregnant and we spent 4 hours there just to be taken advantage of.  I even bought a vehicle here in 2014 and got the vehicle and at the advertised price.  Not sure if what they are doing is legal but its sad to see places like this are still in business.  Even contacted Ram which didn't have much to say.  

Really love the looks of these new trucks but I cant see a reason why I would want to give my business to people like this.  Would rather pay more for something less to an honest dealership that cares about customer service.

Then they completely ignored me when I told them I wanted to custom order it because I wanted features the ones they had in inventory did not have. A couple of months later, I was told I needed to talk to the Fleet Sales Department. I ended up contacting them and shared with Hank Comnos the details of the order. It has been 2 weeks now and no answer. Every time I talk to him he tells me he is too busy and has 400 emails he needs to respond to. They make it look like they are doing you a favor by selling you a truck which they can seem to be able to do. I felt like being in a third world country.

Bottom line don't waste your time here if you need to special order a car because either the cars cannot be ordered or these guys are too incompetent to sell cars.

The truck is great but with these idiots, I'd rather go to Ford which seems to know how to sell trucks and treat a customer.",6,15,168

Crap...( whatever else is in their name), you wont have to worry about encountering that at HB Jeep. If your intimidation stems from the thought of a savvy used car salesman and feeling dumb for not knowing basic information about how the whole car buying or financing process works dont worry none of these sales rep do either. Their salesman have absolutely zero and i mean zero knowledge about what it is that their doing there. Literally hire guys with zero experience, and does it show. Simplest questions such as ""What kind of insurance must i have to drive off the lot?"" is met with a face of confusion and followed with ""ummm... Im not.... let me find that out for you"". By the way that is how most inquiries are responded to. its either that or ""we'll go over that once we process it and find out ummmm.... im not quite sure"". Every question is answered though. ""Do you need proof of address?"" ...umm..im not quite sure.... let me find out.  ""Does the cosigner need to be here for me to apply?"".....we'll go over that once we process it and find out..... ""what are the terms of the financing company. what requirements must be met?""...... ummmmm.. I.... let me find out for you.. ""Do you have a bathroom?.... we'll go over that once we process it and find out. ""do you have a brain?"" im not quite..... let me find out for you...
Seriously save yourself the time the headache, the display of disrespectful grown men talking and acting like a bunch of school boys. Cussing in front of you and figuring out how insurance for a vehicle works.
I would be a bit more understanding about the sales rep they hire there but they are just as much at fault as HB Jeep is. I would not go apply in a field that i know absolutely nothing about. Nor would i hire someone who knows nothing about the product im selling. You dont see landscapers applying to be brain surgeons.  And the people they hire there to sell us cars are just that know-nothing guys. But I guess that is how much respect HB Jeep has for its consumers. I really wish these guys got more training other than how to log into their dealer website and more Customer Service training but from what i saw the lady conducting part of the training was more concerned with letting the new herd of dumb flesh know how much more dedicated she is to the company than anything else. Maybe instead of continuing to hire herd after herd they should spend the money and commission theyre giving to these guy on some real training for how to treat a customer and most of all on a legal team or someone with some understanding of how advertising works. I guess nobody really cares of or has heard that false advertising is a crime. And maybe theyre just that disconnected and dont think that a knowledgeable and apologetic rep would mean the difference between a frustrated understanding customer and a pissed off misled consumer filing a claim for false advertising. Get your xxxx together HB Jeep. You wont be in business much longer if your lawyers are as good as your sales rep ",6,15,-1

However, I soon find out that the old body shop manager I had been in Correspondence with left the company. So I assume the new body shop manager will probably come and talk to me instead. Nope, my new guy they had hired Steve, just blows me off when I try to introduce myself and shake his hand. Yet, the guy is too busy to even acknowledge my existence.  Then I look at my car and one side is darker in color than the other. They suggest to just ""buff it out"" and once it's in the sun the new paint will fade down to the old. So they're asking me to buff out the paint job they just did? I'm wondering why they're asking me to do their job after $8000 in repairs. In addition, I get in my car and drive home with a better indignation only to find out that my pants are soaked in oil from the seat. Apparently one of the mechanics leaked oil in my front driver seat, resulting in a new pair of pants ruined.

10919,03-Jan-18,"First of all I had a bad experience with this dealership!! When I purchased my vehicle back in May 26,2017 I told them that the car didn't have gas and that they needed to put gas in it. When I told them too they said that they didn't do that there. I was furious because I drove all the way from Riverside to Huntington to get a Jeep. Therefore I had to put my own gas. My first purchased vehicle at a different dealership made sure to put a full tank. Even at the dealership where my boyfriend bought his RAM truck at BMW of Murrieta put a full tank of gas and it was a used vehicle too. I was so disappointed after that. Back in November 2017 when I had my first car service I went in for a regular oil change and maintenance check. When I get there to check in the representative tells me that my car had a recall and I'm thinking like 'DID THEY SELL ME A CAR THAT HAS A RECALL AND THEY ALREADY KNEW ABOUT IT!?' I kept asking the representative what kind of recall and he said it was a sticker from the VIN number that I was going to receive a letter in the mail. Till this day I have not received any letter! The recall is supposedly called a T12? I tried using google to see what a T12 recall meant and nothing came up. I even went on the website where you search up vehicles with recalls and my car did not show up at all. I was so confused at that point. I don't know what kind of dealership this is and what kind of service they hold but my car service was not completed. All the checkups that they supposedly did they obviously did not complete the job. I got a description of all the services they made and they checked off that they checked all the fluids in the vehicle. Lies! I dropped off the car with low washer fluid and I never refilled it because I knew I was getting the service and they were going to refill it. I get the car back and it still had low washer fluid. I know what to expect when it comes down to car services because Valvoline would walk me through it, even Valvoline has better service then this dealer! I tried to complain about it and they said that they forgot to reset it. I had my boyfriend check and they didn't refill anything! I contacted the dealership and gave them a review on their website but they obviously did not care to reach out. I am an unhappy customer. And I don't recommend anyone purchasing from this dealership!",6,15,255

I implore you to check out responses by other dealers.  Most don't use profanity, inflated egos and turn the blame on his disgruntled customers.  Again, I stand by my comment, that if I  can warn even 1 potential customer, it is worth the effort.  I believe customer service is extremely important.  This guy can't help but throw a tantrum every time someone complains.  Buyer beware and best of luck if you choose to go forward with a sale here.

I am just trying to understand any fees that i will be charged, which is a simple request.  The dealership states I need to physically visit the dealership.The only conclusion i can make is they want to charge extra dealer fees and the dealership does not want to expose any information that would risk killing the deal. They want me to come into dealership hoping you will just agree to the fees and buy the vehicle.  I am located 2+ hours from the dealership, so driving 2 hours to receive an OTD number is not a reasonable request. In buying 10+ cars over the last 20 years i have never dealt with such an unprofessional sales team. Why would you not provide a simple OTD itemized quote.

I brought my vehicle into HB for Transmission service 5 days ago . 
the day after the service I noticed my vehicle was leaking fluid. (it has never leaked before) 
I called made and appointment with derrick yesterday . today he acted like I never called or spoke with him . 
  Derrick diagnosed my leak  as "" the gasket around the oil pan is leaking."" he said there was dirt caked around the oil pan on the edges holding in the oil . some of the dirt shook loose and now its leaking . he quoted me $ 800 . I told him that diagnosis does not sound accurate. I drive on the freeway . I don't drive through dirt for it to get caked up . I took my keys and went inside to talk to the General manager.   I waited for 10 minutes. Derrick came to me and said he wanted to put my car in the air and show me the dirt .. I said ok .. he took my car back and I am waiting for 20 minutes while its in the air.. finally I go back to see what is going on .. I then see derrick and the mechanic looking all under my car with flashlights and talking about where the leak could be coming from.. 

derrick comes back to me and says. 
"" well maybe the leak is coming from the top"" let me lower it and look. they lower it and look. 

then derrick says well maybe the leak is this.... we need to take some stuff apart to find out what is going on .. 

then derrick has the nerve to say I am looking at him like he does not know what he is talking about  . and he has been in the business 25 years and this is what he needs to do to diagnose my vehicle. 

I told him he is right I am looking at him like he does not know what he is talking about 

45 minutes ago he diagnosed my vehicle and quoted me 800 for repairs.. 

when I wanted to talk to management HE came back to ME and said he would SHOW ME the dirt caked up ect.... but once the car was in the air . he COULD NOT SHOW ME THE AFFORE MENTIONED DIRT WHICH HAD CAKED UP AND WHICH WOULD COST 800$ TO REPAIR . HE needed to look into it further when im under the car saying WHERE IS THE DIRT ?? 


this man Derrick totally tried to scam me.. I was at the dealership for 3 hours and I still do not know what or why my car is leaking . I purchased a jeep Laredo and a jeep patriot fromt his dealership and they  tried to scam me.

I called yesterday, 10/23, and made a 7:00 appt. for today 10/24. When I spoke to Henry Jimenez (service advisor) we discussed (and confirmed) fixing 4 issues; replace 2 front tires, fix the recall, door paneling falling off, and I needed a new key fob. Henry then told me that they would only need my car for a day because these were all very ""simple"". 
    My car was dropped off at the dealership at 7:05 am. Henry called me at 3:00pm (8 hours later) with a nasty attitude, and said ""I don't know why you had your car towed up here, we started it just fine"". I then reiterated the issues that needed fixing, and Henry said ""oh yeah"", and hung up. I then called back at 5:49 and asked Henry when my car would be ready, and he said I couldn't pick it up until tomorrow. I told him that it was crucial I get my car back, because I was taking my godmother to chemo in the morning & I had school. Henry very nastily replied ""yeah, well"". Then Henry lied and said ""We didn't have the tires in stock"". When I told him that wasn't true because I confirmed that there were 5 tires in stock before I made the appt. he again nastily replied ""yeah, well"". I then said ""If you had any issues you should have just called me"". Henry again ""yeah, well"". I asked him why he didn't call me; he gave no response. I then said ""New tires are simple and quick, you still have time to do it today."" Again Henry nastily replied, ""yeah, well - no I don't"". He then text messaged me at 6:02, and said I could get my car (with no new tires of course) which was the sole reason for dropping it off. Obviously I can't drive with no tread (that's why the car was towed).",6,16,0

Took back and the GM said give her what ever she wants in a life be up in the back and only pay $100 more a month. I had just filed BK so I felt lucky to be getting a new car instead of a used one. 5 year loan was supposed to be the deal with a 9% interest rate. To good to be true? Yes!!! They said I had to come back and sign new papers, they couldn’t get the interest rate promised (after realizing it was 11%), but they had gotten down to 9%. They neglected to tell me they “added “ an extra year on my loan and I did not pay attention to that since they said nothing had changed but the rate. Also I had so many inquiries on my credit report. Also the “finance charge that they supposedly were charging cause they were financing the loan was still added into the loan along and they sold my loan to capital one with the interest rate a month after buying the car. So I ended up paying $23,000 for a $14,000 car with no bells or whistles and no power locks or windows, I did notice until last year why my loan was paid off that they had changed my loan terms, so when I signed with new interest rate Also I’m paying interest for my loan with capital one. I thought I was so lucky and referred two people here. I hope that they go out of business just like mortgages people for lying and cheating to their customers.

After I went home, I read the contract and the Purchase price was 34,000$, not 24K.

They said that If I am not going to pay, I have to come over to the dealership to talk. Today, I drove 2 hours to get to the dealership, spent 4 hours there and drove another 3 hours back due to traffic. And the problem was not resolved. They had me drive all the way to give them a couple of papers where I could have just emailed them back.

I had such high hopes for this dealership. Nice website, responded to my e-mail inquiry, etc, etc.  Not so!

Came on the lot with a 2002 Range Rover ready to trade.  My buddy and I got onto the lot where two saleman actually saw us and turned the other way.  We were to meet a salesman who does their internet sales who I can only describe as a scrawney pale Martin Short look-a-like with too much mouse in his hair making him look like ""The Heat Miser"" from that old Christmas show.  But I digress.

We came in our casual t-shirt and jeans and they treated us like dirt which is funny because we both work in the film industry (Director and Photographer respectively) and I plan on telling everyone I know to stay away from this dealership.  Simply rude and they assumed we were dumb enough to fall for their ""very slick"" sales techniques.  

Tried to sell us a car with a damaged front and rear and all they said was ""so do you want to buy it?""  Yeah buddy, I want to by your damaged goods and pay WAY over Blue Book.  They forget they're selling a Jeep, not a Lexus.

The Internet sales guy didn't even take the time to show us the car.  He pawned us off to what I can only describe as ""Cousin It's"" moronic brother who kept calling us ""bro' and drilled me with so many questions that I finally had to tell him to be quiet so I could listen to the ""clicking sound"" the car made as I drove it.

When i wanted to see any other inventory, they took us ""out back"" and showed us a Grand Cherokee that was not only filthy but looked like it had been caught in a flood.  I laughed until my buddy pointed to the License Plate on the car and it was from ""Louisiana"".  Katrina Salvage anyone?

I have to say, once we were going to walk off the lot, the ""original"" sales guy ran out and tried to wheel and deal, but by then I was so disgusted we politely excused ourselves and left.  Later we looked at each other and thought, here was a great example of why car dealers get such a bad rap.  The type of place that makes you want to take a shower afterwards.

I understand people have to make a living and people need to sell, but you don't have to be a jerk about it.  There are too many other dealerships that you don't have to subject yourself to the indignity of one like Huntington Beach Jeep.  Yeah guys, your ""Monkey in the Trunk"" logo fits you perfectly!

I would have left if I had the option.
Basically they have this great text option that Henry would keep me updated on my car and respond quickly to my inquiries. It is great when they use it.
This experience had absolutely NO responses to my text messages. Attempts to call all went unanswered once transferred to my service tech. Messages both with operator and voicemail went unreturned. I did have a loaner (since it was believed to be a covered issue) so I wasn't too worried about when I got it back but I just wanted to know the status.
After 8 days of trying, I basically BEG to speak to ANYONE about the status of my car and magically my tech picks up in 2 rings.
I am then told I need two things done which will cost almost $800. (Almost $500 for new spark plugs alone). I ask if it is driveable and go to pick it up the next day. Total days...10!
After paying $150 for a diagnostic fee.I received it running (the two women I dealt with this time were amazing.) and immediately drove it to the family mechanic who works on the other cars. He is only about a mile away so I pull up and park. When we get to the car to have them bring it in the shop, the battery is COMPLETELY DEAD!

We never once discussed an extended warranty, I never asked for it, and they never disclosed that they were adding it to the total amount financed.

If you absolutely must buy a car from this place, make 100% sure you know what the price of the car is...and what else you're paying for.  If your salesman keeps going to the finance guy and returning with only down payment and monthly payments, talk to the finance guy directly and see what the total amount financed is and an itemized list of things that contribute to that number.

10971,21-Sep-16,"This is regarding my experience with Dodge Huntington Beach... I was sold a certified pre-owned Dodge Challenger RT. The sales process was smooth, I don't really have any complaints about that. However, being a first time buyer, I was unaware that the dealership is required to give you a copy of the supposed 125 point inspection. Within 3 months of purchasing the vehicle, while driving down the freeway with my wife, we heard a loud 'clunk"" sound. That was the left radius arm coming out (think of it as a ball and socket joint) I got the vehicle home and had it towed to the dealership. While at the dealership, the service tech told me they would not likely get to my car that day and offered a loaner car, I accepted his offer. I get a call from the service tech the following day, demanding I return the loaner car. He proceeded to tell me over the phone that the type of damage was not covered and therfore, I was not approved to have it. Then he explained that the radius arm was damaged and/or broken and all 4 tires were bald. Also, there were missing nuts and bolts. I asked what could ha e caused this type of damage? He could not give me a definitive cause, he resorted to mere speculation. That it must be due to negligent driving. I have a 6 year old daughter that wants to go with me everywhere. To the fathers out there, you know what I'm talking about. There is no way in xxxx, that I would risk my daughters life, driving in such a manner. I reviewed the Carfax that was given to me, the previous owner was in a minor accident to the front, no further details. This was not disclosed to me at the time of purchase, which is my fault, I'm told the dealer is not required to reveal that to me. However, for the sales rep. to tell me that is has not been in any accidents, that's a different story. The Carfax report also shows the previous owner had all 4 tires replaced, then oddly enough, he had all 4 replaced only after putting less than 4,000 miles on the new pair. This is a 5 year old car, but it only had 16,xxx miles on it. Why would he replace the tires only after 4,000 miles on the new pair? Why did my tires go bald only after putting 9,000 miles on them before I had it towed to the dealership? I researched it and a suspension issue would cause early wear on the tires. What was affecting the vehicle when the original owner had it,  is clearly affecting my vehicle still. I pointed out all of this to the service tech. I purchased an extended warranty contract from them at the time of purchase. I contacted them, they told me to have the dealership call, to start the process. I asked the service tech to call, I waited 3 days, still nothing from the extended warranty company. I called the service tech to see if he had called. He said he hadn't, cuz he said he knew they wouldn't cover it. Well, I didn't know he had the right to make that decision. He agreed to call but it sounded like it bothered him to do so. They were no help at all. Finally, I get a car from Patrick, the rep. who the extended warranty company sent out. The dealership did not even make me aware that he came out to inspect the vehicle. Patrick told me that they could not cover the repairs due to they don't cover missing parts. He further explained to me, the missing nuts and bolts mentioned earlier, did not appear to be sheared off. Indicating, that someone forgot to put them on or did not put them on correctly. Patrick told me to ask the dealer how did this get missed on the certified pre-owned inspection? I pointed this out to the service tech and to the manager. I did not hear one response from them. While Patrick and I reviewed the Carfax so I could point out the original owner replacing the tires after only putting 4,000 miles on his new pair. His copy of the Carfax did not show this on the history. His copy just showed they were balanced. How does this type of pertinent information, that would be favorable for the dealership be taken out of the Carfax history? Now, the service tech changed it from we don't cover the type of damage, to my vehicle was out of the warranty period. My argument is that the problem existed before the time of purchase. All the things I pointed out clearly show that. The dealership has given me speculation with no definitive cause. They still would not cover the repairs. They still haven't. Mind you, what I mentioned wasn't a fast process. This is about 4 months after I brought in my vehicle. I'm paying for a car, I haven't been able to use. It was only out of the warranty period,  less than a month. You would think they would cover the repairs for a disabled Iraq veteran, after I pointed all of this out. I explained to them that I was a disabled veteran and I deserved better treatment from them, instead of being ignored for months. They didn't acknowledge this at all.",6,16,20

Got call from salesman, he still had tags, still trying to be cheerful went back and grabbed them, asked him about a tank of gas and he said they had to cut back....so it wasn't an oversight, I just spent $60k on a car and they don't even give you a full tank of gas!  I was now in my 7th hour at dealer, figured I should just be happy and get on road...

2 weeks later I notice that HBD still hadn't paid off my bank for trade, even though they had already sold the car.  My wife called to sort out the problem and almost immediately the finance guy started yelling at her...she asks for his supervisor and he wouldn't let her talk either...I get on the phone and he tells me they have 13days by law to mail the check and they mailed a check on the 13th day, I asked why this wasn't brought up in finance and they basically accused me of lying, when I told him we had been assured they process it in'a couple of days'...could hardly get a word in and by now the conversation was becoming more heated...

10976,18-Oct-16,"Huntington Beach Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram -- Deceptive, Dishonorable, Disappointing – DO NOT TRUST THEM! 
Having purchased vehicles from HB Jeep before, and having recommended them to many of my 940 clients over the years; I was EXTREMELY disappointed today in their lack of integrity – even after admitting they screwed up!
I saw them add for 2 vehicles I was looking for, contacted their sales person and made arrangements to purchase before the 1 ½ drive each way and verified the pricing!
Within 10 minutes of arrival, I noticed that the MSRP on the vehicle’s window sticker was significantly LOWER than what they said in them adds; making their discount less than advertised.  I pointed this out to the salesman, who said – “I’ve never seen this happen before.  My apologies.  I’m sure my manager will honor the error.”  I mentioned that maybe the other vehicle was correct; sad to say, it too had the same deceptive error.  What are the odds!  If you’ve ever bought from them, you were probably quietly screwed too.
1 ½ hours later, after having most all the work completed to purchase the vehicle; the manager admitted the error; but, said that “in small print, it says if a mistake is made, we don’t honor them”.
I’m an employer, if my employee makes an error – I will do my best to honor it and serve the client.  They admitted the error but was unwilling to make even a ONE-dollar adjustment towards the $1,000 error.
Thus, they went from being a vendor I would recommend to a deceptive, dishonorable dealer.  I would suggest that you avoid them.  HONOR DOESN’T MATTER IN POLITICS; but, it should matter in business!

I took thee trip to finally come to my senses that it was a waste of time to try to buy a truck advertised in Autotrader by them. On the first trip, the truck didn't have the options I was looking for.  The second trip to the dealer, I asked that the truck be brought to the site so I could look at it before starting the paper work and they told me that its not how they do things there. Who buys a truck without seeing it, right? My third trip I was interested in purchasing in another  truck listed in Autotrader, but they told me they could sell it. They told me it was missing parts due to a break in. I spoke to the manager and  I expressed my disappointment with the whole situation.

While you are waiting you would think they would be prepping your car for delivery to you , however that is not the case. So after waiting hours on finance, plan to spend at least another hour waiting on them to take another hour to wash your car.

Not because of log negotiating but because they leave you at your seat while they stand off in the distance doing nothing. They have the, ""this is the price take it or leave it attitude."" Saying things like, ""if you don't buy it, someone else will."" If you have a trade, don't bring it here. They won't give you anything for it, although blue book value states otherwise.

Talked to dealer the next morning...""No problem-we will take care of you"" well a few days later I did take our jeep in with about 126 miles and the service manager did hear it very clearly and of course our salesman said ""I dont hear anything""and walked away. WOW is that how they that take care of you? We have purchased 3 new jeeps from this sales guy in 2 years!   A 2011 Rubi Unlimited, A 2013 Rubi Unlimited and this 2013 Rubi 2 door. CRAP!!! that is over $100,000. dollars in 2 years. Well anyways, 2 days after dropping off the jeep then the service manager calls and said "" THAT IS NORMAL"".. are you serious! If the jeep was making that sound when we test drove it NO WAY we would have bought it. So the dealer has turned their backs on us!  WOW!  over  $100,000. we spent there and this is how they """"NO Problem- We will take care of you"""" Please buy from another dealer - no car is made perfect, but this is how they treat a GOOD returning customer. Salesmen- Rob Trachman. and Service Manager is Rick B. I mean these guys really looked me in the eye and said that they would take care of me..........right.

10988,01-Jun-19,"6 HOURS to buy a car?   I called on Thursday the 23rd and made an appointment for the 24th at 9:30.   I told Ricardo which car I was interested in and he told me it was upfront. Victor was our salesman and he greeted us with kindness and enthusiasm and told me the car was in the back lot.  I was surprised to learn that the car I wanted was $2000 more than listed online. So George came in to explain it to us but instead we were met with arrogance and rudeness.  After a short but disturbing conversation/argument  he told us "" he's been doing this for 30 years and maybe we should leave and go think about it"".  At this point, my boyfriend left the desk to go ask for another manager and I told George I was no longer speaking to him. I have never been treated so badly.  George needs to realize that without me and every other customer.....he doesn't have a job.  Frankly I would of fired him if it were my company.

Now we're waiting for another manager, and Joe comes in and we have to start the process all over again after telling him how completely disgusted I am with the treatment I received from George. 3 hours after my appointment time, I finally get to see the car .....it is filthy.... dirt and debris everywhere.   It's so bad I don't even want to sit in it and there's no gas in it to take it for a test drive.   Also the rear passenger matching tire is not on and that needs to be replaced.   I'm told it will take an hour to change the tire and to clean and detail the car.   This is how they present a car to someone who wants to buy it??

An hour goes by... just 30 more minutes, 15 more minutes.... lie after lie. 2 1/2 hours later my car is ""ready"".   But I look in the car, it's still not completely clean and there's no gas in it.   Joe explained to me that the cleaning is subcontracted out, and they have no control over how long it takes for them to do their job. Really? This is the standard that is acceptable and you make excuses for them??

I arrived at 9:30 ready to buy a car..... that car and it is now 3:30.   The level of BS that was handed to me that day was ridiculous and insulting?   I love a jeep but I will never step foot back into that dealership again other than the required yearly visit through my warranty... and believe me I'm telling everyone and anyone.   And here's a suggestion stop eating at the front desk. Nobody wants to come in to buy a car and see you with a mouthful of food.  

Finally driving home I notice he Stop/Start is not working so I called and talked to Dan.  Who told me that it really doesn't save gas and is really hard on the engine, so I shouldn't worry about fixing it.  REALLY??  I buy a car that has 360 miles on it....EVERYTHING should work on it.  But after all his daughter has a Compass and hers is turned off and I should do the same.....  

The above is a sugar coated version..... it was a miserable day and experience.......it pains me to the know that I am part of their salary earned that day.  Buying a car should not be that miserable .....it shouldn't be miserable at all.......  and yes I could of walked away but I've had two Jeeps before and believe in the car.   I just I wish I had read the reviews before and gone somewhere else.......  the low price was not worth being treated like crap for he most of 6 hours.

This is a great brand and a great vehicle, but this dealership will not give you an example of either of those. I have tried to buy jeeps here, tried to have my jeeps serviced here (I have owned 6 and half dozen of my friends own them because of me) and every attempt has been a disaster. Twice in the past 4 years I have walked on to this dealership to buy a vehicle - cash in hand. Both times I walked the lot for 15-20 minutes without being acknowledged by anyone. When I go inside and ask for help I end up sitting on the chair for another 15 minutes. Each time I have had to leave and go down to the jeep dealership on Harbor (not a great place but at least the do customer service). Today I had a service appointment because I had been given a gift certificate by a friend who knows I love jeeps. Pulled up, parked my car and waited.....and waited....20 minutes. I flagged a gentleman down and was told that someone would be with me shortly and that my oil change would take 2 hours. Another 20 minutes went by. I called the service desk from the parking lot and asked to speak with a manager - I was transferred to VM.

10992,14-Mar-17,"So let me start this review by suggesting that I have purchased a multitude of cars from various dealerships and manufacturers ranging from inexpensive to very expensive! Never have I ever encountered a more unprofessional, disorganized and wasteful entity in my entire life! I essentially spoon fed them a sale! I called early in the morning and spoke to Oscar (this gentlemen is the internet manager and judging by my experience with him, it's really no surprise that the organization is as horrendous as it is). I told Oscar what car I wanted to test drive, when I would be there and reiterated the importance of timeliness as I made a 2 hour commute to get to the facility. I had also prequalified for a loan and secured financing prior to my arrival. In addition I got my trade appraised, through their website, and had my pink slip in hand ready to make my purchase! When I arrived, on time might I add, I had to wait nearly 30 minutes for my sales rep to acknowledge my presence. Afterwards he took me to the vehicle I was going to purchase. It was unkept and filthy! All of this was of little consequence as the vehicle was being sold at a great price and the inherent value was present. As I went to test drive the vehicle Oscar realized that the dealership had lost the key to the vehicle. They initially thought they locked it inside and I had to help them POP THE LOCK! (As far fetched as this sounds I'm not making it up.) we spent nearly an hour popping the lock to find the key wasn't in the car! It took nearly two hours to get a locksmith to make a new key! Again I waited through this process kindly and patiently! Durning which time I waited in a dilapidated showroom that was clearly not being maintained from an aesthetic or functional perspective with one of the most unprofessional managers I've ever experienced. Yet still I waited trying to give the dealership the benefit of the doubt! As my visit approached the three hour mark I finally test drove the vehicle and came to agreeable financial terms. One would think that after the courtesy and patience I demonstrated the duration of my experience would be seamless...however you would be wrong! Another two hours past as I sat aimlessly waiting for this inefficient, disorganized, and unprofessional people to get together the paperwork for my purchase. They could not manage to do so. I arrived at the dealership at 6 pm and at 11:15 pm I decided that I would take my business elsewhere! When I told them to cancel the transaction I did not receive so much as an apology! Very frustrating experience! It is no wonder that this dealership and the entire Chrysler, Jeep, Dodge brand is going under! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME HERE!",6,16,-1
10993,06-Aug-15,"I went to the dealership to buy a vehicle yesterday. I called before making the 3 hour drive to confirm the vehicle was still available. I also told them I was buying it and asked if they would hold it for me if I made the drive. Tom told me they don't normally do that but would ask his manager. He put me on hold a minute and came back saying that his manager approved it. They would hold the vehicle for me to purchase if I drove down that day. I take off work early and head that way immediately. I arrive there and we immediately sit down to go through the numbers to make the purchase. Keep in mind, I agreed to the purchase price of the vehicle before making the trip. I did not haggle with pricing at all. It was the price on the front window which was a decent price for this vehicle. They run my credit which is approx 800 credit score and I'm approved for the loan amount. I'm also putting 7500 cash down. I decline their extended warranty that they continued to push on me. After declining that, there is still 2k in hidden fees according to the length of the loan, monthly payment, and the interest rate they are giving me. I could of used my own financing but wanted it to go smoothly as it was late in the day and my bank was closed. I agreed to the 5% which I knew I could refinance in a few months with Chase @ 1-2%. They wouldn't show me the total and were playing the normal sales hidden numbers game. I ask one question - the break down of the fees. I never get this. After sitting around waiting, Tom comes back and tells me he cannot make the deal because the vehicle just sold! We are in the middle of a contract and they sale it? They failed to tell me they were doing two contracts at the same time for the same vehicle! They wasted 7.5 hours of my time and did not keep their word. If you cannot hold a vehicle, say so. If you tell someone you will hold it; keep your word. Why waste my time, get a bad review, and run my credit if you are going to sale it to someone else after promising to hold it? Shady shady dealership and sales people. Beware!

10994,02-Apr-15,"I must tell you, In the collection of automobiles that I've purchased - this  car buying experience was the worst that I've ever had. 

 

I initially inquired about a Ram truck online, and was contacted by Robert Bauer. I spoke to him on the phone and by email a couple of times and made an appointment to see him. I arrived at our scheduled meeting time, and he wasn't in yet. I waited about a half hour and he finally arrived, I introduced myself and he had no clue what I was interested in or seemingly who I was. He finally pulled up my info and proceeded to find my truck - I waited another half hour. He took me for a test drive, and when I inquired about the air suspension option and standard warranties he said that I really didn't need those options. After the test drive, we went inside to discuss price and an already lackluster experience spiraled out of control. I told him what I thought the truck was worth, he was offended and said that the dealership was already discounting it. So I tried to get an out the door price from him and he said that he couldn't do that till I was in finance. I explained that part of my decision making process was knowing the finance options , and he retorted by pressuring me to make a decision. I said that I wouldn't make a decision without the numbers in front of me and I didn't like his sales tactic. I said that we were done and he told me to take his card - and that ""you'll be back""

Fast forward two days -  I was still very dissatisfied with the experience at the dealership, but I decided that I would give it another go. I asked to speak to a manager and got Nick Farber. I explained the situation and he said that he would take care of me personally and try to make the situation better. I asked for an out the door price and he said that was against company policy.  I made an appointment with him for 9:30 AM on Friday March 27th. He called me later that day and said that he would be tied up in a meeting and wouldn't be available till 10:30, I agreed and appeared at the dealership as agreed. When I spoke tot he receptionist, she told me that Nick wasn't there, finally another manager told me that he wasn't in yet that morning and wouldn't be in till noon. At that point I was pretty irritated because he had blown my appointment off - I was told that Dan would be helping me in Nick's absence. Dan had no clue about the situation, so I had to explain everything all over again. I had secured financing with my credit union and had decided to go that way, I asked Dan to get me an out the door price so that I could make a decision. He told me that I would need to fill out a credit application so that he could take it to his manager before he could get me an out the door price. I went round and round with him, and explained that since I already had approved financing I just needed to know what the final price was going to be! He came back by telling me that I was being difficult, and that he thought that we were done. I was furious, and raised my voice. Another manager came over, and I asked to speak to the sales manager - after about 5 minutes Danny came over and spoke to me. He agreed that I didn't need to do a complete credit application since I was using my own financing. He got me an out the door price with all the incentives that were available, and I hesitantly agreed to make the purchase. 

He then sent me to Tom Cruz' office to complete the paper work. Tom had no idea who I was or what was going on, again I had to explain the situation and waited for them to get things together. Soon after that Nick Farber arrived, and took over the process- I was not happy at all by then. 

Finally, I went into the finance manager's office and explained that I was very frustrated and would like to make this as quick as possible. I explained that I wanted NO extras, however he proceeded to try to hard sell me an extended warranty, paint / interior protection, a maintenance plan, alarm, etc. I explained that I wasn't interested, and he persisted, and I lost it. I ended up signing the papers and getting out of your dealership as quickly as possible. 

In good conscience I could not suggest this dealership to anyone nor would I be likely to purchase from them again. It seems that customer service is the last priority at this dealership, and that hard selling / sleazyness is the corporate culture. If I'm contacted by Ram, I will let them know what my experience was like and how dissatisfied I still am with it. ",6,16,0

10996,18-Nov-14,"A used car was posted online at $17899.  We went to buy the vehicle and low and behold the numbers were not adding up.  We know that on average tax/license fees total to approx 10% of purchase price.  This salesperson kept quoting about $2700-$3000 of closing costs which didn't make sense.  So when we were working the numbers out it just didn't make sense.  We asked to see the workout sheet and when it arrived the taxes, doc fees, registration all added up correctly but we couldn't figure out why the price was about $1000 over what we were adding up.  Then in a little line item directly under the price that is advertised for this vehicle online, was a weird term ""aftermarket"" and $774 added to the price of the vehicle.  So be very wary of buying anything from this underhanded used sales deparment.  We even asked the salesman to explain the line item and he blew us off and basically said he had tried his best!

10997,25-Apr-14,"This was the worse vehicle purchasing experience that I've ever had. I went in and drove a new Durango RT based on an ad at a specific sale price. The salesman and finance guys negotiated the deal, sale price and payment terms on a car that I'd never even seen or driven. The claim is that there was a mix up with the inventory ID. All of a sudden the car that I drove was NOT the one in the ad. The one I drove was more expensive of course and had AWD. The dealer in attempt to ""make things right"" insisted on working to match the deal as close as possible on the car that I drove. It suddenly became a numbers game on the monthly payment amount in attempt to meet close to the payment amount and terms that was originally pitched on the car with less features. Consequently, I ended up with a car that was out of scope of what we originally planned for the purchase. We were handed of to 3 different salesmen during this process, which made it even more of a unnerving experience. It was a completely confusing and misleading process from the car to the warranty, where the finance guy uses the misleading terms that the warranty covers ""everything"" for as long as you own the car. Lifetime warranty, yes, but it doesn't cover everything. ",6,16,-1

well, I get this call that said, ""Congratulations, we found you a loan, you can pick up your car!"" I said ""what? You were just supposed to be getting me figures!"" Of course, the figure was too high, and by then I was most unhappy that they had secured a loan without my permission.

A few minuets later he came back and no deal on their financing and if I wanted to use my bank, I would have to sign a contract with them at 1.92% higher APR.

I had researched the trade in value on numerous credible sites. They OFFERED ME NEXT TO NOTHING! OVER $5,000 LESS THAN IT WAS WORTH. This included a litany of stories. They also came back with a price on their vehicle much higher.. The real difference between what I was quoted and my experience, including trying to steal my trade in was some $9,000+. 
Best advice : go elsewhere! This is a dealership you should avoid like the plague. 
Save you self the time and avoid a terrible experience.  ",6,16,-1

Lease and purchase prices promotion are different...be sure to know what number you're working with.

Don't go after 6pm or eat dinner b4 u go.

11010,09-Oct-19,"Get ready for a fight, or they will take you to the cleaners!

Found a 2018 Ram 2500 4x4 for a great price here while searching on the internet. I live about 6 hours away from Huntington Beach but this price was about $4k cheaper than everywhere else I could find this particular truck. I called the dealer, spoke with a Bryan and confirmed the price. I asked if there would be any surprise add-ons and he promised me that was the price I would get. I told him I was already approved for the loan and he said that was great!

My wife and I took the next day off, drove 6 hours, and got a hotel room so we could be at the dealer in the morning. This seemed like a good idea to save $4k. 

We went inside, asked for Bryan, he wasn't there but there was another nice kid who would be happy to help us. I told them I didn't want to cut Bryan out of his commission, they said no worries, he would still get it. 

We sat down with new kid. First thing he tells us is there will be an additional $4,000 for Theft Protection GPS, Surface Coating, and Service Contract. (All Optional in final contract, but I was told this is the only way I was getting that internet price.) Additionally, they insisted I used their financing even though I came in with a pre-approved loan. Their loan had an APR that was 3.4% higher than mine. They said I could refinance after 3 months. I said that would cost me three payments of nearly pure interest and they looked at me like I was crazy.

I said no way, I didn't ask for or want any of that crap. All I wanted was the price I was promised before I drove 6 hours and rented a hotel room. 

We fought all day. We left no less than three times. First time I left was because they didn't even have the truck there, I told them I didn't even want to talk to them anymore until they produced the truck so I could test drive it. We went to the beach and walked around with our feet in the ocean until they called us back and said they had the truck. 

After the test drive the fighting continued. All I wanted was the price I was promised and they told me I was being unreasonable. The manager said ""Okay, I can't earn everyone's business"", and walked away. We left, they ran us down in the parking lot and said they would come down by $1,750, but I still had to use their financing. I said no, they walked away. We drove off. 

We got about 5 minutes away and they called. This guy said he was the GM and he didn't want to loose my business because of financing. He said I could use my financing and take off a total of $2,300. We decided this is close enough and we took the deal. I know we could have nickle dimed them down some more, but it was getting late and we still had to drive 6 hours to get home. 

Now, this may be knit picking, but these guys got me on Yelp for the first time, so here we go...

After the the papers were signed, we waited a long time for the truck to be back from detailing. We were walking around the truck and my wife noticed a 2"" gash in the paint right on the edge of the front wheel well. I can't believe we didn't notice this before, and we had already signed. (Not really a deal breaker anyway.) I went inside and had the GM come out and look at the gash to see if there was anything they could do. ""Sorry man, AS-IS..."" and basically walked away. I thought, ""Really? Brand new car and I get AS-IS treatment?"" Still not a deal breaker, I can fix this anyways.

We were waiting some more, they couldn't find the rubber floor mats that were included or the spare key. They never found the mats, said they would be ordered and shipped. While waiting the same GM asked me to leave them a good review on Yelp and I said I would. I hope he didn't mean favorable, cause I would have said no.

This was an awful experience. This isn't my first time buying a vehicle, but I have never felt like I was dealing with such a crooked dealership. I left two stars because after a day of fighting and headache, we still got the truck cheaper than I could find it listed anywhere else in a 500 mile web search.

If you're up for a fight, got a day to burn, and don't mind walking out a few times to get what you were promised, then you might not mind buying a car here. Just don't travel a long distance and expect them to be upfront about pricing before you get there. All promises are out the window once you sit down with sales person.

I doubt I'll ever see those floor mats...

I am sorry that i didn't read every thing in detail but I believe in a small amount of trust between us should be there so we could have a good relationship and they have shown that clearly they do not wish to proceed honestly I DO NOT CARE THAT THE VEHICLE HAS A V6 I am fine with it I do care however when i am told throughout that I have something that I do not. this is what happened to me and i feel cheated.

11014,18-Feb-15,"Called and e-mailed concerning a new 2014 Jeep Cherokee, was assured the car was still available.  Upon arrival at the dealership, I was informed the gentleman I was communicating with was busy and Tom Cruze gave me John Dreyer to help me.  John said the Cherokee was at their offsite storage area and drove me to that lot and proceeded to frantically look for the Jeep finally giving up in what seemed to be forever as I was standing among all of these dirty dusty vehicles in an unpaved parking area.  John was kind enough to allow me to drive another Cherokee back to the dealership so I could at least access whether I wanted a 4 cylinder Cherokee.  Back at the dealership he again began trying to locate the vehicle and somehow determined that is was at another lot and someone had disabled the GPS system the dealership uses to keep track of the vehicles.  Well, he finally got the vehicle to show me which was caked with dust and the wheels looked like it had been doing some off-roading.  This all took over an hour and a half and I had to leave for another appointment.  I called John when I got home and arranged for an appointment at 10 am the next day to perhaps close the deal on the car, he assured me the Cherokee was still available and someone would be there to appraise my trade-in.  Arrived at 10 am, John was there but no Cherokee, so he ran off to find it again.  I sat cooling my heels for 30 minutes and finally sent him a text to find out what in the world was going on.  He informed me he could not get in the gate at the offsite lot and was waiting for someone to open it - he said "" we just opened and I should understand that with over 2000 new cars, it is hard to keep track of them etc, etc"". I sent him another text to see if the trade-in could be looked at while I was waiting and was informed by John that he could not locate the used car guy.  I waited another 20 minutes and then left.  What I do not understand is why he did not arrange to have the vehicle ready and detailed for me to look at seeing that I showed a genuine interest in buying it and had made an appointment.  Called another dealer on the way home and inquired about a similar vehicle, it was at the dealer when I arrived 15 minutes later, even though the salesman had to go off site to get it.",6,16,149

11016,16-Oct-16,"EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED in how this dealership handled customer service.
After TWO WEEKS, our brand new Jeep that we bought at this dealership would not start. This was disappointing in itself, but my review is based on how inadequate the situation was handled. 

When the car did not start on a Saturday night, I tried to contact the dealership but found that not many people were there, which was understandable. I left a message with Tom Cruz, the sales manager, and I left two messages with Jacob Jacobo, the man that helped us buy the car. I also left a general voicemail with the receptionist that night for ANYONE to get back to me. 

I received no calls back the next day, so I left a separate message with each of the men above another message with a different sales manager, and another message with the receptionist again for anyone to get back to me. I had to have the car towed TWICE from one dealership that was the closest to me, then to Huntington Beach. This was covered under warranty, but essentially our day was gone while we waited four hours to get the car to the dealer. 

My husband and I work in San Diego, and we needed to get into a rental or something to get back and thankfully, the service department helped us with that, which is why this review is in my opinion worth one star (even if there is no option for zero stars). Although our car was not in the dealership's possession, they put us into a rental, but this would bite us in the butt later since we didn't get paperwork for the mileage coming in.

We still did not receive any correspondence back, after FOUR days, and after leaving voicemails every day with the receptionist, it was finally ridiculous and I sent an email to Tom and Jacob. Then Tom emailed me back right then and there and told me that him, and his whole team were out, and this was why no one had contacted us. I find that extremely hard to believe because the day before the receptionist let me know that Jacob had been in, but left early. After telling Tom this via email, I hadn't heard back from him, and still haven't. 

My Jeep was ready after almost two weeks of being in the service department, and while I appreciated that our car was worked on, when we got our car back there was almost 200 extra miles on the car. Now we did not have the paperwork as I mentioned with our situation of the car not being in when we received the rental. But the service department gave us the invoice letting us know the car came in at 1420 miles, which it did not, had been driven 5 miles to check if it worked, and it says that we received the car back with 1426 miles on it. However, we have pictures that our car came out at 1423 miles. Something wasn't right, and this whole situation was just wrong in the first place. 

I would caution everyone about coming here. It was not only disappointing, but just upsetting and a huge hassle that no one should have to deal with when buying a new car.",6,16,-1

I called the salesman that helped me with the car and he said just come in and we’ll fix it. I came in and talked to a finance officer and she told me it can’t be changed and I should have read my contract and it stated Feb 1st. 

I’ve now had this car for almost a month and still haven’t gotten a call for when I can get the tint put on. I could have saved money and went to a tint shop and gotten it done on the same day. The only reason I did it here is because I was told I would get a loaner car while they do the work, which after reading my contract I see also is not true. 

Now do I love the car, yes. Do I feel like I got cheated, not really.  It’s the inconvenience of it all. I shouldn’t be told one thing and not get it. That’s a real bad sales tactic.

11862,02-Oct-18,"My review is not so much against Crown Dodge, but rather the Dodge vehicle I purchased. 
On August 25th, I purchased a 2017 Dodge Charger. After only 2 days in the car, I got a ""service shifter"" alarm. Also, the service department at Crown called me and said there was a recall on the computer software system, so I brought the car in. After they performed the upgrade, the computer system crashed. That led to them having the vehicle for 2 weeks while they tried to fix it. It required them calling the corporate mechanics because they didn't know how to fix the computer. They ended up having to replace one of the computer components. After I picked up the vehicle, I drove it for 2 days, then began having multiple problems. The check engine light came on. I also had erroneous readings that all of the tires had low tire pressure, and some sort of brown fluid was leaking from under the car. Back to the dealership. They have now had the vehicle for the past 2 1/2 weeks. At this point, I don't even want the car back. As far as I am concerned, this car isn't safe. I just want Dodge to buy the car back and allow me to purchase a vehicle that actually runs. The whole reason I spent so much money on a new vehicle is for the reliability. I am afraid that if they make me take this car back,  the computer system will fail while I'm on the freeway and I could seriously hurt or kill someone if I can's stop. Computers seem to have influence over just about everything in cars these days.  I have an open case on file requesting a buy back option. The case manager is in Texas, I believe, and she is very difficult to contact. This car is not safe, but I feel like my concerns are being ignored or at least allowed to drag on. I bought this car 5 weeks ago and have only actually driven it for a total of 4 days. The car is still in the service department as I write this review. 
The dealership itself has tried to be helpful throughout all of this. Alex, my sales manager has been helpful and is doing what he can, but the buy back option is out of his hands. The service manager has been helpful as well. Also, JP my service advisor has been an advocate. Crown Dodge has provided either a rental car or a free loaner vehicle for me while my car has been out of commission. ",6,17,357
11875,12-Jun-18,"I was excited to finally find a car, I get a Jeep Compass which I was sold from first glance and test drive. Once the ink was signed and I drove it off the lot, the back up camera kept sticking, even in drive. The gas mph is supposed to be 22 in the city and 32 on the freeway. I have pictures now of my gas gauge is malfunctioning and not reading accurately. The radio switches back and forth from Media on it's on. I brought the car back in for other servicing to let them know. I reported both of these problems when I brought my vehicle in on May 7th. The customer service rep told me that I indeed needed a new radio and that they couldn't find anything wrong with the gas gauge. She would order the radio and it could possibly take a day or a month. What kind of timeline is this?! Especially on a brand new vehicle. It is not June 11th and I have yet to hear back from the service department on my radio. I am still having problem with the gas gauge and can show you pictures of the issue. I am very dissatisfied with this service. A new car should now have these issues and before leaving the lot should have a full inspection. A timeline for a part should never be a day to a month. The communication on this is ridiculous. I want my radio and gas gauge fixed! No more excuses. This is disappointing to pay so much for a vehicle to not get what you paid for. I will do a courtesy to call the service department today to see if my radio is in. I have already contacted the manufacturer. If this is not handled I will seek legal counsel. I don't have a problem with the customer service rep, I have a problem with the service. ",6,17,27
11882,02-Apr-18,"We had a terrible experience at the Crown Dodge Service Department. I spoke with Kristin on Friday. I made an appointment for Monday morning for repairs to our new 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee. I called at 8 am on Monday to confirm. Kristen confirmed the morning appointment time as between 9 and 10 am. She instructed us to ask for her upon arrival. 

My wife arrived at 9:05 am. She parked the car and went to one of the offices in the service department. She spoke with Monte about the scheduled repairs. He asked who she had been assigned to. She said that we had only been advised to ask for Kristin. He reacted as if there was no Kristin. He took her to a window where there were three sheets of paper taped up listing the appointments for the day. We were not on the list. 
My wife insisted that we were instructed to ask for Kristin. He then conceded that he did know Kristin and advised where she could be found.

My wife entered the main office area where she found Kristin. Kristin asked where the car was. My wife said it was parked outside. Kristin scolded her for not getting in line. We were not instructed to get in line before. 
My wife moved the car behind the 20 - 30 cars that were in line. Why were we given an appointment, then placed in line behind 30 cars? What is the purpose of an appointment?

When she got to the front of the line, a young man tried to help her. He had to find someone who would work her in, since she was not on the list and had no one assigned to her. The young man was going from one person to another, but they were all saying they were busy.

Finally, Monte came to the car and asked what she needed. She told him about the trouble we are having with the car. 
He said he saw on his tablet that we needed “a loaner”, but there were none available. She said that was fine, she just needed a ride back. He told her she would have to take a shuttle, and there was not one until 11:00. She said okay and waited in the cold waiting room.
Luckily a nice shuttle driver came in at 10:25 and offered a ride.

At 3:48 pm Monte called to ask what was the purpose of the car being brought in. My wife had to explain the trouble again. The car had been there all day, and they hadn’t looked at it yet.

I called at 4:45 and asked when we could pick up the car. Monte said they wouldn’t be able to look at it until tomorrow. I was furious. We had an appointment at 9 am! We had been without the car for an entire day, and now they were going to keep it another day. I told him we would come and get the car.

My wife went to pick the car up. She went to Monte who waved her off and told her to go in the office for the paperwork work in order to pick up the car.

The car remains in a state of disrepair.

11934,27-Oct-17,Went to this dealership. I found 2 chargers with 20% off sticker on windshield. Just what I was looking for.. The sales person was jonny.. Which was great at first but then when it came down to price I noticed he wasn't adding the 20% off when I asked he said both cars were a mistake and they should have never had that sticker. He should have owned this from the beginning... How is this my fault? He then came back and said they granted me the 20% off which was still a lie.. he tried explaining how much money 20% off was. It never added up. I pulled out my calculator so I could show him how much 20% really was.. Which he was off by 1k. I went to car and by that time they took off stickers of 20% off.. But they really think we buyers are stupid.. I went to the other car took a picture of the 20% off.. And i took a picture of the car I was trying to buy. This is not the first time they mix up window stickers like this.. I came a month ago and had this same issue.. Also the car was labeled as a 2017 it was a 2016.. WOW.. I still was willing to give them a chance because of the car itself.. Didn't happen though. Jimmy decided to pawn me off to one of his managers.. I saw jonny outside when I was leaving.. Its my fault if you look at the reviews it would let you know about this stuff.. The manager I must say was nice.. Gerardo I believe his name was.. That's the only reason this place gets 2 starts,6,17,-1

11944,09-Sep-17,I will never be using this dealership again it is unfortunate I have already bought two cars from them hopefully this review will keep somebody else from making the same mistake... both brand new cars I have bought from this dealership have been like running a marathon.. it starts with the sales people lying about prices and trying to manipulate the deal into a monthly agreement as opposed to an overall price of the car... twice they came back with monthly payments acting like I was getting a deal because they didn't understand I know how to use a calculator and when I did the math and showed them they were lying about the price I would be paying for the car.. they then come back and say oops we must have made a mistake... either you are so stupid you do not know how to do your job both times I tried to buy a car.. or you're a liar and a scam artist and you hoped I would be too stupid to catch it.. I'm pretty sure it was the second reason.. their service department is atrocious they continue with their lying long after you have bought the car the service people are rude unknowledgeable about what they are speaking about and overall horribly unpleasant to deal with.. basically their thought process is if we make this as an unenjoyable as possible for a customer they will not come back as often thus we will probably save money on warranties... my wife's car is only a year old and has been shutting off as she drives the vehicle when she called service today they told her nothing we can do for you you'll have to come by next week sometime and maybe we can take a look at it... that is absolutely unacceptable.. when I called back they just talk over you don't allow you to speak and then hang up the phone multiple times.. Crown Dodge is a disgrace the owner should be ashamed that his dealership is ran by such dishonest unworthy people.. I was going to buy another Jeep this year I will be going to a different dealership and so should you,6,17,542
11964,14-Jun-17,"Before I begin, let me say that I take no joy in writing such reviews. As a reasonable, patient and fair person to a fault, I take such reviews seriously. I would much rather submit a positive review (and I have done so for many organizations I have done business with), however, when really bad situations arise, I think it is important to share with those that could otherwise avoid having to go through a similar experience. This dealership is hands down the worst Jeep dealership I have ever encountered. I tried to purchase/lease a vehicle from them several weeks ago. I started off by speaking with Scott Walters, then was passed along to Darren Stewart and finally to Paul Mills. I have been a long time loyal Jeep owner with excellent credit and had many models of Jeeps both purchased and leased from various dealerships where I have lived/worked around the country. I generally always asked the same set of questions to make sure all the figures/terms are clear, so not my first rodeo as the saying goes. Crown Jeep refused to answer very basic questions that I asked verbally and in writing and then gave me attitude for actually asking the questions. Furthermore, I have tried on (3) separate occasions to make the G.M., i.e. Mr. Crown via his assistant Terry Vasquez aware of my experience so they could use as a learning tool to improve customer service for future customers, hence the reason I have resisted writing this review until now. I have never had the courtesy of a reply from her or anyone else at the dealership. Needless to say, I took my business to another dealership and was treated fairly, professionally, courteously while valuing my time. I even contacted the GM of that dealership recently to let him know how positive my experience was with the Internet Sales Manager. Do yourself a favor and avoid Crown Jeep. They are dishonest (deliberately did not apply rebates/incentives I was eligible for, probably to pocket for themselves), unprofessional and just outright rude. The place is dysfunctional and clearly it all starts from the top right on down. If I could give them zero stars I would. These people need to wake up and realize in the year 2017 that many people want to avoid the haggle and complete as much of the transaction by telephone as possible and then go in, sign the docs and be on their way. If you don't want your valuable time wasted, not to mention being unnecessarily frustrated/ripped off, then don't give this dealership your business. Go somewhere that they actually value the customer relationship and appreciate your business.",6,17,2704

Called 3 separate times. Every time was put on hold for close to 15 minutes average. First time the connection finally just dropped. Other two calls the receptionist came back on and tells me there is nobody available to help me. How hard can this be?Noticed they asked what type of service right up front. Maybe when they know it's a Safety Recall you go to the bottom of the pack (no big money there for them).

I wasted my one chance to get away from that car because I trusted them.

12088,27-Nov-15,"I am a medical student and my husband is an active duty service member stationed at the Port Hueneme Naval Base. I unfortunately didnt do my research before we decided to buy our first car together as a young married couple. I posted a review of my first experience with them about a month ago, but after I posted my horrific experience on 4 different review sites they decided to finally do something about our situation. Long story short- they sold us the wrong car to drive off of the lot. We asked for a V6 4x4 and we drove a 2016 Jeep Cherokee 4cyl off the lot. It wasn't until the next morning that our financial adviser pointed out that we were driving a 4cyl, which was NOT the vehicle I specifically asked for. I returned the vehicle less than 24 hours later and after being harassed by multiple salesmen as my husband and I walked across the lot due to the fact that we were already returning the vehicle, they told us I lost $10,000 in equity and there was nothing they could do for us. Not to mention they lied to us about the cost of window tinting, the rental car agreement for servicing, and the details of the car we drove off the lot. I had the financial manager give false information to us and thankfully my financial adviser educated me before I went in. I had to call Navy Federal representatives twice during the closing of our deal in order to prove that our financial 'manager' was dishing us negligent information. They called me back 4 days later after my detailed and explicit reviews were seen by the entire dealership and bought my car back at full price and I finally was able to drive my 2015 Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk off of the lot. I thought that I finally put my miserable experience to rest, but that was a joke of a thought within itself. I scheduled a detailing appointment with Cassie on Friday, November 21st.I told her in front of my husband that we are leaving for Tahoe next week so we need our car. She acknowledged the information I provided her and proceeded to schedule my detail wash appointment on Tuesday, November 24th. Well, it is November 24th without my car. I called Crown Dodge 4 times today asking about the status of my car. I dropped my car off at 8:45am this morning. At 3pm, they said they didnt even get to my car yet. I called back again and my service manager didnt answer the phone. I called again at 4:30 and my car still wasnt finished. I called again at 5:30pm and my service manager didnt answer again. My husband dropped me off for my friends funeral this even WHICH I LEFT EARLY FOR TO PICK UP MY CAR after service hours. I called them as I was walking away from the funeral to head to the dealership and they said my keys were not available for me to pick my car up that i dropped off to get a DETAILED WASH ONLY OVER A PERIOD OF10 HOURS. I am scheduled to leave for Tahoe at 6am tomorrow with my husband. I am supposed to pick my family up along the way and get there in time for a scheduled event while my husband is taking leave before deployment. They once again said their famous words, ""I'm sorry Mrs. Cann, but there is nothing I can do for you."" I gave them the benefit of the doubt for fixing my car situation and took down my reviews on all of the sites, but this is the final straw. I am now being punished for the fact that not one person called my husband or me to tell us that the car would not be ready by the end of the day WHICH WAS IN FACT GUARANTEED TO US TWICE. I am now xxxx BENT on making sure I can continue to make sure I can pass our experience onto others so prevent them from buying and servicing at your dealership. I already called the Better Business Bureau once and I will be doing it once again tomorrow morning along with contacting Crystler. You have wasted enough of our time. I will be seeing you guys first thing tomorrow morning.

12159,16-Jun-13,"I went to crown Dodge after I was in an accident and my car was totalled. They totally took advantage of the fact that I was a woman and needed a vehicle asap. They were so friendly acting like gentleman but it was all an act. The salesman Evan told me that the Jeep I was looking at came with a warranty and free service for 4 years and it was included in the price. Well now 3 weeks later when I am fixing a mess THEY created in financing, I realized they charged me over 3 thousand dollars for that service. My bad for not reading their contract with a fine tooth comb but morally, they are disgusting. Typical salesmen attitude only care about making the sale on the most money they can. I will never go back to this dealership and recommend people stay away too.",6,17,138
12174,02-Mar-13,"I have given this rating due to the way I was treated in the service department. I took my jeep into this place for warranty work. I was informed they would check out my jeep and call the warranty company and give ma a call by the end of the day. Two days later I had to call and was given some run around and was told there was a Chrysler bulleton out stating the jeeps were installed with faulty trans filters and that this would fix the problem. They made it sound like it was going to be covered it was not. 3 day later I had to call again and find out the status of my jeep now and again was given some run around saying they could not duplicate the problem and would I mind coming down to show them. Took off work early and took jim for a ride and duplicated the problem. 4 days later I had to call and find out the status and I was told they couldn't duplicate the problem that I had shown him 4 days earlier. I informed jim to stop all work and I want my jeep back and that I need it by Wednesday night at the latest he said fine and that he would do it and call me. Wednesday night no call Thursday no call until Thursday afternoon jim calls and says the jeep is done. The total is way to much for something that was played off as warranty. 
So I spent 13 days without a car due to jim not calling warranty right away so they could issue me a rental. This is why I purchased the extended warranty. Now after paying the high bill I get my jeep home and look under it to find the transmission pan is leaking transmission fluid as well as the front shock, control arms (upper and lower) as well as the half shaft and inner fender have a bunck of grease and oil all over them.
Unethical, sloppy mechanics.",6,17,42

I should have never thought that this dealership would have changed.  All the sales guys (except Ricky) stand in front of the entrance and smoke, so when you try to walk into the building, you smell like you've been in a casino or bar all night.

12176,26-Jan-13,"I'm Lucky that I did not get killed driving the unsafe 2009 Jeep Rubicon they sold me for an over inflated price.

The Sales Manager said this is a Chrysler Certified Per-Owned Vehicle that they spent $2,000 getting it Certified. After numerous break downs and phone calls, I found out it was not a Chrysler Certified Per-Owned Vehicle.

Some of the problems:
Broken rear track bar bracket, axle could fall off and roll over vehicle.
Wheel lug nut where undersized and wheels could have fallen off.
Dislocated rear axle spring.
Rear Sway Bar rubbing through break lines.
Transfer case shifting cable broke first time tried to use it.
Transfer Case is bad and needs to be replaced.
Oil press sending unit was bad.
Bad oil leak.
and a few other items.

The sales manager agreed to give me $3,000 off, then changed it to $2,000 on the contract without telling me. When I found out it was too late.

I got this 2009 Jeep Rubicon about 6 weeks ago, I have not been able to drive it for the past 3 weeks because it's unsafe to drive.

A few weeks after buying this Jeep I found Crown Dodge where running ads $1,000 less than what I had paid for it, I believe this is unlawful along with some other unlawful things they may have done.

I've been back to Crown Dodge over 20 times trying to straighten this out and just get the run around. This jeep has been it their shop 3 times and I have talked to half a dozen people there.

Also tried taking it to another Dealership, They did not want to touch it with all of the problems it has.        

This Dealership Needs to be Shut Down Before Someone Gets Killed!

12180,10-Oct-12,"I was looking to get a 2012-2013 Charger SRT8. I contacted about 10 different dealerships, all with the same details: Give me your best price possible and I will buy a car from you today. Also, see what deal I can get on my 2010 Challenger RT. I was contacted by Richard Schwartz since I posted on the internet. We went back and forth. At once, I thought he was rude through email but its hard to tell if he meant it like the way I took it or not, so I brushed it off. I told him, here is a quote on the best price I have been able to find. Also what the best offer on my car as a trade in. He said, I can beat it, just come down to test drive the car and drive home in it. He said, come as soon as possible since I like to leave early since I have the day off. I said I will be there before 5. I even left early so Richard wouldnt be held back too much longer.

I get there and I notice the car isnt where it has been for the past few months. He said, oh, its been moved. We walked around for 10mins. He said, let me see if its somewhere else. I waited in his office for about 10 more mins and he came in to tell me it had be sold. OK, that happens, not happy, but I understand, you can always get another car. Then I am told the price I showed them wasnt going to happen. That it was a low-ball offer and no dealer could ever do that price. I didnt tell him it was a friends dealership that I have done business with in the past, I just told him and some other manager that I have gotten 10k off previous yr SRT8s. I wasnt even looking for that type of deal. Was told I dont know what Im talking about and Im pretty much smoking crack. 

Then as I am trying to leave and get my keys since they tested out my car to see what shape it was in, another manager told me pretty much teh same thing Richard did. Im a liar, dont know what Im talking about, blah blah blah. Well, Im never doing business there again.

I have been bringing my car there for a yr for service and had very good experiences with them, but after this, I will be driving 30miles somewhere else each time I need an oil changed or any warranty work done on my Challenger.

Another manager did call me to check up and see what the status was and from what she told me, this isnt the first time Richard has done this. If this is true, then why keep someone like that? If you know he is bad, why risk having a customer, like myself, be handled this way?",6,18,-1

12197,21-May-11,"I took my vehicle to Crown Dodge starting in January/2011 after Chrysler instructed me to take it to a Dodge service center if I wanted potential assistance with unresolved issues with the car. The initial problem was in regards to an air injection code that had been in the vehicle since a little over a month after purchasing the used 2005 Dodge Stratus. After a little over a week, I was told that my car needed a new O2 sensor and then after opening it up they found that it also needed a cadillic convertor (spelling?). I agreed to replace these parts and the problem was still not resolved and I was up to about $3,000 in repairs. About a week later my service rep told me that there was a special emissions warranty on the car and that I would have to pay for any of those repairs. My car was at Crown Dodge service center for 6 weeks. During that time I got very few updates on what was going on and I finally let them know I needed to go out of town and needed to know if I would have my car. I was told to pick it up and I drove to Nevada. When I got there, my car had an oil leak and the air pump was still staying on. I had to disconnect my battery every day to keep it from being drained by the pump. I called Sandy (my service rep) the day I arrived and she told me to bring it back when I returned. I remained there for 3 weeks and on my way home the dash was glitching (back defrost turning on and off, radio/clock turning on and off) and about half way home the odometer readings started flickering all over the place. I returned home on Saturday and took the car in Monday. I was told there were 2 oil leaks (cost almost $800) and I got those fixed. They told me the dash was flickering initially but they couldn't repeat it so come get the car and bring it back if it continues. I paid for the oil leaks (3 weeks later) and didn't even sit in my car before noticing the dash was flickering. I left the car and then was told that there was a ground issue and they were having trouble finding where it was coming from. Eventually I was told they found it and that cost me $225.00. After I picked up my car there was a loud noise coming from my engine (it was heard over my radio) and the car was still puttering at slow speeds and stops. I took my car back and Sandy advised me to take it to my mechanic to make sure it wasn't the transmission and to let her know what they say. I did that and then took it to a transmission shop, per my mechanic. They confirmed it was not the transmission and that you could clearly hear the noise form the engine. I called Sandy back and didn't get a return call so called again a few days later. I was instructed to bring my car back in to Crown Dodge, so I did and after a few days they called and told me it was a loud alternator (Sandy was not there and I got a new service advisor, Jeff). I told Jeff that I wanted to follow up with Chrysler because I didn't understand how there was a new issue with the car that wasn't there before. I also asked him about the puttering and her told me it may be a core issue inside the alternator, but they wouldn't know until they replaced it and also asked me to follow up with the service manager, David Weber, about my concerns. I left a message for David and never got a call back. I also called Chrysler and after them speaking to David, they agreed to pay for the alternator. After the repair was done, I picked up the car and to my surprise it was still puttering. I left and immediately called back to Chrysler. I also found that a rodent of some sort had been in my trunk (how I don't know) and chewed up some papers and a piece of the weather strip in my trunk. I called and spoke to Jeff on a Saturday and he asked me to leave a message for David on Monday, which I did and he again didn't call me back. Chrysler got a hold of David regarding the puttering of my car and I was asked to once again bring back my car. I did and now they are telling me it needs 4 new motor mounts and the car isn't puttering. I told Jeff not to touch the car because I wanted to follow up with Chrysler because it didn't make sense to me how it now has another repair that wasn't needed before and how the issue it has had all along that was never fixed, suddenly isn't there. He asked me to call David and I said he doesn't call me back so who else can I call. He said Stewart, a new service manager. I left a message for Stewart that Friday and surprisingly David called me back Monday. I explained to David my concerns about the recommended repairs because each time I bring it back there is something else wrong with it that wasn't there before. All he kept saying was ""you need 4 motor mounts"", over and over again. I told him not to touch my car and I was following up with Chrysler, which I did. My rep from Chrysler called me back after finally getting a hold of David and told me that David said they are recommending I replace the motor mounts, but based on the mileage and year of the car they didn't really have to be replaced and they weren't really worn down that bad. For this reason Chrysler said they couldn't authorize a repair that was ""needed"", which is why I questioned it in the first place. Chrysler has offered to send me to another dealership service center for another look. I picked up my car from Crown Dodge on Monday May 16th and attempted to file a complaint against David Weber and the woman I spoke to attempted to address my concerns by bringing David in to speak to me. This was a big waste of time, David told me good I was going to another dealership and I also let him know I had filed a complaint with the Bureau of Automotive Repairs and he said ""ok, good"". I told him I didn't understand how my car continues to have new problems every time I bring it in and how he didn't return 1 phone call I made to him, except that morning after I left a message for someone else. He just kept shaking his head at me. Then I asked him about the weather strip in the car and he told me to have the new service center access it and call Chrysler. I said ""so Chrysler is responsible for damages that happened to my car while at your service station?"" and he said ""yes"". I said that doesn't make sense, how are they responsible for damages that happened at your service station and David said because a rat couldn't get in my trunk. I said I don't know how it happened, but the damage happened while it was at his service station and he told me to call my insurance company and file a claim. I said, ok, so now my insurance is responsible for the damages and he said yes. I said that doesn't make any sense, the damage happened at your service center and he said ""I don't know what to tell you, it's an insurance issues. I told him he didn't make any sense and I needed my key. I was told it was in my car and he walked away. I continued to express my concerns with the 2 women at the counter and 1 informed me that David and another guy looked at my trunk and said it was normal wear and tear and a rodent didn't do it. I showed her the pictures I took before I cleaned the trunk (to make sure a rodent wasn't still in there) and a pillow case with the stuff that was chewed on was in my trunk for them to see (I don't know if David ever looked at it). In total I was without my car for about 13 weeks and was never offered a rental car, except for 1 weekend when I was dropped off to get my ""fixed"" car and had to leave it there for continued issues. I am insulted by David's lack of returning any of my calls to him and his response to any of the concerns I presented to him and my service reps. My car is still not fixed and I have to take it to another service center this upcoming week.   ",6,18,-1

12344,19-Jun-19,"After extensive correspondence back and forth with their Online Sales representative, I thought the final price was settled and agreed upon. Originally the sales person quoted me at $923 for DMV fees, which meant they were calculating this 60k truck as if it cost over 150k. I thought this was insane so I used the DMV calculator from the official DMV website to double check and they were indeed up-charging like crazy.  I let him know that as a non-resident, active duty military I would be waved from some fees. Salesman came back with $110 for DMV fees. Sounded good.  When I visited the dealership and it was time to sign all the documents with their finance guy, they changed the sales tax because it was ""miscalculated"". Even though the salesman acknowledged my zip code multiple times in our emails. This I could accept because I didn’t expect them to pay it for me. I signed all the documents and called it a day. About 3 weeks later I get a text from the same finance guy demanding an additional $338 for DMV fees, after going back and forth trying to understand why I would absorb their mistakes, he threatens me with his office manager calling my commanding officer to collect the money. This is incredibly illegal and plain unethical and unprofessional. I then resulted to having the Base Legal Office get involved and rectify. Ultimately, after Legal got involved they accepted their own mistakes.

Of course he had never heard of it but would look into it. I returned to get my Jeep. They had detailed my Jeep but the scratches were still there. I was told to go out to the waiting room and they would bring my Jeep up in a couple of minutes. I waited over 30 minutes  for them to bring my car to me. They told me there were cars in front of it that they would have to move. In reality, my car was next door in an overflow lot and they didn’t know it. I had one of the service personnel come up to me in the waiting room to inform me of this and that he needed to  see my paperwork to retrieve a service number. Finally my Jeep was delivered. No a fan of this service dept.,  they say one thing to keep you happy but I would prefer it they were up front and told me what was really happening.  ",6,18,-1

Check engine light on for evap leak, said it was under warranty. When I picked it up, paperwork said ESIM Switch and gasket replaced, cust declined repairs on purge valve. ???? What??? Clunking noise was caused because a software update is needed, cust declined repairs. What????  One concern was not even addressed at all. Complete waste of time going there.

The dealer failed to gain my approval prior to repair. Never called me when car was ready for pick up. Left messages to check in vehicle with no return call. Finally told I could pick up, 5 days later. Arrived at dealer and was surprised by the cost of the repair and the claim on their document that I verbally approved them via a phone call that never occurred. Then I was told that the car was fixed 3 days earlier and that they called to let us know. Which they did not. Service desk personnel were uninterested in taking responsibility for our concerns.

Was immediately greeted out front and was told to hang tight while Mike the service technician plugged into my vehicle to get all the current information( this was the only pleasant experience I had). I was then ushered to the front desk where I exchanged information with another individual who told me it would be about a hour and forty minute wait as today was a busy day. It ended up being a 3 hour wait to service a vehicle with under 5,000 miles. This cost me to miss significant time at work as I had to now drive back to the city of Carson in rush hour traffic. 

This is not the first bad experience I've had with this place. I had a similar experience when purchasing the vehicle. After getting the ""Deal"" done I was cast to the waiting area where I was told my vehicle would be out shortly. An hour and a half later i was finally brought my new purchase and told they had sold a lot of vehicles that day and again were backed up.

I called back Dave or David answer I said I needed to know the status of my Jeep and he said I have like 100 of those.  So I gave him my name he said there wasn’t any notes that he didn’t know what to tell me. I said I needed to speak to Lana that way I know if I go home or not and of course Lana wasn’t at her desk again. Dave goes and tells me just home then.

12429,15-Nov-18,"I had been looking around for the new 2019 Ram Rebel and on a RAM truck message forum (5thgenrams.com), I was referred to Max B as another local forum member just picked up a Laramie trim from Max.

This dealership had tons of Rebels compared to other dealers who had little to none. So I figured they have the most inventory means they know how to get one for me??

So I call Max B. and introduce myself and tell him that I was referred by a forum member.

1st red flag - Max did not care about the referral or his deal - he just wanted to sell me a truck. Max was offended when I told him that of the 35 Ram Rebels in stock that I could not pick one.

So he asks some questions and I give him answers.
I offered to send a build sheet from the Ram website so that he can look for an incoming Rebel that met my needs. 
I email him my build sheet and he calls back and starts to ask questions on package options and such.

2nd red flag - Max arrogantly states that a 3.6L engine (base) can not be had on a Rebel and never will be. That was a lie - there were a couple of 3.6L Rebels popping up in San Diego and Lake Elsinore using the Ram truck locator.  I could tell Max wanted me to just take a truck off their lot and forgo looking for a 3.6L engine.  I felt that Max was lazy and didn't want to pick up his fingers to locate an incoming or find a factory order D1 or KZ status.

3rd red flag - Max says why get a V6 engine when a REAL MAN drives a V8 Hemi. I try to explain that I am not going to haul, not going to tow, and need the truck as a daily driver. 

Max making that sexist remark is unheard of these days unless he came from a trailer trash area of Georgia.

4th red flag - Max would not tell me which is more affordable to lease on a Rebel when we started to talk about numbers.  He just said he has no idea about residuals and money factors.  Huge mistake - all salespeople are taught to give out base numbers when a customers asks - how do they close a customer ???

5th red flag - Max laughs at me when I try to change over to a Big Horn trim with a 3.6L engine and says that a special order will take 6-8 weeks. That was a lie - there were tons of dealers receiving Big Horns with base 3.6L engines. As a matter of fact I just test drove the Big Horn at an Anaheim dealer 2 weeks prior.

6th red flag - When asked about special ordering, Max immediately changed his superior attitude to that of condescending.  Max did not want to do a special order because it means he would have to work.  I could tell Max wanted to sell a truck to me now - not in 6-8 weeks for a special order.  How a car dealership survives without having some of their sales on a custom order is beyond me.

Do NOT do business with this person or dealer - he will lie thru his teeth to get you into any car they have.  
Max lacks basic customer service skills, no knowledge of financial numbers, will berate you if you want a special order, and make sexist remarks.  
Beware females who are independent - Max will rub you the wrong way as he did to me.",6,19,-1

12455,20-Aug-18,"I originally brought my truck in for a full flash of all the modules and specifically told the service writer and the tech that called I wanted everything updated and flashed.  I was having issues with my fan blower and when I picked my truck up I was told only the power control module was updated and flashed.  When I asked why wasn’t everything flashed as I asked and was written in the order I was told that was all I needed.  

The flash did not solve my problem and when I returned I was told they could flash everything but it wasn’t necessary because only the pcm controller the blower.  I told the service writer to again update and flash everything and was told “That’s a lot more work” and that I would be charged again.  When I asked if that was why they didn’t do it in the first place I felt like I was treated dismissively and I was not given an answer.  I asked for some consideration because the service was not done as I asked and the service writer was kind enough to only charge me 2/3 the price of the original price.  The flash did work and I now have a working truck but a total disregard for the service writer and dealership.  I would recommend going to another dealer and avoiding Orange Coast for service.

She gave me a ticket and said go to Kelsey’s desk. Kelsey did not wear a name tag, nor is her desk marked, so how am i to know who Kelsey is? She checked me in and said the wait would be no longer than 1.5 hours for an oil change. After two hours of waiting, i went to her desk. No one acknowledged my existence while i waited for Kelsey. I had to ask someone where she was and found out she went home for the day. Sure enough, my car was done, but no one let me know! I had somewhere to be after my appointment and didn’t make it there, unfortunately. No one was really friendly and didn’t seem like they enjoyed their job. It was kind of a downer to be there.

 In addition, i called 4 times to move my appointment back by 20 minutes and got hung up on every single time. So irritating!

12512,02-May-18,"Where do I begin? Saw a sweet online price to get me in, wanted to purchase the vehicle too. After reading all of these great reviews of this dealership I was hoping to have a good day.  I dealt with Max, seems very friendly at first and was quick to write you up for the advertised price to make you happy, but after a while he makes you feel as if your wasting his time and was very condescending. 

After going back to the finance guy, they sneak a lot of things to add up the cost which I did not want, was not negotiated and he was not willing to take off. Also he was not aware of the price that was negotiated upfront. Somehow they were trying to sell me the vehicle at two different prices and clearly not on the same page in the upfront price with Max. I saw the red flag in their fishy process and all they were doing is playing games to con me. The nice discounted price disappeared. All he did was lower my monthly to make me happy since they did not budge on the net cost, but up their interest rate to 8.9%!!  I have excellent credit and should not pay their outrageous rates! As I was walking out, customers were upset in the waiting area. I am just glad I left and purchased elsewhere.

12521,11-Apr-18,"I FILED WITH THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU AND FEDERAL REGULATORS THESE PEOPLE ARE SO BAD. NO JOKE- BUY FROM ANY OTHER DEALER...Spoke to the CFO Armina Mgerian- she is fully aware of their illegal sales tactics and has no interest in discussing any of it because they have numerous complaints against them already and people still buy cars from them- her basic response ""what you gonna do about it""... BUYER BEWARE...Wow. Just wow. Worst experience ever. they did a bait and switch on the APR. Told me I should qualify for 3% interest on the loan. I agreed to come drive the car. I agrree to buy it and work out my trade in. Everythings great so far. Then after he runs my credit he LIES and says I don't qualify for ANY purchase loan and cannot buy the car. BUT he can offer me a lease a 8%... bait and switch. BUT it gets worse. I decline and leave... and sure enough the next day a DIFFERENT salesman contacts me and states he CAN get me the 3%. I respond anything over is unacceptable, but if you can really get me under 4%, I'll still buy the car. He comes back and offers 5.5%... They had my credit history PRIOR to running my credit. Then told me 3%. Then no deal but a horrible lease deal. Then magically the next day he can't swing 3% but can get me a loan for 5.5%. How does it go the night before from NO DEAL you are screwed... to 5.5 % the next day? How? Because they commit lender fraud and try and make you love the car, commit to buy, then state the only deal they can give you is HORRIBLE. IF you won't take the bad lease, they will send you home. Then they finally make a REAL effort for the loan, you grab the 5.5% and they get a kick back from the lender. I'm contacting Chrysler, the state of CA, the BBB and speaking with an attorney. I was smart and got the entire exchange in writing via email and the attorney confirmed they did a blantant bait and switch. Buyer beware and do ALL negotiating via email.

12638,15-Oct-14,"Stay away from these guys, COMPLETE DIRT BAGS!!!! My problem started over a month ago when I contacted these guys about a new Jeep Rubicon X. I was emailed back by a sales person named Garrett. He informed me he could give me 1k off sticker. I politley thanked him and said, I could get at least 3k off sticker at several other dealerships, at which point he became beligerant and typed back in all CAPS. I have purchased 4 different vehciles from this dealership in the past and forwarded his emails to the owner of Orange Coast, Jon Gray. I had his email from him thaking me for my prior purchases. Mr. Gray responded back saying that Garret's conduct was unprofessional and said that it was not indicative of his employees attitudes. I accepted his apology and he got me in touch with a new ""Salesperson"" named Ken. Ken assured me that I would be getting 4k off the sticker of the vehicle to make up for the service, which I thought was great.

It started out just fine. I was going to use OC Motorsports to build the jeep and we were going to wrap some of the cost of the lift into the financing. It took almost 2 weeks for the lift and pricing to be finalized through OC motorsports (Partly my fault since we priced out several different suspension packages). During that time they sold the vehicle they had quoted me on. When I inquired when they could get me another, Ken said yes, but now my discount would only be 2k as it was a new model year (Had I known that I would have been down at the dealership day one). The classic 1990's used car salesman bait and switch!!!! At this point I wasn't happy,  but I wanted to see where the numbers landed. Ken had all of a sudden dissapeared and wouldnt return my emails. After my third email he ""Apologized"" that he had been busy with end of the month (Like he couldnt shoot me a 2 line email letting me know that"" and said he would have my numbers shortly. 

Two days later I get an email, not from Ken, but from the original rude and inept sales person ""Garrett"". There was nothing written in the body of the email, just a screen shot of their computer screen showing a montlhy payment that was $140 higher a month with an additional $1500 down payment. Ken didnt even have the decency to send the email himself to explain why the down payment and monthly payment was substantially higher. This is one of the most unprofessional, classless transactions I have ever been a part of!

I have purchased over 23 new vehicles since 1994. I have never been treated with such contempt or indifference. I have purchased 4 different vehicles from this dealership, so to say I have been loyal to them is an understatement. I bought my 2014 Grand Cherokee SRT8 from Poway Jeep because Orange Coast wouldnt return my emails in a timley manner (Never contacted the owner on this issue). This dealerships service and employees are sub par and define why the general public cant stand the buying process. Buyer beware, absolutley an untrustworthy dealership!!!!!!!!!!",6,19,-1

12641,07-Apr-14,"After several test drives of 09 Mazda5 at 4 other dealers, I went to Orange Coast Chrysler Jeep Dodge dealer to test drive one that they had advertised.  I spoke with the Sales Manager-Howard.  I explained to him that the price was fair but that I had seen another for approximately $400.00 less.  I told him that if he was willing to match it and address a ""check tire"" light and a grinding sound that I believed to be a suspension issue, then I would buy the car.  Howard explained to me that all their used cars have been inspected and are approved to be sold.  Nonetheless, he agreed to have the car looked at by the local Mazda dealer.  He specifically told me that a Mazda Mechanic would drive the car and make the repairs needed to correct the problem.  The following day I called Howard to confirm that the car had been repaired.  Howard told me that the car was still at the Mazda dealer but that it should be ready by the time I arrived.  Eventually I picked up the car.  About 15 minutes into my drive home the check engine light went on.  I immediately called Howard to inform him about the light (upon getting of the freeway I started to notice the sound in the suspension).  Howard told me that the car had been checked out and driven by the Mazda mechanic and that ""Leonard"" from the Mazda dealer told him that they had rectified the problem.  Howard told me that he would call me later to give me instructions as to what to do to have the problem addressed.  The next day I called Howard at the Mazda dealer following Howard's instructions.  Leonard told me that he was never told to test drive the car.  Furthermore, he told me that he was simply told to reset the computer in the car.  I relayed this information to Howard.  All he could say was that there must have been some sort of miscommunication.  Initially Howard agreed to correct the problems but then told me that he had given me such a great price that he didn't know if they had room to pay for the repairs.  I told Howard that I was willing to have the car inspected by my regular mechanic because I felt his prices would be more reasonable than that of the Mazda dealer.  After talking to his used car Manager Howard agreed.  My Mechanic inspected the car and wrote and estimate of the repairs.  Howard agreed that the repair cost was fair and would get back to me to arrange repairs.  The next day Howard told me they were only obligated to make repairs to the light issue because it was a safety issue.  Repairs to the suspension would be my problem.  I explained to Howard that quite frankly that was mildly interesting to me.  He had told me that the repairs had been done prior to picking up the car; Howard clearly lied.  Howard told me that they were willing to pay $200 to repair the problem with the light or to spend it any way I wished to.  He also gave me the option of returning the car back.  I told him I would call him back the next day with my decision.  The next day I told him I was returning the car.  Howard then told me that was not an option.  I told Howard we would be resolving the cost in court.  Howard told me that they have their attorneys ready for court.  A day or so later Howard called me willing to pay me $600 (total cost was $643.27) for the repairs. I paid for the repairs up front just as they asked me to and faxed them a copy of the bill.  I asked him to call me to confirm that he received the fax.  He did not.  I asked Howard assured me that the check would be sent that same day first class mail.  Thirteen days later and after several calls and voice mails, no check.  I eventually called Orange Coast (accounts payable) to inquire about the check.  They were quick to address my concerns and I informed me that the check had been sent out to my mechanic.  Clearly the miscommunication  and deception from the ""Sales Manager"" need to be addressed.  Howard at Orange Coast Chrysler Jeep Dodge is the epitome of a car salesman.  ",6,19,0

12669,27-Mar-12,"I purchased a 2011 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon in November of 2011. After two months had passed I still had not recieved registration, tags, or a license plate.  When I called in February to find out what was happening I was told that November was a busy month and not to worry, my license and tags would be coming. When March arrived I called again and  was told to talk to Alicia the DMV girl but every phone call to her resulted in a message on her machine and not one time in a weeks period did I receive a return call. In complete frustration I went to the DMV and was informed that the car was owned by a woman and they would not give me her name. The next day I called to the dealership and  was unable to get David Reed, Alicia or Brian Cole to answer there phones. When I asked to be transferred to the General Manager Pete Shaver the operator patched me in on his cell phone and I told him my worries and that I needed to find out who owned my car, that I had already paid over 35,000 dollars for. When he called me back the following day he said the DMV girl had accidently sent the pink slip to the woman who they had repossesed the car from.  He assured me that going to the DMV in two weeks he would straighten out the problem. After two more weeks I attempted to find out the situation and was told it might be easier for me to just go the DMV myself and take care of it. But then Pete Shaver said if I wanted he would at least get me the license plates. Well now it is March 27 and I finally recieved my pink slip,registration, tags but still no license plate even tho my pink and registration have a plate number on them. When I attempted to contact them again the exact same thing, message machine and no return calls, when I called the Jeep factory complaint line I was told to go to the DMV  myself and report the plates stolen and just get new plates myself, of course at my own cost. The amazing thing is that Jeep themselves don't care and told me there was nothing they could do and they did not want to talk to Orange Coast Jeep about this. I am wondering if there is some sort of legal issues involving this dealership and the rules of business involving the DMV. I am sure this letter will just be removed and discarded, because not one person I have talked to at this dealership or at the Jeep factory has ever wanted to actually do the job they are paid to do. I can promise you I will never buy another Jeep from any dealer, I am 55 years old and have bought many cars, Toyota, Ford, Chevrolet, and others and I have never experienced anything as horrible as the experience at this dealer.

12693,04-Feb-11,"Brought our 2001 Dodge Intrepid here for service several days ago because the check engine light was on.  They found several pressure leaks and repaired same for 1,000.00.  
The day we picked up the car, I got a call from their service manager asking me to return the car because they may have forgotten to check something. So, they let us drive the car away without verifying that it had been completely repaired.  In the meantime, my wife called me to tell me that the car was running very badly now.  We did not have this problem before taking it in for the engine light; the car has always run beautifully.
We left the car all day again.  They called me and told me that they had fixed the problem, apologized profusely, and told me that there would be no charge.  I picked up the car and everything seemed fine.  The next day, the check engine light was back on, and the car stalled in an intersection and kept stalling every time I started it.  I had it towed back to the dealer and left it there for the 3rd time.  

The car is now having problems that it did not have when I took it to them in the first place.  They don't really seem to know what they are doing.",6,19,184
12714,30-Dec-10,"I bought my car at this location -- horrible experience -- my recommendation is to never, ever do business with this dealer.  I received the worst service at this company.  This firm refused to secure my car after it flooded and I was waiting for Jeep to determine if they would cover the defect in the windshield that caused 3 inches of rain to puddle in my car. (This event follows several other instances of  of replacing the same parts repeatedly due to other defects -- which were very costly).  I had to demand that the Customer Service Manager secure the car so that no further damage would occur -- and only after I told him his firm would be legally liable did he take action to secure the car from further damage.  When I asked to speak to the General Manager, the Customer Service Manager refused to transfer the call, stating that the GM was was out of town (I had already confirmed that the GM was onsite that day with the front desk staff). 

When I finally spoke with the GM, he was very condescending when I requested answers as to why I had been given poor service and poor treatment -- he stated that the firm had been in business 30 years and I keep coming back so they must be doing something right.  Are you kidding me???!  I'm not here paying for rental cars (repeatedly) and paying for repairs of obvious defects because I want to -- I expected a higher level of customer service since they sold me the car.  The GM told me to go somewhere else!  Unbelievable!!!  In my opinion this firm should not be in business.  ",6,19,-1
12715,16-Sep-10,"Summary: This dealer employs rude, arrogant service managers who blatantly attempt to take advantage of female customers and their perceived naivete.  This is also the most expensive C/D/J dealer I've ever visited, and I've used at least five throughout California.

The first time I visited this dealer, I was shopping for a Jeep.  The saleswoman thought that the best way to sell me on a Jeep was to take me for a test drive and then turn donuts in a local parking lot.  I left, convinced she was insane.  

The second time I visited, several years later, I had had my Jeep towed in because of a dead battery (jumping wouldn't start it).  The dealer sold me a battery for close to $300.  I had no choice but to purchase, as my truck wouldn't start.  The whole time, the service manager was conversing with his cronies and barely looking at me as he shoved paperwork at me to sign.  I was asking questions about my car's behavior and getting vague, ""you're a woman and wouldn't understand"" answers.  

The third time and fourth times I visited (failed LED lamp and transmission flush), the quoted prices were OBSCENELY high compared to either Pep Boys or other dealers.  I also got the same jerk as my service manager.  Although I no longer live in LA, tomorrow I'm driving 50 miles back to Buerge Jeep who will do the transmission flush for $100 less than Orange Coast. Unbelievable and unfortunate that Orange County lacks a respectable or even remotely competitive C/D/J dealer (Tuttle Click isn't any better).",6,19,-1

Got to dealership, said it would be 120.  1 hour later Brian Koritzer in service calls to tell me my vehicle cannot be aligned.  Brian said inner/outer tie rods were busted and needed a new wheel and tire, cost would be roughly 1450.  I said not to do any work I would need a second opinion.  

Got to dealership and i still had to pay the price of the alignment that was now listed as an ""inspection fee"" I pointed out the FREE inspection sign and it fell on deaf ears.  Forced to pay the 120 and brought car to Firestone.  Firestone aligned the vehicle and has been operating fine ever since.  I have lifetime maintenance and alignment with Firestone for around 160 bucks, one time fee.  They said there was NO damage to tie rods and wheels were scuffed, not destroyed.

I reiterated that I was interested in the red vehicle specified in my online inquiry and asked Adam to send me the exact out the door price, as I intended to purchase the vehicle using cash. Adam texted me the cost breakdown and I called him to confirm, as I would need to drive approximately three hours to get to Gilroy, CA.

When I arrived, Adam did not make any attempt to come out and introduce himself. Shortly after driving the vehicle, I was told that my vehicle is more expensive than what I’d been quoted, and that the quote I was given was for a grey vehicle. I had fallen victim to a bait-and-switch and ended up driving over three hours for no reason.

I would also like to add that I have never purchased a vehicle at this low of a price point. I’ve negotiated deals with BMW, Porsche, Lamborghini, Rolls Royce and have never been treated this way. I don’t have much experience working with the lower end dealers and find it disgusting that they treat their customers the way I have been treated.

12731,20-Nov-19,"When coming to a deal on the price for a vehicle I was going to lease from this dealership, one of the things that was instrumental in my agreeing to the price they quoted me, was that i was told the vehicle and the lease terms would qualify me to be able to claim the CA Clean Vehicle Rebate (CVRP).

However after they had told me multiple times during the negotiations, including answering affirmatively when i directly asked them before signing, I found out later that in fact the lease did not qualify. 

Attempting to contact the dealership about this resulted in long strings of being ignored, given a run around, and  being told they would get back to us soon then they never did, over and over. 

At this point they have not in any way attempted to reconcile after their sales team lied to us. If they would at least work with us to reconcile the situation I would assume it was a misunderstanding and be glad to work with them.

12755,28-Jan-19,"Giving one star because the price was good but that's it. Here are all the reasons why I would not recommend this dealership:

- brand new Jeep Compass was not ready when we had agreed I would be there, despite me sending all of my insurance, driver's license info, credit card number, and copy of a $13,909 cashier's check two days ahead of time
- when I arrived I was told I had the wrong day, despite showing emails and text message correspondence that had confirmed December 26 at 10 am
- when my father inquired about the delay (because I needed a ride there), he was told, ""if she doesn't like waiting, she can just leave""
- when I was signing paperwork, the DMV document noted a ""lienholder"" as Chrysler Financing, when I was paying cash for the vehicle. When I pointed this out to Willie Pettaway, he said it was okay to sign it. I crossed it out and initialed the lienholder and he said he needed to redo the entire form because it was a legally binding document."" So it was okay for me to sign an inaccurate legally binding document that claimed Chrysler Financing was the lienholder but not okay for me to cross that out (because it was wrong) and initial it...??????
- purchased a brand new vehicle and it was not clean, and they only gave me a half tank of gasoline (see photos of 63 miles on a new car and only 1/8 of a tank left on Yelp site)
- sent me a text message with a link to the video to explain my new purchase - the link didn't work; emailed three more times and got no response - it finally took another general manager to intervene (see pictures added on Yelp site)
- one of the ""general managers,"" Bob Mann, called me personally and said that, based on what I reported to him, he was going to fire his finance guy for incompetence, then called back to tell me I'd be getting an email apology (that never happened)
- I emailed Scott DePeralta three times to ask for the regional manager and his/her contact info - he never responded
- at one point, Scott emailed me and said I could just bring the car back, but the sad thing was that I couldn't because I had already used a $500 rebate that could not be transferred to another dealership
- I finally found a regional manager named Piyom Ghavimi who said he would assist - forwarded all emails to him and never heard back

I called Browning Grimmett the day before I planned to come in to see a used Hyundai Accent and we agreed upon a 1pm appointment. He asked me to call him again once I was on my way, which I did. Only then did he mention that the dealership would be closing early that day. He told me it was closing at 3pm, when I arrived I discovered it was actually closing at 2pm. After an hour drive, he was completely unprepared to show the vehicle I indicated. In fact I had to remind him which car it was. It was in their sister dealership in Morgan Hill. After wasting 45 minutes to go retrieve the vehicle, we got through paperwork only to be told that we would need to come back the following day to finish financing. Though upset that at this, we agreed, and he said he would meet with us at 11:30am the next day. When we arrived at the agreed upon time, Browning was nowhere to be found. Only after waiting for 15 minutes did we discover he had not come in at all. Tony Truong abruptly came up to me, asking for my insurance documents without any greeting, and did not introduce himself to me until prompted by the fact I was clearly confused. I was then called ""distraught"" when I expressed my uneasiness at not being informed of what was happening. At this point a gentleman who did not give me his name began to intervene. He told me he didn't know what I wanted him to do. I asked if there was any price negotiation that could happen because of how much we had been inconvenienced and said that it does not instill a lot of confidence in me to make such a big purchase when I am being told so many different things. I was responded to in a very defensive, blame shifting manner, trying to make it seem as if it was my fault communication had not been clear.

After the purchase of Jeep Cherokee Limited last weekend I received the Thank You email from the GM of this dealership. The email states ""You may be receiving a questionnaire from Jeep soon. If you cannot give us a completely satisfied rating for any reason, please call me so we can better serve you as our valued customer"". I responded to the GM’s email and tried directly contacting him to discuss issues and to offer suggestions, instead he directed the sales person to contact me though I wanted to talk to the GM per his email. I find it absurd that despite the GM’s original email he was not accessible and he did not even respond to my several email requests which shows his lack of commitment. Apparently he might come up with the excuse that he had no time and was too busy.

Both the Sales person and Finance Manager were courteous. But I observed during the purchase that the sales person pleads to the customers to give the dealer 10 out of 10 rating when the survey is received so that the he and others can receive bonus. This practice appears to be unethical leading to misleading rating for this dealership. I believe the rating should be transparent without any influence. Apparently his focus was to get him bonus from my purchase that also seems evident from his text message.

I went to the dealer after the Sales person sent me an email with out-the-door price for the Cherokee Limited that I wanted, but during the paperwork in his office for the same SUV he said that I will have to pay $1000 more if I refinance with 0% which shocked me because he did not state so in his email and my preference was to get this refinance but I could not. Also, during the price agreement paperwork with the Sales person in his office he did not go over the option of the cooling-off period which I find misleading.

It saves everyone time and saliva from speaking and negotiating so much.  They won't deal with you via email because of ""high demands"".  More very old sales car tactics to bring you in.  Lets go back to that, high demands.  In this pandemic where many dealers are closed, lots are overfilled with unsold merchandise, and cars still on cargo ships where they are not unloaded because there's no room on any lots.  Sure looks like there is more inventory than demand.

Then they do the most irresponsible thing and maintain their old car sales tactics by bringing you in when we're in a pandemic and are in a shelter in place.  That is irresponsible on their behalf and comes to show they are more interested in profits than people's health.  I will not bring my wife and I to simply negotiate and possibly get sick.  We can do negotiations via email or telephone, then when we come to a price we both agree to, then we can come in and sign papers with minimal exposure.  Even my last two car purchases way before the pandemic allowed this (Lexus and Tesla).

I would avoid this dealer and if this is tactic is across the board, go to a different manufacturer that actually cares about people and willing to adapt and negotiate online or over the phone.

13260,10-Apr-20,"**UPDATE**
I hate to do this, but they (HB Chrysler Dodge Jeep RAM) got me. If it sounds too good to be true, with this dealership it probably is... I thought I wasn't getting scammed, but they just waited a week to start twisting everything around. 

First, was the chip in the windshield that they told me would get taken care of and replaced.  A month later, it still hasnt been taken care of.
Then I was given a copy of a clean Carfax, but I got home that night and noticed a basketball size dent in my bumper. I did not hit anything, and after telling the dealer about it, they reviewed their security footage and I was told they are ""not required to disclose damages unless they are a safety concern."" And that's not all...

A few weeks later, I was called back in for a better deal with a better bank and I need to come in to sign the papers or I'd lose my loan. I thought my current loan was decent, but better? Ok, I didn't think I was lied to yet, of course I'll come sign for a better deal. I get into financing and this time it's a paper contract (the first time it was all electronic and I was given a USB with all the files.) The finance manager has every paper stacked on top of one another covering the tops of the pages and only exposing the signature lines because ""the documents are all the same as before, only the finance company changed and we got you a better APR and monthly payment."" 

My original contract: 17.63% APR $368 monthly
My ""better deal"" contract: 22.89% APR $428.67 monthly

I purchased the truck for $11,500 and brought enough to pay off the truck that day. The finance manager told me if I want to build my credit get financing and just put money down. So I put $6,000 down in cash and was led to believe (all the way through driving off the lot) my financing was only for $5,500 +tax and license.  
 
I bought my first new truck from this place 20 years ago and I remember how comfortable and confident I was with all the decisions being made. It was the best vehicle purchase I ever made. When I went back to buy another truck last month, they gave me that feeling all over again. However, Huntington Beach Chrysler Dodge Jeep RAM aka Surf City Auto is not a dealership to be trusted. It's full of con-artists, cheats, and the epitome of used car salesmen.  

Original post: Let me start by saying this dealership has restored my faith in used car salesmen (at least the ones at Huntington Beach Chrysler Dodge Jeep RAM.) I was greeted by Victor, he was friendly and knowledgeable. I told him what I wanted, what I was spending and he found a truck better and still in my price range. Then I met Johnny and he was very straightforward, a ""no BS"" type of guy. There were no up sales, no ""bait and hook"", just a straight forward professionally ran business. I definitely recommend and will refer business to these guys anytime I can. A million thanks to Victor and Johnny and the guys at Huntington Beach Chrysler Dodge Jeep RAM!",6,19,255

All dealers do this to some extent but this place seems to take pride in screwing the customer.

13283,09-Oct-19,"Get ready for a fight, or they will take you to the cleaners!

Found a 2018 Ram 2500 4x4 for a great price here while searching on the internet. I live about 6 hours away from Huntington Beach but this price was about $4k cheaper than everywhere else I could find this particular truck. I called the dealer, spoke with a Bryan and confirmed the price. I asked if there would be any surprise add-ons and he promised me that was the price I would get. I told him I was already approved for the loan and he said that was great!

My wife and I took the next day off, drove 6 hours, and got a hotel room so we could be at the dealer in the morning. This seemed like a good idea to save $4k. 

We went inside, asked for Bryan, he wasn't there but there was another nice kid who would be happy to help us. I told them I didn't want to cut Bryan out of his commission, they said no worries, he would still get it. 

We sat down with new kid. First thing he tells us is there will be an additional $4,000 for Theft Protection GPS, Surface Coating, and Service Contract. (All Optional in final contract, but I was told this is the only way I was getting that internet price.) Additionally, they insisted I used their financing even though I came in with a pre-approved loan. Their loan had an APR that was 3.4% higher than mine. They said I could refinance after 3 months. I said that would cost me three payments of nearly pure interest and they looked at me like I was crazy.

I said no way, I didn't ask for or want any of that crap. All I wanted was the price I was promised before I drove 6 hours and rented a hotel room. 

We fought all day. We left no less than three times. First time I left was because they didn't even have the truck there, I told them I didn't even want to talk to them anymore until they produced the truck so I could test drive it. We went to the beach and walked around with our feet in the ocean until they called us back and said they had the truck. 

After the test drive the fighting continued. All I wanted was the price I was promised and they told me I was being unreasonable. The manager said ""Okay, I can't earn everyone's business"", and walked away. We left, they ran us down in the parking lot and said they would come down by $1,750, but I still had to use their financing. I said no, they walked away. We drove off. 

We got about 5 minutes away and they called. This guy said he was the GM and he didn't want to loose my business because of financing. He said I could use my financing and take off a total of $2,300. We decided this is close enough and we took the deal. I know we could have nickle dimed them down some more, but it was getting late and we still had to drive 6 hours to get home. 

Now, this may be knit picking, but these guys got me on Yelp for the first time, so here we go...

After the the papers were signed, we waited a long time for the truck to be back from detailing. We were walking around the truck and my wife noticed a 2"" gash in the paint right on the edge of the front wheel well. I can't believe we didn't notice this before, and we had already signed. (Not really a deal breaker anyway.) I went inside and had the GM come out and look at the gash to see if there was anything they could do. ""Sorry man, AS-IS..."" and basically walked away. I thought, ""Really? Brand new car and I get AS-IS treatment?"" Still not a deal breaker, I can fix this anyways.

We were waiting some more, they couldn't find the rubber floor mats that were included or the spare key. They never found the mats, said they would be ordered and shipped. While waiting the same GM asked me to leave them a good review on Yelp and I said I would. I hope he didn't mean favorable, cause I would have said no.

This was an awful experience. This isn't my first time buying a vehicle, but I have never felt like I was dealing with such a crooked dealership. I left two stars because after a day of fighting and headache, we still got the truck cheaper than I could find it listed anywhere else in a 500 mile web search.

If you're up for a fight, got a day to burn, and don't mind walking out a few times to get what you were promised, then you might not mind buying a car here. Just don't travel a long distance and expect them to be upfront about pricing before you get there. All promises are out the window once you sit down with sales person.

I doubt I'll ever see those floor mats...

I told him if he can put it in writing that he can give me the advertised price on their website plus tax and license I would do the 2 hour drive from northern los angeles to Huntington beach. He keeps telling me I have to come down. I was not going to waste 2 hours of my life driving just to get there for them to bait and switch me. If they don't have anything to hide and that pricing is true, why couldn't they spend 5 minutes if that to write me a formal quote? I guess they did have something to hide if they repeatedly refuse to send me a quote. consumers please beware, this dealership advertises low prices to get people in the door but won't prove it in writing. I will be taking my business elsewhere.",6,19,222
13288,10-Sep-19,"Too bad I had not read the reviews on this dealership well before wasting my time, gas & effort. Just reading the past 30 days of 1 star negative reviews sum up allot of how this illegitimate place works. Nothing but lies after lies well before you get into this dealership and then they continue when you arrive with the “Bait & Switch” tactics along with more lies. My opinion is that they need to be investigated & shut down for good.

I initially made contact with supposed salesman Androw Mansour on a RAM truck & was told the truck was available. I informed Androw that I lived in Hawaii & that I would be paying cash. He told me that they do not take cash or deposits on vehicles. He also said he worked in finance. I had been conversing with Androw for four days ensuring the truck was available & he confirmed it was. I called Androw on a Sunday & I asked him to please text me by the end of Monday night on the availability of the vehicle. I indicated to him that I would be flying all day & arriving late Monday night & would not be able to receive messages during my flight. I also made sure that he understood that I was driving to the dealership early Tuesday morning from San Diego to Huntington Beach.
   
Androw never contacted me on status and availability on Monday night as he said he would so I called him early morning Tuesday & he enthusiastically said “yes, the truck was still there”. So we started our 77 mile trip all the way to Huntington Beach. We were about 12 miles from the dealership when Androw called & said you’re not going to believe this and that the truck was just sold 10 minutes ago. He said however that there were 2 other trucks available, a Black & White one with the exact same features.

Not believing Androw, when I arrived at the dealership I immediately asked for the desk manager whose name is Jock. I inquired about the vehicle status that I came out to see & was told that it had been actually sold the day before. One of the other sales man Andy did a tracker on the truck and located it in Los Angeles. So I told Jock the desk manager that I had driven all the way from San Diego for this truck. Jock replied that they are the #1 sales dealership in the country & vehicles are continuously being sold. So I told him that this is what every dealership says which is a bunch of B.S. I also told him what he didn’t know and that was if the truck indeed had been sold the day before then why would your salesman Androw lie to me just over an hour ago & tell me that the truck was there. Jock’s reply was that he was going to have a talk with Androw.
 
When I asked Jock about the supposed Black & White trucks that Androw said were available, he then directed salesman Andy to look them up. Sure enough there were no trucks that Androw could produce however there were trucks at a higher price. So I asked Andy to get a hold of Androw & ask him where are these supposed trucks that he indicated on the phone that were available. Andy left & later came back & said he cannot find Androw. So I said to call him on his mobile & he said he didn’t have his number. I asked why is it that I have his number & the dealership doesn’t. He couldn’t provide me with an answer only to say that there are no trucks as Androw described however he again had higher priced trucks. I believe the kicker to this whole scheme is that Androw & Andy are one in the same person who is trying to cover up his own lies & mistakes.

So now it seems obvious that I too are another victim of being lured into this dealership by their false advertised pricing, con artist lies and illicit salesmen tactics all while at my own expense.
 
The good news however is that I did purchase a truck at Dave Smith Motors in Idaho. They literally are one of the highest volume dealerships in the nation with thousands of vehicles and availability to choose from. They don’t lie, are honest and pricing is unbeatable.

If there was an option for negative stars i'd put -5 and beyond. This dealership is filled with a bunch of classless employees starting with the person who answers phone calls to the sales reps and even more so, management! For 2 days i was trying to purchase a vehicle without even haggling the price of the vehicle. They would not send me a written quote, they insisted i come in. Once they found out i was going to purchase cash nobody wanted to talk to me i called every hour to try to talk to management, they were always ""busy"" and for 2 days i never received a call. I was told they do not take personal checks or cashiers checks by a sale rep and that i would have to finance through their bank and payoff loan after first month! I finally got through to another sales rep that said to just come down and within an hour and a half i was there. I walked in and they were slow i mean nobody there and it literally took 5 mins for someone to ask me if I've been helped! So much for the ""busy managers"" that couldn't return  my phone call! Anyhow, i told them the car i wanted to see and they said ""they sold it 40 minutes ago to a sister dealership""! Then i asked what dealership and that i'll go there to buy it. They replied ""they sold it to some family"". This place is a joke! If you have any experience buying cars and they cant sway you, you will be ignored and god forbid you want to buy cash and move a car that has been sitting on their lot for 100 days!  Usually they do all the calling if you enquirer about a vehicle but as soon as they saw cash coming, i was calling them and all i received was crickets from this dealership! I took off work drove in traffic for an hour lost time with my family just to get there and find out I've been lied to! THIS PLACE IS A JOKE! FOR YOUR OWN GOOD STAY AWAY! THERE ARE PLENTY OF CLASS ACT DEALERSHIPS OUT THERE AND THIS ONE IS NOT ONE OF THEM! THE CULTURE BEING TAUGHT THERE IS HORRENDOUS!!!! 

Oh and by the way, the car that they ""sold"" is still up for sale on the website!

13294,03-Jul-19,"So this is for their Jeep dealership unit ( I have read about the other brand teams- Dodge, Ram- being equally notorious!!), - They had been advertising super low prices on their Jeep Wrangler models and refusing to engage much over the phone- They wanted us to be at the dealership to talk further! Understand this! So we went over to at their dealership. Even though we knew exactly which vehicle on their lot we wanted, they made us sit there for 6 hours!!- going back n forth on prices they had already advertised! Adding some weird unadvertised packages which made no sense at all to their final pricing! When we almost were ready to walk out, they called us back and removed that package amounting to almost 4000$. They sold off the vehicle which we test drove and agreed to purchase right under our nose to another customer!! How could you be so unprofessional in your dealings?
Finally- when the financing phase came, they didnt' realize that we had pre-approved ourselves on Chrysler financing and said that we will have to pay some high interest rate at something greater than 7% even though our credit scores were Tier A. When we brought it to their attention, they realized they couldn't swindle us on that front - so went ahead with the financing aspect. When they realizing we were not going to buy any additional extended care or maintenance packages from them, they got upset and started behaving rudely with my wife.- telling her that they know we are there because of the low prices they have advertised- Ofcourse that's why we were there- I mean isn't that the point of getting customers to your dealership! they were not favoring us in anyway!
 The only reason we purchased the vehicle from them was because, we didn't have time to shop around at other dealers and go thru the process all over again!- But if there was a police complaint i could make for false advertisements and unprofessional attitude,, I would do it right away!. Definitely thinking of filing a civil case against them for sure- so they get the message! Don't think anythings going to get fixed at their end though...",6,19,921
13295,29-Jun-19,"(I wish I could give lower than 1 star)  They advertise prices that seem too good to be true.  After you've test driven the vehicle and spent a bunch of time listening to the salesman tell you how wonderful everything is the sales manager will come in and let you know there is $4000 worth of accessories they installed that will be added to the price of the car.  $4000!!!  I told them I didnt want it and wouldn't pay for it. I told them that was not in the advertised price of the vehicle.  He lowered it to $2400 saying 'thats what it cost him' and he couldn't remove that cost.  I reiterated that was not in the advertised price and I drove 3 hours to get there because of the advertised price.  I finally got up and left refusing to shake his hand.

Bottom line I went there to buy a truck that had almost 23k discount the deal sounded too good to be truth I went there I I was trading a 2018 accord touring the most expensive accord there is normal msrp is around 35k and trade value based on blue book when I was there from 25k to 26k and the manager told that my blue book on my car was 19k and that brand new it only retail at 26k but at the same time the had a same year accord but the basic one and they where asking 25k for it.

We first went to HB Jeep for a 16' VW Tiguan, sales guy was nice, sales manager Johnny Deyet was the biggest xxxxx I have ever come across. We walked out, tried the next day, got the same bad service but with another manager. My point, don't go there, they treat there customers like s**t, they don't deserve your business. A couple nights later, we found another 16' Tiguan that STG Auto Group has online that had the exact same everything  as the other car except was 10,000 miles less. That night we saw it which was 30 minutes before they closed, we headed down to check it out.

13300,01-Jun-19,"6 HOURS to buy a car?   I called on Thursday the 23rd and made an appointment for the 24th at 9:30.   I told Ricardo which car I was interested in and he told me it was upfront. Victor was our salesman and he greeted us with kindness and enthusiasm and told me the car was in the back lot.  I was surprised to learn that the car I wanted was $2000 more than listed online. So George came in to explain it to us but instead we were met with arrogance and rudeness.  After a short but disturbing conversation/argument  he told us "" he's been doing this for 30 years and maybe we should leave and go think about it"".  At this point, my boyfriend left the desk to go ask for another manager and I told George I was no longer speaking to him. I have never been treated so badly.  George needs to realize that without me and every other customer.....he doesn't have a job.  Frankly I would of fired him if it were my company.

Now we're waiting for another manager, and Joe comes in and we have to start the process all over again after telling him how completely disgusted I am with the treatment I received from George. 3 hours after my appointment time, I finally get to see the car .....it is filthy.... dirt and debris everywhere.   It's so bad I don't even want to sit in it and there's no gas in it to take it for a test drive.   Also the rear passenger matching tire is not on and that needs to be replaced.   I'm told it will take an hour to change the tire and to clean and detail the car.   This is how they present a car to someone who wants to buy it??

An hour goes by... just 30 more minutes, 15 more minutes.... lie after lie. 2 1/2 hours later my car is ""ready"".   But I look in the car, it's still not completely clean and there's no gas in it.   Joe explained to me that the cleaning is subcontracted out, and they have no control over how long it takes for them to do their job. Really? This is the standard that is acceptable and you make excuses for them??

I arrived at 9:30 ready to buy a car..... that car and it is now 3:30.   The level of BS that was handed to me that day was ridiculous and insulting?   I love a jeep but I will never step foot back into that dealership again other than the required yearly visit through my warranty... and believe me I'm telling everyone and anyone.   And here's a suggestion stop eating at the front desk. Nobody wants to come in to buy a car and see you with a mouthful of food.  

Finally driving home I notice he Stop/Start is not working so I called and talked to Dan.  Who told me that it really doesn't save gas and is really hard on the engine, so I shouldn't worry about fixing it.  REALLY??  I buy a car that has 360 miles on it....EVERYTHING should work on it.  But after all his daughter has a Compass and hers is turned off and I should do the same.....  

The above is a sugar coated version..... it was a miserable day and experience.......it pains me to the know that I am part of their salary earned that day.  Buying a car should not be that miserable .....it shouldn't be miserable at all.......  and yes I could of walked away but I've had two Jeeps before and believe in the car.   I just I wish I had read the reviews before and gone somewhere else.......  the low price was not worth being treated like crap for he most of 6 hours.

I took thee trip to finally come to my senses that it was a waste of time to try to buy a truck advertised in Autotrader by them. On the first trip, the truck didn't have the options I was looking for.  The second trip to the dealer, I asked that the truck be brought to the site so I could look at it before starting the paper work and they told me that its not how they do things there. Who buys a truck without seeing it, right? My third trip I was interested in purchasing in another  truck listed in Autotrader, but they told me they could sell it. They told me it was missing parts due to a break in. I spoke to the manager and  I expressed my disappointment with the whole situation.

It wasn't until his manager stepped in with my ""deal"" when things went south. First off, they are telling me the price of the wrangler I want to purchase is $32.5K then this dingo walks in and tells me my monthly payment is going to be $797 over 72 terms, they clearly werent looking to sell a car. They add in their $4k dealer accessories kit which is smoke and mirrors, and tell you that you must finance the vehicle through the dealership for atleast 3 months at 7% APR, then you can refinance with any lender. As someone with very good credit, I've never seen modern cars selling with 7% APR. I managed to shave $2K off their dealer accessories and took out the other xxxxxxxx warranties they tried baiting in as well, so for those that say its non negotiable, it is but they wont take it all off. The final straw for me was the insult of an offer for my trade in, they were a good 30% under its fair trade in value, I have other offers from dealerships and carmax to back up my ""fair value"" assesment. I walked, too much smoke and mirrors, hidden fees, etc. I will be buying a wrangler but certainly not from them.

Their markup price may be possible to negotiate on very-rare case basis, but only good for few hundred dollars off max. If you are a guy, FORGET IT, you are required to pay the full $4,000 markup price. Only ladies can negotiate the $4,000 markup aftermarket price for few hundred dollars less.

13313,24-Jan-19,"When you go to a dealership and buy a car new from the lot, you're not just buying a car but you're buying a piece of mine that anything that breaks on it is covered for the next 36,000 miles. You're not expecting them to all of a sudden after a year-and-a-half turn on you and try to rip you off looking for any reason they can. My radio broke a year ago and I took it out oh, this does not void the warranty, even though he's trying to convince me it does and trying to convince me that my air conditioner knob won't turn because I took my radio out of year ago. Not only that, I've been bringing my vehicle to this place for the past year since I got it and the last two times I brought it it didn't have the radio in it and because I didn't get this bearded self proclaimed mechanic as a service provider... it was never a problem and all the issues that were covered under warranty we're fixed. I wasn't asking for the radio to be fixed. This time it was my door latches and my air conditioner knob would not physically turn and he's going to try to tell me that that's because I took my radio out a year ago and it's so ridiculously underhanded and is blatantly transparent they are not out for customer service or do you good because you bought a vehicle from them...they are out to suck as much money out from you as they possibly can even as a loyal customer. I don't understand it because these guys, at the front desk, if they're not getting the money you've figured they would understand and it would try that help you get your car fixed...not try to say $150 to bring it in when it's under warranty. Yes you heard me $150 to bring it in and it still under warranty it's only a year-and-a-half old. I did not install any more systems I did not alter anything electrical inside I simply took the radio out of the dash. They wouldn't even compromised to fix my back door latches on my patch on the back because you know that's directly related to the radio(sarcastic) and makes a whole bunch of sense there. I really wish he wouldn't have been so stubborn with this, it's just not right, taking the radio off does not effect the door latches nor the A/C components and DOES NOT void your warranty... and he kept thinking if he explained it enough  to me that I was going to believe what he said. So basically they are trying to rip me off and weasel their way out of a signed contract warranty...when there's been multiple repairs on this thing...in the same condition as it's in now...so there's nothing really more I can say to get the point across. The Dodge I had bought had broken multiple times within the first year and they had it for upwards of two weeks at a time, 2 weeks and I didn't say nothing I didn't complain at all because they had me covered and they fixed everything that was wrong with it... everything that was DESERVED to be fixed. Now for a couple little things it would have taken maybe an hour and a half to do all of them, they're going to cause me and themselves this much trouble trying to squeeze a hundred something bucks out of me which...I got...but it's not the point. The fact that they serviced before in the same condition and now they're not lets you know that the inconsistency automatically leads to the conclusion that they're ripping us off every chance they can get...any time they can think of. I know this is common knowledge, that dealers rip you off....but I'm not having it this time....you should have just fixed my doors and A/C....I talked to my lawyer friend...my warranty is still valid....stop jerking people around.

13315,05-Jan-19,"Went to the dealer after they would not negotiate an out the door price over the internet or phone.  Turns out the Ram truck that was advertised was just a ploy to get customers into their door.  The truck is a Ram 2019 Longhorn with a stock number 50505 was advertised as an MSRP of 58K when the actual vehicle was 62K, they then proceeded to tell me that I had to buy 4500 dollars in additional dealer services to get the vehicle at the advertised price.  Makes sense since the garbage they sell as ""extra coverage"" is 100% pure profit and the sale of the truck is a just s small fraction into their pocket. 

The sad part of this story is my wife is 8 months pregnant and we spent 4 hours there just to be taken advantage of.  I even bought a vehicle here in 2014 and got the vehicle and at the advertised price.  Not sure if what they are doing is legal but its sad to see places like this are still in business.  Even contacted Ram which didn't have much to say.  

Really love the looks of these new trucks but I cant see a reason why I would want to give my business to people like this.  Would rather pay more for something less to an honest dealership that cares about customer service.

13324,24-Oct-18,"**Rude, disrespectful, unprofessional, and very nasty attitude.**
I called yesterday, 10/23, and made a 7:00 appt. for today 10/24. When I spoke to Henry Jimenez (service advisor) we discussed (and confirmed) fixing 4 issues; replace 2 front tires, fix the recall, door paneling falling off, and I needed a new key fob. Henry then told me that they would only need my car for a day because these were all very ""simple"". 
    My car was dropped off at the dealership at 7:05 am. Henry called me at 3:00pm (8 hours later) with a nasty attitude, and said ""I don't know why you had your car towed up here, we started it just fine"". I then reiterated the issues that needed fixing, and Henry said ""oh yeah"", and hung up. I then called back at 5:49 and asked Henry when my car would be ready, and he said I couldn't pick it up until tomorrow. I told him that it was crucial I get my car back, because I was taking my godmother to chemo in the morning & I had school. Henry very nastily replied ""yeah, well"". Then Henry lied and said ""We didn't have the tires in stock"". When I told him that wasn't true because I confirmed that there were 5 tires in stock before I made the appt. he again nastily replied ""yeah, well"". I then said ""If you had any issues you should have just called me"". Henry again ""yeah, well"". I asked him why he didn't call me; he gave no response. I then said ""New tires are simple and quick, you still have time to do it today."" Again Henry nastily replied, ""yeah, well - no I don't"". He then text messaged me at 6:02, and said I could get my car (with no new tires of course) which was the sole reason for dropping it off. Obviously I can't drive with no tread (that's why the car was towed).",6,19,-1

A few minuets later he came back and no deal on their financing and if I wanted to use my bank, I would have to sign a contract with them at 1.92% higher APR. He said wait to get my first statement/payment and then take the loan to my bank to have them cut a check to pay off the loan and have my bank take over the loan. Of course I refused and promptly left. It's too bad because the vehicle was perfect for us and the price was right. ",6,19,-1

Don’t bother getting a pre approved loan from a major lender they will not accept. Ie. USAA pre approved loans
Felt as if I was inconvenience to them for wanting to purchase a car. Plan on spending hours waiting on finance even if you are 1 of 2 people waiting.  While you are waiting you would think they would be prepping your car for delivery to you , however that is not the case. So after waiting hours on finance, plan to spend at least another hour waiting on them to take another hour to wash your car.
Dealer feels like it should be a used car dealer on the corner in a neighborhood.

13333,23-Aug-18,"I came in to buy a 2018 Challenger because of the advertised price.  They pulled the old ""four square"" sales trick where they only show you down payment and monthly payments without telling you the actual price.  I went home and plugged the numbers into a car payment calculator to learn that the total amount financed was several thousand dollars more than we talked about.  I had to call back the next day to learn that they tried to hide a FOUR THOUSAND DOLLAR extended warranty in those numbers, hoping that I wouldn't do the math.  We never once discussed an extended warranty, I never asked for it, and they never disclosed that they were adding it to the total amount financed.

If you absolutely must buy a car from this place, make 100% sure you know what the price of the car is...and what else you're paying for.  If your salesman keeps going to the finance guy and returning with only down payment and monthly payments, talk to the finance guy directly and see what the total amount financed is and an itemized list of things that contribute to that number.

You should go to a dealership that's not stuck in the 80s with shady sales tactics, though.  It's 2018; you don't have to put up with this anymore.",6,19,-1

Come to dealership with pre financing from your credit union, and save THOUSANDS.

Saying things like, ""if you don't buy it, someone else will."" If you have a trade, don't bring it here. They won't give you anything for it, although blue book value states otherwise.

Then they completely ignored me when I told them I wanted to custom order it because I wanted features the ones they had in inventory did not have. A couple of months later, I was told I needed to talk to the Fleet Sales Department. I ended up contacting them and shared with Hank Comnos the details of the order. It has been 2 weeks now and no answer. Every time I talk to him he tells me he is too busy and has 400 emails he needs to respond to. They make it look like they are doing you a favor by selling you a truck which they can seem to be able to do. I felt like being in a third world country.

Bottom line don't waste your time here if you need to special order a car because either the cars cannot be ordered or these guys are too incompetent to sell cars.

This is a great brand and a great vehicle, but this dealership will not give you an example of either of those. I have tried to buy jeeps here, tried to have my jeeps serviced here (I have owned 6 and half dozen of my friends own them because of me) and every attempt has been a disaster. Twice in the past 4 years I have walked on to this dealership to buy a vehicle - cash in hand. Both times I walked the lot for 15-20 minutes without being acknowledged by anyone. When I go inside and ask for help I end up sitting on the chair for another 15 minutes. Each time I have had to leave and go down to the jeep dealership on Harbor (not a great place but at least the do customer service). Today I had a service appointment because I had been given a gift certificate by a friend who knows I love jeeps. Pulled up, parked my car and waited.....and waited....20 minutes. I flagged a gentleman down and was told that someone would be with me shortly and that my oil change would take 2 hours. Another 20 minutes went by. I called the service desk from the parking lot and asked to speak with a manager - I was transferred to VM.

Took back and the GM said give her what ever she wants in a life be up in the back and only pay $100 more a month.

They said I had to come back and sign new papers, they couldn’t get the interest rate promised (after realizing it was 11%), but they had gotten down to 9%. They neglected to tell me they “added “ an extra year on my loan and I did not pay attention to that since they said nothing had changed but the rate. Also I had so many inquiries on my credit report. Also the “finance charge that they supposedly were charging cause they were financing the loan was still added into the loan along and they sold my loan to capital one with the interest rate a month after buying the car. So I ended up paying $23,000 for a $14,000 car with no bells or whistles and no power locks or windows, I did notice until last year why my loan was paid off that they had changed my loan terms, so when I signed with new interest rate Also I’m paying interest for my loan with capital one.

13349,24-Apr-18,"If you are a bit scared of the whole 'buying a used car from a dealership' scenario, or intimidated about going to a place that sells cars and getting conned by a savvy knowledgeable used car salesman; Then have absolutely no fear when you come to HB Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram... Crap...( whatever else is in their name), you wont have to worry about encountering that at HB Jeep. If your intimidation stems from the thought of a savvy used car salesman and feeling dumb for not knowing basic information about how the whole car buying or financing process works dont worry none of these sales rep do either. Their salesman have absolutely zero and i mean zero knowledge about what it is that their doing there. Literally hire guys with zero experience, and does it show. Simplest questions such as ""What kind of insurance must i have to drive off the lot?"" is met with a face of confusion and followed with ""ummm... Im not.... let me find that out for you"". By the way that is how most inquiries are responded to. its either that or ""we'll go over that once we process it and find out ummmm.... im not quite sure"". Every question is answered though. ""Do you need proof of address?"" ...umm..im not quite sure.... let me find out.  ""Does the cosigner need to be here for me to apply?"".....we'll go over that once we process it and find out..... ""what are the terms of the financing company. what requirements must be met?""...... ummmmm.. I.... let me find out for you.. ""Do you have a bathroom?.... we'll go over that once we process it and find out. ""do you have a brain?"" im not quite..... let me find out for you...
Seriously save yourself the time the headache, the display of disrespectful grown men talking and acting like a bunch of school boys. Cussing in front of you and figuring out how insurance for a vehicle works.
I would be a bit more understanding about the sales rep they hire there but they are just as much at fault as HB Jeep is. I would not go apply in a field that i know absolutely nothing about. Nor would i hire someone who knows nothing about the product im selling. You dont see landscapers applying to be brain surgeons.  And the people they hire there to sell us cars are just that know-nothing guys. But I guess that is how much respect HB Jeep has for its consumers. I really wish these guys got more training other than how to log into their dealer website and more Customer Service training but from what i saw the lady conducting part of the training was more concerned with letting the new herd of dumb flesh know how much more dedicated she is to the company than anything else. Maybe instead of continuing to hire herd after herd they should spend the money and commission theyre giving to these guy on some real training for how to treat a customer and most of all on a legal team or someone with some understanding of how advertising works. I guess nobody really cares of or has heard that false advertising is a crime. And maybe theyre just that disconnected and dont think that a knowledgeable and apologetic rep would mean the difference between a frustrated understanding customer and a pissed off misled consumer filing a claim for false advertising.

Furthermore, he could not see how this would be an emission issue.  Their initial price for replacement and thermostat and flush was over $500.00. When I complained about their lack of adequate response for not being covered, no effort was made to provide me with proper response.

When I purchased my vehicle back in May 26,2017 I told them that the car didn't have gas and that they needed to put gas in it. When I told them too they said that they didn't do that there. I was furious because I drove all the way from Riverside to Huntington to get a Jeep. Therefore I had to put my own gas. My first purchased vehicle at a different dealership made sure to put a full tank. Even at the dealership where my boyfriend bought his RAM truck at BMW of Murrieta put a full tank of gas and it was a used vehicle too. I was so disappointed after that.

When I get there to check in the representative tells me that my car had a recall and I'm thinking like 'DID THEY SELL ME A CAR THAT HAS A RECALL AND THEY ALREADY KNEW ABOUT IT!?' I kept asking the representative what kind of recall and he said it was a sticker from the VIN number that I was going to receive a letter in the mail. Till this day I have not received any letter! The recall is supposedly called a T12? I tried using google to see what a T12 recall meant and nothing came up. I even went on the website where you search up vehicles with recalls and my car did not show up at all. I was so confused at that point. I don't know what kind of dealership this is and what kind of service they hold but my car service was not completed. All the checkups that they supposedly did they obviously did not complete the job. I got a description of all the services they made and they checked off that they checked all the fluids in the vehicle. Lies! I dropped off the car with low washer fluid and I never refilled it because I knew I was getting the service and they were going to refill it. I get the car back and it still had low washer fluid. I know what to expect when it comes down to car services because Valvoline would walk me through it, even Valvoline has better service then this dealer! I tried to complain about it and they said that they forgot to reset it. I had my boyfriend check and they didn't refill anything!

When it arrived I looked at it, then went back in to get the keys from my salesman, only to be told that it was already sold. Huge bummer, but I'm determined. My salesman recommended I go grab lunch and he would call me when my next choice was ready to view. After TWO HOURS and no phone call, I call him and he tells me it's ready but he forgot to call me. I return to the dealership and sit down to make a deal. My salesman was doing at least three other things and got up several times. He also was less than informed and had to ask his manager for the answer to every question I asked. I didn't appreciate being charged an additional $900 than the advertised price because I had already secured my own financing. They also refused to honor a Ram $500 military discount for which I qualified. The manager had an opportunity to smooth things over and step in to save his struggling salesman, but instead was rude and unapologetic. After several mistruths and an overwhelming feeling that I was not valued I stood up and left. Second best decision I made that weekend. The first was going to Orange Coast Dodge after I left HB to get my vehicle. ",6,20,-1
13373,10-Aug-17,"This is in response to the owners reply.  I do have a life, and posted my initial complaint the same day I did on BBB, as well as the other websites he boasted about.  It obviously took this site awhile to post.  To the readers researching this dealership, you can see by the owner's reply that he is rude and not concerned about his lack of customer service skills. I implore you to check out responses by other dealers.  Most don't use profanity, inflated egos and turn the blame on his disgruntled customers.  Again, I stand by my comment, that if I  can warn even 1 potential customer, it is worth the effort.  I believe customer service is extremely important.  This guy can't help but throw a tantrum every time someone complains.  Buyer beware and best of luck if you choose to go forward with a sale here.  Most of the complainrs are regarding the lack of service after they've pocketed your money. ",6,20,18

I am just trying to understand any fees that i will be charged, which is a simple request.  The dealership states I need to physically visit the dealership.The only conclusion i can make is they want to charge extra dealer fees and the dealership does not want to expose any information that would risk killing the deal. They want me to come into dealership hoping you will just agree to the fees and buy the vehicle.  I am located 2+ hours from the dealership, so driving 2 hours to receive an OTD number is not a reasonable request. In buying 10+ cars over the last 20 years i have never dealt with such an unprofessional sales team. Why would you not provide a simple OTD itemized quote. As an example of their customer service I was talking to Mario on the phone and he abruptly said he needed to help other customers and would call me back later that evening, which he never did.  I was trying to buy a $50K dodge durango, and I cannot believe this type of customer service  I would not recommend this dealership for anyone considering a new Jeep, Dodge, or Chrysler product.

13409,14-Mar-17,"So let me start this review by suggesting that I have purchased a multitude of cars from various dealerships and manufacturers ranging from inexpensive to very expensive! Never have I ever encountered a more unprofessional, disorganized and wasteful entity in my entire life! I essentially spoon fed them a sale! I called early in the morning and spoke to Oscar (this gentlemen is the internet manager and judging by my experience with him, it's really no surprise that the organization is as horrendous as it is). I told Oscar what car I wanted to test drive, when I would be there and reiterated the importance of timeliness as I made a 2 hour commute to get to the facility. I had also prequalified for a loan and secured financing prior to my arrival. In addition I got my trade appraised, through their website, and had my pink slip in hand ready to make my purchase! When I arrived, on time might I add, I had to wait nearly 30 minutes for my sales rep to acknowledge my presence. Afterwards he took me to the vehicle I was going to purchase. It was unkept and filthy! All of this was of little consequence as the vehicle was being sold at a great price and the inherent value was present. As I went to test drive the vehicle Oscar realized that the dealership had lost the key to the vehicle. They initially thought they locked it inside and I had to help them POP THE LOCK! (As far fetched as this sounds I'm not making it up.) we spent nearly an hour popping the lock to find the key wasn't in the car! It took nearly two hours to get a locksmith to make a new key! Again I waited through this process kindly and patiently! Durning which time I waited in a dilapidated showroom that was clearly not being maintained from an aesthetic or functional perspective with one of the most unprofessional managers I've ever experienced. Yet still I waited trying to give the dealership the benefit of the doubt! As my visit approached the three hour mark I finally test drove the vehicle and came to agreeable financial terms. One would think that after the courtesy and patience I demonstrated the duration of my experience would be seamless...however you would be wrong! Another two hours past as I sat aimlessly waiting for this inefficient, disorganized, and unprofessional people to get together the paperwork for my purchase. They could not manage to do so. I arrived at the dealership at 6 pm and at 11:15 pm I decided that I would take my business elsewhere! When I told them to cancel the transaction I did not receive so much as an apology!

13420,09-Feb-17,"The problem started when I first leased the car in November 2016, the advertised price was 24, 000 $, after we agreed on the terms and everything, we signed the contract, and the Finance manager, David Gold, told me that there is no need to read the contract, just sign it. After I went home, I read the contract and the Purchase price was 34,000$, not 24K. I went back and tried to resolve the issue and cancel the contract, they said they are ""Sorry"" about this mistake, but they can't cancel it because the car have already been sold. The next problem happened last monday. I received a call from the dealership. The person told me that I owed them money. I made all of my payments on time and have paper proof. They said that If I am not going to pay, I have to come over to the dealership to talk. Today, I drove 2 hours to get to the dealership, spent 4 hours there and drove another 3 hours back due to traffic. And the problem was not resolved. They had me drive all the way to give them a couple of papers where I could have just emailed them back. I then tried to trade in the car I bought for another one, but the new manager told me that I cannot do that, because I agreed to pay so much on the first car that I will have to lose so much money If I want to trade it in.

13460,18-Oct-16,"Huntington Beach Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram -- Deceptive, Dishonorable, Disappointing – DO NOT TRUST THEM! 
Having purchased vehicles from HB Jeep before, and having recommended them to many of my 940 clients over the years; I was EXTREMELY disappointed today in their lack of integrity – even after admitting they screwed up!
I saw them add for 2 vehicles I was looking for, contacted their sales person and made arrangements to purchase before the 1 ½ drive each way and verified the pricing!
Within 10 minutes of arrival, I noticed that the MSRP on the vehicle’s window sticker was significantly LOWER than what they said in them adds; making their discount less than advertised.  I pointed this out to the salesman, who said – “I’ve never seen this happen before.  My apologies.  I’m sure my manager will honor the error.”  I mentioned that maybe the other vehicle was correct; sad to say, it too had the same deceptive error.  What are the odds!  If you’ve ever bought from them, you were probably quietly screwed too.
1 ½ hours later, after having most all the work completed to purchase the vehicle; the manager admitted the error; but, said that “in small print, it says if a mistake is made, we don’t honor them”.
I’m an employer, if my employee makes an error – I will do my best to honor it and serve the client.  They admitted the error but was unwilling to make even a ONE-dollar adjustment towards the $1,000 error.
Thus, they went from being a vendor I would recommend to a deceptive, dishonorable dealer.  I would suggest that you avoid them.  HONOR DOESN’T MATTER IN POLITICS; but, it should matter in business!

13463,16-Oct-16,"EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED in how this dealership handled customer service.
After TWO WEEKS, our brand new Jeep that we bought at this dealership would not start. This was disappointing in itself, but my review is based on how inadequate the situation was handled. 

When the car did not start on a Saturday night, I tried to contact the dealership but found that not many people were there, which was understandable. I left a message with Tom Cruz, the sales manager, and I left two messages with Jacob Jacobo, the man that helped us buy the car. I also left a general voicemail with the receptionist that night for ANYONE to get back to me. 

I received no calls back the next day, so I left a separate message with each of the men above another message with a different sales manager, and another message with the receptionist again for anyone to get back to me. I had to have the car towed TWICE from one dealership that was the closest to me, then to Huntington Beach. This was covered under warranty, but essentially our day was gone while we waited four hours to get the car to the dealer. 

My husband and I work in San Diego, and we needed to get into a rental or something to get back and thankfully, the service department helped us with that, which is why this review is in my opinion worth one star (even if there is no option for zero stars). Although our car was not in the dealership's possession, they put us into a rental, but this would bite us in the butt later since we didn't get paperwork for the mileage coming in.

We still did not receive any correspondence back, after FOUR days, and after leaving voicemails every day with the receptionist, it was finally ridiculous and I sent an email to Tom and Jacob. Then Tom emailed me back right then and there and told me that him, and his whole team were out, and this was why no one had contacted us. I find that extremely hard to believe because the day before the receptionist let me know that Jacob had been in, but left early. After telling Tom this via email, I hadn't heard back from him, and still haven't. 

My Jeep was ready after almost two weeks of being in the service department, and while I appreciated that our car was worked on, when we got our car back there was almost 200 extra miles on the car. Now we did not have the paperwork as I mentioned with our situation of the car not being in when we received the rental. But the service department gave us the invoice letting us know the car came in at 1420 miles, which it did not, had been driven 5 miles to check if it worked, and it says that we received the car back with 1426 miles on it. However, we have pictures that our car came out at 1423 miles. Something wasn't right, and this whole situation was just wrong in the first place. 

I would caution everyone about coming here. It was not only disappointing, but just upsetting and a huge hassle that no one should have to deal with when buying a new car.",6,20,-1
13485,21-Sep-16,"This is regarding my experience with Dodge Huntington Beach... I was sold a certified pre-owned Dodge Challenger RT. The sales process was smooth, I don't really have any complaints about that. However, being a first time buyer, I was unaware that the dealership is required to give you a copy of the supposed 125 point inspection. Within 3 months of purchasing the vehicle, while driving down the freeway with my wife, we heard a loud 'clunk"" sound. That was the left radius arm coming out (think of it as a ball and socket joint) I got the vehicle home and had it towed to the dealership. While at the dealership, the service tech told me they would not likely get to my car that day and offered a loaner car, I accepted his offer. I get a call from the service tech the following day, demanding I return the loaner car. He proceeded to tell me over the phone that the type of damage was not covered and therfore, I was not approved to have it. Then he explained that the radius arm was damaged and/or broken and all 4 tires were bald. Also, there were missing nuts and bolts. I asked what could ha e caused this type of damage? He could not give me a definitive cause, he resorted to mere speculation. That it must be due to negligent driving. I have a 6 year old daughter that wants to go with me everywhere. To the fathers out there, you know what I'm talking about. There is no way in xxxx, that I would risk my daughters life, driving in such a manner. I reviewed the Carfax that was given to me, the previous owner was in a minor accident to the front, no further details. This was not disclosed to me at the time of purchase, which is my fault, I'm told the dealer is not required to reveal that to me. However, for the sales rep. to tell me that is has not been in any accidents, that's a different story. The Carfax report also shows the previous owner had all 4 tires replaced, then oddly enough, he had all 4 replaced only after putting less than 4,000 miles on the new pair. This is a 5 year old car, but it only had 16,xxx miles on it. Why would he replace the tires only after 4,000 miles on the new pair? Why did my tires go bald only after putting 9,000 miles on them before I had it towed to the dealership? I researched it and a suspension issue would cause early wear on the tires. What was affecting the vehicle when the original owner had it,  is clearly affecting my vehicle still. I pointed out all of this to the service tech. I purchased an extended warranty contract from them at the time of purchase. I contacted them, they told me to have the dealership call, to start the process. I asked the service tech to call, I waited 3 days, still nothing from the extended warranty company. I called the service tech to see if he had called. He said he hadn't, cuz he said he knew they wouldn't cover it. Well, I didn't know he had the right to make that decision. He agreed to call but it sounded like it bothered him to do so. They were no help at all. Finally, I get a car from Patrick, the rep. who the extended warranty company sent out. The dealership did not even make me aware that he came out to inspect the vehicle. Patrick told me that they could not cover the repairs due to they don't cover missing parts. He further explained to me, the missing nuts and bolts mentioned earlier, did not appear to be sheared off. Indicating, that someone forgot to put them on or did not put them on correctly. Patrick told me to ask the dealer how did this get missed on the certified pre-owned inspection? I pointed this out to the service tech and to the manager. I did not hear one response from them. While Patrick and I reviewed the Carfax so I could point out the original owner replacing the tires after only putting 4,000 miles on his new pair. His copy of the Carfax did not show this on the history. His copy just showed they were balanced. How does this type of pertinent information, that would be favorable for the dealership be taken out of the Carfax history? Now, the service tech changed it from we don't cover the type of damage, to my vehicle was out of the warranty period. My argument is that the problem existed before the time of purchase. All the things I pointed out clearly show that. The dealership has given me speculation with no definitive cause. They still would not cover the repairs. They still haven't. Mind you, what I mentioned wasn't a fast process. This is about 4 months after I brought in my vehicle. I'm paying for a car, I haven't been able to use. It was only out of the warranty period,  less than a month. You would think they would cover the repairs for a disabled Iraq veteran, after I pointed all of this out. I explained to them that I was a disabled veteran and I deserved better treatment from them, instead of being ignored for months. They didn't acknowledge this at all.",6,20,357

I brought my vehicle into HB for Transmission service 5 days ago . 
the day after the service I noticed my vehicle was leaking fluid. (it has never leaked before) 
I called made and appointment with derrick yesterday . today he acted like I never called or spoke with him . 
  Derrick diagnosed my leak  as "" the gasket around the oil pan is leaking."" he said there was dirt caked around the oil pan on the edges holding in the oil . some of the dirt shook loose and now its leaking . he quoted me $ 800 . I told him that diagnosis does not sound accurate. I drive on the freeway . I don't drive through dirt for it to get caked up . I took my keys and went inside to talk to the General manager.   I waited for 10 minutes. Derrick came to me and said he wanted to put my car in the air and show me the dirt .. I said ok .. he took my car back and I am waiting for 20 minutes while its in the air.. finally I go back to see what is going on .. I then see derrick and the mechanic looking all under my car with flashlights and talking about where the leak could be coming from.. 

derrick comes back to me and says. 
"" well maybe the leak is coming from the top"" let me lower it and look. they lower it and look. 

then derrick says well maybe the leak is this.... we need to take some stuff apart to find out what is going on .. 

then derrick has the nerve to say I am looking at him like he does not know what he is talking about  . and he has been in the business 25 years and this is what he needs to do to diagnose my vehicle. 

I told him he is right I am looking at him like he does not know what he is talking about 

45 minutes ago he diagnosed my vehicle and quoted me 800 for repairs.. 

when I wanted to talk to management HE came back to ME and said he would SHOW ME the dirt caked up ect.... but once the car was in the air . he COULD NOT SHOW ME THE AFFORE MENTIONED DIRT WHICH HAD CAKED UP AND WHICH WOULD COST 800$ TO REPAIR . HE needed to look into it further when im under the car saying WHERE IS THE DIRT ?? 


this man Derrick totally tried to scam me.. I was at the dealership for 3 hours and I still do not know what or why my car is leaking . I purchased a jeep Laredo and a jeep patriot fromt his dealership and they  tried to scam me.


DERRICK TRIED TO SCAM ME WITH A 800$ DIAGNOSIS. TOLD ME HE WOULD SHOW ME THE DIRT UNDER THE CAR AND WHEN I WAS UNDER THE CAR WITH HIM LOOKING THE ENTIRE STORY CHANGED AND IT NEEDS FURTHER DIAGNOSIS..

13572,18-Apr-16,"Found my dream car and drove up from San Diego, had preapproved loan in hand just needed to verify it was the car I wanted.   After waiting an hour to get appraisal, finally got into finance, I was assured final dealer prep would be done before I got and finance wouldn't take that long, wrong on both.  Even though my bank had instructions for EFT finance insisted I needed a cashiers check, I told the finance guy this was the 4th car I had purchased with this bank and never had they given me a check.  He also didn't know how to use their touch screen system, which is supposed to speed things up, it didn't, had to bring in another finance guy to show him.  Spent well over an hour in finance and was now in my 4th hour overall.  Well at least my car would be done...it wasn't, also prior to going into finance I had requested the my personalized tags and tire valve stems be put in my new car...finally the salesman brought the car out after another hour of waiting, now well into my 5th hour at dealership.  The salesman said he had to do the prep, even though the car is gorgeous still had stickers and some marks on window, but now I was just ready to leave.   The tags and valve stems weren't in the new car either, even though I asked...got on the road with less then 1/4 tank of gas, my wife said just go, we were starving so went across street to grab some dinner before starting back to San Diego.  Got call from salesman, he still had tags, still trying to be cheerful went back and grabbed them, asked him about a tank of gas and he said they had to cut back....so it wasn't an oversight, I just spent $60k on a car and they don't even give you a full tank of gas!  I was now in my 7th hour at dealer, figured I should just be happy and get on road...

2 weeks later I notice that HBD still hadn't paid off my bank for trade, even though they had already sold the car.  My wife called to sort out the problem and almost immediately the finance guy started yelling at her...she asks for his supervisor and he wouldn't let her talk either...I get on the phone and he tells me they have 13days by law to mail the check and they mailed a check on the 13th day, I asked why this wasn't brought up in finance and they basically accused me of lying, when I told him we had been assured they process it in'a couple of days'...could hardly get a word in and by now the conversation was becoming more heated...

I finally hung up knowing I'd get no where with these guys, LOVE MY CAR BUT HATE THIS DEALERSHIP, VERY FRUSTRATING TO DEAL WITH, DON'T GO HERE, THEY TREAT YOU LIKE CRAP!",6,20,0

It was a simple fix of an oxygen sensor, quickly the well paid and on commission reps tried to oversell and played on my fears. After spending the well overpriced fix and still wasn't done properly I left and went to an expert who went through the paperwork from these thieves I was told by more than a few auto experts that this dealership should be ashamed of stealing from an elderly person and that estimate was beyond reasonable.

13657,06-Aug-15,"I went to the dealership to buy a vehicle yesterday. I called before making the 3 hour drive to confirm the vehicle was still available. I also told them I was buying it and asked if they would hold it for me if I made the drive. Tom told me they don't normally do that but would ask his manager. He put me on hold a minute and came back saying that his manager approved it. They would hold the vehicle for me to purchase if I drove down that day. I take off work early and head that way immediately. I arrive there and we immediately sit down to go through the numbers to make the purchase. Keep in mind, I agreed to the purchase price of the vehicle before making the trip. I did not haggle with pricing at all. It was the price on the front window which was a decent price for this vehicle. They run my credit which is approx 800 credit score and I'm approved for the loan amount. I'm also putting 7500 cash down. I decline their extended warranty that they continued to push on me. After declining that, there is still 2k in hidden fees according to the length of the loan, monthly payment, and the interest rate they are giving me. I could of used my own financing but wanted it to go smoothly as it was late in the day and my bank was closed. I agreed to the 5% which I knew I could refinance in a few months with Chase @ 1-2%. They wouldn't show me the total and were playing the normal sales hidden numbers game. I ask one question - the break down of the fees. I never get this. After sitting around waiting, Tom comes back and tells me he cannot make the deal because the vehicle just sold! We are in the middle of a contract and they sale it? They failed to tell me they were doing two contracts at the same time for the same vehicle! They wasted 7.5 hours of my time and did not keep their word. If you cannot hold a vehicle, say so. If you tell someone you will hold it; keep your word. Why waste my time, get a bad review, and run my credit if you are going to sale it to someone else after promising to hold it? Shady shady dealership and sales people. Beware!

13690,02-Apr-15,"I must tell you, In the collection of automobiles that I've purchased - this  car buying experience was the worst that I've ever had. 

 

I initially inquired about a Ram truck online, and was contacted by Robert Bauer. I spoke to him on the phone and by email a couple of times and made an appointment to see him. I arrived at our scheduled meeting time, and he wasn't in yet. I waited about a half hour and he finally arrived, I introduced myself and he had no clue what I was interested in or seemingly who I was. He finally pulled up my info and proceeded to find my truck - I waited another half hour. He took me for a test drive, and when I inquired about the air suspension option and standard warranties he said that I really didn't need those options. After the test drive, we went inside to discuss price and an already lackluster experience spiraled out of control. I told him what I thought the truck was worth, he was offended and said that the dealership was already discounting it. So I tried to get an out the door price from him and he said that he couldn't do that till I was in finance. I explained that part of my decision making process was knowing the finance options , and he retorted by pressuring me to make a decision. I said that I wouldn't make a decision without the numbers in front of me and I didn't like his sales tactic. I said that we were done and he told me to take his card - and that ""you'll be back""

Fast forward two days -  I was still very dissatisfied with the experience at the dealership, but I decided that I would give it another go. I asked to speak to a manager and got Nick Farber. I explained the situation and he said that he would take care of me personally and try to make the situation better. I asked for an out the door price and he said that was against company policy.  I made an appointment with him for 9:30 AM on Friday March 27th. He called me later that day and said that he would be tied up in a meeting and wouldn't be available till 10:30, I agreed and appeared at the dealership as agreed. When I spoke tot he receptionist, she told me that Nick wasn't there, finally another manager told me that he wasn't in yet that morning and wouldn't be in till noon. At that point I was pretty irritated because he had blown my appointment off - I was told that Dan would be helping me in Nick's absence. Dan had no clue about the situation, so I had to explain everything all over again. I had secured financing with my credit union and had decided to go that way, I asked Dan to get me an out the door price so that I could make a decision. He told me that I would need to fill out a credit application so that he could take it to his manager before he could get me an out the door price. I went round and round with him, and explained that since I already had approved financing I just needed to know what the final price was going to be! He came back by telling me that I was being difficult, and that he thought that we were done. I was furious, and raised my voice. Another manager came over, and I asked to speak to the sales manager - after about 5 minutes Danny came over and spoke to me. He agreed that I didn't need to do a complete credit application since I was using my own financing. He got me an out the door price with all the incentives that were available, and I hesitantly agreed to make the purchase. 

He then sent me to Tom Cruz' office to complete the paper work. Tom had no idea who I was or what was going on, again I had to explain the situation and waited for them to get things together. Soon after that Nick Farber arrived, and took over the process- I was not happy at all by then. 

Finally, I went into the finance manager's office and explained that I was very frustrated and would like to make this as quick as possible. I explained that I wanted NO extras, however he proceeded to try to hard sell me an extended warranty, paint / interior protection, a maintenance plan, alarm, etc. I explained that I wasn't interested, and he persisted, and I lost it. I ended up signing the papers and getting out of your dealership as quickly as possible. 

In good conscience I could not suggest this dealership to anyone nor would I be likely to purchase from them again. It seems that customer service is the last priority at this dealership, and that hard selling / sleazyness is the corporate culture. If I'm contacted by Ram, I will let them know what my experience was like and how dissatisfied I still am with it. ",6,20,46
13691,25-Mar-15,"I purchased a 2011 used 4 runner on 1/15/15. In March, I brought  the car in for it's complimentary oil change. The service department was wonderful! I was informed at that time that I needed new brakes. Bobby in the service department tried to work with the used car department but they refused to budge. He argued with them that I had only had the car two months. George Khoury, executive sales manager in used cars, would do nothing. So, I went across the street myself to talk to him. He said he could do nothing. He would be losing money. He is the epitome of the sleezy used car dealers. No wonder they have such  bad reputations. I have spoken to several mechanics since then and all of them agree I should not have needed new brakes after only 2 months. So I don't know what he did to make the brakes pass or they were just a fraction above the legal limit. I really liked this place and was going to recomend it to several friends but not after dealing with their executive sales mgr. George Khoury.

13705,18-Feb-15,"Called and e-mailed concerning a new 2014 Jeep Cherokee, was assured the car was still available.  Upon arrival at the dealership, I was informed the gentleman I was communicating with was busy and Tom Cruze gave me John Dreyer to help me.  John said the Cherokee was at their offsite storage area and drove me to that lot and proceeded to frantically look for the Jeep finally giving up in what seemed to be forever as I was standing among all of these dirty dusty vehicles in an unpaved parking area.  John was kind enough to allow me to drive another Cherokee back to the dealership so I could at least access whether I wanted a 4 cylinder Cherokee.  Back at the dealership he again began trying to locate the vehicle and somehow determined that is was at another lot and someone had disabled the GPS system the dealership uses to keep track of the vehicles.  Well, he finally got the vehicle to show me which was caked with dust and the wheels looked like it had been doing some off-roading.  This all took over an hour and a half and I had to leave for another appointment.  I called John when I got home and arranged for an appointment at 10 am the next day to perhaps close the deal on the car, he assured me the Cherokee was still available and someone would be there to appraise my trade-in.  Arrived at 10 am, John was there but no Cherokee, so he ran off to find it again.  I sat cooling my heels for 30 minutes and finally sent him a text to find out what in the world was going on.  He informed me he could not get in the gate at the offsite lot and was waiting for someone to open it - he said "" we just opened and I should understand that with over 2000 new cars, it is hard to keep track of them etc, etc"". I sent him another text to see if the trade-in could be looked at while I was waiting and was informed by John that he could not locate the used car guy.  I waited another 20 minutes and then left.  What I do not understand is why he did not arrange to have the vehicle ready and detailed for me to look at seeing that I showed a genuine interest in buying it and had made an appointment.  Called another dealer on the way home and inquired about a similar vehicle, it was at the dealer when I arrived 15 minutes later, even though the salesman had to go off site to get it.",6,20,-1
13731,18-Nov-14,"A used car was posted online at $17899.  We went to buy the vehicle and low and behold the numbers were not adding up.  We know that on average tax/license fees total to approx 10% of purchase price.  This salesperson kept quoting about $2700-$3000 of closing costs which didn't make sense.  So when we were working the numbers out it just didn't make sense.  We asked to see the workout sheet and when it arrived the taxes, doc fees, registration all added up correctly but we couldn't figure out why the price was about $1000 over what we were adding up.  Then in a little line item directly under the price that is advertised for this vehicle online, was a weird term ""aftermarket"" and $774 added to the price of the vehicle.  So be very wary of buying anything from this underhanded used sales deparment.  We even asked the salesman to explain the line item and he blew us off and basically said he had tried his best!  I think they could be held liable for false advertising but I would rather pay $1000 more anywhere else, than wait forever to be messed around with.",6,20,-1
13807,25-Apr-14,"This was the worse vehicle purchasing experience that I've ever had. I went in and drove a new Durango RT based on an ad at a specific sale price. The salesman and finance guys negotiated the deal, sale price and payment terms on a car that I'd never even seen or driven. The claim is that there was a mix up with the inventory ID. All of a sudden the car that I drove was NOT the one in the ad. The one I drove was more expensive of course and had AWD. The dealer in attempt to ""make things right"" insisted on working to match the deal as close as possible on the car that I drove. It suddenly became a numbers game on the monthly payment amount in attempt to meet close to the payment amount and terms that was originally pitched on the car with less features. Consequently, I ended up with a car that was out of scope of what we originally planned for the purchase. We were handed of to 3 different salesmen during this process, which made it even more of a unnerving experience. It was a completely confusing and misleading process from the car to the warranty, where the finance guy uses the misleading terms that the warranty covers ""everything"" for as long as you own the car. Lifetime warranty, yes, but it doesn't cover everything. ",6,20,69

Everyone I talked too talked over me and did not listen. How many times did I have to say I did not need financing? Well atleast 10 because no one listens. How many times was I told I do not matter? In many ways atleast 5.They basically treated me like trash because I was not there to pick up the vehicle TODAY.  They stated we have customers here now and your not. I ended up purchasing from Van Nuys Dodge along with another new vehicle that my son happen to see Van Nuys was a good dealer and took the very little time required to complete the deal.

I had such high hopes for this dealership. Nice website, responded to my e-mail inquiry, etc, etc.  Not so!

Came on the lot with a 2002 Range Rover ready to trade.  My buddy and I got onto the lot where two saleman actually saw us and turned the other way.  We were to meet a salesman who does their internet sales who I can only describe as a scrawney pale Martin Short look-a-like with too much mouse in his hair making him look like ""The Heat Miser"" from that old Christmas show.  But I digress.

We came in our casual t-shirt and jeans and they treated us like dirt which is funny because we both work in the film industry (Director and Photographer respectively) and I plan on telling everyone I know to stay away from this dealership.  Simply rude and they assumed we were dumb enough to fall for their ""very slick"" sales techniques.  

Tried to sell us a car with a damaged front and rear and all they said was ""so do you want to buy it?""  Yeah buddy, I want to by your damaged goods and pay WAY over Blue Book.  They forget they're selling a Jeep, not a Lexus.

The Internet sales guy didn't even take the time to show us the car.  He pawned us off to what I can only describe as ""Cousin It's"" moronic brother who kept calling us ""bro' and drilled me with so many questions that I finally had to tell him to be quiet so I could listen to the ""clicking sound"" the car made as I drove it.

When i wanted to see any other inventory, they took us ""out back"" and showed us a Grand Cherokee that was not only filthy but looked like it had been caught in a flood.  I laughed until my buddy pointed to the License Plate on the car and it was from ""Louisiana"".  Katrina Salvage anyone?

I have to say, once we were going to walk off the lot, the ""original"" sales guy ran out and tried to wheel and deal, but by then I was so disgusted we politely excused ourselves and left.  Later we looked at each other and thought, here was a great example of why car dealers get such a bad rap.  The type of place that makes you want to take a shower afterwards.

I understand people have to make a living and people need to sell, but you don't have to be a jerk about it.  There are too many other dealerships that you don't have to subject yourself to the indignity of one like Huntington Beach Jeep.  Yeah guys, your ""Monkey in the Trunk"" logo fits you perfectly!

well, I get this call that said, ""Congratulations, we found you a loan, you can pick up your car!"" I said ""what? You were just supposed to be getting me figures!"" Of course, the figure was too high, and by then I was most unhappy that they had secured a loan without my permission.

When I spoke to the advisor she asked for me to go outside to get the service card And I had to explain what the previous person advised me.  She didn’t even have her name on the paperwork it was another guy who didn’t even help me.  For a simple oil change and tire rotation I took 4 hours to complete.

Well those 10 minutes turned in 4 hours cuz They completed the service at 11:30 am.  I even had to ask if there was any recommended service still needed. Another service agent had to look it up and stated oh yes filters can be replaced.

14217,19-Jun-19,"After extensive correspondence back and forth with their Online Sales representative, I thought the final price was settled and agreed upon. Originally the sales person quoted me at $923 for DMV fees, which meant they were calculating this 60k truck as if it cost over 150k. I thought this was insane so I used the DMV calculator from the official DMV website to double check and they were indeed up-charging like crazy.  I let him know that as a non-resident, active duty military I would be waved from some fees. Salesman came back with $110 for DMV fees. Sounded good.  When I visited the dealership and it was time to sign all the documents with their finance guy, they changed the sales tax because it was ""miscalculated"". Even though the salesman acknowledged my zip code multiple times in our emails. This I could accept because I didn’t expect them to pay it for me. I signed all the documents and called it a day. About 3 weeks later I get a text from the same finance guy demanding an additional $338 for DMV fees, after going back and forth trying to understand why I would absorb their mistakes, he threatens me with his office manager calling my commanding officer to collect the money. This is incredibly illegal and plain unethical and unprofessional. I then resulted to having the Base Legal Office get involved and rectify. Ultimately, after Legal got involved they accepted their own mistakes. 
Hypothetically speaking, these people could quote you $1 for certain fees and then threaten and demand different amounts. That’s pretty vile.

Of course he had never heard of it but would look into it. I returned to get my Jeep. They had detailed my Jeep but the scratches were still there. I was told to go out to the waiting room and they would bring my Jeep up in a couple of minutes. I waited over 30 minutes  for them to bring my car to me.

14302,15-Nov-18,"I had been looking around for the new 2019 Ram Rebel and on a RAM truck message forum (5thgenrams.com), I was referred to Max B as another local forum member just picked up a Laramie trim from Max.

This dealership had tons of Rebels compared to other dealers who had little to none. So I figured they have the most inventory means they know how to get one for me??

So I call Max B. and introduce myself and tell him that I was referred by a forum member.

1st red flag - Max did not care about the referral or his deal - he just wanted to sell me a truck. Max was offended when I told him that of the 35 Ram Rebels in stock that I could not pick one.

So he asks some questions and I give him answers.
I offered to send a build sheet from the Ram website so that he can look for an incoming Rebel that met my needs. 
I email him my build sheet and he calls back and starts to ask questions on package options and such.

2nd red flag - Max arrogantly states that a 3.6L engine (base) can not be had on a Rebel and never will be. That was a lie - there were a couple of 3.6L Rebels popping up in San Diego and Lake Elsinore using the Ram truck locator.  I could tell Max wanted me to just take a truck off their lot and forgo looking for a 3.6L engine.  I felt that Max was lazy and didn't want to pick up his fingers to locate an incoming or find a factory order D1 or KZ status.

3rd red flag - Max says why get a V6 engine when a REAL MAN drives a V8 Hemi. I try to explain that I am not going to haul, not going to tow, and need the truck as a daily driver. 

Max making that sexist remark is unheard of these days unless he came from a trailer trash area of Georgia.

4th red flag - Max would not tell me which is more affordable to lease on a Rebel when we started to talk about numbers.  He just said he has no idea about residuals and money factors.  Huge mistake - all salespeople are taught to give out base numbers when a customers asks - how do they close a customer ???

5th red flag - Max laughs at me when I try to change over to a Big Horn trim with a 3.6L engine and says that a special order will take 6-8 weeks. That was a lie - there were tons of dealers receiving Big Horns with base 3.6L engines. As a matter of fact I just test drove the Big Horn at an Anaheim dealer 2 weeks prior.

6th red flag - When asked about special ordering, Max immediately changed his superior attitude to that of condescending.  Max did not want to do a special order because it means he would have to work.  I could tell Max wanted to sell a truck to me now - not in 6-8 weeks for a special order.  How a car dealership survives without having some of their sales on a custom order is beyond me.

Do NOT do business with this person or dealer - he will lie thru his teeth to get you into any car they have.  
Max lacks basic customer service skills, no knowledge of financial numbers, will berate you if you want a special order, and make sexist remarks.  
Beware females who are independent - Max will rub you the wrong way as he did to me.",6,21,-1

When I asked why wasn’t everything flashed as I asked and was written in the order I was told that was all I needed.  

The flash did not solve my problem and when I returned I was told they could flash everything but it wasn’t necessary because only the pcm controller the blower.  I told the service writer to again update and flash everything and was told “That’s a lot more work” and that I would be charged again.  When I asked if that was why they didn’t do it in the first place I felt like I was treated dismissively and I was not given an answer.  I asked for some consideration because the service was not done as I asked and the service writer was kind enough to only charge me 2/3 the price of the original price.

I dealt with Max, seems very friendly at first and was quick to write you up for the advertised price to make you happy, but after a while he makes you feel as if your wasting his time and was very condescending. 

After going back to the finance guy, they sneak a lot of things to add up the cost which I did not want, was not negotiated and he was not willing to take off. Also he was not aware of the price that was negotiated upfront. Somehow they were trying to sell me the vehicle at two different prices and clearly not on the same page in the upfront price with Max. I saw the red flag in their fishy process and all they were doing is playing games to con me. The nice discounted price disappeared. All he did was lower my monthly to make me happy since they did not budge on the net cost, but up their interest rate to 8.9%!!  I have excellent credit and should not pay their outrageous rates!

BUT he can offer me a lease a 8%... bait and switch. BUT it gets worse. I decline and leave... and sure enough the next day a DIFFERENT salesman contacts me and states he CAN get me the 3%. I respond anything over is unacceptable, but if you can really get me under 4%, I'll still buy the car. He comes back and offers 5.5%... They had my credit history PRIOR to running my credit. Then told me 3%. Then no deal but a horrible lease deal. Then magically the next day he can't swing 3% but can get me a loan for 5.5%. How does it go the night before from NO DEAL you are screwed... to 5.5 % the next day? How? Because they commit lender fraud and try and make you love the car, commit to buy, then state the only deal they can give you is HORRIBLE. IF you won't take the bad lease, they will send you home. Then they finally make a REAL effort for the loan, you grab the 5.5% and they get a kick back from the lender. I'm contacting Chrysler, the state of CA, the BBB and speaking with an attorney. I was smart and got the entire exchange in writing via email and the attorney confirmed they did a blantant bait and switch. Buyer beware and do ALL negotiating via email. Ver very untrustworthy group...

My husband and I have excellent credit and good income also we had a check from our credit union pre-approved for $50,000. We felt like as if we wasted his time didn't feel like he really wanted to help or even care to sell the cars to us.

14511,15-Oct-14,"Stay away from these guys, COMPLETE DIRT BAGS!!!! My problem started over a month ago when I contacted these guys about a new Jeep Rubicon X. I was emailed back by a sales person named Garrett. He informed me he could give me 1k off sticker. I politley thanked him and said, I could get at least 3k off sticker at several other dealerships, at which point he became beligerant and typed back in all CAPS. I have purchased 4 different vehciles from this dealership in the past and forwarded his emails to the owner of Orange Coast, Jon Gray. I had his email from him thaking me for my prior purchases. Mr. Gray responded back saying that Garret's conduct was unprofessional and said that it was not indicative of his employees attitudes. I accepted his apology and he got me in touch with a new ""Salesperson"" named Ken. Ken assured me that I would be getting 4k off the sticker of the vehicle to make up for the service, which I thought was great.

It started out just fine. I was going to use OC Motorsports to build the jeep and we were going to wrap some of the cost of the lift into the financing. It took almost 2 weeks for the lift and pricing to be finalized through OC motorsports (Partly my fault since we priced out several different suspension packages). During that time they sold the vehicle they had quoted me on. When I inquired when they could get me another, Ken said yes, but now my discount would only be 2k as it was a new model year (Had I known that I would have been down at the dealership day one). The classic 1990's used car salesman bait and switch!!!! At this point I wasn't happy,  but I wanted to see where the numbers landed. Ken had all of a sudden dissapeared and wouldnt return my emails. After my third email he ""Apologized"" that he had been busy with end of the month (Like he couldnt shoot me a 2 line email letting me know that"" and said he would have my numbers shortly. 

Two days later I get an email, not from Ken, but from the original rude and inept sales person ""Garrett"". There was nothing written in the body of the email, just a screen shot of their computer screen showing a montlhy payment that was $140 higher a month with an additional $1500 down payment. Ken didnt even have the decency to send the email himself to explain why the down payment and monthly payment was substantially higher. This is one of the most unprofessional, classless transactions I have ever been a part of!

I have purchased over 23 new vehicles since 1994. I have never been treated with such contempt or indifference. I have purchased 4 different vehicles from this dealership, so to say I have been loyal to them is an understatement. I bought my 2014 Grand Cherokee SRT8 from Poway Jeep because Orange Coast wouldnt return my emails in a timley manner (Never contacted the owner on this issue). This dealerships service and employees are sub par and define why the general public cant stand the buying process. Buyer beware, absolutley an untrustworthy dealership!!!!!!!!!!",6,21,114
14513,29-Apr-14,"This review is for sales services only. 

Ok experience. I came 3 times total. End up buy the jeep wrangler Sahara 4 doors here, because I like the car a lot. 
First time I came, no one outside great and show me car. 

Second time I went inside the office, then Cole Jezowski said hi and showed me the car. Test drive with him. I like him. He is not too pushy. It's his job to sale anyway. I asked him all kind of questions about the car and finance. Then I walked away. I told him ""can we do this tomorrow?"" He answered ""sure, I'll keep your file here. So you come back I have all info ready. "" at least he was not rude. 

Next day I came back at 7 pm. Talked to Cole again for price and financing. I got the car for Around $37000 total. Waiting for finance was really long, two hours waiting. Cole is experience seller. He gave me an impression that I had some good discount. This is my first time, so I was trick. 

Although my experience was ok. I would not come back. I would not recommend for first time buyer to come here, unless you have good negotiating skill.  ",6,21,254
14514,07-Apr-14,"After several test drives of 09 Mazda5 at 4 other dealers, I went to Orange Coast Chrysler Jeep Dodge dealer to test drive one that they had advertised.  I spoke with the Sales Manager-Howard.  I explained to him that the price was fair but that I had seen another for approximately $400.00 less.  I told him that if he was willing to match it and address a ""check tire"" light and a grinding sound that I believed to be a suspension issue, then I would buy the car.  Howard explained to me that all their used cars have been inspected and are approved to be sold.  Nonetheless, he agreed to have the car looked at by the local Mazda dealer.  He specifically told me that a Mazda Mechanic would drive the car and make the repairs needed to correct the problem.  The following day I called Howard to confirm that the car had been repaired.  Howard told me that the car was still at the Mazda dealer but that it should be ready by the time I arrived.  Eventually I picked up the car.  About 15 minutes into my drive home the check engine light went on.  I immediately called Howard to inform him about the light (upon getting of the freeway I started to notice the sound in the suspension).  Howard told me that the car had been checked out and driven by the Mazda mechanic and that ""Leonard"" from the Mazda dealer told him that they had rectified the problem.  Howard told me that he would call me later to give me instructions as to what to do to have the problem addressed.  The next day I called Howard at the Mazda dealer following Howard's instructions.  Leonard told me that he was never told to test drive the car.  Furthermore, he told me that he was simply told to reset the computer in the car.  I relayed this information to Howard.  All he could say was that there must have been some sort of miscommunication.  Initially Howard agreed to correct the problems but then told me that he had given me such a great price that he didn't know if they had room to pay for the repairs.  I told Howard that I was willing to have the car inspected by my regular mechanic because I felt his prices would be more reasonable than that of the Mazda dealer.  After talking to his used car Manager Howard agreed.  My Mechanic inspected the car and wrote and estimate of the repairs.  Howard agreed that the repair cost was fair and would get back to me to arrange repairs.  The next day Howard told me they were only obligated to make repairs to the light issue because it was a safety issue.  Repairs to the suspension would be my problem.  I explained to Howard that quite frankly that was mildly interesting to me.  He had told me that the repairs had been done prior to picking up the car; Howard clearly lied.  Howard told me that they were willing to pay $200 to repair the problem with the light or to spend it any way I wished to.  He also gave me the option of returning the car back.  I told him I would call him back the next day with my decision.  The next day I told him I was returning the car.  Howard then told me that was not an option.  I told Howard we would be resolving the cost in court.  Howard told me that they have their attorneys ready for court.  A day or so later Howard called me willing to pay me $600 (total cost was $643.27) for the repairs. I paid for the repairs up front just as they asked me to and faxed them a copy of the bill.  I asked him to call me to confirm that he received the fax.  He did not.  I asked Howard assured me that the check would be sent that same day first class mail.  Thirteen days later and after several calls and voice mails, no check.  I eventually called Orange Coast (accounts payable) to inquire about the check.  They were quick to address my concerns and I informed me that the check had been sent out to my mechanic.  Clearly the miscommunication  and deception from the ""Sales Manager"" need to be addressed.  Howard at Orange Coast Chrysler Jeep Dodge is the epitome of a car salesman.  ",6,21,96

14529,22-Jul-12,"My experience with this dealership was one of the more unpleasant experiences in recent memory.  The sales people were flat out dishonest.  One quoted me a price more then $2000 higher than the price they listed on their website for that same vehicle.  When I pointed it out they claimed it was an error so I gave them another shot.  When I went back in, however, the vehicle online had been ""sold"" and they claimed there was only vehicle in the entire region that would fit my needs.  5 minutes, a google search, and phone call later I found a similar vehicle (grand cherokee overland, black, 4x4) down the street for $3000 less than this place quoted me.  Also, at least one product specialist couldn't even answer simple questions about the vehicle.  In sum, I was very disappointed with their business practices and would not recommend them to anyone.

14542,27-Mar-12,"I purchased a 2011 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon in November of 2011. After two months had passed I still had not recieved registration, tags, or a license plate.  When I called in February to find out what was happening I was told that November was a busy month and not to worry, my license and tags would be coming. When March arrived I called again and  was told to talk to Alicia the DMV girl but every phone call to her resulted in a message on her machine and not one time in a weeks period did I receive a return call. In complete frustration I went to the DMV and was informed that the car was owned by a woman and they would not give me her name. The next day I called to the dealership and  was unable to get David Reed, Alicia or Brian Cole to answer there phones. When I asked to be transferred to the General Manager Pete Shaver the operator patched me in on his cell phone and I told him my worries and that I needed to find out who owned my car, that I had already paid over 35,000 dollars for. When he called me back the following day he said the DMV girl had accidently sent the pink slip to the woman who they had repossesed the car from.  He assured me that going to the DMV in two weeks he would straighten out the problem. After two more weeks I attempted to find out the situation and was told it might be easier for me to just go the DMV myself and take care of it. But then Pete Shaver said if I wanted he would at least get me the license plates. Well now it is March 27 and I finally recieved my pink slip,registration, tags but still no license plate even tho my pink and registration have a plate number on them. When I attempted to contact them again the exact same thing, message machine and no return calls, when I called the Jeep factory complaint line I was told to go to the DMV  myself and report the plates stolen and just get new plates myself, of course at my own cost. The amazing thing is that Jeep themselves don't care and told me there was nothing they could do and they did not want to talk to Orange Coast Jeep about this. I am wondering if there is some sort of legal issues involving this dealership and the rules of business involving the DMV. I am sure this letter will just be removed and discarded, because not one person I have talked to at this dealership or at the Jeep factory has ever wanted to actually do the job they are paid to do. I can promise you I will never buy another Jeep from any dealer, I am 55 years old and have bought many cars, Toyota, Ford, Chevrolet, and others and I have never experienced anything as horrible as the experience at this dealer.

14566,04-Feb-11,"Brought our 2001 Dodge Intrepid here for service several days ago because the check engine light was on.  They found several pressure leaks and repaired same for 1,000.00.  
The day we picked up the car, I got a call from their service manager asking me to return the car because they may have forgotten to check something. So, they let us drive the car away without verifying that it had been completely repaired.  In the meantime, my wife called me to tell me that the car was running very badly now.  We did not have this problem before taking it in for the engine light; the car has always run beautifully.
We left the car all day again.  They called me and told me that they had fixed the problem, apologized profusely, and told me that there would be no charge.  I picked up the car and everything seemed fine.  The next day, the check engine light was back on, and the car stalled in an intersection and kept stalling every time I started it.  I had it towed back to the dealer and left it there for the 3rd time.

14587,30-Dec-10,"I bought my car at this location -- horrible experience -- my recommendation is to never, ever do business with this dealer.  I received the worst service at this company.  This firm refused to secure my car after it flooded and I was waiting for Jeep to determine if they would cover the defect in the windshield that caused 3 inches of rain to puddle in my car. (This event follows several other instances of  of replacing the same parts repeatedly due to other defects -- which were very costly).  I had to demand that the Customer Service Manager secure the car so that no further damage would occur -- and only after I told him his firm would be legally liable did he take action to secure the car from further damage.  When I asked to speak to the General Manager, the Customer Service Manager refused to transfer the call, stating that the GM was was out of town (I had already confirmed that the GM was onsite that day with the front desk staff). 

When I finally spoke with the GM, he was very condescending when I requested answers as to why I had been given poor service and poor treatment -- he stated that the firm had been in business 30 years and I keep coming back so they must be doing something right.  Are you kidding me???!  I'm not here paying for rental cars (repeatedly) and paying for repairs of obvious defects because I want to -- I expected a higher level of customer service since they sold me the car.  The GM told me to go somewhere else!  Unbelievable!!!  In my opinion this firm should not be in business.  ",6,21,813
14588,16-Sep-10,"Summary: This dealer employs rude, arrogant service managers who blatantly attempt to take advantage of female customers and their perceived naivete.  This is also the most expensive C/D/J dealer I've ever visited, and I've used at least five throughout California.

The first time I visited this dealer, I was shopping for a Jeep.  The saleswoman thought that the best way to sell me on a Jeep was to take me for a test drive and then turn donuts in a local parking lot.  I left, convinced she was insane.  

The second time I visited, several years later, I had had my Jeep towed in because of a dead battery (jumping wouldn't start it).  The dealer sold me a battery for close to $300.  I had no choice but to purchase, as my truck wouldn't start.  The whole time, the service manager was conversing with his cronies and barely looking at me as he shoved paperwork at me to sign.  I was asking questions about my car's behavior and getting vague, ""you're a woman and wouldn't understand"" answers.  

The third time and fourth times I visited (failed LED lamp and transmission flush), the quoted prices were OBSCENELY high compared to either Pep Boys or other dealers.  I also got the same jerk as my service manager.  Although I no longer live in LA, tomorrow I'm driving 50 miles back to Buerge Jeep who will do the transmission flush for $100 less than Orange Coast. Unbelievable and unfortunate that Orange County lacks a respectable or even remotely competitive C/D/J dealer (Tuttle Click isn't any better).",6,21,148

14728,02-Aug-19,"my experience with star ford was an absolute nightmare. i had my car towed to them on a thursday. i dealt with service specialist Sam. she was nice on the phone initially and told me she would follow up with me the next day. i received no call from her the next day but i did receive an automated text saying i could contact that number if i had any questions. i texted the following day to check on the status of my car but no response. i called sam the following day on friday to see what the status was and she was unable to tell me any sort of eta, just that my car had not been looked at. i called on monday after again to follow up and they still had not even looked st my car and could not give me even a foreseeable date in the future that they would look at it. tuesday morning i called to let them know i would be towing it off of their lot since it had been there for four work days without any progress or updates on the end of the staff at star ford. of course, once i mentioned that, she then had the car looked at. she told us that she could not do a diagnostic until the battery was replaced which she wanted to charge $180 for. please note that the car battery was dead because the anti theft device had been enabled and because there car sat there from thursday to tuesday with no one looking at it, the battery died. i told her i did not want them to change the battery so i would be getting the car towed off the lot. i called her back to coordinate the tow and she did not take my call or call me back, she then went home for the day. when my tow truck arrived, they would not release my car because sam told the cashier we owed $115 for the diagnostic. however on the phone she told me she was not even able to do the diagnostic because the battery was not working. they turned my tow truck driver away and the cashier called me to ask for payment. i told her i did not owe any payment, nothing was agreed upon or signed and that i needed to talk to sam. she kept repeating over and over “i don’t know mam, i am just a cashier, i just need to take your payment”. i asked for her manager and she said he was gone and no one could get a hold of him. she and multiple other people on site continued to argue with me and refused to release my car. they said they were trying to contact sam or the manager of the dealership, manny, but no one was able to reach them. i told them i was going to come down with my title and the police to have my car released and then all of a sudden they said they had the approval from sam to release my car. this was the biggest nightmare of my life and was a waste of 5 days waiting on my car to be repaired or even looked at. i had it towed to a locally owned garage and they looked at it same day - come to find that they were able to charge the battery and it worked again. they suggested we get a new battery but i was able to drive off the lot same day. i will never return to star ford and i will be sure to tell everyone i know about the absolute headache of an experience i dealt with there. even if i didn’t feel that they were trying to swindle me with repair work i didn’t reall need done or a battery that didn’t need replacing - the worst part still would have been sam and the way she dealt with my situation. she never returned my calls and deliberately passed my account on to someone else so she didn’t have to deal with me. i’m also very disappointed that the manager never got involved or contacted me after the fact.

Last oil change I was told by your customer service representative that I would be to have my brake fluids changed within the next service or so. He quoted me around $300 and I told him I would most likely do it the next time I came in. This time I came in and the cs rep mentioned nothing about the brake fluids needing changing but then gave me a list of over $800 worth of services she recommended. When I got my car report it said that my brake fluids were completely green-- it wasn't even yellow like the report said last time I came in. This is contradictory information and as a customer I don't know if I can trust your business.

It was 2pm and I had not heard back yet so I decided to call to get an update. I was then informed that the vehicle had been ready. Excuse me, so why did I get a call to inform me of that my vehicle was ready. I didn’t say anything and just picked up my vehicle. The next day (June 21), I hear the break still squeaking. I called and was told that Kevin from the service department was on the line and would I get a call back. I called two hours later after I didn’t get a call back and spoke to Giselle from the service department and she informed Kevin is yet again on the phone. I explained the situation to her and she asked me to bring the car in again, mind you I had to get a day off to bring in the vehicle. at this point, I am frustrated because I asked for the day off work had to pay for two Lyfts and the car was not fixed which was the reason I brought it in the first place. Instead of assisting me, she was completely rude and hung up on me.

Wednesday my father and Brother go in to take the car. Eddie was rude to my brother and not answering him why or how long for the part to come. He avoids my brother and calls the sales man who sold the car, his name is Nardos (Nick). He was extremely rude to my family to a point where my brother told him back the F... up and they left.

Very terrible customer service on both service agent and the sales agent. I still don't know from Eddie the service department about the part.

Then after they had my car for 4 days, I picked it up and it broke down again, for the same reason. Which is to say the technician pretended to fix my car and sent me back out onto the streets with a dangerous and faulty transmission.

I called and was told that they don’t offer rentals and that what they did provide was a one way Lyft voucher, I then mentioned that I had received a postcard with a rental offer and she said ok when you come in prove it. Then I asked how long it would be she said it would be around half a day. I said ok, thank you. I then call the 800 number and fortunately spoke to the same person that I had spoken to before and he called the dealership spoke to them and assured me not to worry everything is set up. I finally show up to my appointment and as soon as I let the service technician know I’m getting a rental he looks at me with disdain and was appalled then proceeds to tell me that I don’t need a rental and they don’t give out rentals for this type of Service.

14941,25-Apr-19,"I considered my experience poor for the following reasons: I received a recall letter in December 2018 letting me know that I needed to take my Ford Focus for Safety Recall service. The letter indicated that I would receive a notification when the parts arrived, so I could make an appointment. The first quarter came and went, and I never received a notification. When I called the service department, I learned that they had the parts. The service representative was not friendly and in a short and dismissive tone, told me that, ""Ford does not offer service for safety recall cars on Fridays."" I was stunned when I heard this! Fixing safety recall cars should be a priority at Ford: these defective cars can potentially cause an accident, as your letter clearly states, and endanger my safety and others.  
Then, when I took my car for service, Ford didn't want to pay for the Lyft driver because my work is over 10 miles from the dealership--my work is only 12 miles away from Glendale. In my opinion, this must be part of the ""free of charge service."" 

Finally, when I went to pick up the car, the cashier who called to get the car from the service department, was unfriendly and not even made eye contact with me once. She made me feel as if I had done something wrong for taking my car to fix the defect.

I always praised Ford not only for its quality of cars but excellent service. Now, I have nothing good to say: Since I bought the Ford Focus, I have taken it 3 times for service all related to the defect engine and CPV. And all three times, the service has been mediocre. I definitely, won't buy nor recommend to friends and family to buy a Ford.

I took my car for a diagnose again since they were not able to repair the shuddering transmission and long delay acceleration last time I took it, and for me to qualify for the settlement of the lawsuit I needed another diagnose. They had zero understanding, they just wanted to get rid of me and told me that now they had a new error code on the throttle body. And until I would not fix the throttle body ($1,200!!!!) they could not diagnose the transmission. For the record, the throttle body is a small part that costs $37 and a normal mechanic can replace in literally 15 min for $20.

I didnt hear anything Friday night or Saturday morning, I go back to work on Sunday so I needed a vehicle,  and texted the number that was given to me for text updates.

I'm sure for basic service they're fine. When it comes to system updates or anything ford warranty related - they simply don't know what they're doing or have hacks to get around the system.

When this happened to me they held my truck and I had to fight to get it back in working order. The switched my person several times in the name of convenience, but the reality is they do this to change the story on you so that there isn't any accountability on what the previous person promised or said.

I was told it would be a simple update. No more than a couple of hours. Day one I was told it was the wifi, then i was told it was Ford, then I was told it was my truck. I couldn't afford to leave it with them as it's my main means of transport or income. So they made me wait two more hours to get it ready and updated. A week later I bring it and told the part is in stock and it should take no more than an hour. 8  hours later I'm told it's the wifi, then that it's Ford, and that I have to leave my vehicle.

Understand by this point I've dealt with 3+ people all whom know little to nothing of what the previous person said, promised, or advised. So each time you have to start all over again. They text you and don't reply. They don't engage in solutions only presenting and making it your problem. Frankly some of the people are just rude and think it's perfectly ok to leave you w/o a vehicle and to waste your day.

15087,04-Mar-19,"I wasn't planning on writing this review but as I keep finding issues related to my car being serviced at Star Ford last summer I feel I should let others be aware as it continues to infuriate me. In July 2018 I took my 2018 Shelby GT350 with 7k miles in to have the engine replaced, it had a mechanical failure which apparently isn't an uncommon thing with these vehicles. It took nearly 3 weeks for Star Ford to even get around to inspecting the car and having Ford approve a new engine via warranty, I had to call in regularly to see what was happening as their level of contact was rather minimal.

After 6 weeks of the car being down I go to pick it up. This is what I find:

1) A nick in the driver door handle.
2) A nick in the dashboard.
3) A scrape on the rear bumper.
4) The interior was absolutely FILTHY with trash in it from working on the car and a layer of dust from presumably having the windows down for weeks at a time.
5) The driver side wiper was mis-adjusted too high and missing the cap on the nut.

Needless to say for a premier car by Ford I was thoroughly disappointed.

Now over time I have noticed other issues related to their work such as:

1) Damaged washer fluid hose from removing the hood.
2) Improper clips over the battery cover.
3) Steering wheel came loose while driving! For some reason they had to replace the clock spring behind the steering wheel when the car was in their hands, they obviously didn't properly tighten down the steering wheel nut. This is a serious one and could've resulted in an accident.

Frankly I am surprised the engine is even bolted in correctly at this point (maybe it isn't), needless to say I would avoid their service department at all costs. Maybe their sales team is fine but this would be the worst experience I've ever had with a dealer in regards to service.",6,21,11

I returned to service area and waited for 3 more hours til 10:30..
They finally brought my car and I was led to Parts Dept. to what I thought was pay for the 2 fuses that I know cost no more than $4 or $5 dollars.. to my surprise the total bill was $147... I was never told that it would cost that much.. I know it took only about 2 minutes to change those 2 fuses.., which are right on top of motor.. I told Seta that I could have done that myself in no more than 5 minutes.. She replied that “well, it’s already done!!”.. I went to the service center with a great deal of confidence in the workers.. I just went thru a severe heart operation and walked in there with a false sense of trust that I could get help with such trivial a matter.. it was 3 1/2 hours to change 2 small fuses which takes not even 5 minutes.
I understand the deductible part.. but even then, I was never made aware of what it would cost... I guess I was expecting friendly courtesy in making me aware that my suspicions were right and that I could just change the fuses myself.. Sooooooo disappointed..
I would hate to think that you are the type of establishment that would want me to install a new transmission when all it needed was a quart of oil..
3 1/2 hours to change those 2 little fuses .
$147 for 2 little $4 fuses.,.. and to top it all off.. the charging system still doesn’t work..!!!!!!!
It probably was never tested..!
Now you tell me, please, .!. am I making a big deal out of nothing????

When I brought up the TSB concern the service advisor said she couldn't find a TSB issued for my vehicle.  The service advisor then brought out a technician who said ""it's not bad"" and proceeded to blow off my concern.  I even heard them discussing how I found this on the internet and it's not relevant.  

The oil change was fine, and completed within the time I was told.  The additional service concern was absolutely horrible.

I'm not your average car guy.  I have a low production high performance car with low miles.  I baby this vehicle and I keep up on TSBs issued by Ford.

I was then told they may not be able to do the repair and only the service.  I was not happy.  I was asked if I could leave my car overnight, and I explained that I was on call the next day and could not, but to no avail.  Luckily I ended up not needing the repair.  Also they didn't clean the car.  Everywhere I have been, a cleaning is part of the basic service.

Basically, I spent 40 minutes waiting to just get in for my appointment and ended up with a very basic service.  Not sure why I can't show up and walk inside instead of standing by my car.

15252,09-Jan-19,"Selling absolutely quick. Think as you were dealing with scammer. After you signed the paper, you are done. No communication AT ALL after purchase. I bought car as promised, so I decided to buy it. Already over a month, and I still haven't receive replacement for my car because dealer said OEM is too expensive. So, I guess this dealer does not use OEM due to pricey on OEM. Imagine what they would put inside the engine, mechanical parts, aftermarket??? Of course, OEM is too expensive, so this dealer will try everything to get the cheapest, lowest cost possible. I know something is not right when signing the paper and wanted me to drive the car home because I am not in a hurry to buy a car, but I made a very very stupid decision. Now, I think I should better pay someone to inspect my car because OEM is too expensive from what the dealer told me. 

So, if anyone want to do one-time business, buy from Star Ford Lincoln. Otherwise, think twice before you buy from them. Like my co-worker said, ""You're screwed"". Yes, I am screw this time.

I’ve been a customer with this dealership for more than 10 years and I’ve bought three cars here but I had the WORST experience today with Freddy Camacho (financial manager).
1) Freddy was extremely rude and did not care about good customer service. He made me go home to get documents that he could’ve easily pulled up. 
2) Priced are not stable! For an oil change they charged me $48 the first time I came and WITHIN THE SAME DAY when I came back (with the documents Freddy was too lazy to look up) the oil change was now $58!!!

Ford even told enterprise where I was renting a car a few days.  They gave me 3 days on the rental.  Thank goodness for open ended contract, but I was paying for it. 
It took them more like ""several"" days to just diagnose where and why my car's gasket  leaked water into my car and verify my back up camera worked intermittently. 4 business days to do just that!  I called for update.  Ford rep left message without any info other than to call them back.  Phone tag ensued where I requested for detailed messages.

This is what happened on the second visit and I informed them I can’t be a day without my vehicle as I use it for my work. They got me into a rental, but I was still responsible for insurance costs. 

I call the following day and my service advisor, Randy, is not in the office. This is his scheduled day off and he told me nothing of the sort. So the previously in the day as I was text messaging him through the system, I was not getting a response. That prompted the phone call, which I was informed it would need to be held overnight again. Finally at the very end of the third day, just an hour before service and Enterprise Rent A Car closed, I was told to come pick up my vehicle. 

No more than 24 hour after picking the vehicle up, the parking sensor issue is back and the infotainment is buggy. Bluetooth is constantly dropping and the screen freezes. 

I emailed Randy, no response. I called yesterday to speak to Manny or Randy, both were busy. I left a message for the manager to call me about my issues and I received no call back. It it now 2 days later and I’ve heard nothing.

15336,03-Dec-18,"After having some work done to my 2008 Ford Focus I noticed that the Anti Theft (PATS) system had been triggered and wouldn't allow me to start my vehicle.  After doing some research I found out that the only way to have it reset was to take it into a Ford service center.  I called ahead to see if/when it could be serviced and was told by the service rep that it could be reset for $145 and that it would take approximately 2 hours to do it.  I told the service rep that I would bring it in the following morning since it was close to the end of business that day.  Once I brought it in I met with the service rep with whom I had previously spoken to over the phone and he brought out the service tech who would be servicing my vehicle.  I explained all the parts that had been recently replaced and that the PATS system needed to be reset, hence why I brought it into the dealership.  The tech said that we may need to have new keys cut and programmed and if so then it would run me $250, otherwise it would be $145 just to have the PATS system reset.  I was then told by the service rep that it would take a couple of days because of how ""busy they are"".  Having no other choice, I left the vehicle with them and waited for their phone call.  After a day I received a call from the service rep.  He told me that they were unable to turn off the PATS system because another part needed to be replaced (the ignition housing switch) and that it would cost $700 for the part and service.  I asked if they could turn off the PATS system without replacing the part and he told me no.  This didn't really make sense to me so I told him I would come by the following business day in order to speak with the service tech himself in order to see what could be done.  After arriving the next day the service rep brought me to the service tech and I further explained to the service tech that all I wanted was for the PATS system to be turned off and didn't want them to do all of the extra work of trying to figure out why else the car won't start.  After saying all of that the service tech then told me that he DID turn off the PATS system but that the car still wouldn't start unless we replace the ignition housing switch.  At this point I didn't know what to think.  First I was told that they could turn off the PATS system, then I was told there was no way to turn it off without replacing the ignition housing switch first, then I find out that they did in fact turn off the PATS system like I had originally asked.  The service rep then reminds me that it would be $700 for the part and service and by this point I was just ready to leave.  I told the service rep I would have the car towed to a mechanic that I know and have him replace the part.  The service rep then said it would be $195 for having the PATS system turned off.  We got into a little back and forth because he originally quoted me at $145 for that service and all of a sudden it shot up to $215 (""he factored in my AAA discount, thus bringing the total down to $195"").  After a while he agreed to the original quote of $145 and I had my car towed home.  It wasn't until I got home that I decided to actually see if the car would start, and to my surprise IT DID!  I didn't even have to go through the hassle of having it towed again, but because the service rep and tech told me it wouldn't start I believed them.  I'm giving this dealership 2 stars only because they reset my PATS system, but only after a few days of hassle.

We noticed the valve cover was leaking a bit of oil and brought it to the service advisors attention. He said it was just sweating. Then we hit a small rock and took it to Ford. The undertray was pretty torn, battered, and saturated in oil. So the service advisor recommended we bought a $400 replacement.

The first time I notice that the service rep did not explained services done on my truck so I was ok maybe next time, the second time I took my truck again I had to returned 3 times to rent a car due to the lock of customer service and the lock of correctly servicing my vehicle mechanically speaking as well. My truck was left on the roof of the parking structure with not only parts not working but windows open which causes for dust, tree lifts, etc. to go inside which I had taken to be detail days before, once truck finally given back after 2.5 weeks I had to speak with Manny (the manager) that promise me the heaven and the stars after I brought the issue to him that this will never happened again but guess what they just did it again today, pick up my truck as had to complaint to Angie, service department that other dealers have courtesy shuttle, she replied that they are only allow to use Lift but one way, unheard but finally she then send lift to pick me up this morning, got to the dealer with a positive attitude that this time my experience was going to be different meaning will be treat the right way... first after Angie at least took me to pay for service provided but never explained what was done nor at least a thank you, my truck was left outside under the climate, full of water due to the overnight weather, I had detailed it a week previous which frustrated me but thanks Lord Jesus contained myself then found inside the seat plastic cover laying on the passenger side along with the numerical tag on top of the dashboard so I said enough then I walked to Manny the manager to let me know that it was again an oversight ""again"". I conclude that this a pattern and that I should never go again since if this happened 3 times in a row that only tells me that Manny does not make his staff accountable
 sine the only question he asked me was "" what do you think I should do about it instead of telling me what he should do about it.

I approved this cost and then a few days later the check engine light was back on and my car quit running and I had to be towed to the Star dealership.  This time the serviceman told me that it was the coolant system and that I also had a gasket leaking for a total cost of $1500.  I had to approve it because my car stopped running.

So for a total of over $2500, my car is running.  I do feel like the first time that the engine light came on, Star Ford diagnosed my car incorrectly and I paid for a wrong fix.  I also didn't' need to have the gasket replaced because there was a very minimal oil leak but I felt that I had no choice.

So I walked through the arithmetic with him on one of the options, and it seemed like one was a good deal, so I agreed to it.  On my way home, I went back over the math and realized that there was a mistake in the arithmetic and it was a really bad deal (paying $900 for $450 of value).  I called Freddie immediately, told him to cancel the package, and returned to the dealership to sign the corrected paperwork.  Freddie had told me earlier that transparency was very important to them. However, not correcting the math error when walking through the calculation with him was not exactly transparent.  Brush up on your arithmetic before you go in, triple-check your calculations, and don't buy any of the optional maintenance packages!

While the MKZ Hybrid is a great car in itself Lincoln definitely has issues catering to their upscale customer experience that the other luxury brands do not. Unfortunately when it’s time for service for a Lincoln you have to take it to the Ford/Lincoln dealer where they aren’t capable of giving the kind of service and experience to a luxury car owner. This last trip to the dealer took them almost 3 1/2 weeks to get my car back to me for a variety of screw ups. The first time I brought the car in was for a broken seat so I got the oil changed at the same time and the next day they said come in your car is fixed. Of course they never touched the seat and had to bring out a tech who said he knew what part needed to be ordered which took another week to get and I had to bring the car back then. So now onto the 3/12 weeks of nonsense next, supposedly the part that came in the first time was not all they needed they had to order another part. Then a week goes by and that part came in broken I believe it was. Then they reordered another week goes by and supposedly they got the wrong part. In the meantime I get no calls from Seta their one and only Lincoln service advisor because apparently she is so busy to keep her clients informed on what is going on with their cars. Seriously I am expecting to get the car back maybe the next day after the parts come in and then days go by and nothing. I have to call or email to get status and of course we apologize for the inconvenience and I stay in their loaner car which is their only saving grace! So onto the last week when I call days after the part was supposed to be in she tells me the part they need is on backorder!! Wow so I ask her how long will it take to get it and Seta says parts dept has no idea, this was on a Wednesday and then only 2 days later I get the email my car is fixed. Wow I am shocked because only 2 days before the part was on backorder with no one having any ideas when the part was coming in..right! Personally I think they jury rigged the part because the seat still has a part on the side that makes a new noise that was never there before. Also all 3 times that my car was in for service over the last year it always took them one week to fix each item seriously!

I was repeatedly put off for bringing it ""could you come next week, we're really busy"" or my ""service"" provider ""wouldn't be in,"" etc. When I finally got it back to them, after having it for more than 2 days, I called to find out what was going on. They told me they wouldn't be able to get to it until the following Monday, with my ""service"" rep telling me they hadn't looked at it yet. At that point I came and got it. But the real kicker is that later that day they sent me a statement with a list of ""services"" they claimed to have done on the car - when their own rep had told me they hadn't done a thing - that's why I came and got it! After many years, and many thousands of dollars put into my T-Bird at Star Ford, they won't get another dime from me.  ",6,23,-1

15561,13-Sep-18,"Hi,
This is the second time I had to take my CMax in for a stuck driver’s side door.  The first time they told me that that was part of a recall on the CMax and they fixed for free. 
The fix lasted a week and then the door got stuck again. I took it back in and they said that it wasn’t covered by the recall and it would be $420+. 
I declined as I’m preparing to look for a new car in a few months anyway.  But I am now pretty certain I won’t be getting another Ford. 

I do want to point out that the service rep Seta was great. It wasn’t her call. And in fact all of the service reps have always been great there. All of them. ",6,23,-1

Sasha. To discuss my DISAPPOINTMENT ON THE REMOVAL OF ""SEVERE STAINS"" on my New Ford 2018 Edge.
My was SUV was work on TWICE FOR TWO DAYS at a time 48 Hrs each Two times it was there.
Mario failed to explained Why my SUV still had severe stains on the Roof and Brush Buffer marks on the side panel between the front passenger door and rear door.
He did not offer to ""CORRECT"" And  Not APOLOGIZE "" for the Poor Quality of work perform by his employess.
Instead of addressing the problems.He went into a long LECTURE, ON Black VEHICLES. The more you looked you would find more marks,and stains. His final commend was to take pictures send them to FORD for repainting Roof, because the paint now is very thin ....However, it would still have a problem.  ""Hard to Beleive That, Then why Paint ""????
ON July 24th 2018, at the time of purchase.Written disclosure or verbal was not provided regarding severe stains on the Paint and Windshield would not be removed to its original Factory Paint Appearance.

I'm a First time Ford Buyer and New Client of Star Dealership Company.
After your Body Shop Manager Mario negative remarks and bad experience with this vehicle.
I'am very disappointed and depressed I purchase this Ford Edge.
My family and I have not had peace and enjoyment.

15605,01-Sep-18,"After purchasing 4 Lincoln Navigators from Star Ford, one would think that they would receive prompt and courteous service.  Not the case this time.  Over the past two months, I have spent over $10,000 in repairs.  My last repair:  Brought the car in for a diagnosis and repair.  After being told that the repair was $199.00, I was relieved.  Then I was told they missed the cut off time for a part so had to wait another day.  Then told the part didn't arrive.  Then told the part was defective.  Then told the bill would be $1400 (all via email btw).  Then heard nothing from the dealership for days.  

I reached out to Alex Tamez, the General Manager, via email to voice my concerns.  No response.  I left him a VM on Thursday.  No response.  I left him a VM on Friday.  No response.  I went to the dealership and left word with reception and service department that I""d like to speak to him.  No response.

When the fob still didn’t work they said they would try to reporogram it for $145.00! in less than 5 min they came back and said that the FOB was broken and I needed to buy a new one.  Total cost for programming and new fob WITHOUT cutting the metal key was $363.00!   I asked for the old broken fob back and they said they threw it away as normal procedure, but when I insisted they got it out of the trash and gave it to me.   That night I went home stuck the supposedly broken key fob into the slot in the car and followed the reprogramming instructions in the manual and the old key fob reprogramming worked just fine.  Really, $145 for that!  I don’t even think they tried to reprogram it!  They just lead you down the path to milk you for every dollar they can.

15617,15-Oct-16,"Sales:
I tried to purchase a vehicle in April from Star Lincoln in Glendale, CA without avail.  I went in with printout of the same vehicle (identically equipped) from a local competitor with similar miles and said ""If you could come within $500 of this price, I would rather purchase from Star as it is closer to my home.""  They tried to explain that it is not the same vehicle when was clearly the same except for the color (black vs. red).  I am a realist and understand not all deals can be made based on a number of variables.  They did not want to make the sale, so I purchased from Vista Lincoln (GREAT dealership!) that evening. 

Fast forward approx. 30 days ..... 

Service:
I took the vehicle I purchased in for service as there was a suspension/steering issue.  They said they fixed the issue and replaced a strut.  After getting it home (nearly 10 days later), one issue was fixed and another created with the steering. I brought it back that week and another part was replaced.  Got it home and the same issue was there (approx. 10 more days later).  I made an appointment, brought it back and another MAJOR part was replaced.  Got it home, same issue existed.  
By the sixth time I brought it back (yes, 6th!), and after being in one of their loaner cars for over 30 days between May 1 and September 30), I was told ""the noise/feeling is normal.""  This was after multiple service advisors and the service manager (Manny) all sat in the vehicle and agreed prior to taking the vehicle in that there was an issue.  It took a call to Lincoln customer service to start a complaint process to get anything moving forward.    
The General Manager at Star Lincoln in Glendale, CA and I connected and he asked if I could bring the car by so he could personally drive the vehicle (Alex).  He was very nice and genuinely seemed as if he cared.   I drove to the dealership and he drove the vehicle and agreed there seemed to be an issue as he never felt steering like mine in another vehicle.  He asked what he could do as I explained that I had an appointment to bring the vehicle to another dealership for another opinion.   He said he wished he could have one last shot at it as he would ""personally oversee the repair.""  Again, he seemingly seemed like he wanted to figure it out, I agreed and he whisked me off to service and put me in a loaner minutes later.  Approx. seven (7) days later, he informed me that the issue was ""normal"" like the tech and Service Manager said.  He was very nice about it, but I knew he was wrong and was nearly infuriated and frustrated at that point.  In my mind, Lincoln would never be able to compete against the other luxury brands with dealerships like Star and I gave up.  I wasted enough valuable time and was on my way to trading the car in for a Lexus which is what it replaced.  I never had such an issue with Lexus (or Audi, Nissan, Honda, Chevrolet, Infiniti, etc.).  
After sharing my disbelief with my assigned customer service representative, she suggested that I bring the vehicle to another dealership for one last opinion as her hands were tied (at this point, I was ready to go to arbitration per the Lemmon Laws in California and actually started filling out the paperwork).  I chose to give it one last try and brought it to Advantage Lincoln in Duarte, CA, where they took me in with open arms.  After actually listening to what I had to say, they found the part that was causing the issue and replaced it.  Less than one week later, I had the car back and guess what, it was fixed! Moving forward, I am driving 25 miles out of my way to service our two Lincoln vehicles at Advantage as they earned my trust, respect and ultimately, my business.  
While all this was happening, I had my wife's vehicle in for service at the same time (we were expecting our first vehicle back by this time) which is under factory warranty.  They did find that her battery was weak and needed a replacement, but wanted to charge us over $160 to replace it.  Had my wife picked up the vehicle, she would have paid, but luckily I asked ""why would we pay when it is under warranty?”  It turns out the service manager did not check to see if it was under warranty.  Really? 
At the end of the day, Star Lincoln in Glendale, CA has fundamental communication and systems challenges to overcome as they are greatly flawed.  Things happen in business, I get it.  This situation was simply ridiculous, avoidable and probably due to the laziness of people who did not want to take the time to find the real issue.  After reading a number of reviews on this dealership, it seems to be a common thread.  
I can say that Vista Lincoln was GREAT to deal with on a purchase.  As a person that has owned 24 vehicles in my lifetime, I have seen the good and the bad from the Midwest to West Coast.  Vista Lincoln was open, honest and genuine from the get go.  Not like Star Lincoln in Glendale, CA.  
I can also say that based on my experience with dealership service departments, Greg at Advantage Lincoln in Duarte, CA is world class.  He communicates with the customer, provides updates and is honest about his findings.  Not like Star Lincoln in Glendale, CA.  He earned my trust to the pint that I said “If you tell me the issue is normal as Star Lincoln in Glendale, CA  stated, I will admit I am wrong an 10 dozen doughnuts to the Star Lincoln in Glendale, CA service department as an apology (I can admit when I am wrong).”  As you read above, I did not have to buy the doughnuts as Advantage Lincoln in Duarte, CA found the issue on the first try.  
I would not recommend Star Lincoln/Ford in Glendale, CA in any capacity.  Buyer beware.

15754,26-Sep-15,"When I first went to this dealership on 9/3/15  I was shocked and ecstatic to be driving a new 2016 Ford Fusion with a payment budget that worked for me and my family. I was amazed that Ford Fairfield gave me $4300 in rebates and traded in my old car  which covered down payments and the first payment.  I am scheduled to make my first payment on October 3.  I was also told that a Lease agreement was a better option for me to help build my credit.

What has since transpired is straight out of a tragic comedy routine and not a good one at that. I was contacted by a Finance Manager (22 days after driving away) by the name of Matt yesterday at 1:30 in the afternoon (an hour before I was scheduled to go to work) and subsequently spoke with the Finance Director Kenny Calderon after several attempts to actually speak with this individual. Their reason for calling was to tell me that funding had fallen through and that I needed to return my new vehicle to their dealership (in fact was demanded to return by Matt), unless I was able to secure a
 co-signer who has more credit than myself or the car will be repossessed. 

How can a car be repossessed when the first payment is not due yet and not late??????

What dealership runs a business like this? Why was funding not secured and in place before I even arrived at this dealership? I did all the online application requirements.  I was assured repeatedly by Adam Herren, the Sales Director (who I had been dealing with before even stepping foot into the dealership) that all was taken care of. I even spoke to him the night before and was told that funding was still all set.

WHAT is the problem up there? Do you have any idea the amount of strife and emotional turmoil and panic that you have placed me and my family through and nobody seems to give a rip up there, all I am told is it's just business!  I am left with no car for my family because our trade in has already been destroyed.  Our family is now faced with having to walk to and from school and work, because we are being threatened to be completely without a car now.

And why was I able to get the car fixed up with ______ and NO ONE said anything to me while I was up there at the dealership then??

We are not getting any real answers from anyone because every time I call and ask for this person or that person that helped me on that first day, I am being told ""they are no longer working here"".....right down to the General Manager!!!   

Am I caught in the middle of something???  

Why am I not even given the opportunity to make a first payment to Ford Credit whom I was told held the lease.  I am left in confusion by all of this.  I don't know what to do, who to talk to or who to trust.

I will never ever recommend this dealer to anyone I know and will be telling everybody not just people I know but everyone that I come into contact with about how this experience at FORD FAIRFIELD was totally life changing in one moment and a Nightmare the next! 

I even did a Yelp review on their behalf and this was the response that I was given:

15770,10-Aug-15,"Things started to go downhill after a great experience here. I knew I should have waited a month before posting my first review...

After a week and a half with the car I noticed my so called ""factory tint"" started to peel at my back window. After close inspection, these were not factory tint as my interior had water marks that I had to wipe off. (The marks reappear when you wet them by the way.) So, I had to bring the car in for Jeff Perkins to see. After ""speaking to the manager"" he pointed me to a local window tint shop called Pacific Sound & Protection that did the tints and told me he had no idea that the tints were aftermarket. I know, I should have inspected the vehicle before delivery but I trusted this dealership to know what they are selling. Honestly, I would prefer the tints to be removed and have another place of my choice to install them professionally at the dealership's cost.

Then this week I get a letter from the DMV called ""Notice to Suspend Registration"" on the car that I traded in because DMV says I have no insurance on it. Duh, it's not my car anymore so I transferred my insurance to my new one immediately. Of course calling the DMV with their ""stellar"" customer service didn't help but them pointing fingers at me that it was my fault. So I called Jeff Perkins about the situation. He told me he was going to make a phone call and then just hung up; I'm sitting there going ""hello?"" Since the letter gave me till Sept. 14 I decided to wait on any response. The next day I received an email with a subject ""DMV"" and a message ""Lisa should be calling you today."" I have no idea who sent that email because that message was literally the only thing in the body of that email. Two days passed and I responded to that email that I have not received any phone call what so ever. Then another 24 hours passed till I get a phone call from Lisa who left a voice mail that the Notice of Transfer and Liability was sent on the 27th; a week after I handed over my keys to this dealership. I have a feeling this is not the end of this.

Now, I could have sold my old car and get a better price than what all dealerships would offer. I know that for a fact but I didn't want to deal with the DMV part and obviously I had to deal with it anyways... Now that I read a few of my fellow Yelpers on here it seems this place has DMV issues.

Oh look I just found a bubble on the passenger window tints today, great... 

I still love my Focus ST though...",6,25,32
15804,11-May-15,"I bought my car from Ford Fairfield. The buying process was excellent, they didn't pressure you, they gave you time, and it was easy. However when I started having mechanical issues with my car, thats where the problems started. I use my car every day to drive to work, and i bought a new car so i wouldn't have to worry about not having a car. So I took my car in, and it was going to be in the shop for at least 3 days. They told me that a loaner car was not available because they don't do that. I had bought the car less than 6 months ago and they were going to leave me without a car after buying a brand new one. I fought for nearly an hour with the service advisers before they finally caved in to give me a loaner car. They had the car for 10 days, then after getting it back, less than two weeks later I lost my electric steering and had to take it back. I lost the steering due to them failing to put a ground wire back on properly. Again, I had to fight for a loaner car to get to work. 

Less than two months later i had the same problem with the ticking. I took it back to Ford Fairfield. This time they would not allow me to have a rental car or a loaner, even after fighting them, so I will no longer give them my service.


After buying a brand new car from them, they were not willing to give me a loaner car, which i believe is bull crap. I would never suggest this dealership to anybody!",6,25,-1

Not only was the sales associate Kirsten very rude, she lacked basic product knowledge that I would assume would have been taught at some sort of training. I was given more then one phone number to contact her and low and behold she was unreachable at either. She Did not return messages or respond once and pocket called my work cell after 2am. I contacted the dealership via email and asked a simple question, which was cometary ducked and dodged the whole time and was given the directors number multiple times. I would never visit this dealership again, not even if I was offered a free brand new vehicle. I would not and WILL not ever recommend this dealership to any living or dead person. Friend or enemy. In fact I will do the opposite and forewarn everybody I come into contact with about Kirsten the make believe sales associate that hasn't any idea what she is doing aside from bringing down the dealership single handedly.

Second service they took the fuel filter out instead of the oil filter. They also left a double gasket on the oil filter. Third time they serviced the transmission and left something loose and it leaked all over. Had to bring it in twice to fix this problem. Fourth time they only changed one of the 2 filters and were going to roll it out charging me for changing 2 filters when they changed one. Ordered a new truck but it waited 5 weeks before it was actually ordered. Several times I was told it was ordered but it wasn't. Then finally it was ordered but it was ordered wrong. Increased the oil change prices to almost double. Refuse to honor other quick lane purchased warranty.

15990,03-Sep-14,"I purchased a brand new 2014 Ford F-150 FX4 and got a great deal.  The experience was great in the beginning, but then it all started bad when I had to come back at 400 miles with a broken Navigation and Bluetooth.  My audio module in the truck was bad so the service department at Ford Fairfield fixed it and I never had the problem again.  I only had the truck for 2 days and had to give it back to them for 4 days so they could repair a brand new truck.

I didn't start having problems with the truck again until at 4600 miles my check engine light turned on and my truck was accelerating poorly.  I then had to race home from work and take it to another Ford Service in Novato.  They determined after plugging into their computer that multiple codes came up that related to the wiring in the car.  After having the truck for the next couple days, they determined it was a loose harness so they took apart all the wiring, checked the connectors and then put it all back together.  They then drove the car for 90 miles and released it to me saying no errors came up when plugging the truck back into the computer.  I then drove it for another 500 miles and three days later the same problem occurred.  I then drove the truck up to Ford Fairfield where the service department is now trying to figure out what is wrong with it.  

I brought these problems to sales at 400 miles and 4600 miles where I told them I wanted a new truck because this truck was already having so many problems.  They proceeded to work with me but concluded that they couldn't help me any further and I would have to take it up with Ford.  They attempted to run some numbers on getting a new truck for me and buying my current truck back but told me the value had dropped on the truck.  This would, therefore, increase my payments to almost double paying for the same truck with no problems.  I said I was not going to do that and we would have to work it out.  They were nice enough to give me a loner truck for the time being but forgot to mention it was a 2 day loner.   After the 2 days was up, I was told by the salesman that sold me the truck they couldn't work with me on getting me a new, safe, working truck.  He  also proceeded to tell me he needed the loner back and I proceeded to tell him that I work in Dublin and had no way to get the truck back until the coming weekend.  I was then told they could report it stolen if I didn't return it and I told him to help me out because there was no way for me to get it back.  I eventually got this matter worked out with a manager who was able to get two drivers to pick it up no questions asked and apologized for the experience.

To sum this all up, the buying experience at Ford Fairfield after I started having problems was absolutely HORRIBLE and I would never buy a truck or car from this dealership ever again.  I know it was not their fault that the truck they sold me was having all these problems, but as a dealer you are supposed to keep your client happy and help them out anyway you can.  I have been told constantly by sales at Ford Fairfield that they can’t help me, but in order to keep a client you have to help them when there is a problem any way you can and not dismiss them.  Unfortunately, this didn’t happen and I will never go back to Ford Fairfield to purchase a Ford product.

A few days later I had to refill the window washer fluid as it was not done at time of service.  Tires were under inflated causing warning to appear on the dashboard.  I though transmission was making a clunking noise and service told me they reset the computer control on the transmission.  Did not help.  Took it to another Ford dealer and was told the problem was actually with the driveshaft and Ford had issued a bulletin to dealers making them aware of the problem and providing a fix for this problem.

16292,04-Nov-11,"You, and Ford Motor Company, deserve better.
Working with this dealership has been one of the most frustrating experiences of my life, with the sales and parts departments and dealership management proving themselves to be idiots or imbeciles time after time during the month that we tried to purchase a new car through the dealership.
During the summer I ordered a 2012 Ford Mustang GT from Ford Fairfield. In early September I was told that the vehicle was being off-loaded in Benicia, and should be ready for pick-up in the next day or two. Two weeks later it finally reached the dealership. 
Once at the dealership, three standard ""dealer installed accessories"" needed to be installed to complete the vehicle (these were standard parts that are shown at ""build and price"" section of the Ford website, and the accessories were spec'ed at the time we ordered the vehicle). When we first arrived to pick up the vehicle, none of the accessories had been installed. During the next few weeks Ford Fairfield tried to get us to accept accessories other than what we ordered, argued that the standard vehicle already included the accessories and otherwise lied and mislead us. Four times we were told that the vehicle was ready to be picked up, and four times we showed the salesman the parts that were missing - even going so far as to show the sales manager the parts on the Ford website and show the salesman the parts on other vehicles on their lot. Four times we walked away without the car since it was not as ordered.
The sales manager blamed the parts guy, but after weeks of addressing the same problem, that excuse was no longer believable. 
We contacted the General Manager of Ford Fairfield to voice our dissatisfaction with the way his organization had handled the delivery of the vehicle. While he was astonished to hear about our experience, and promised to investigate further, we never heard back from him or anyone at the dealership. 
Everyone makes mistakes, it's how you handle those mistakes that determines your reputation. Sadly, Ford Fairfield has shown that they are incapable of providing a vehicle as ordered, or taking the steps to get the vehicle completed and ready for delivery. Their salesforce is ignorant of the standard options offered on thier vehicles, and their parts department is equally ignorant and unable to provide the correct parts to complete a vehicle. 
There is no way that I would buy a $10 part from these imbeciles, let alone a $35K vehicle. If my experience is any indication of the competence of the individuals at this dealership, I  imagine the service department is equally incapable and can not imagine letting them put a wrench on my vehicle.
So, really, you're going to spend $20-50K on a new vehicle. Would you rather spend it at a dealership run by and populated by idiots and imbeciles, or go elsewhere and work with honest, intelligent people who will take care of you and appreciate your business?
Please don't spend your money at Ford Fairfield - and let's hope Ford Motor Company fires this dealership group and gives the franchise to a group / organization worthy of all of our business.",6,25,-1

They fail to execute protocol and return your calls back. Specifically speaking on a phone call today with Juan Espinoza his attitude was disgusting and consistently cut me off every time i choose to speak. I personally had to drive up there and speak to Al Hammerschmidt the general manager and Scott Moses the service  manager for this pending issue to be resolved.

16527,04-Mar-18,"1 star is still a high rating for a place like this. Management at this place is a joke very rude and unwilling to help after you have already bought your car. Gabriel Martinez is the worst car salesman I have ever had if you for some whatever reason find your self here do yourself the favor of using someone else I wish someone had given me that advise very rude and disrespectful. Mr Martinez helped my girlfriend and I buy a car he quoted us 3,000 less then what my final price actually was. He said if I put 4K down my final price out the door would be 15k after putting an additional 3k down my price was still 15k after signing the contract I realized the mistake and went to go approach and talk to him about the issue. In my hand I also have the original agreement in his handwriting of the deal he made with us when I approached him he was very rude and disrespectful and unwilling to admit to his mistake asking me ""if I knew how to do math"" obviously I do that's why I was there it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out when your being robbed. He then proceeded to take me to his boss which I'm guessing runs this poorly managed lot and that was even worse because he wouldn't even acknowledge what I was saying. His counterarguments were ""I didn't drag you in here you came to us"" and ""I should stop complaining because I'm going to make my girlfriend feel bad about the deal and I should be supporting her instead"". Who in the world is he to tell me that? These individuals have no integrity or customer service values needed to run a successful business. I acknowledge I signed a contract and it's final all I wanted was an explanation as to what happened to my 3k extra down payment and all I got was a bunch of insults and run arounds.

Today, 12/8 I receive THREE calls back to back from 619-474-6431, I was at work so I did not answer but after the third call, I answered just in case it was a family member.

We can remove you from the follow up list. You inquired and came to see some civics. You were interested in a car so we follow up to see if you're ready to make a purchase. You can reply here and I can remove you from the follow up list. Works better than hanging up the phone. Let me know, thanks!"" I was fine with his initial text but he stated ""works better than hanging up the phone"" and then made me angry as I was at work and in sales and typically, it is respectful to call once and leave a voicemail. I told him I'd never want to work with a pushy salesman and I didn't answer cause I was at work, (I didn't even have to tell him that, it's none of his business but I'm respectful.) He then responds to me completely out of line, ""Between me and you if you hvnt bought by now... is for a reason. Just wanted to close out your info to make sure to not call anymore. If u don't answer I obviously dont know why that's why I leave a message for all I know you may HAVE HAD RECEPTION BECAUSE OF CRICKET SERVICE (what???). I don't know thats why I confirm. As I confirm that you hvnt bought a car and are not in the market anymore so will close out your info. Now no one will call you for that same inquire.

I understand its a Honda dealer and the prices are not going to be cheap, but the prices should be fair and reflect the year/model of the car...its a civic for goodness sake. I was hoping to get quality service since it is a dealership, and instead I've gotten crappy customer service, no follow up, inconsistency with paperwork, misleading information. And still my car isn't fixed!! This was a no brainer- I show up with my car in the condition it is in, usually I get a laundry list of things to do and quotes so that I can have it fixed. Since Ball Honda is closer to me, I figured it will be easier for me to have my car repairs done there, and I wont have to stall any longer on getting my car fixed.
I chose to go to this place over Pacific Honda, because it was closer and more convenient for me to get to. I was hoping to get some parts covered on my existing warranty and then pay for the rest of the damages that my car has.

They agreed and kept our car for over 4 hours (we were told this was a 40 minute procedure.)  They said they would deliver the car to us.  Then they said they had no one available to deliver the car.  We went to the dealership and they tried to give us two keys.  Unfortunately, they were the same transponder code - meaning they did not reprogram the car... they simply did what was cheapest and easiest for them.  The made us wait hours to add to their ruse while they simply made a single duplicate key. To add insult to injury we were chased to our car and yelled at by a sales manager telling us to take the car.  He screamed four times that the car was ours and he was going to leave it on the curb (they have possession of both the car and the keys.)  Then he threatened that he would ruin my 87 year old mother's credit.  I informed him that she (a widow) had paid cash.  He said we were taking this (our simple key issue) too far.  We bought a 7 year warranty and all other recommendations with this dealership.  Within a full 24 hours of the purchase, we know this is not a company with whom we wish to do business.

He would not even acknowledge what I was asking him; in fact he told me either I was going to purchase the vehicle his way, or he was not going to sell it to me! I was irate for his total lack ,of people skills,and quite frankly somewhat amazed that he would let me walk without making the purchase. When I told him fine than I wouldn't buy the car, he put a gentleman named James Dunning on the phone. Mr. Dunning tried to make excuses, that possibly Mike didn't understand what I was asking him, and apologize for Mike's lack of professionalism, and courteousy, but my mind was already made up about him he was a total JERK.

We arrived at the Kia dealer and the first red Sportage they showed us was not the car with the quote but they would find it for us. We could test drive this one. After 2 tries at trying to get the car started the salesperson gave up and went to look for another Red Sportage which was on the Honda Lot.  We took that out for a quick test drive. The car was ok and had plenty of room. 

When we got back the salesperson kept saying this is not the car from your quote we can't find it but we will.  So we waited and I was getting very irritated at this point.  What poor service all around.  Then the salesperson said he would check on the price we could get this sportage but he would have to see his manager.  OK now we have to play the stupid manager game.  He came back with a quote of $22995 which we had a internet price on a similar vehicle for $21,695.  Now I know I asked for a $24,400 red Sportage but he said there was no way the would sell a $24,400 car for $21,695. He said the internet departments only job was to get customers in not to quote them. Excuse me didn't it say get a quote right online?  

Well we just walked away. Went to Nissan, purchase a cute little Juke and drove away in our $24,000 car.  

The bottom line here is we were willing to go to $22,00 but did not want to play the game.  You lost a customer and you lost any of our future business.  It is really true what they say about a happy person really doesn't share with that many people but someone that is unhappy shares with many. So no I won't be buying a car from Ball Automotive Group and I sure won't be recommending them to anyone.

When I asked what the costco price was for the car I was interested in, he told me that the costco pricing for the CRV had been ""cancelled"" due to high demand and low inventory brought on by the Japan tsunami. If I had known their was no costco pricing, I would never have driven across town to your dealership when there is one practically in my backyard here in Chula Vista. Great Bait and Switch tactic. When I called Costco why they sent me to a dealership whose prearranged pricing had been ""cancelled"", they were just as confused because they were not aware of the ""cancellation"". I think Ball Honda was just trying to squeeze a little bit more profit. Well good luck because you will not see me in your dealership again (plus I will tell as many friends and neighbors about your scam).",6,25,238

16936,01-Apr-11,"My wife and I were going dealer to dealer looking for a new car since I got in an accident and my car was totaled.  We finally came to Ball Honda and fell in love with the 2009 Honda Fit!  It really is a great car.  It's not so much that the people are messed up directly to your face here at this particular dealer, it's just that there are people there who seem to have no pride about their work.  Rich Reinbach was a manager and he was actually very caring, but I don't envy his job at all.  He works with people who seem to either have no integrity or are so blind to their incompetence that they just keep working there with no problems.  There were a number of issues we had with this dealer that made us furious and my wife normally does not get angry easily.  First of all, the sales person was ambiguous on which car we'd actually be driving home.  Minor, but these things add up.  When we went inside the room to sign papers, we asked that we change the credit card to be swiped because we remembered that that card was near its max. We wrote the new credit card info on the paper and he said he'd take care of it. The guy ended up swiping the wrong card anyways causing us to have to pay a overcharge fee.  The dealer didn't do anything to compensate.  Then when we drove the car home, the antenna on the car was missing and I noticed that there were some paint chips near the door handle.  The detailing on the car was poor quality too.  At this point, my wife is already regretting we came to this dealer.  I call the dealer and he says to come by and pick up the antenna and tries to tell me that we don't really need.  The radio would work out without it.  I listen to mostly AM radio stations, and I do NEED it!!!  That day I'm supposed to drive there ( I swear I'm not making this up) my battery dies!  I realized that my headlights were on for about an hour accidentally.  But this should be a new battery!!!  How could the battery die within an hour of the headlights being on!!!!  So I take responsibility for that, but my suspicion was that the battery was not as new as I thought.  I call the dealer to explain all that's happened to us, and all he says is...   ""Come in for a free car wash!!!""  I DONT'T WANT A FREE CAR WASH!!! I want compensation for the overcharge fee on the credit card and a car that has all the accessories on it when I purchase it, scratch free with a brand new battery!!!!  You already failed on that.  He made no further attempts to appease me and I never heard form the dealer again.  We regret coming here.",6,25,-1

Car was NOT COMPLETELY DETAILED and showed a lack of ""Attention to Detail"".  Body shop also demonstrated a lack of ""Attention to Detail"" by not correcting ""agreed to"" paint damage.

Another salesman was not totally truthful when questioned about which fluids & filters had been replaced.  And a sales manager tried to convince me a large dent on the roof (close to the moon roof) was there upon agreement to buy?  Both were wrong!

I had changed one on another of my cars in the past and it was an easy job. They quoted me over $750 to change a part held on by two screws near the top of the engine! Unbelievable!

I know how engine works and have a service manual myself, I asked them to take a look at it and specifically check the sensors (Oxygen) and timing belt since I hade the belt replaced recently.

It was the O2 sensor!! I was very disappointed because if they did test my sensors (which I told them) for continuity and resistance, I could have replaced it first and save me some money! But I was wrong in trusting them and looked the other way because the dealer says they are fine! Now, the best part.. I called Parts Department to check availability and pricing for O2 sensor, they quoted me for $330, I asked them why is it expensive because Honda at Lemon Grove is offering it for $223 dollars, the guy just said Ah!, we're different company"", and hung up! Didn't even bother to see if I could get a discount!... I'm fixing my car by myself because they can not fix it in the first place, and now I get this treatment?...Fine then..

The first time the electricity was out and service personnel were unable to perform. The second time I booked service through the internet and that did not go through. I called to verify and they said my appointment was not in the system.  The third time was over the phone to book my service.

I delivered my car on time.  The service agent did not write my contract until 11:47 am.  I was told over the phone and in person that it would not take more than an hour and fifteen minutes.

I didn't leave Ocean Honda until 2:30 pm.

It took three hours for what was essentially an oil change and inspection.

So the Car Doc package  was essentially a rip off.  I could have gotten better service elsewhere.

This notion that a company can waste the time of a customer like this is absolutely outrageous, as if the customer's time is unimportant.

This has no integrity and doesn't keep its word.

Because of this incident, I will not purchase this car at the end of the lease and I will never buy or lease a Honda again, at least from a dealership.

This is unfortunate because I absolutely love my car but the service was abysmal and I will never give my money again to a company that values its customers so little.

On top of all that, despite being forced to wait for three hours, the water fountain did not work.

Thank you for ruining the start of my new year.

This company has left a bitter taste in my mouth and I will communicate this disappointment far and wide.

The only one standard to compliant is in my contract.   If the damage from improper used outside force, the dealer just have to give reasonable statement of investigation for consumer to decide further whether to fix it from out of pocket or leave it as ease.   Therefore, it's very difficult for me to understand what is he trying to fulfill by telling me those irrelevant things.

I drive my 18 Ridgeline with 63 miles on the odometer home from the dealership.  On my way, I make one stop before arriving home.  I push the ignition button to turn off the engine and the battery dies... like 6 feet under dead!.  So, I wait an hour for AAA to arrive for assistance.  They run a diagnostic that confirms the battery is the problem and not the alternator.  They jump start me.  I drive around (as if the 30 minute drive home was not long enough) and try to back into my parking space.  The truck lurches and jerks both in steering and transmission to the point that I did not feel comfortable risking body or property damage parking in the garage, so I put in on the street.

The next morning, I go out at 8:30am to start up the Ridgeline and... drum roll please... the battery is dead again... I get a second jumpstart and let it run for an hour while attempting to call the dealership about this problem.  From 10:00am until 10:15am I could not reach ANYONE... NO ONE in sales, NO ONE at reception.  Frustrated with trying to reach the dealership, I decide I would drive back but just after a few minutes on the road, I have alarm chimes going off and icons displayed in the data info area on the dash.  Deciding that a 25 mile trip in 90 degree heat was not wise, I took this brand new Ridgeline with less than 100 miles to a Firestone facility I have used in the past.  They do an assessment and I'm buying a new battery to the tune of $207 for a brand new vehicle I have had for 16 hours!

I just spent north of $30,000 for a brand new vehicle .  While I hate to sound ""entitled"" the dealership should take 100% ownership for this issue and make additional compensatory steps necessary, because as of right now, NO ONE at Buena Park Honda is helpful!

I’m not sure if I will bring my van back to Honda of Buena Park, but if I do I will only work with Eugene.

In all this was a very discouraging experience just to get an oil change and a recall fixed.",6,26,-1

But not anymore for the last 2 years. 
I have an appt. at 4 pm but my car was not taken until 5:30 pm . It’s only a flat tire. 
I talked to Oscar Ramirez , service manager n told him my concern but you know what he said?Oscar said even if I have appt., it’s normal for customers to wait n didn’t even assure me if he’ll see when my car will be serviced. I told Oscar it’s been an hour n Hugo my service specialist didn’t even update me( I have to ask Hugo 3 times about my car service)
Oscar just said soon maybe. Not a good managerial service. 
Mike S. n his team were the best for 7 yrs. ( and I highly recommended this place before n always gave a 5 star rating)

I thought they every time check up all of my car.
Because every time they recommended to replace. 
I usually replaced them according to their recommendations.
I trusted 100% for service advisor and their system.

Last Monday(May 14), I heard strange sound around brake so I visited here.

The service advisor said I had a problem with the disk because I didn`t replace the brake pads.

I couldn`t believe that. I repaired last January but The service advisor didn`t recommend about brake pads. 

The service advisor said other service advisor recommended to replace on Aug but I refused.

However I visited three times after I refused to replace brake pads.

I checked all of report when I got from Honda.

On Aug, Front brake pads level was 3 and checked red.
On Nov, Front brake pads level was 4 and checked green.

what happen?

I CAN NOT TRUST YOUR REPORT.

I was sacrificed by your mistakes so repaired my car with an unreasonably high repair cost.

Last Wednesday(May 16), the warning light came on and I visited again.

I was very uncomfortable and upset for service advisor "" Martinez Joanna"".

She said that if they inspect my car and find some problem, we have to pay more than $ 100

18201,01-Jul-17,"I wish there were negative stars so I can give them Negative 5.
Here is my review about Rude and worst  customer service experience. On Sunday June 11, 2017 I called  Buena Park Honda dealership to lease a New 2017 Honda Odyssey Mini Van.  Spoke to Internet Sales person named Patrick . I gave him my requirements and informed him my down payment and the monthly payment . I informed the sales person about the quote I received from Hardin Honda and also informed him that they do not have the EX-L model which I am looking for.  Finally I said let me drive to your dealership from Riverside County and you find me a good deal since you guys have several of these models in stock. While I was driving he texted me a down payment and monthly payment  but I responded that I  am driving towards your dealership so just check EX-L without RES for me.  But he texted me again a quote while I was driving so I could not respond due to safety and reached the dealership. Here comes the worst part................ I was with my wife who wears modest dress and wears a head scarf, So this sales person came up to us, looked at us and with no smile on his face   without saying Hi ,he said ""which one should I grab,silver or White"" , hmmmmmmm  I said can I talk to you about the final numbers before you pull the van , he said ""Why did you show up if you didn't agree with the  numbers"" I told him it was your quote not a final number. He became further rude and angry and left  to his room,left us wondering if he will come back, he came back with the quote copy and said here are the numbers I texted you. I said can we sit and talk and he said , nope that is the number and I cannot talk any further. Then I said can  you talk to your Desk manager and see if you can give some discount in down payment and he said ""nope"". I asked can I get a copy of the quote and he said ""Nope"" . In my observation it seems like this person need a major sales training to learn how to deal with the Intercultural customers. He seems like someone who  judged us based on my wife's dress and our demeanor.  My comment is not about the deal or the numbers, it is how the sales person changed his tone and attitude when he saw me and my wife. I suggest these type of sales persons must be either removed or retrained from the dealership. The sad part is this dealership is part of Sonic Automotive group and I am not sure how he is working here without going through a training to work with diverse culture and working with people of color. 
Just so you know, while my way home I stopped by at Weir Canyon Honda and received an excellent service and leased my 2017 Odyssey within an hour. I am not here to advertise any other dealership but I want to make all my fellow Americans know to stay away from the fake reviewed dealerships on yelp or other review sites as my personal experience was the worst at Buena Park Honda.

18247,17-Mar-17,"I have lost absolute confidence in this location. I came here to service my car after I had some trouble starting it. My diagnostic report, however, was completely false. The report said that my ignition switch was completely blown, and the associate helping me said that the wires were ""blackened and charred."" I was told that it would cost $651 just for the parts, and over $890 for the repair including labor. I decided to take my car home without the repairs, and when I looked at the ignition, it just wasn't true. The wires were fine, and the switch was in perfect working condition. Additionally, even Honda's online site had the part for less than $150.
I tried contacting this location, and I have received no response. My emails were not responded to, and my calls during business hours haven't even been answered. I ended up fixing my car myself. Don't waste your time here. It isn't worth it. ",6,26,-1

So the guy tells me it would be about a hour to finish I decide to stay an hour isn't bad. I watched other customers come in after me some with no appointments and leave before me. I figured it was ok because I'm not sure why they were there in the first place. So I didn't complain I just continued to wait. The adviser could see me looking around for my car I think he could tell I was ready to go so he says it'll be out soon. After two hours I get up and try to see what's going on. And I see my car no ones working on it it's just sitting off to the side so I ask what's going on is it ready ? No one knows,  there was 3 guys trying to figure out what was going on with my car The help was great but there should be no reason why my car was done and no one knew or decided to tell me.  My car was ready and sitting there but now they couldn't find my paper (because it was on someone's desk under other pages, I think they forgot about me) and if I didn't get up to see what was going on I could've be there for another two hours. To have an appointment at 4:20 and not leave till 7 is horrible service. Who knows how long the car was sitting there ready to go. ",6,26,-1
18253,19-Oct-16,"So Honda of Buena Park screwed me over big time. I bought a new honda civic last week, took it and got it inspected by both Uber and Lyft, cancelled my insurance from my trade in, got rideshare insurance and paid a deposit which was my money for my car payment of the car I traded in. Then 8 days later they call me to tell me that they couldn't go through with the loan and that I needed to bring the car back or else come up with a $9000 deposit.
I was so furious, I can't believe that they would do something like this to somebody. 
Now I'm stuck with no money to make my car payment which was due a week ago and have to pick up the pieces and fix this mess that they pressured me into.
On top of all that, when I picked up my old car they gave it to me with a flat rear tire. What a way to top it all off.

Went to the local Lowe's for something completely different and happened to look in their specialty fastener drawer and found the same plastic fastener for about $1.00 each. Today I called the dealership to get a price for floor mat hooks, which many dealers sell online at a price range of $1.34 - $1.40 each with a suggested retail price of $1.85 - $1.90 each.

18274,20-Apr-08,"I purchased a 06 civic dx from this dealership early this month only to discover that the bank would not ""work"" with me on this particular vehicle because its value was less than the 05 civic ex  they were placing me into, and the bank was merely ""looking out for my best interest.""  After consulting with my banker I made the final decision on the switch to the 05 civic EX that had over 50k miles on it and a body style I disliked with a warranty that'set to expire at 60k (wow!).  James Pak, who assisted me in the transition was not at all the person I wanted to sit down and finalize the sales contract with.  He came off as being a rude individual.  He made me feel that I was there wasting his time when he stood and left while I was still deciding on what I should do about the switch he snidely replied ""I'll let you guys decide because I've got a lot of  other important things to do.""  Whenever he spoke to me his eyes were constantly blinking and rolling as if I didn't know a thing about purchasing cars when this was actually my third car-buying experience.  Before I had begun signing papers in his office, I also mentioned to him (as well as the salesperson, Sean Kim) that the brakes were worn out on  the 05 Civic and I expressed a deep concern and explained that I will be using this car to transport my  six year old daughter and five year old nephew to and from school everyday , but James Pak looked at me blankly, gave me the impression he didn't care about my family's well being and that he cared more about this car being sold. He made me feel his time was more precious and that he just wanted to expedite signing of the papers so he can go  home.  He  firmly insisted that there was nothing wrong with the car and he told me that cars all have a different feel.  My cousin who was with me while test driving this vehicle noticed that Sean had to pull  the brakes up when I attempted to make a right turn.  After waiting for close to 45 minutes on the forms that James had printed,  one or two of them which he admittedly made mistakes on, he told me that he was tired,  I went over the sales contract with Mr. Pak  and  noticed that he had increased the amount on my gap insurance coverage.  I asked him to change to what it was originally on my old sales contract which was 495.00,  I even pulled out my contract and showed it to him, only to be rudely interrupted when he snapped at me saying, ""To make this easier on you, I wouldn't be able to complete this transaction without that figure being on there""  referring to the 650.00 that replaced the 495.00 for gap insurance.  From experience, I know that gap insurance should never exceed 500.00.  I felt ripped off.  I honestly would not recommend going back here to purchase another vehicle if Mr. James Pak is still working there.  He'd be better off working in the dealership's car detailing department where he doesn't have to interact with clients on a day to day basis.  The rest of the staff was very helpful and living up to their motto ""Honda Helpful""  I strongly recommend Sean Kim for a promotion .  He has been helpful from the start and deserves it. ",6,27,-1

I verified that he would give me that price for that car and that he had the car on the lot.  I then drove an HOUR to his location.  Upon arrival he showed me the car, it was indeed the color & trimline I wanted.

We sat down to do the paperwork, but suddenly the price had been inflated by over $1000 with ""accessories.""  He had not mentioned any accessories on the phone.  I did not want any of the accessories.  But he would not remove them.

I go see the sales manager and pretty much tells me ""tough"" and that they can't do anything about it, except to go talk to the sales rep, who conveniently does not work there any more.I find it hard to believe that they don't care about their customer base, all over a $29.95 oil change. They were not friendly at all and were not very accomodating either. I would NOT recommend this dealership.I tried giving them a chance. First, the sales was poor and they tried to strong-arm us into trading in our used car for only $400 (excellent condition '91 Toyota Camry).

I have been in contact with Brittany the entire day about leasing a Honda Clarity Plug-in.
I was assured over and over again that they are able to meet my needs. I was told that this was confirmed with her manager Andy, and to come in.
Towards the end my shift at work, i wanted to confirm once again that this deal is still good, since it was an hour drive, and once again i was told yes.
Needless to say, as soon as i pulled up I already had a negative experience. I was greeted by a salesman at the parking lot, and was told that Andy and Brittany was not there. Attempted to call Brittany, but it went directly their receptionist.
After a few minutes, another salesman came to see us and said that the deal i was given is not possible, and was told to come back the next day. Not entirely sure why i would return to this place after this experience. He went on to give me a quote, which was no where near close to what i was given, so we left.

This is exactly the situation i didn't want to run into, since i was going there from far, so i made sure over and over again.

I was then transferred to his son Khaled who said he will check with his dad on the deal and call me back in 5 minutes. It has been almost 24 hours and over 20 calls and still couldn't get either of the guys. One time I got hold of him, he said he sent me text messages and his phone was acting weird and he again said he is in a meeting and will call me in 5 minutes and hung up.

I tried to talk to a Supervisor about this and no luck. Just more of the same treatment. If they treat potential buyers like this, imagine once you are there at their dealership. I am sure they are used to humiliating and intimidating people and forcing them to buy vehicles at high prices. I hope Honda does something to shut these guys down. My sincere appeal to anyone reading this is to avoid these guys. You deserve better. All their prices over the phone are just to get you to the dealership. They will not honor deals and they will try all kinds of tactics to make you pay more. Stay away.

I found a used Honda Accord on Autolist located at Honda World in Westminster. I called the dealership and spoke with Chris (salesperson) to make sure the car was still available. I also inquired about the price because under the price of the car it said to ""make an offers."" Chris asked for my number and said he'd call me back. 

Chris text me back and we agreed on the price via text (see attached). I clearly told Chris please do not waste our time. I clearly clarified and confirmed the price more than once via text. I was pretty confident as I had everything in writing on what was supposed to transpire once we arrived at the dealership. We drove over thirty miles on a late Friday night (last night to be exact) with high expectations on purchasing this vehicle. We finally arrive only to be told Chris had an unexpected emergency and had to leave. umm, okay! Jimmy, a salesperson approached us and said he could help us. We proceeded to test drive the car and when we returned back to the dealership we began showing Jimmy the text from Chris and he abruptly told us there was no way he could sell us the car at the price Chris and I agreed on. We were stunned!

Per the text from Chris he told us to speak with Armin, if he (Chris) wasn't around.  We then asked to speak to Armin. Jimmy goes to get him but he's apparently with clients. We agreed to wait. After thirty-minutes of waiting Jimmy informs us that Armin said, ""there's nothing he could do.""

At this point we are beyond furious and demanded to speak with Armin. Armin finally comes out to speak with us and he seemed extremely agitated as if it were our fault that Chris had blatantly lied and used bait and switch to get us to come to the dealership. Armin began to deny the fact that Chris had given us the price of the vehicle until we showed him the text. He quickly changed his tune and offered us a gas card as if this would seal the deal... NO WAY! This is just the beginning. I will post on every social media that'll let me post to let potential buyers know that this dealership is full of scammers. I will also seek whatever recourse I can from this UNETHICAL, DECEITFUL, DISHONEST DEALERSHIP!

This confirmed the price quote I received over the phone...

Guess what?????  By the time the service was done, I received a STICKER SHOCK!!!!!!  What was $199.95 came out to be $366+; Almost twice as much as the promised price.  Over the phone, they promised me $199.95 and in person, the pre-service quote was confirmed $199.95 for the Acura MDX.  By the time the service was done, they told me Acura parts were more expensive.

We had to return on 2/16/15 to resign a new contract because the bank would not finance our Warranty Solutions the extended warranty . So it actually worked out for us because it lowered our monthly payment which made us happy . But you know how it is when the finance manager say's sign here initial here and my interest was really only on what our interest rate and monthly payment would be . Well when we got home and after we ate dinner I started to look over our contract and I noticed on Line H of the sales contract we were being charged $750 for Surface Protection ""Invisiguard "" which I never asked for this to be put on our vehicle and our finance manager Duylinh Huynh never mentioned it to us at the time we signed the contract . Also in reviewing the contract every add on we did agree on for some reason all cost $750 my alarm upgrade , Honda Care Sentinel , and Gap Insurance all cost $750 .
The next day I called to speak to our finance manager I was told by Michelle who I guess is the operator receptionist that he was busy . So I sent him a text message ,. The following day on 2/18 /15 Mr. Duylinh returned my call and I questioned him about the Invisiguard and he said that all new vehicles at Honda World get this added on . I asked him why he didn't mention or disclose this and he merely said that he was sorry and he forgot and then he offered a free car wash next time we were around the dealership . He then said check your doors and you'll notice the Invisiguard and I said ok I'll check . Well I checked and I could not detect any Invisiguard . So at this point I decided to wait to cool down because we did initial Line H . About a week went by and customer service relations manager Thelma called to ask about our experience at Honda World and I vented my frustration about being scammed . She said she would talk to Duylinh about it and get back to me . Hours went by and she called back and she said she spoke with Duylinh and he told her the protectant has been applied so I told her that our salesman Tam Le told us that this vehicle had just arrived on the morning we purchased the car and in fact he had to go get the car from their storage facility and when it was brought over to the new car area it still had most of the white paper you see on cars when it's on the transportation truck . So I asked how and when this was installed , which I got the reply of I can have Duylinh call you about it and I told no thanks . But I did tell that I was going to have the vehicle looked at by some Auto Body Shops to see if they could see the Invisiguard on our new car . I took our vehicle to 4 different body shops and not one of them could detect any Invisiguard and when I mentioned I was charged $750 to one estimator that is ridiculous and they ripped me off big time . I am seriously thinking of filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau  ,.Don't know if will help since we did initial but not receiving it makes me furious . 
So buyers beware of this hidden charge and read every part of the contract you initial .

WORST CAR DEALERSHIP ON THE PLANET!!!
I don't even want to give them 1 star!
It's the old bait and switch. 
We had been looking for a Honda and found one on there website and called and they said they would beat the other place that had the same car we were looking at. Sean was the guy I spoke to on the phone. I told him we were coming from San Diego and would be there around 6 pm. He said no problem. Traffic was horrible and we didn't get there until almost 7 pm, but before we arrived I called them as we were getting off at Buena Park Blvd. and spoke with Sean again asking him if they still had the car and he said yes. (Now let me tell you the distance from the exit to the dealership is only about 2 miles.) Upon arrival we go inside and a manager comes over to us and tells us he has good news and bad news. (We already knew the bad news before he told us.) 
The bad news was the car was sold and supposedly Chris did not have this info. (BUNCH OF LIES!). The good news was (in his opinion)  they had other cars we could look at (DUH) and they would honor the price and accessories told to us. (ANOTHER BUNCH OF LIES!)

The first DIRTY LYING SALESMAN was a complete ***HOLE. He was RUDE and DISGUSTING!. I went to the manager and told him his salesman was rude and I don't want to work with him. 
The new salesman was nice and naive. He was new and hadn't learned all the BULL**** yet. 

After hours of looking at cars. They did not have another Honda that we liked. When they brought over an Acura we were interested. And then the haggling and lies began again. They did not honor there word to meet the price and accessories we wanted. Understand we knew this was a better car and were willing to come up in price but not get ripped off. As we were about to leave the manger said if we took the Acura we  he would give us 3 years free oil change, movie tickets, detail both of our cars and fill our gas tanks. 
At this point it is now after 10 pm and we are tired and exhausted with dealing with them. We quickly researched the Acura to see what a fair price was.
We told them the price we wanted and after some more haggling we finally agreed upon the price. 

Now the finance nightmare/experience. We asked for the 1.9% interest rate and was told by the manager that only people with good credit get that and we said we have good credit and the stupid manger proceeded to tell us ""that a lot of people say that but when we run there credit they don't have good credit."" Well, long story short we have good credit and got the 1.9. 

In the end we got a nice car but not without a nightmare experience! Did not get the tech package we were promised either.

18955,27-Jan-14,"DISHONEST. UNETHICAL. TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE.

I've been looking for an Accord, and when I found it listed on their website, I was very excited! I online-chatted with them on Saturday, and the salesperson confirmed that it was in stock and available. He suggested that I call to confirm a time to visit. I did- though was unsuccessful in reaching a live person (twice). No problem, I didn't have time to drive down on Saturday.

On sunday, I again online-chatted, and again the salesperson confirmed that it was available. I then called and dealership and asked to speak with someone in sales. I was forwarded to Andy (who I later found out is the manager). I asked him about the specific car that I was interested in - he said ""Yes! You're in luck! We have it here! We actually have that model you are looking for in two colors - silver and white!"". Great, I said. I'm looking for white. Can you hold it for me? I don't want to drive all the way there and not have it be available. He asked how long it would be - I thought, maybe 30-40 minutes, maybe an hour, depending on traffic. ""No problem! Come on down. Ask for me.""

So, we got in the car and headed down. It took about an hour. 

Upon arrival, I asked for Andy, and was told to wait a moment, and that someone else could help me. A salesperson named Sky came over. I asked about the car. ""Ummm, we don't have any of those in stock."" WHAAAAAT??? I explained that their website had several listed, in addition to the more pertinent piece of information that I got off the phone with Andy about an hour ago, and he said to come in and test drive it. Well, he went back to see Andy (at this time, he said that Andy is the manager). He came back and said, ""well, we have one in black"". Apparently, the white and silver ones don't exist. ""But....... it's not here, it's on the storage lot and you can't see it today."" WHAAAATT???? Though I had an inclination that this was going to happen, I was somewhat speechless. I asked to speak with Andy. ""He's not available."" Apparently, he was in a ""meeting"" that would last ""maybe 30 minutes, maybe longer"". This was on a sunday afternoon at 2pm. And certainly with very few customers on the lot. I asked for his supervisor and was told ""no one else is here"". 

I'm not sure what he thought was going to happen. Did he think that I was going to show up and be fine with not having the car there? Did he think that he was going to sell me a different car (yes, the salesperson tried to offer me a different one)? How did he think that this was going to go down?

I think what is even more indicative of this experience is that this is the MANAGER that I'm talking about. The manager sets the tone for the establishment. If the manager is unethical, then what can I really expect from all the people who work for him?

So...... lesson for the day? Don't waste your time. We spent about 3 hours on this fruitless endeavor.

I had read some of their other reviews, and thought that there might be issues with this dealership. I was hoping that maybe our experience would be different, but certainly the dishonesty of this particular dealership proved itself true.

And not just dishonest, COWARDICE on the part of the MANAGER - ANDY. It's not too many places where a customer cannot speak with the manager, especially in a place where one might be dropping $40k.

When we came back, the salesperson was gone but said someone else called and offered more money the next day ($300 more than we agreed on). He referred us to the manager.

He said it must've been a mistake on the salesperson to offer that, despite having it written down and in text message (we discussed options via text with the salesperson while we were eating).

There's a reason why HONDA WORLD WESTMINSTER has so many 1 star reviews. My girlfriend fell victim to their hustle. I was lured by their low price. My general message, listen to the warnings and bad reviews of this place! 

My rant/detailed review:

We were shopping Labor Day weekend at 4 dealerships (I'm one of those research hounds always searching for top value). I handle the negotiating because my gf doesn't do well with small print and contracts. We agreed on an all inclusive price with the sales rep Leo out the door inc. taxes in person. Later that day, I confirmed again with Leo on the phone prior to going in and purchasing the vehicle. Everything was good, we had a clear understanding of what ""Out the door"" meant. 

My GF goes back w/ her sister to buy, I wasn't able to go back with them thinking the price was going to be honored. Stupid me for assuming. Wow how quickly things can change...

They 'said' they told her it was the wrong price and presented her with a new price. Her story is that they were still using 'out the door' pricing when presenting her with the new numbers and they kept her there for almost 3 hours! I'm sure they smelled fresh bait after talking to my gf with the numbers. How could their price be 'wrong'  by $1500 when the other 3 dealerships were offering the same ballpark number the same day??? At the end, they ended up throwing on the 'out the door' (inc. taxes) as the purchase price, and added on taxes again. Taking about $1500 of our hard earned money. My gf, again, not good with contracts and numbers, signs away thinking the price was set. Their word is complete BS and they will take advantage if you don't know what you are doing. 

I called and spoke with the manager a few days later after learning about this. Manager was completely unhelpful and borderline rude. Explaining to me that all the numbers were on the contract. His general message ""She signed the contract, too bad"". It was a complete dead end. This dealership does not care and just wants to make the single car sale and move onto the next. I feel she was grossly taken advantage of and I strongly do not agree with this business practice. 

I take fault in this because I did not see this the whole way through, I just hope to bring this to light and help some of you avoid the headache and frustration this dealership put us through. Avoid this one and go to the other local Honda dealerships like in Cerritos or Costa Mesa, even out to Torrance. They are just a quick drive down the fwy. It is worth it to avoid these people!

Our sales rep was Leo Hernandez
Sales manager that was there was Vinh Nguyen

On another note, when I called back, Vinh was not there and Leo was on vacation. I got a manager named Andrew?, who was handling the transaction, saying he 'remembered' that one. Not sure what the name change is about. I told them that I was going to take my experience online to make sure people don't fall into the same hole, the manager Andrew/Vinh's response ""Go do what you have to do"", so here it is and many more to come elsewhere. 

Again: Be careful if you have to deal with HONDA WORLD WESTMINSTER!

Took a quick spin to make sure all was right and agreed to take it with the national lease deal.  Filled out the paperwork, waited, waited...low and behold, now the sales manger has said that they won't honor the national advertised deal.  We had a deal on the phone - that's why I came here - and that's the deal I want. Now comes the Sales Director, Vinh Nguyen.  He says stock is low - we won't honor our word or national advertising.  Next comes Sales Manager - she says we only have one - we won't honor our word or the national deal.

Plus, my wife and our nine month old son have suffered through these wasted hours.

I bought a certified used car from this dealer on November 5th and 2 days later the antifreeze was leaking all over. I brought it in a month later when I had the time since the leak was slow and have been told that there is a crack in the radiator and it needs a new thermometer because the old one is broken. The total….nearly $800. I thought that they checked and fixed used cars before selling them. I guess these guys have found a nice way around the tough economic times and no longer sell reliable used cars. I just think it is plain old crooked, especially since the mechanic we brought it to after they gave us that total said that the crack is not new…that he believes it has been there for a while and has just been getting bigger.

Rely most on error codes from computer, rather than driving a car. Thinks that cars are for showcase.

19338,28-Sep-18,"I want to start by saying that I am not a fan of these types of correspondences but I feel the need to advocate for myself as a returning customer and others. I believe it was 9/24 when I booked a 7am appointment over the phone for an oil change for 9/26. I made sure to confirm that the car would be ready by 8am, 8:15am latest. To ensure this, I dropped the car off the night before and noted on the key slip that I had a 7am appointment. I called at 7:05, no answer. Then again at 7:13, answered; after about 15 minutes, the receptionist was able to track down the service advisor and put some heat on the, for lack of a better word, situation. At that point, the receptionist informed me the car would be ready in 30 to 45 minutes. By the time our call ended at 7:23 (even though the car had been there at the time of the scheduled appointment time) this would work - I’d make it to work nearly on time. Ten minutes later the service advisor sent the text to confirm the service requested. Red flag, this indicated  that the service had not begun yet. 8:10 I arrived to pick the car up and waited an additional twenty minutes. It took 1.5 hours from the appointed service time to to the key being returned. I don’t find this acceptable. To be very transparent, I was annoyed with the situation because I took advantage of the ability to schedule an early morning appointment and option to drop the car off in advance. When would the car have been serviced if I did not call? 

Furthermore, if an oil change only takes between 30-45 minutes, as the receptionist suggested on our call, why did it take in total 1.5 hours? In the future should I not drop my car off the night before if I have a 7am appointment, does this cause confusion? If I schedule the first appointment of the day for a service that takes 30-45 minutes, should I assume it will take longer, and why?

19421,12-Jun-18,"This review is for the Service department at Stevens Creek Honda, and specifically for Service Manager Ricardo Pimentel and Service Advisor Summer Pettigrew. Do NOT bring your Honda to this service department if you want any semblance of Customer Service, or your vehicle to be correctly diagnosed and repaired in a timely manner.

I brought my vehicle to this dealership on 5/17/18 because it was blowing hot air out of the A/C. Stevens Creek Honda did a diagnostic and determined that I needed a new A/C Compressor, which was covered under warranty but they could not complete the repair due to a nationwide backorder on a part, with no ETA. I waited two weeks to hear back from this dealership, leaving numerous voicemails for Summer Pettigrew but she failed to return a single call. Fed up with them not returning a single phone call, I stopped in one day to see Service Manager Ricardo Pimentel, who was rude, unapologetic, and refused to do anything to get me into a conforming vehicle. I asked him about a rental car because driving a car with a brand-new, under warranty car with black leather interior in June with no A/C and no ETA for a repair is not acceptable. He said he would ""look into it"" for me and get back to me the next day- It's been almost a month and I haven't received a single phone call about my car from Stevens Creek Honda. I called HondaCare to inquire about my warranty contract, which indeed say I'm entitled to a rental car while waiting for parts or the vehicle is being repaired, and the rep over the phone said in these cases they can make accommodations for extended rental car periods, but the case needs to be opened through the dealership and there has been no activity on my account, aka Ricardo Pimentel didn't even bother to pick up the phone regarding my issue.

I made complaints to Honda Corporate, who were communicative until they got back to me saying this dealership won't return their calls and there isn't anything they can do in this instance as they are privately owned and operated.

The best part? I was driving around with no A/C for two weeks after bring my car to this service department, which Stevens Creek Honda service reps told me ""Just drive with your windows down"", until I took my car to a different Honda dealership up the Peninsula- they were able to complete my repair in ONE DAY and my A/C seems to be working fine to this point. 

These people, specifically Service Manager Ricardo Pimentel, are extremely dishonest and a disgrace to anybody that works in a customer-service type job. How hard is it to pick up the phone and return a phone call? Apparently it's very difficult for these people. 

I recommend you take your car to any other Honda service department if you run into an issue. Anderson, Capitol, Serramonte- driving to any of these locations will serve you and your vehicle better. At the very least different dealerships give you the courtesy of returning your phone calls.

Do not trust Service Advisor Ricardo Pimentel or anything that he might promise you. This Service Department even refuses, to this day, to provide me with a completed work order stating their diagnosis and they were unable to fix the vehicle to conforming standards.

I did eventually get a call from a gentlemen named Richard Artell, who introduced himself as the Service/Parts Director for Stevens Creek Honda. He apologized on behalf of his incompetent staff and offered to take care of me when the next service is due, but when I call back the next week I was informed he no longer works at this dealership.",6,28,-1
19539,01-Feb-18,"HORRIBLE MECHANIC SERVICES AT THIS DEALERSHIP. In the past, they used to check the car, diagnose the problem and then quote you for fixing the problem. This time my car wasn't starting, I jumpstarted and took it to the dealership assuming its the battery issue. They said  to just look at the car, they will charge $70??!!! and then will provide a quote to fix the problem. I said I think the battery is at fault. I had replaced the last battery 3 years ago at this very dealership, so could you please check the battery. Again, they said you will have to pay 60% for the battery as it is still under partial warranty. I agreed. But then they came back and said, we will have to run diagnostics to claim warranty and will charge you another $40 over and above the battery price. So, paying 60% +$40 came close to putting in a brand new one, so I asked them to put in a new one. They changed the battery, service charge of approx $30 which 3 years ago was free of charge when you bought a new battery. Anyways, by the end of the day, my car wouldn't start again. This time I went to a local mechanic. He said the battery clamp is loose and tightened it, and thus the battery was leaking. It took him 2 minutes and charged me zero dollars.

So I went last week to this dealership and asked the person at the reception to test drive accord and civic hybrid. His replies were as follows 
1. There are no sales agent to take u on test drive, pls take an appointment.  ( there were two people from Honda standing right next to me also there was one guy roaming around outside who guided me inside ). So I guess they didn't think ill buy a car 
2. I booked an appointment and then I was asked very rudely by the same person accusingly that why in the world do I even want to buy hybrid and even went on explaining that he drives a Honda Civic and it's pretty good. Well if Honda doesn't want to sell hybrid why are u making them? 
3. Finally the worst part of this visit was , after all this he says ""I think"" we don't have any 2015 hybrids in the inventory. Well in today's hi tech world if someone says he thinks and cannot just check on his computer that just says it he is not interested in selling . I did check their inventory after coming back home and they did have hybrid cars in their inventory, it just indicated they don't want to sell!! 
Well I'll be writing my review to Honda directly also I hope they realise that this particular dealership has a big problem , they don't want to sell cars.

19708,22-Jan-14,"HONDA OF STEVEN CREEK TOOK ADVANTAGE OF ME
During the month of July, 2013 I feel I got defrauded by Honda of Steven Creek. I went in and spoke with car salesman Mike D. and I test drove a used 2010 Honda Accord. The car looked fine and felt fine, and I specifically asked Mike if this car had been in an accident and he said ""NO"". My cosigner and I proceeded to sign all documents. About two weeks after I went to get my windows tinted the tint shop informed me that one of my doors wobbled to much and that I should have it checked out. I took it to Honda Steven Creek recommended body shop AW Collision of San Jose and after their inspection they informed me that my car had in fact been in a car accident and someone attempted to cover it up making it an unsafe vehicle. The body shop told me the estimated cost to have this car repair would be $9,137!!!. I immediately took this issue to Honda Steven Creek and I spoke with Samantha E. and I explained my problem to her and I gave her a copy of the repair cost estimate and of course she told me that there was no one there to help me and to go home and she will show her boss my documents. During a period of 3-4 weeks I spoke with Subhash C. General Manager, Moe A. General Sales Manager and Abraham Finance. I begged them to please help me out with this unsafe vehicle. I informed them that I feel they took advantage of me by selling me a wrecked and unsafe vehicle and I simply wanted them to give me for what I'm paying for and after numerous of phone calls and three or four visits to Honda of Steven Creek dealership they refused to help me out making all sorts of excuses and disrespecting my cosigner and I. In addition they went as far as to tell me that Honda of Steven Creek had millions of dollars to spend in attorneys in case I wanted to sue them. As a result I contacted the auto fraud legal center and attorney Hawk and his firm decided to fight for my rights as a consumer and sue this dealership for their wrongdoing!!!!!!!!!My case is currently pending in California in the Santa Clara County Superior Court Civil Case Number 1-13-CV-254207, in which Honda of Steven Creek is doing business as Santa Clara Imported Cars, Inc.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 In addition we just had a mediation hearing on 01/15/2014, in which of course nothing happen at mediation thanks to their refusal. 
Overall, I'm an American guy that is just trying to make it.  I have two jobs and I am putting myself through college (Engineering major) I went to a Honda dealership and not to a mom and pop dealership in order to avoid these kinds of problems and honestly, because it was a Honda dealership I felt I can trust them and get myself a good reliable car. Unfortunately, Honda Steven Creek clearly took advantage of me and even after I took this problem to them they have refused to help me out. $9,137 is a lot of money for car repairs. I can see why they would like to dump this car on somebody and get it out of their dealership. Once again a huge corporation is taking advantage of the small people/consumer and tax payer. ",6,28,-1

19717,12-Jul-11,"I went to maintain my car last week and asked them to fix my front wheels brake because I heard the 'gigi' sound when the car was moving. They finally charged me almost $1000 for only the brake repair, not including the maintenance expense.

I, of course, didn't let them do the repair and brought the car to a repair shop which only charged me $109. Don't you see the difference?

Don't go there !! If you really need to, don't trust them at all, use your own common sense and judgement to offer them the work. If they see you accept their advice, they will be very greedy and give you all nonsense, unfair quote.",6,28,-1
19719,23-Nov-08,"Walked onto the lot and was suggested to work with Steve.  Steve is a salesman with integrity, no pressure, up front and honest.  It was a busy night, Steve told us when there were delays in getting in line to have the finance guy look at our offer.  We appreciated that.  What happened next was rather insulting, although, I know it's just business.  Steve had to be the messenger... we were completely lowballed (by $6000) with our trade-in.  He stated that they do not go by the ""blue book"" values.  So, my question is, why is it posted for consumers to see?  Stunned, we left and Steve lost a sale.  

If you're going to go to Honda of Stevens Creek, definitely work with Steve.  Easy going, knowledgeable and honest (what more can you ask for in a sales guy).  And beware of the ""haggling"" you have to deal with, I just don't have the tenacity to deal with that kind of business.  My trade in was a Saturn, and wanted to drive something different.  But, due to my less than perfect experience with Honda of Stevens Creek, I will be purchasing another Saturn which was Plan B.

19721,18-Aug-08,"We received a price over the internet from South Bay Honda. They didn't have the car we wanted on the premises so we went over to Honda of Stevens Creek to see the car in the color we wanted. When approached by salesmen, we told them we had gotten this price from South Bay. They told us that South Bay salespeople were ""liars"" and that they could not give us that price. We were appalled that they would outright use that word. We were really put off by these guys. When it turned out that indeed the South Bay salesperson never came though with the car, let alone the price (she didn't even show up for our appointment) we went back to Honda of Stevens Creek. On the day we were to pick up the car, the car was to be on the lot. My husband and the salesperson had to drive to another lot (took about 1 hour round trip) to get the car. Then we sat down to finalize the sale. We had the price that the sales person quoted us. The sales person told us that the manager said it was too low. We were down there ready to buy based on the agreed on  price. The sales person was a nice guy but he apparently should not have quoted a price he couldn't deliver on. It may be the game they play, make it the managers fault. In any case, the difference was about $150. The manager asked ""are you going to walk away from the car you want for $150?"" Indeed we did. They were dishonest. We will ever return there. We bought the car from Anderson Honda for the same price basically but the process was open, honest and straightforward.",6,28,-1
19722,03-Aug-08,"I have bought a used Acura from this dealership that was previously owned in the State of Florida.  It is still my car, and there have not been any mechanical repair issues.  Also, the price is reasonable.

There was something I liked about the salesperson.  However, when it turned out that the vehicle did not have a spare tire, he followed instructions and took one from one of their other automobiles for use in mine.  If I am not mistaken, that was the end of my dealings with him.  He said he was seeking employment elsewhere.

The person who processed the paperwork evidently had a preference for Cantonese, Mandarin, or something else.  I purchased a warranty through him, but eventually cancelled within a 60 day period.  I only elected the insurance minimums and added comprehensive coverage with a $500 deductible.  Leaving almost immediately to drive to the mid-west, I still did not have an official license plate. 

After driving further than halfway across the (contiguous) country, I went to the carwash.  The next day, I observed faint scratches throughout the car's paint.  Subsequent inquiry through an attorney general's office lead to the impression that the service did not cause the damage; but unmasked a previous carwash-type problem(s).  Fortunately, insurance still provided ~ $1,300, and I saved the claim through multiple winters.  (In the nearer future, a new policy with a lower deductible would pay $3,000+ for hail damage).

When the warranty trial ran out, I asked about a different priced option but communication skills were once again lacking from the dealership.  After reviewing the materials sent to me, I did not buy.

After at least two months, I was still waiting for my title and plates.  It was difficult to complete tasks such as transferring the balance from the lender, or to register the vehicle.  I did get pulled over for this once--before I knew that traffic violations are classifed as minor misdemeanors.  Sales service was ineffective.  

Honda of Stevens Creek promptly obliged a recent request for records. 

I remain satisfied with the value of the purchase.  My feelings may have been otherwise if I had not observed the missing spare, or elected comprehensive coverage.

19725,21-Jan-07,"My husband and I were looking for a car for our daughter.  We found a pre-ownd  97 Saturn coupe on their lot.  The sales associate stated that it was a trade-in and that ""they only keep the best cars to sell...the rest (implied the ones that need work) go to action"".  He continued to say that the car had been totally looked over by the service department and was in tip-top condition.  We test drove the car, liked it, and purchased it. The finance guy actually echoed what the salesman had said, that the car was completely checked out and that they only kept the best for re-sale.  On the way home over Highway 17 both the oil and the temperature lites went on.  When we got it home we realized the the oil was really old and obviosly hadn't been changed in over 10,000 miles and that there was hardly any coolant in the radiator.   Upon further inspection the hoses not easily visable needed replaceing and the brake fluid was very low.  There wasn't even any wiper fluid!  What exactly did theur service department do?  My husband was a mechanic while putting himself through school, so he was able to spend an entire day servicing the car.  My daughter drove it for a week and the alternater went out and the battery needed replacing.  This has been a nightmare.  Countless hours have been spent on this lemon!  What burns me is that we went to a ""reputable dealer"" to avoid this type of rip-off.

Honda of Stevens Creek 

Purpose of Visit:
Sales

Review site - http://www.dealerrater.com/dealer/add-review.asp?dealerid=6724
In late July'05 I visited this and 3 other Honda dealerships to buy Odyssey Touring DVD/Nav (fully loaded).  The other 3 dealerships gave me very competitive rates and in a very polite manner. Considering that MSRP was $39010, the best quotes were $37500-$37800 from the other dealerships. 

But the visit to this dealership (Honda of Stevens Creek) was like visiting hell.  Even though the sales person was very polite, the sales manager was not.  And when I tried to walk out, he insisted that I offer him a target price I would like him to meet for the new Odyssey.  So I quoted the best offer I had from another dealer, and he became instantly beligerent and quoted $6000 more than what the other dealers had quoted.  His quote was $44000.  

I told him that this was a very bad joke, considering that MSRP was $39010 and best quotes were $37500-$37800.  At this he made insulting remarks and that he does not have to listen to me.  All this happened after he requested me to not leave and to suggest a price I was looking at for this van. 

These other dealerships were Anderson Honda (Palo Alto), Larry Hopkins Honda (Sunnyvale), and one in Capitola.  All 3 were very friendly and polite.  I finally bought the van from Larry Hopkins Honda.",6,28,-1
19728,24-Feb-05,"I got really bad service experience at this dealer recently. The poor service caused my vehicle broke down on highway 80 in Sierra Nevada.

What happened is that my Honda Element received a 22500 mi service at Honda of Steven Creek on 01//15/2005 before the vehicle hit on the road to Reno, NV on 01/16/2005. The service man who did the work on my Element didn't tighten (I guess he lost his mind during the work) the oil drain plug at the end of service. That caused oil drain plug loosed and lost while the vehicle was running on highway 80 at 7pm close to Soda Spring, CA. All motor oil was lost suddenly. I called AAA emergency towlling service upon the vehicle broke down. The car was towed to nearby Truckee,CA. My family was forced to stay at a motel in Truckee through AAA emergency assistance. AAA authorized repair center in Truckee found such poor service that caused the broke-down. The bad service could cause severe damages to my Element's engine.Now even more than 30 days past, Honda of Steven Creek has not paid any compensation for damages and the cost by the bad service.Do I recommend this dealer to other people for their car services?

19729,18-Mar-20,"We purchased a used 2019 Toyota 4 Runner from them.  The car was advertised with key less entry.  I was given a valet key to test drive the vehicle.  We drove 70 miles to see the car.  We could not find a white one near us in Northern LA County.  We drove two hours to get there.  

We purchased the vehicle with CASH.  We asked for an alarm system and an extended warranty.  We were told the warranty would be accepted at any Hyundai dealership (we questioned that since we bought a Toyota).  

We paid for those items in the amount of $4,442.00.  CASH  After signing all the papers we were taken out to the car and handed the valet key.  I asked what about the key fobs that operate the key less entry and set the alarm.  The salesman said they didn't get those keys when they got the car.  The car had been on their lot for over 20 days.  

The day after the purchase we spent another $247.31.  We sent the bill to the dealership to pay us back.  They said that they didn't owe us that money just because they advertised key less entry, they never had those keys to give us, so they would not reimburse us for that.  

Within 3 days of purchasing the car, we tried to get the alarm system to work,.  It didn't.  We took it to a Toyota dealership close to our home and there is no alarm system and Toyota will not honor the extended warranty we paid for, neither would the Hyundai dealership down the street.  

I was sent a form to fill out to cancel the warranty, but the paperwork asked for a dealer number,  I was not being given that by Russell Westbrook dealership.  I found something that said it was a dealer number and filled out the form completely and signed it.  All the dealer had to do was sign and date it and send it to the warranty company and send me a copy of the completed form    I have been waiting for 7 days for them to sign and send it in to the warranty company and to me..  The 30 days to cancel the warranty and to make claims for the items we paid for but were never given is almost up and now they won't respond to my calls or emails.  

I feel that this dealership does a bait and switch scam and false advertising between the keys, the alarm and the warranty.   Then throw in we are in our golden years, and the whole deal hurts more.

Never trust a used car salesman is what this has taught us.  Sad that an NBA star has his name attached to such a horrible business.

19732,03-Aug-19,"I was looking for a 2019 Elantra Sport.  A couple of dealers close to me had it in stock but not the color I wanted, so I made the drive of over an hour to Russell Westbrook of Anaheim because they seemed like they were honest over the phone. Once I got there, things started off great and friendly....test drove the car..friendly chit chat..but how quickly things changed. After the test drive and the friendly conversation. 

The shady tactics immediately began. I repeatedly told the salesman over and over that I wanted everything clear and transparent as far as vehicle price and out the door price. What do they do? They play the monthly payment game with me. 

"" How much do you want your payment to be? "" 

I already knew this was a shady tactic. But I played along. A man's character is worth more to me than any dollar amount. So I let the salesman do his thing. We do the back and fourth as he goes to his manager. Comes back. Goes to his manager. Comes back. This happens about 5 times. He comes back the 5th time and there is "" service agreement "" now worked into the pricing. So I asked him what is it ? He told me it was an extended warranty. I told him Hyundai has the best warranty in the Auto industry and I didn't want it. He responds with :

""I can't get your payment to where you want it if you don't get the warranty and help me out. "" 

( Basically make his commission higher. )

I chuckle to myself inside and let him do his thing. They basically were playing the let's make the customer tired game and they will cave. This dealership is ridiculous.  Mind you I have bought many many cars over the years and personally I work in sales myself. So this was fun for me to observe. 

We finally get to a payment that works for me and mind you, I still haven't seen what the total price is on the car and anything else that's added on top of the vehicle. At this point we have been at the dealer about 4 hours now. I see the camera in the corner of the ceiling so I know they are watching me from the almighty mirrored managers office. Give me a break.

I actually don't see the final numbers until it's just about closing and I'm in the finance managers office.  

In the final contract there was a KARR alarm system I wasn't told about that was over 1300 dollars. A 3M clear sticker that was 595. The "" Warranty "" at over 1400 dollars. Mind you, all of the additions caused my payment to be 60 dollars more a month than it needed to be. That's worth it to me to see a dealer and a man's true colors.  

I told them I didn't want any of it, they told me they couldn't do the deal if they took all of the above items off...I know right?! The shady keeps coming. LOL. They said the alarm was pre installed and they couldn't uninstall it. Wow. Having bought cars before I already knew they could just disable it if they wanted too. But they didn't, instead they assumed I was dumb and wouldn't put up much of a fight. I didn't. Not because I'm dumb, but rather I wanted to see how desperate this dealer was to make a profit, I wanted to see how far this dealer would take things. I walked out of there feeling like if I was anyone else. They wouldn't have known better.

I would have told everyone I knew to come buy their new Hyundai here...unfortunately I won't. 

What is the lesson here folks? An honest sale keeps more sales coming. A pipeline and book of business that is consistently lasting. This dealer won't have that. Not with my salesman anyways. 

This is the exact reason I left sales. I wonder how the salesman would feel if his or her child walked into buy a car and this happened to them? 

All of you are probably asking....

"" You did end up buying the car. So what's up with this review ? ""

Well simple answer is, consider myself collateral damage. I experienced it, so now being informed. You know what to expect when you walk into this place. Call it, community service if you will.

19768,01-Nov-18,"** Buyer beware ** My wife and I were confronted and yelled at by Fred Angiuli, Hyundai Finance & Sales Manager, during final car purchase negotiations **

This is the most unprofessional car dealership I have experienced.  In summary, Fred Angiuli, Sales Manager, yelled at my wife and I for trying to get a good deal. 

My wife and I obtained a price quote via e-mail and agreed to meet w/ the internet sales lead.  We met w/ on a Tuesday afternoon on 10/30 around 6:30 PM (The day before Halloween).  Fast forward to 8:30PM; after 2 hours of test driving the car, negotiating sales price, and looking at financing, my wife and I agreed upon a number w/ the internet lead.  We were ready to make the sale.

The internet lead calls us into the main office and we're greeted by Fred Angiuli, sales manager.  Fred Angiuli, Sales Manager, proceeds to question why we are paying such a low price for the car, states my wife and I do not understanding the terms of purchase (as we initially had a price quote via e-mail), and proceeds to upcharge the final price by an additional amount.  

My wife requests to waive the upcharge.  

Fred, Sales Manager, is furious we are requesting for a discount.  He retorts, ""You know the price you're paying, you're not getting this discount.  Don't play your pregnant card too.  Drop that act.""  After this comment, Fred proceeds to and yell at my wife and I in front of his entire team.

Fred, Sales Manager, proceeds to explain why we are not entitled to a discount.  Looking at my home address and the location of this dealership, Fred feels we've traveled ""far"" coming to his dealership.  Furthermore, it's close to month-end, it's the day before Halloween, and it's almost closing time.  He retorts, ""Your timing is perfect and don't act like you don't know you're getting a good deal.  Stop playing the dumb card.""

My wife is puzzled why Fred is so angry and then asks for his name to try to ask him questions.  Fred retorts in a condescending way, ""I'm Fred.  This [associate] is [name], this [associate] is  [name], this [associate] is [name], this [associate] is [name].""  He says the names of all of his staff in the same room as us (keep in mind they are not involved in this conversation, just looking at us).  And adds, ""any other questions you have?  So can we make the sale?""

Fred is still furious we're asking for a discount.  Fred then adds a backhand comment, ""I've given you this great price.  And during this entire conversation you haven't even thanked me.  Where is my thank you?""

My wife and I then proceed to refuse the purchase.  We then say we feel we're being attacked by Fred and being talked down by him.  He says, ""You only say I'm talking down to you because of the price.  If the price was now the initial agreed upon, then you'd say I am a nice guy.""  More on this later.

He apologizes but in a very condescending and non-authentic way (Note - he doesn't keep eye contact during this apology, but during his entire confrontation, he keeps eye contact).  My wife then says she would've preferred some transparency in terms of the price instead of upcharging us at the last minute.  In essence, we've wasted 2 hours and did not eat dinner.  

Fred retorts back, ""Stop playing the [pregnancy] card already.  If food is the issue then we'll pick something up for you!!!""  We left the dealership in disgust.

-- I respect a business defending it's price, but Fred's could've said things MUCH differently.  I work in customer service and there is no reason to belittle and attack a client, especially in front of the a team.  Furthermore, if Fred was angry at the price agreed upon he should have had this conversation with his employees.  This conversation should not have been made w/ the client (at least not so aggressively).
-- In retrospect, as a client, of course we are coming to this dealership because we found competitive pricing!  Otherwise we wouldn't have come here at all!  I mean, as a customer, of course we are trying to get a good deal! 
-- Fred's final comment, summarized, ""If the price is right, then I wouldn't be a mean guy.  I'd be a nice guy.""  This is completely untrue.  I would NOT make the purchase because of Fred's hostile attitude.  Once he started to attack us I did not feel comfortable making the purchase (Regardless of the price).  My trust in him and the dealership was thrown out the window.  

TIPS:
-Buyer beware for sales manager Fred Angiuli.  Very aggressive, confrontational, and may verbally attack you during final negotiations which is what happened during our experience.",6,28,-1

I put a deposit on a car that I was told would be in stock on July 17.  A couple weeks away from the arrival date, I began following up to make sure its arrival was still on schedule.  After a week of no follow up, I started to worry something was wrong.  I eventually found out from Hyundai corporate, not the dealership, that the car I put a deposit on was sold on July 2.  I then spent the next week trying to get a hold of someone at the dealership to get an explanation and try to work on a solution.  I had troubles getting a hold of anyone, and when I did, I didn't get any answers or solutions, and on one occasion I had an employee flat-out hang up on me.

Eventually, it was clear to me that nobody was going to help me, so I ended up buying a car elsewhere.  The day after I bought a car I finally got a call back from Ahmad, with whom I spoke on Tuesday, with no follow up.  He told me that he did call me back on Tuesday, but I never received a phone call from him nor did he leave a voice mail.

I bought my Elantra back in 2012 and have had no issues with it in the past ever which is great, for the brand, but this location has turned me off from getting a new vehicle from them and I will explain why. 

Over the years I found that I will no longer be wanting to buy vehicles as I grow tired of them quickly. I have decided to sell my current car and lease a new vehicle; I was predominantly looking at Lexus but would have looked at some vehicles from Hyundai and other like makers. 

It was like the company was reading my mind, because they called me and asked if I wanted to go in and see what they could give me for my current car as I was regularly servicing with them and had low miles for the year. 

After setting up the appointment with them the relations got sour. They called like 4 times to confirm I was coming and immediately while on the phone tried to get me to pick out cars to see and buy/lease and did not give much thought to my current car situation--But I still decided to go to the meeting, but first decided to spend about 100 dollars getting the vehicle detailed so it looked nice for them. This meeting was solely to sell my current vehicle or get numbers and continue my research, but by the response I feel they had only one thought in mind; sell, sell, sell.

I arrived early and was told by the gentleman out front that mister Babazadeh (the person to contact me) was on a test drive would be back shortly. I waited... I waited... and I waited. The person who originally brought me in came back three times to check on me and see if Babazadeh had come by yet and nothing. I had waited beyond our reservation for him and nothing. I was annoyed to say the least. This man and his team contacted me four times within two days to make this meeting happen and then would not come out to see me. 

I decided to remove myself from the company completely as I felt beyond disrespected and told them to remove me from all forms of communication and that I would be taking my business elsewhere. I told him who I was suppose to meet with and what the situation was; which he then stated that he was just in the office right behind me and could get him for me.

Sooo he was here and just decided not to come out to see me?? Obviously I opted out of seeing him and I truly am offended by the way they handled the situation. My schedule is chaotic and I blocked out an entire evening for him and he did not acknowledge me the entire time I was on the facility. 

I will never recommend this location or any other Hyundai relating back to the Russell Westbrook name again! ",6,28,497
19857,21-Feb-18,"Service Department is a disorganized operation from minute you walk through the door. Let begin by saying that My past experience with this dealership was very positive and as a matter of fact I recommended it to a number of my friends.I noticed once I arrived the Dealership was under a new Ownership no big issue there.... that is until i sat there waiting for someone to attend to my vehicle. 

After about 10 minutes I walked inside where I again waited for one of the Service personnel to speak to me...finally after another 10 minutes I caught the attention of one and he proceeded to figure out that I was there for my scheduled service but alas he could not help me apparently because I had a Genesis and I had to be handled by a concierge service person...OMG what a train wreck that turned out to be, I got handed off after another 10-15 minutes to Erica, who proceeded to tell me it would not be more than 30 minutes. After two hours had passed Erica reappeared only to tell me they were almost done and all that had to be done was to wash my car and I could be on my way. 

It was annoying enough to have gone through the gauntlet of trying to find a service person and being ignored, but then I figured look they must have just changed management with the new Ownership it cant get any worse.....Well, Not sure where Erica was trained but someone forgot to teach her how to follow-up because there I sat for another Two hours waiting for my car (to be washed). What a waste of a half of a day, I am a pretty reasonable person and I am willing to give some latitude with New Ownership change but come on now Westbook Hyundai get your act together. You want the Genesis to compete with the High-end cars in the Market, well guess what you have a long way to go, train your staff, teach them the fine art of follow-up and customer service, until then I am avoiding your operation until you get your act together.

The salesperson didn't know what he had available. We found one on the lot I liked, and he attempted to find out whether it was already sold, but never did. He said he would check into possible equity in my returned lease because of very low mileage and good condition; he never did.  There were several mix ups during negotiations that I will mostly attribute to the fact that these occurred late in the evening after I'm sure an already long day -- we were there well after closing. The Finance Mgr. made a few errors that caused me some grief; there was a mixup about the payments for my returned lease that didn't get resolved.

20131,26-Feb-17,"Unfortunately there is no ""zero"" star.

I should have followed my guts and read the reviews carefully before getting stuck and buying my Hyundai from Hardin.
I have no issues with the car, but my issue is Hardin. As soon as they sell the car, forget about anything else including customer service and satisfaction.

I will state my story as short as possible:
I took the car for a test drive it had the ""alarm"" light on and the front right wheel was inflated at 22 psi (normal is 34 psi). I told the sales guy (Mark) and he said it is ok, just drive it, the car might have this alarm because it was parked for some time.""
We had a deal and I bought the ""Certified Per-owned Hyundai"" from Hardin. Next day I went to receive it, and asked the sales guy to make sure the Tyre pressure is checked. After driving the car for 2 days the alarm went on again highlighting that the same wheel is inflated; I went to a gas station to add air and decided to buy a Tyre pressure gauge to check it next time. After another 2 days the same thing happened, then I took action and called the sales guy (Mark) who advised me to go to the service center and tell them the issue and they will fix it.
I visited the service center, and explained the issue and story to a guy named Richard, who took the car and said they will check it. After 30 minutes he tells me there is a nail in the Tyre and the tyre needs replacement. I asked him to talk to the sales guy and fix the issue. He replies, ""you have to call your sales guy and you ask him to send us a due bill to fix this!"" I calmly called Mark who said this is not my call or in my hands and he cannot do anything except talk to his manager.

At that point I sensed the unprofessional system of Hardin and asked Richard to give me the car. I went to a tyre shop and they immediately fixed it for $20 dollars. Meanwhile, I received a call from Mark who bluntly advised that his manager said that ""the car is certified and their guys have checked the car before I took it and it had no issues."" I reminded him that there was an alarm when I had the test drive, he acknowledged it and said he remembers it, but it is not his call."" At that point I said ""Thank You Mark,"" and closed the phone.

Thank God I did not buy a service contract with them, now I am carefully checking the market to check the best authorized service center/dealer who can take care of my car for a long term maintenance relation. Gladly it will not be Hardin Hyundai.

Bottom line is lack of internal coordination, poor customer service, and lack of responsibility. The attitude is ""you have the car now, just deal with it and stop bugging us, there is nothing we can do.""

Trust me guys, if you want to buy a Hyundai just buy it from any trusted authorized dealer.",6,29,-1

20148,04-Feb-17,"When it comes to customer experience and commitment to customer, and professionalism, steer clear of this location.  Although there may be good car salesman that really care about getting the car you want and helping you through the process this is not the location.

We had such a bad experience with Jay Prieto and when the sales person your working with commits to a price OTD on a piece of paper and then backs away from it and then makes you believe that the car is in the lot but is not, and then you find out it's in the OFF SITE lot.  Enough said, it just got worse from there.

Sometimes when a business has to over advertise that they are #1 dealership in the west coast, they don't tend to have elevated sales associates.  You get cocky and tend to get away with a lot of things, even if it means being dishonest and manipulating the customer and giving them false hope.

20278,07-Oct-16,"This dealership utilizes extremely deceptive business practices. If you have your heart set on a specific vehicle, this is not the place for you. I'm sure they are fully capable of selling you a car if you either have no clue what you want or maybe have a general idea without specifics, but that was not my experience. 

I live all the way down in east county San Diego (a good two hours away with no traffic), but was thrilled when I found a green Fiat 500 with the trim and features I had been looking for. It was *the* car at a fantastic price. I called up the dealership to confirm they still had it in stock and spoke with Victor. He sounded confused about which car I was looking for, even though I provided him with the stock number and year/make/model/color. It sounded like he just wanted to get me off the phone because he kept cutting me off when I was trying to clarify with him that he has two Fiats on his lot and I am specifically looking for the green one. Rather than look it up in his system, he hurriedly told me he'd ""have one of [his] guys drive around the lot looking for it"" and he'd call me back in 10 minutes. Uh, okay. 

Nearly an hour later, he calls back excitedly saying the white Fiat was still available and the grey one was being detailed right now. I asked him if the green one had sold then, and he said he knew nothing about a green one. We clearly have a listening issue here because I must have said the word ""green"" nearly 10 times during our previous phone conversation. I clarified that he did in fact say ""grey"" when referring to the car being detailed, and he said he would double check on it and call me back because now he's not sure. Four hours later, I still hadn't heard from him so I texted him with the VIN and stock number, once again reminding him that I wanted the green Fiat. A couple hours later, he responds that is is still available. I guess there was some kind of misunderstanding in green vs. grey color? I still don't know. So, taking his word for it, I took time off work and finalized all my financing the next day (Wednesday) after making an appointment with him to see the car on Friday at 5pm.

I get a call on Friday morning (today) asking if I am still interested in seeing the Fiat today. Yes, absolutely! He once again asks which color I wanted. (Can I really expect otherwise at this point?) I tell him, once again, that I am interested in the green Fiat. Without skipping a beat, he tells me it already sold. I asked him when it happened, and he said, ""I don't know. It could have been last night. It's just not showing up in my system as being in stock. It's not here."" Oh, so there IS a system now? We didn't need to play the game of send-the-sales-guy-around-the-lot-and-make-up-colors? He obviously really wants to sell the white one because he mentions, again, that they have a white one I could come take a look at. The grey car has apparently completely disappeared at this point. I told him, again, I live two hours away and that there are plenty of white Fiats here should I decide to select a different color. The only reason I was willing to drive up to Anaheim was to get this specific car. ""Oh,"" he says, ""you should have put a deposit on it then.""

WHAT? I'm sorry, but what? Why was I not informed of this during the several conversations I had with him? Our first contact was Tuesday, at which point I told him I couldn't even make it up there until Friday. Why not tell me on Tuesday that the car may sell in between now and then, so I should probably put a deposit on it if I was really interested? We spoke again on Wednesday and again confirmed the Friday appointment; why not mention it then? I would put money on the fact that it wasn't there even the first time we spoke. Needing to send someone into the lot to look, confusing grey and green, constantly bringing up the white Fiat... yeah, that green Fiat probably hadn't been there this whole week. It didn't just sell last night. He said he'd double check to make sure the green one sold and call me back. Regardless of what he says, I won't believe him. I'm not going to drive all the way up there only to be once again pitched the same white Fiat I can buy 10 miles from my house. 

You always hear about people calling car salesmen xxxxxxxx, but I like to give people the benefit of the doubt. Hardin Hyundai unfortunately proved the stereotype to be true - they will go to any lengths to get you to purchase a car on their lot, including lying to you just to get you to come in. I've learned my lesson, just like another reviewer who was put in the same position did (only she actually showed up to the dealership). Don't even try this dealership unless you live or work right around the corner. Don't spend any significant amount of time driving in to the dealership, because in all likelihood, the car you have your heart set on is gone, despite what they tell you. Whatever they say, they are probably lying.",6,29,-1
20317,21-Aug-16,"Was interested in buying a Genesis from Hardin Hyundai and saw a 2015 still on the lot - but priced such that once out the door, KBB (which we all use to guide the value of our cars) dictated that the same car would be worth 10K less than Hardin Hyundai's asking price. I understand some depreciation but it seemed excessive to me. When I asked about this, I was told that the same KBB (which Hardin uses to value their trade-in's) - was only a guide and not to be trusted...also I was told that basically, if I didn't buy it, someone else would so - my business didn't really matter (the latter was my takeaway but not actually stated). The conversation basically ended after my sales rep told me if was ""a free country and he didn't HAVE to sell to me"". No explanation for the price gouge, just intimidation efforts it seems. Wouldn't go back and wouldn't encourage anyone to either. Bad attitude, bad service, bad prices.",6,29,-1

I will be happy to share my experience with anyone and everyone through any media outlets nesessary until the issue is resolved. Along side MANY other issues I had with him, the biggest is that I told him several times that he did not have my permission to run a hard inquiry on my credit and he sat there right in front of me and did it anyways! I have been working on my credit for YEARS so that I can buy a home, I had no need to buy this car, and told him I did not want the car if it meant I needed a hard inquiry, that was when he assured me he was only running a soft inquiry. I came in with a loan and a check already, why he would run a hard inquiry when a soft inquiry  would suffice, I had no intention of financing though Hardin!  After Frank emailed me and asked me to give him a score of 10 on this survey, I confronted him on the issue. Again, he ignored the issue and asked me to give him a 10 on the survey. When I tried to explain to him the severity of what he had done, he told me homeland security requested it and that his boss made him do it.

She was told that all scheduled maintenance must be performed at 'dealership' to qualify for the free 'lifetime' oil change.  Since part of the 15K scheduled maintenance states to replace the cabin air filter, in which THEY WANT A RIDICULOUS $90.00 TO PERFORM, we void the 'free' lifetime oil change.

So Steve and I email back and forth a bit and agree on price for Santa Fe Sport.  I then wanted to add the Premium package and Steve says it'll be about $3k more and about $10-15 per month (per email).

We go down to dealer (traveling from south county) expecting to lease based on the above info.  We start talking pricing and he's way off from emails.  Show him email and then he starts the typical numbers shuffle.  This is what I try to avoid by dealing with Internet/fleet.  After continually turning him down and restating what he said in email, he then he runs to get manager.

So 'manager' (wish I could recall his name) shows up and starts the hard sell.  Says Steve 'made a mistake' and he should've said '$10-15 more per $1000'.  So $30-45 more per month.  So I call BS (in a nice way) and let him know.  Still won't budge and starts another round of numbers fun.  Tell him no thanks and get up to leave.

Over a 2 week period, I had a salesman lie to me (told me the car was the owner's sons' car), had the finance department try to switch the warranty price on me during the contract signing, had the finance dept give me extremely rude service, traveled 70 miles with my family to find out promised repairs were not even started after the salesman had called me and promised that they were done, had the salesman tell me ""nothing will make you happy"", had the general manager totally ignore my calls, emailed the owner and had the owner's son call me just to have him tell me ""well they are ALL my cars"", had that same gentleman dismiss all my concerns, and then ignored by the owner after I emailed him again.  I never wanted to return the car, I only wanted some sign of accountability. No customer should ever be treated in the manner I was. I sincerely hope that this review, along with the multiple others I see on this site, persuade people to completely avoid this dealership, as well as all the other Hardin dealerships.",6,31,-1

20786,01-Jul-13,"I'll keep this short although the headaches I've had with this dealership could fill a dissertation. In 2011 I purchased a pre-owned Nissan 350z. I had problems from the beginning with the dealership. I bought the car with a due bill to get some tinting removed and without getting a smog check. The dealership informed me they would take care of the due bill and pay for the smog check. It was a complete nightmare to get them to do the work but eventually they did.

Here is why I would really avoid this place, not that I had planned on going back anyways, I purchased the car with the understanding that it had one prior owner and was never in an accident. I was even showed a Carfax which confirmed it. Today I looked at purchasing a new car and got the dealership to give me a trade in quote. When they came back with the quote they asked me about the accident my car had been in in 2008. This was a huge shock to me as I bought a car without any prior accidents. Sure enough though, they had a Carfax showing my car had definitely been in an accident. 

Learn from my mistakes, this dealership is slime and should be avoided.",6,31,-1
20788,06-Jun-13,"this bad review concerns the service & parts dept.  for this dealer. on june 5th about 11 am i called the parts dept and spoke with parts manager keven i informed him that i was just leaving harbor hyundai in long beach i told him the reason for my visit to this dealer was because the fuel tank door to my 2010 hyundai sonata would not open when i push the button that""s on the driver side door. harbor hyundai said a new switch needed to be installed but that it wasn't in stock, it had to be special ordered. i ask keven if he had it in stock at hardin hyundai and he said yes and that he would set it aside for me , he told me that they were busy that morning but if i took my car in at 1 pm the same day it would be done in an hour. i said great! see you then, i got there about 10 til 1 and lionel a service advisor told me that it would be 3 hours at least, i told him the time keven had given me was an  hour he said lets go talk to keven, when lionel asked keven about the time he had given me keven said yes that he had given me that time, well lionel told keven there was no way it could happen so now both keven and lionel are giving me the oh well too bad look, neither one was willing to say hey were sorry maybe we could do in 2 hrs or looked the least concern that i had driven 20 miles to their dealership base on the time calculation i was given. i let them know i was an unhappy customer and left , i called and spoke with service manager rick and explained the situation he was great apologetic and scheduled me to back the next day at 11 am to have the job done. well guess what?  i took my car in at 11 am it took them 45 mins to get the car out back, finally they did about 15 min later i am told yes harbor  hyundai is right it needs a switch however we don't have it in stock and we'll have to order it, i said wait a minute keven said yesterday he had it in stock, we spoke to keven and keven tells me he sold it to someone because he didn't think i was coming back , however rick the service manager tells me keven lied because i told keven you were coming back to have it installed that although you left upset you were willing to have the job done here. looks to me like keven got payback on me because of my complaint the day before to rick, unfortunately rick does not outrank kevin they're both supervisors. i called and spoke with gm matt from hardin i told him the story and he immediately on the phone sided with keven saying he has known him for years and that keven would never do what i had just described but when i told him rick said keven knew i was coming matt insisted no way and that he hasn't known rick as long as keven and has no idea why rick would say that. so no hope there its easy to see why guys like keven will get to do what they want at hardin hyundai there is no accountability. i feel sorry  for rick having to work with clowns like matt and keven",6,31,-1
20792,24-Mar-13,"NEVER would recommend them.  NO WAYY.

I went to this dealership an Elantra.  The Sales guy was Mel.  We got a good deal.  took family the next day to do the paperwork.  They ran a credit check.  Everything was good.  they gave the Keys and manual before i was sent to the finance dept, Mel came back telling that there was a $500 competitor discount that was given to me (he didn't tell me that the previous day).  Now, he wanted proof that i owned another vehicle to get the discount.  i don't own another vehicle, so could not give proof.  

MEL canceled the deal for both the cars and started blaming me for wasting his time.  he started talking rough and tried his best to pickup a fight.  This guy, working as a car salesman, needs to be trained by Hardin about treating customers better.

i have been a Toyota / Honda customer all these years and have NEVER had such a bad dealership experience like i had with MEL at Hardin Hyundai.

if you want to avoid being abused by a Hyundai salesman, i would never recommend Hardin Hyundai.

20798,18-Nov-12,"Horrible customer sales experience!

Unfortunately, I have to pick at least one star otherwise I would have gave them zero!

No wonder their competitor, Harbor Hyundai, has much better ratings because of all the upset customers from this dealer going to them.

No wonder this dealer has only 2.5 Yelp stars and most reviewers has bad customer service experience as a common problem.

Please note that my experience is based upon one SALES individual name Leasandro/Lesandro/Lezandro on the phone. Please also note that this was my first time ever to call this dealer. This guy is a Fleet Manager supposedly!

Ok, so I called this dealer yesterday because I am shopping for a new car and need to buy it either this weekend or the one after. I had the quote from the other dealer and wanted to shop around to find even a better deal. After giving all the necessary information to this guy name Tom, he ask me for the lowest price I already have. After listening to it he told me that it will be useless for him to tell his low price. I told him that as promised I gave him my price so he should do the same. After little argument, he finally agreed to give me his price but told me to wait for his call back.

After 30 mins, I got a call from this guy Leasandro/Lesandro/Lezandro claiming to be a Fleet Manager to help me out. I told him everything pretty much all over again and asked him to give me his price. Right away, he gave me an impression of a ""Know it All"" type guy and talked to me like that the entire time. Again, I asked him about the price and he started to tell me that he can beat any dealer's any low price at any time guaranteed! He also said that he can beat it by few hundreds. He continued by saying that there is a reason on why he is a # 1 Hyundai Western volume seller and no body can beat or match his price. Period!

At this point, I was 50-50 in terms of giving this dealer my business or not.

Anyways, I told him my price and asked him if he can beat this by hundreds like he promised earlier. He immediately said Yes! I told him that my price is before any rebates and this is where I busted him with his lies!

Right away, he told me that it is impossible for any dealer in the entire Western region to offer me the price, I had, without any rebates. He said that it is next to impossible and that other dealer is lying to me. I told him that I did indeed verify the price from the other dealer more than 1 time and they have assured me that the price is before any rebates. He still argued with me and kept telling me that the other dealer is lying and that he is telling me the correct price which he is darn sure that no body can beat it!

At this point I told him that I can take him to this other low price dealer website and can proof the price that way. After guiding him through this other dealer website, I showed him the low price which he claimed earlier that no body in the entire Western region can offer!

I heard a complete silence on the phone. I then asked if he is seeing the price or not. He then responded if I am looking for a manual transmission and I said No. He then said that the price the other dealer has is for manual transmission and just by looking at the price he can tell that.

I knew this was a big lie so right away I told him that it clearly states in the fine print that the car and price is for auto transmission. Also, I called the other dealer and did verify through that as well!

As he was totally busted with his ""big talking earlier"" and lies, right away he started to make excuses. His voice becomes dim and there was no ""Know All Type"" attitude. All of a sudden, he told me that he can match the price for the same exact car! Now keep in mind that his earlier ""last/final/best quote"" was at least 1000 more. So, how come all of a sudden he can match the price but earlier told me that the entire Western region cannot do it without any rebates?

There was answer as well as no apology for all his lies. Instead, he became aggressive and told me, ""Now I am telling you that I do have a car...I can beat that price....Do you want to argue or need a car""

What a joke!

At the end, he told me to just go to the other dealer and buy from there!

WoW! Just WoW!

Amazing to see on what kind of staff, who claim to be a manager, dealer has who has no respect, courtesy, or friendliness to a brand new first time customer like me! How can I think about this dealer for any current, future purchases or for recommending it to others?

Like I said, my experience is based on a guy Leasandro/Lesandro/Lezandro at Sales department who claim to be a Fleet Manager. This dealer may have other good people but needless to say that this dealer will not get any of my business for sure! First impression is huge for me!

However because it was a night time, he decided to come back the next day with my son.  They wanted to close the deal and requested that he put down some security deposit.  My husband obliged and wrote a check out for $500.  As he was leaving, the general sales manager comes out and tells my husband to instead use his credit card.  My husband did not want to do that and told him he will be back in the morning to test drive the car etc.  Then  this general manager Chris guy began to pressure my husband.

Today my son, his wife and I endured 3 hours of a classical ""bait and switch"" game at the Capitol Hyundai in San Jose, CA. We should have left at the first sign of trouble. That is on us. We are not experienced dealership customers. We speak with an accent and I believe our accent and foreign names were the reasons for this frustrating encounter.
They didn't have the car we wanted (it was sold miraculously yesterday although it was still listed in the inventory today) but, fortunately, they had an older model for a ""better price"" that was printed out after a long struggle with computers and printers. We said we had a pre-approved loan and were ready to pay the quoted ""better price"" with a bank check. They decided to beat our bank's loan offer and 30 minutes later a new quote was printed that was $3000 more than the first one! They insisted that we ""misread"" the first document. The new one had a much higher APR than we got from our bank, there was a ""downpayment"" of $2500 added to the previously quoted price, and, by the way, the promised discounts were cancelled because we were ""refusing their financing""!!!! They were cancelled on the quote for their financing offer!!! The salesman was constantly disappearing ""to figure out stuff"", lying, stalling, and trying to pressure us into a horrible deal. I keep thinking that, may be, my accent, or my blond hair made him think I was so stupid I could possibly buy that load of you know what??? My son and his wife kept their composure to the end but I have to admit that I lost it a bit. This was the most blatant and pathetic attempt of swindling I have ever witnessed.

He was rude from the beginning and was not there to sell the car, rather his whole mission was to prove the customer wrong by random fumbling even when he knew he was wrong.  Instead of making the whole buying process a smooth and amiable one, he made it so stressful that I considered not buying the car just because the attitude of Ronald but since my friends had come with me that day to help me buy a car just on that day,  we decided to sit through and bear that guy. Ronald is extremely rude salesperson. From the beginning, he made it seem like it was us who were in need of the car and he was not interested in selling it and interrupted whenever I started to speak up. He does not know how to understand a customer or does not have the patience to hear out  their opinion. He would just start speaking up with no clear objective and start making up things half way in between. I stayed there for 9 hours and it was a very tedious experience given my salesperson did not try to make my visit any worth it. It was my friends and I who were trying to propose a figure in order to get the deal closed and Ronald, on the other hand, did not even try to negotiate, rather was vehemently raising objections on everything and seemed that he was hell bent that the deal does not closed.

20832,03-May-18,"Don't go here if you don't want to be mislead, disrespected and lied to. 

Long story short: I was lead to believe I was coming in to buy a car that was sold 5 days prior. And I only learned that the car was already sold upon arriving at the dealership, after having made a 50 mile trip out of my way (even though we kept in contact for the entire 5 days). 

Long story: I came in at 7pm on a Monday with the intention of buying a 2018 Elantra. We have agreed upon a price with the salesman John Nava beforehand, over the internet, but it took an additional 1.5 hours of negotiations with Gus, a sales manager who plays the really, really bad cop (btw, you've overdoing it a bit, Gus), just to get BACK to the agreed upon number with John. From 9 to about 11pm I was told to just sit there and wait for financing (there was literally one other customer at the dealership between two financial managers). Finally, at 11pm, in the financing office, I was offered to sign some document that did not contain any financing information, no APR or bank name, just the car+documents+tax prices. After asking which bank this is and the APR I was approved for, the financial lady told me that all the banks are now closed and they can't have me approved. I would have to take the car home and come back again tomorrow. I was very angry, since I live 50 miles away and don't have a car of my own to get back. At this point, it's a $60 uber ride home. I wasn't going to take this card blanche new car home without signing the PROPER documents first. After asking why I was made to wait this long if you knew that ""the banks are closed"", I got some bs from Jalil, the head finance manager, trying to convince me that everything is going to be fine and I should take the car home. The finance lady offered me a ride home, which I accepted. She went on to ask John to give me a ride home, and he got veeery angry. I said that I will come back to buy this car in two days, but much earlier in the day, but John was done talking to me at that point. I called my $60 uber ride home, while the financial manager Jalil offered to make a $60 discount on the car when I come back to buy it. 
A day later Jalil called me up to say that I've been approved by a bank and that everything is set. 

Two days later, on Wednesday, I am ready to head back to the dealership. I call Jalil with a few important questions before going, but he says he will call me back in 5. Three times. THREE times I had to call him over four hours just to be promised a callback. I ended up not going there because I didn't receive some very important answers.

On Friday John Nava calls me to ask when I will be coming in to buy the car. I say I'm not sure exactly when, but next week for sure. He says GREAT! ... with a kind of ""see ya never"" tone...

On Monday I get a cashier's check with a sizeable downpayment IN THE NAME OF THE DEALERSHIP (the dealership charges an additional $120 if you use a debit card for downpayment), ready to go get the car. I've also emailed John Nava with some final questions, just to make sure it's the same deal, but the quick to reply before man was now completely silent. Around noon I call John telling him that I will be there at 7pm and that I'd like Jalil to be there to finish our business (I wasn't going to let the $60 uber ride slide as a matter of principal). He says GREAT! Come on in, Jalil will be here. I decide to call Jalil as well, just to make sure, because I had a weird hunch about John not telling me something. I tell him that I AM COMING IN TODAY TO FINISH OUR BUSINESS. He naturally says he will ""I'll call you back in 5"", and, naturally, never does. At this point I still have no idea that the car I'm after is sold. I get on the train, and as I approach my final station, I get a call from Jalil at 6.30pm. He tells me two things: 1) my car was sold 5 days ago and 2) Jalil is headed to the Sharks game right now. Wow. That's awesome! 

At this point I decide between turning back or going there and ripping their heads off. I decided to still go and try and get the same deal. Nope. They weren't having it. The EXACT SAME CAR, but a few days ""newer"" was going for a grand+ more. John had a very smug look on his face when I came in. Nicely played John, nicely played. I walked out immediately. Very, very bitter aftertaste.

The dealership will just find ways to ignore me. They were very quick to sell the vehicle/optional contracts and I hoped they will show the same quickness to help me cancel it but far from it. Very disappointing.

My second key is not yet with me. I followed up on that so many times and yesterday I was told(when I called) that my key is available and I can come and collect it.

20842,01-Jun-17,"I went on a Friday night and was basically the only customer there, but it took over four hours to test drive one car, pick out a different one and fill out all the paperwork. I had to return the next day to get the car detailed. When it was presented to me, it did not have a cargo cover and so I had to return again to get the cargo cover. After I got the cargo cover, I noticed that there was sticky residue where all the sheets containing the vehicle info had been pasted on the car, but I did not want to have to return again a third time to have that taken care of. The car does not seem to have been polished either. Although I was offered a first oil change for free, since I prepaid for 3 years worth of maintenance, that offer meant nothing and when I asked for something else instead, I did not get any response. The salesperson was very hard to understand because of her accent and her odd way of pronouncing certain words. The manager did not explain the charges for the lease in a way that was understandable and used generic terms for charges that could be anything.",6,33,-1

This was a major turn-off for me, but I continued on with the young salesman. He was extremely immature, and kept making sexual references in conjunction with the vehicles on the lot, saying things like ""I would make love to the Genesis"" and ""The Veloster N is a ride your daughter wouldn't survive"". He kept saying how much he can't wait to get his hands on a Veloster N. Well, I wouldn't let this salesman put his hands on anything, because they are greasier than most cheeseburgers I've ever eaten! I believe the salesman's name was ""Perry"" or ""Pierre"", not quite sure. Either way, I will not be returning to this dealership anytime soon.",6,33,-1

21943,13-May-17,"the sales person was very aggressively pushing for stuff that I did not need like LoJack and something else that I don't even know what it was. Initially he was trying to charge me 800$ for LoJack. Wasted time to argue and his trip to his manager to bring it down to 300$. I did not want to pay for that at all, but the sales person lied saying he could not physically remove LoJack from the car, so I had no choice, but to pay for it. Later I found out that it simply had to be digitally deactivated and his statement that he could not physically take it out of the car was misleading at best and simply a lie at worst just to make me pay more for the car. The sales person also insisted that I had to do Hyundai loan at 5.9%. I wanted to pay 100% cash, but again the sales person insisted I had no choice. He did not even mention there was 750$ promo if I go for Hyunday loan, so I did not take advantage of that promo to save 750$. In short, the sales person was a jerk full of lies. My experience sucked - it took several hours to complete the purchase - most of that time spent on price arguments. The car selling industry sucks exactly because of people like that. Hyundai should simply sell cars at their standard prices and take negotiation out of the car buying process. I am very frustrated with my buying experience, thus this negative review.",6,33,-1

21945,27-May-11,"We ordered a new Elantra Limited edition and asked what would the price be and were told we would have to  pay sticker price since this car was in big demand and short supply.  We gave this dealer a deposit and waited seven weeks to get delivery.   We were called and told that our car had arrived and was ready for us to pick up.

We arrived that same night and started to go thru the paper work and at the very end we noticed that the sales price was almost $800.00 OVER sticker price.  They had added $495.00 for window tinting and the windows were not tinted and $300.00 for sticker that were on all the doors and hood and trunk.  We were told these were to identify the parts in case the car was stolen and somehow got to a chop shop.

When we balked at the increase in cost Todd said he would take off the price of the window tint, but we still had to pay the additional $300.00 for the stickers.  I reminded him of our initial conversation about paying ""Sticker"" price and after being at this dealer for three hours, he told me, ""my position is basically this, if you don't buy the car, I'll just sell it to someone else!""

I have worked in sales all my life and have NEVER treated a customer the way this guy treated me and my wife.  He couldn't care less about charging us more then he agreed on and wasn't apologetic in any way.   Very rude, especially for a so called General Manager!

The dealership's practice of automatically adding Lo-Jack to every car as a way of boosting their profits, was very upsetting--it turned what could have been a great experience into one that took a couple of days and was frustrating. Why should I have to fight to not pay for something that I never wanted to have to begin with? There were times that I was ready to buy a different brand car because of the hassle, and the sales manager, when he eventually relented and agreed to remove the charge for the Lo-Jack (after repeatedly telling me he couldn't remove the charge), treated me like I was being unreasonable--truly, I was two minutes away from buying a Mazda.",6,34,-1
21948,06-Jul-17,"Do not buy from here. I was given a price up front by Cody Didyoung and specifically asked if there was anything dealer added, and was told no. I guess they forgot to mention the additional $300 charge for VIN stickers they add onto the doors. I made an appointment and was told the car would be ready when I got there. It wasn't. The department that preps vehicles did a horrible job. Sticker goo was left on the rear windows and the front tires were over inflated by 4 pounds. The engine bay looks like someone dumped a 40lb bag of sand in it (I guess that's my fault for assuming the engine bay would be clean). The coolant and windshield wiper fluid weren't anywhere near full, and I feel 23 miles on a car I was told was ""just off the truck"" is a tad excessive. The bottom line is poor attention to detail, things you don't see at some other manufacturer's dealerships. Don't settle for substandard treatment, here or anywhere else.  I contacted the dealership about the above faults with the car and was told the email would be forwarded to the service department, detail department, and the manager.

They ran my daughters credit 7 times which dropped her score 23 points and ultimately didn't add her to the loan because of a clerical error by Equifax. Because she wasn't added to the loan they increased my monthly payment by $10. She was never apart of the original deal when I shook at $350. I was told the $14 difference was gap insurance however the gap was only $4 per month. After they put the loan through my name we called both people we talked to. We never heard back.,6,34,-1

22703,06-Jun-17,"Man the customer service in this place has gone down hill. Especially on the service side... This is honestly the first bad review I have ever wrote. Typically I'm very cordial, calm, and civil about things. 

Today was the worst experience I have ever had.... I went in to get service done on my vehicle today, and the maintenance rep was texting on her phone for 10 minutes before she gave any assistance. Secondly, one of my sensors in the back got pushed in and I asked her if the service guys could put it back into place. Immediately she stated ""You will have to pay for that."" Now when Rick was my service advisor, he would first go through the car and if anything was needed, he would explain thoroughly what was needed and my options.  After waiting an hour and a half just for an oil change and hoping they would do something with the sensor, she came back and said they tried to work on it and I needed a new sensor. ($140). Now the price didn't bother me if it was needed... When I went to my car after they said it was finished, I noticed the back sensor wasn't even touched. I went home and literally put it back in its place and it works fine... So now not only do I feel I am being screwed but the lack of work ethic from this dealership is inexcusable.  

Last year I purchased a 2015 Sonata Limited 2.0T from Raymond and because the service was so outstanding, My fiancé and I went in not a week later and leased a veloster from him. The service was so great that I didn't even argue the sticker price on the sonata. I appreciate great customer service and loyalty to their customers. We were honestly wanting to be life long customers and was really contemplating upgrading to a Genesis soon. Now I'm not so sure that's going to happen with WIN Hyundai. 

A little advice to the people in service (Amber Morales) ... Give your customers your undivided attention. Make them feel welcomed and not a burden. When they ask for something small, do not immediately go into demands. By all means... if you have a customer waiting to be helped, put your cell phone away. You are on company time... not personal... If you provide great customer service, you will have life long customers...

So I submitted the web request via their website and I was contacted by a very sweet lady named ""Maggie Tellez"" who's business card says she's their internet and fleet manager. After going through the motions with them, letting them see my bank statements and run my credit they got me an approval which I found to be an amazing surprise considering im fresh off a discharged bank ruptcy. Then Maggie told me that her finance manager said it was a today only approval that they bank would not approve it tomorrow. ""This was my first red flag, in my 31 years of age I have purchased a couple different cars and have never heard that one before."" So after some talking back and forth I left I promised id call back before their close time of 9pm. I went home got online and found that auto loan approvals are good for 30 to 60 days depending on the bank. I sent Maggie a text message saying their finance guy is lying to me and that if he wants to be straight forward with me and gets me a lower monthly payment ill go sign paperwork tonite. Via text message Maggie admitted that they are trying to meet a daily sales quota and I admonished that they are trying to meet their quota with deception and scare tactics. She said it was not her, that it was in fact her sales manager who made that decision. I told Maggie that I found that unprofessional and  not honorable.

23765,31-Mar-17,"I purchased a new Elantra from Keyes Hyundai Woodland Hills.  Although I ultimately got a good purchase price for the car, the car buying experience was awful.  Navid gave me false information.  When I pointed out the deception on the purchase contract regarding an owner loyalty rebate, Navid stated it was an honest mistake.  Navid works under the supervision of an entire team of sales managers- mistakes don't just happen.  This was an attempt to rip me off.  I imagine the sales team more often than not gets away with the deception otherwise the sales team would discontinue the practice.
If you an interested in learning more about my new car buying experience, please continue reading.  I purchased a 2017 Elantra Value Edition with an msrp of $21,350.  I negotiated a purchase price of $20,000 minus all applicable rebates.  I knew I qualified for $4250 worth of rebates.  I thought I qualified for an additional $500 loyalty bonus for a total of $4750 but I was told No by Navid.  Believing Navid's answer was truthful, I agreed to purchase the car for $15,750. (20,000 - 4,250 = $15,750)
When I went to sign the contract, this is what the sales team tried to pull off- they raised the car purchase price to $20,500 ($500 more) and now $4750 instead of $4250 in rebates appeared.  The bottom line price was the same ($15,750) but clearly something had changed that I was not told about.   I dug deeper and it turns out that I actually did qualify for the $500 owner loyalty rebate.that 30 minutes earlier Navid said I did not qualified for.  
When I pointed out that I agreed to a car purchase price of $20,000 minus all applicable rebates, the sales team adjusted the price to $15,250.  Had I not pointed out the false information given to me by Navid about the owner loyalty rebate, I am would have overpaid by $500,  
The sales team will claim this was an honest mistake,  I don't agree but judge for yourself.  In my opinion, there are way to many sales managers overseeing the purchase process for these types of mistakes to just accidentally occur.

On August 8, 2015 at about 8:30 a.m. I came in to this dealership with my parents to look at purchasing a Certified Pre-Owned 2013 Hyundai Accent GS.  I did not have a pleasant experience and feel that if I had not had my parents with me who are very experienced car buyers and have bought 4 different Hyundai's I would have been grossly taken advantage of.

Despite hearing negative reviews about this dealership I decided to give it a try.  My salesman (Luis Zappeda) was nice and I do not have anything negative to say about him.  The issue I had was with the upper management.  Specifically Aram Hovhannisyan the Sales Manager and Gregory Miller the Finance Manager.  To begin my experience Mr. Hovhannisyan had the price of the vehicle up to 16k.  This was rediculois when the list price online said 11,888, and is well over the price I could pay for a NEW Hyundai Accent down at Norm Reeves.  He kept trying to charge me for add ons I told him I did not want, and that had already been charged when the car was initially sold to the first owner!  He also had the DMV tags/Fees up to 529.00!!  When we confronted him about the very high cost he could not explain it and tried to brush it off.  Thankfully I had done my research and knew the cost to register this vehicle and get tags was much lower (176 to be exact).  After proving to him the cost was not what he was trying to charge he finally adjusted it.  

Additionally,when he first came with the APR for the monthly payments it was a staggering 7%.  After I finished laughing at this redicoulus attempt, I told him my credit union can easily get the APR down to 2.4%.  He scoffed walked away and low and behold came back a couple minutes later and had a 2.39%.  The fact that he even started with a 7% APR when my credit score is in the high 700's is ludacris, and once again confirms what I have heard about this dealership.  After a lot more nagotiating, the total price of the car finally go lowered to around 14k.  We informed the Salesman and Sales Manager that I can easliy go down to Norm Reeves Hyundai and purchase a brand new Hyundai Accent, get better service, and pay the exact same price.

We finally agreed on a price and moved on to the Finance Manager Mr. Gregory Miller.  This is where my real dissatisfaction comes from.  He was not trust worthy, he was rude to me as well as my family, and he was grossly unprofessional.  Mr. Miller tried to charge me $400.00 to CERTIFY my Certified Pre-Owned Car.  I was furious.  IT IS ADVERTISED AS Certifed Pre-Owned on the website at the dealership.  When my family and I got angry, showed him the paperwork from the car and from online that says it is already a Certified Pre-Owned vehicle he said he would ""honor it"".  As we continued filling out the paperwork we noticed there was nothing about having to pay an extra $400.00!  When trying to sell me the extra monthly warranty, I told him very clearly I was fine thank you and did not want it.  However of course he kept pushing and pushing.  He would not take no for an answer and seemed to get more and more frustrated and began talking down to me and my parents.

He was also very rude to my father and mother, they were helping me through the proccess as I am a first time buyer.  He rudely asked if my mom was an accountant as we were going over numbers and fine print of the contracts.  He later asked what my dad did.  My father is an LAPD Officer.  As soon as Mr. Miller heard that he asked my dad to sign off on a ticket he got.  VERY unprofessional!  My father was taken back as this guy had just tried to rip us off, was being extremely rude and condescending, then wanted him to sign off on a ticket!  My father, however, politely explained that it is the City's policy that Officers are not allowed to sign off on tickets when off duty.  At that point Mr. Miller lost interest and once again became rude.

I recently took my car back in to this dealership as the plastic in the wheel wells was coming loose.  I had another unpleasant experience in the service dept. with Rickia Smith.  She was also rude.  Tried to charge me 68 dollars to reattach some clip.  I specifically told her no do not fix it, as i was not going to pay 68 dollars for that.  I was then left sitting in the waiting area for 2 hours.  I finally noticed my car sitting outside and Mrs. Smith was no where to be seen.  I had to go ASK someone for my car so I could leave.  A guy completed the paperwork, slapped down a pen and receipt and tried to charge me 68 dollars!  I refused to pay as I did not agree to the price and specifically told them not to do anything.  He stared at me, rudely grabbed my keys and receipt shoved them at me and said don't worry about it, just go.

Talked again about the price with sales guy Art Simon's I even mentioned that I use to work at a dealership for 19 years. He had to get the price okayed by the sales managers because I didn't want to buy the snake oil package of waxes and alarms. The sales manager agreed to the price as listed on cars.com. I went home 35 miles picked up my Daughter as this car is for her. Drove back she drove the car and loved it. I told Art let's do it. This is were this dealer gets shady. The managers work up the paper work and they slip in the 2k in accessories thinking I wouldn't notice.  I refuse the deal and the manager  Artsrun Oganesyan comes in and tries to offer a discount on this accessories that they want to install on the car . I mentioned again I am not interested.  He then starts making excuses about there's no money in the deal without the package and they include this on every car after the deal is figured out. BAIT AND SWITCH.  I ask him to contact the original manager that had already  agreed to this deal and he refused.  Today I call the dealership ask to talk with the general manager and the receptionist refuses to put me through to his voicemail.  I then asked for  Hani Nassif  the owner's voicemail.

After my experience, I’m pretty sure no one will read this email let alone care. But if I owned this dealership or this company I would want to know how I just lost a loyal, BUYING customer. 

Until today, my husband was a longtime Hyundai driver that would happily drive Hyundais for the rest of his life. When our family needed a new car he insisted on another Hyundai. We both drove and decided on the 2019 Kona SE gas model. 

We researched and talked to numerous dealerships to get the best price. We finally talked to a dealership south of our location that quoted us an out-the-door price. We spoke on the phone and texted. The person I talked to said she had spoken to her bosses and they were aware of the price quoted. My husband, our 2 year old son and I drove the one hour south to this Win Hyundai dealership in Carson, CA to buy the car. 

Once there we did not get to see the woman whom we spoke with, we were told she was the assistant. We asked to drive the exact car we were quoted and the one we were going to buy and we were told that the prices were the same and we could drive any of them, so my husband test drove the car he thought we would buy while I waited with our two-year-old. 

We were very clear from the moment we arrived that we were there to buy the car for the out-the-door price we were quoted. I didn’t care about monthly payments, colors, trims- we just wanted to buy the car we were quoted for the price we were quoted. The salesmen said that price was good and he would try to get the same price for the car we test drove. We told him we didn’t really care about which car, we just wanted them to honor the price we were quoted.

That’s when the games started. The car wasn’t at that lot. The keys to the car couldn’t be found. The mileage didn’t match. 
Almost two hours later after being assured this will all work out, a new manager came into the office and basically said they would not honor that price for a myriad of reasons and stared talked different numbers and installed packages that were never even discussed before.

Long story short, they did not honor what they promised and when we called them out they said ‘too bad’ smiled like real jerks and said we can leave.

Like I said before, after this experience I’m pretty sure no one will read this email let alone care. But if I owned this dealership or this company I would want to know how I just lost a loyal, BUYING customer.

24203,23-Jul-17,"I walked in under the idea that I would be able to purchase a car advertised at 21000 that ended up costing way more. Many of the rebates did not apply as I was not a college student or an uber driver. Being a car dealership, I should have anticipated the price was too good to be true, but I liked John and wanted the car.  My biggest disappointment was dealing with the finance manger who explained the items of the contract, but upon closer look some things were optional though I was led to believe that the dealer covered the cost, i.e. paint protection. I also declined several offers for the maintenance package and somehow it ended up on the contract until I corrected the manager that I did not want the package. Had I signed, I would have been stuck with something that was, I believe, discretely put in hopes I would overlook.  The biggest disappointment I faced was the trade in, which did not happen. Even though I own the car outright and had a notarized letter from the former lien holder stating so, I did not have the original title and the dealer would not work with me. I was not given any guidance as how to correct the problem. I was offered  to store my car at the dealership until it was resolved. After contacting several other dealers and DMV's I was told that the dealer probably didnt want to spend the money to find the title or to acquire it. I guess spending 28k doesn't tip the service meter anymore. I decided to contact the GM and was directed to a voicemail that had no greeting or name, just a ""please leave your message at the tone"". I left a message and no one has bothered to email or call me regarding this issue.  I can not fault John as he did everything in his power to get the best deal, but I think his managers were not interested in helping him out. I could see it on his face. I appreciate his integrity and hope that in the future his managers will do a little more to help him make the deal. It should be noted I left the dealership during mid negotiation to attend a meeting in OC and then returned to close the deal. That was my commitment to John.  It is unfortunate that customer service, helping the customer, going the extra mile isnt a part of your culture.  As a person in management, I would have a conversation with those negotiating the deals in the back room. Yes, you are selling a car, but you are also selling an experience and customer loyalty.

We went into a Santa Fe and I was excited to see a CD player and informed Chris that a CD player was important to me (I'm old school I guess). He nodded and said that the Tucsons sill had them unlike the Sonatas. Unfortunately I never looked at the Tucson close enough during the test drive because I did not catch the lack of a CD player. WIN Hyundai also did not have the color of the trim I wanted so they had to get one from another dealer and I was promised that it would be ready and delivered to my house by noon the following day but this was pushed back all the way to 4pm.

24269,07-Mar-17,"That low rating is mostly for the customer service. Which was/is poor. I posted my review elsewhere but here it is again, in all its verbosity.

Well I suppose it's time to post my review of Win Hyundai in Carson.

It started off fine. I purchased a car from saleman Mike back in the middle/end of December. It was a trade-in/purchase. No real problems there. In fact outside of the time it took, it was relatively painless. Mike was an amenable guy. The trade was probably as good as can be expected, although getting the hard sell during the paperwork was a drag, but I know it's part of the process.

The more painful part started when 1. I didn't get the extra set of keys and 2. there was some confusion with the registration/license plates. In fact, the last reason is a contributing factor why I am giving them a poor review. The customer service. Or rather, lack thereof.

It was annoying enough that it took almost a month to get my extra keys 'programmed' and that I had to wait almost 2 hours during a Sunday visit. Ok, no problem. But over the course of the last 2 months, I've been getting a few letters DMV regarding my lapsing registration for the car I traded it, including a renewal and a warning notice. I was under the (correct) assumption that the registration paperwork I took care of with the sales team during the sales transaction (including for the trade-in) was eliminating the need for me to register the car or would also take the old car (the trade in) off the DMV registration rolls.

Apparently I was wrong. I'm still getting notices about the car.

Which leads to my current (ongoing, frustrating, disappointing) issue with the customer service department at Win Hyundai Carson. It sucks. I've been getting repeat emails (form letters) from Win Hyundai about a service appoint. Apparently I was just assigned a random appointment without my knowledge of scheduling, and just expected to be present. For whatever reason (the email didn't clarify.) When I tried to respond to the email, and to the email of a one Daniel Hernandez (Service Manager) - nothing. Even after repeated attempts to contact via email. And via the online chat (with 3 different chat personnel, apparently, none of whom, of course, work directly FOR or WITH Hyundai, they are just random chat agents who 'contact' Hyundai with complaints - or not since NONE of the 3 times I chatted, were my complaints or messages relayed BACK to Hyundai, or at least, responded too. And I placed a few phone calls DIRECTLY to Win Hyundai Carson, and left a few messages FOR Daniel Hernandez, via the (somewhat clueless) ladies answering the phone or leaving him a voice mail directly, on 2 different occasions. They didn't seem to have a very good grasp on what was going on or even seemed to care that much. I didn't get the cold shoulder (ear) but there wasn't much sympathy from them, even after I explained myself (a few times) and my situation (a real drag.) Subsequently, leaving a voicemail and message with customer service for Mike, my sales rep (whether he's even still there or not, who knows!) was to no avail.

So to encapsulate: 3 chats, numerous emails, numerous voice mails, numerous phone messages left with customer service representatives AND 3 communicates through Facebook messenger - which were responded to, and I was promised a response, over a week or two - and guess what? No return emails. No return phone calls. No return Facebook message (other than the empty promise of 'we promise we'll get to your message!' - another lie? strung along again) - NOTHING even after WEEKS of trying to get Daniel (or Mike, or... anyone) to return my messages.

Which, at this point, I almost forget what my original questions/issues were. Actually I do remember, all to well. The appointment i was booked for outside of my knowledge, and the status of my car registration (or deregistration of the trade-in car since that was promised to be 'taken care of' during the sale/trade in transaction back in December.)

So my recommendation? Car sales - ok. Customer service? Poor. The worst part? I'm a NEW CUSTOMER of WIN HYUNDAI! I just BOUGHT a new car 3 months ago! Is this the way you treat a new, potential long term, future customer? I don't think so. Incredibly frustrating, very disappointing, and certainly, not a company or dealer I would recommend just on customer service alone - which is probably one of the most important facets of a business, especially one that thrives on customer service with such a high quality, efficient automobile they are representing.

Truly stupefying especially now that I'm going to be taking the car I bought from WIN Hyundai and having it serviced and accounted for elsewhere. As well as my friends and family - who I won't recommend to use WIN Hyundai. I've actually gotten better and more efficient customer service from the Cable Company.

24655,04-Sep-14,"HORRIFIC SERVICE DEPARTMENT & SALES

I don't usually waste my time writing reviews and I don't really have the time to do them, but I had to leave a review for this place. 

SALES: I purchased my 2014 Veloster from them and this should have been grounds for me to run. The sales guy at first was accommodating, friendly and pleasing to deal with. He found me the car I wanted and all was good... until the day came when they ran my credit and he realized I had a trade-in. To cut all this short, his attitude changed completely and became totally distant. He even went as far as to say, ""Maybe you can go to another dealer."" Bottom line is I still got the car here despite his terrible attitude, and it was due to his boss that was more professional than he. Still this was an unpleasant experience... but this is not the worst part. 

((SERVICE DEPARTMENT)) 

DO NOT COME HERE. Their service department is just the worst. Horrible customer service. I called to make an appointment with them to bring my car in for several problems I am having with the car, and the person that answers the phone, 2 TIMES, I had him tell me, ""Can I give you a call back?"" and never did. I gave them one more try before I left this review and guess what... he said the same thing to me again. I am just horrified that a place like this would have such horrific customer service. Just to get transferred to the customer service department it took almost 10 minutes. The number you call initially is to Win Chevrolet, from there the person that answers transfers you to Hyundai, then the receptionist there asks where can she transfer you... again. I just don't get it. Go anywhere else but here. xxxx, even Southbay Hyundai is better, and they were horrible also, but at least they took care of me. ",6,37,23

Sales person, one of the nicest people I’ve dealt with. Service writer, another one of the nicest people I’ve dealt with.
Carlos in fincance, total disgrace. Very rude individual who changes interpretation of written documents to his advantage. Tries to fool customers into things when the written material is stating it a certain way. Doesn’t care for what the customer has to say or what the customer needs, only cares for his numbers (after all that’s what the finance department’s main goal is, numbers).
Richard Michaelson, the owner of Riverside Hyundai, another pathetic individual who doesn’t care about his customers or their personal information.
He showed my personal profile to another customer just because they said they were related to me without my consent and without me being present. Doesn’t matter if the person says they’re my sibling or if they say they are me, before showing any personal information he needs to ask for identification or ask for my consent. Michaelson is a rude individual to speak to and i definitely will not do business again with Riverside Hyundai when it comes to purchasing a new vehicle. As far as service goes, My service writer’s customer service is great and that’s the only one thing that brings me back here for service.

The offers do include ""fine print"" which states the offers are subject to any dealer added options - so this dealership operates within the law, but uses very deceptive practices.  There are plenty of other dealerships in the area who do not use these ""bait and switch"" practices - After leaving Riverside Hyundai we went to another dealership and purchased the vehicle we had gone to the dealership to test drive.",6,37,-1

Be very careful when buying a call from Riverside Hyundai.    The price they have on their website does not include any dealer add-on.   Although most of the times you can choose to add these services, Riverside Hyundai forces you to buy them.    They put LoJack on every car at the cost of $1,200 and then tell you there is no way to buy a car without.    Therefore, the price you saw on their website would be much higher than when you walk-in.   This is a clear bait & switch.   

They say that the fine print says that the website price does not include dealer add-on.   However, if I don't have a choice of not getting the dealer add-on, then the price of the car on the site is not a true reflection.

The sales rep told me later that's why all of their cars have it.  I asked to have it removed and they told me they couldn't do that.  They charge the customer for it, essentially making the customer pay to protect them, and it makes them a lot of extra money over the life of the loan.  It's a scam.  Turns out, my local dealership in Orange County doesn't put LoJack on any of their vehicles and told me they never get cars from Riverside because they all have LoJack and then they have to charge the customer for it.  So what looks like a good price quote isn't. They also told me that I would get a discount on my insurance for having it, but turns out Auto Club does not offer any discount for LoJack.

However, there are 2 things you need to know so that you don't get taken advantage of, as I was.  Many cars say that they already have windows tinted and LoJack installed - and they will upcharge you for these additions unless you object.  I have learned that LoJack is NOT already installed and the windows are NOT already tinted, but they will try to trick you into accepting these additions unless you object.  They also charge MORE THAN RETAIL for the LoJack.  Secondly, in my purchase, they agreed to a finance rate of 1.9% and then did it at 2.99%.  When I learned about this change, I called them and they said that since I did not catch it when they did the paperwork (there is SO MUCH paperwork!), that there was nothing they could do about their mistake.

25226,24-May-14,"This place has got to be one of the shadiest dealership around! First of all, as a precautionary measure, I called the dealership to talk to someone to ensure that the specific year/model (2014 Genenis w/tech package) of the car I was looking for was available. Of course they said it was there. Upon my arrival, the person I spoke to wasn't available, the model wasn't on the floor, so I wasted my gas and time driving there. They then attempted to put me into another vehicle (same model/year, but not MY color), so I listened to the offer. We went back and forth on pricing. They finally came down to $35,700 before tax, licensing, and doc fees (roughly $3,800). I balked the offer and countered one last time, so apparently the sales manager (Emad Mahroom) was so offended that he came up and out of his chair with the offer sheet in my face (I'm seated) and ask,""Excuse me sir...how much do you want this vehicle for?"" I responded ""$33,000"". He then crumpled the offer sheet right in my face and said have a good evening. I was extremely offended and humiliated; it took all of my tact and professionalism as a service member (Marine) to not blast off on this jerk. I then gathered my family and we departed the dealership. The next morning the sales associate (Madj Alhaddad) calls me back up to apologize and sweeten the pot on the vehicle. They still wanted the $35,700, but then threw in an extended bumper to bumper warranty + the add ons the dealership placed on the vehicle (tint, interior/exterior coating, Lo-Jack). I was enticed to say the least. After careful consideration and counseling from other dealers in the area I was convinced that this was a great deal, so I confirmed the deal. $35,700 + docs, fees, and taxes. Once again as a precautionary measure, I asked the sales associate to document the details of the sale via e-mail. The pricing breakdown: MSRP, the add ons, the warranty, the docs, fees, and taxes, interest rate/term, every little detail. As expected, they didn't provide it to me. About an hour later I get an e-mail telling me that they want to restructure. 48 HOURS OF GOING BACK AND FORTH! I make the commitment, and they basically reneged on EVERY promise that they quoted me on via phone conversations and text messages (on more than one occasion). I feel cheated and lied to. Riverside Hyundai should be ashamed of themselves for these shady practices and tactics. Don't go to these jokers unless you want to get played with! Especially Brian ""Big B"" Wilson. The only bright star I saw in the whole ordeal was Madj the sales associate. She was extremely professional and did everything in her power to give me a solid deal. Someone gave her the $35,700 quote, but no one is owning up to it. I have text and email traffic stating this offer, and plan on speaking with an attorney today and the Better Business Burial for some justification.",6,37,-1

I was not told any other options at that price range. I was not offered to see any other models or styles. Everybody wants the signing to go as quickly as possible, but I would also like to know all of my options at this time considering this is a vehicle I will be driving for the next 3 years. Andy pulled up and connected me to a 2018 electric blue Hyundai Elantra SE with no backup cam, bluedrive, or Sirius radio installed. I also noticed the rims were not to my liking immediately and mentioned that to Andy who told me the car was already under my name so basically there was nothing I could do.

I did not believe him, I went for a second opinion to a friend (who was too busy for me in the first place, why I went to Hyundai).  He found the hoses disconnected, one was connected using a wire tie (not OEM).  My mechanic assures me leaving these hoses disconnected is the reason why the engine light came on, not because of the air pum.  He tested the air pump, and found nothing wrong with it.  Hyundai told me there was nothing they could do for me, I should have  brought it back to them to put the hoses back on.  They do not trust other mechanic's opinions, except for Hyundai's mechaincs.

26012,02-Oct-16,Sadly I have had to deal with this dealer for a number of years as they are within a mile of my home. One thing I know about is service and honesty and this dealership lacks both. This dealership has a policy of screwing customers for sport and they have perfected it. The two worst people at the dealership are Morris the sales manger and Mike Hanka the service manger both of which go far beyond the stereotype of sleazy car salesmen. I generally try to take my car to any other Hyundai dealership when I have the time.  If you take the time to read the negative reviews they all trend the same. The dealership has no incentive to help people out. My experience today is just crazy. I took my car in at 7am for a warranty item and now at 2 PM they haven't even looked at the car. I am contemplating just taking a day off and taking it to a more competent dealership. We regret buying our car from this dealership,6,38,-1
26104,04-Apr-16,"I would love to give good reviews like at Tustin Hyundai, the sales guys are great. I did purchase my 2015 Sonata from this dealership, but only because they gave me the best price around.  The sales guy really didn't tell me all the car can do.  I had to find out for myself.  He also didnt tell my father (who also bought a car) even though my father went back a few times to ask.  The Sonata has an awesome tech package that I really love.  Wish the sales guy would have been more knowledgeable or willing to share info.
Now lets talk about service:.  Took my brand new (purchased in Dec) car into dealer for 1st service.  Service guys weren't rude or anything, just didn't seem to actually want to service my car.  I asked them to look at something and they told me it would take an additional 3 hours!!! WHAT???  A simple thing, like how come safety belts dont automatically retract when I unclick?   Im not waiting 3 hours to have that looked at.  Got in my car after supposed service is done an now ALL OF MY TIRES has LOW AIR WARNING.  They supposedly rotated tires.  No warning lights before I went in!!  Also my phone no longer connects.  I have a call out to service manager who still hasn't called me back!  Super disappointed in service.  Unfortunate as I love the Hyundai Sonata. ",6,38,75
26131,23-Dec-15,"I was a returning customer so I thought I would have been treated better.  Morris the ""middle man"" between the Salesperson and Finance department had an extremely ""dry"" personality and did not even smile one time.  I should have walked out during process and regret that I didn't.  I will definitely will not be coming back again to them after my last experience in Sales dept.  I love the vehicle and the payment is decent and $0 down payment so that is only reason I agreed to terms",6,38,-1
26242,21-Aug-13,"Very disappointed with the service department. Went in because my car engine light went on. The service advisor didn't give me an update of my car until almost 5:30pm and told me the car had to stay overnight. Next morning still didn't get an update until 5:00pm, & was told to pick up car. Apparently it was a ""transmission sensor"" that needed to be fixed and ordered and that they would call me once it was in. A week passed I never Recieved a call so I called to get an update because I rely on my car and it was shifting and not driving well, which almost caused a fatal accident in the freeway. The part that was suppose to be ordered was not ordered. Another week passed and again no call so I called and sure enough the part was in. Took the car in the next morning it took them almost a week to change a sensory part on the transmission. Got the car back and was told there was a 50/50 chance it would work. Well guess what it didn't work. Called the service advisor he said he would talk to the mechanic and call me back. No call and when I attempted to call back they would put me on hold and never answer. I was on hold for 45 minutes and no one gave me a response. Had to call the attribution number since my car is still under warranty. They are now some what on customer service since I called Corp. but still lack alot of professionalism and customer service. The only reason why I gave them a 2 on customer service is because the cashier Star is amazing. Extremely friendly very courtesy and has a huge smile when she greets you. & the shuttle guy don't recall his name was very friendly as well. ",6,38,223
26258,24-Jun-13,"I took my Santa Fe to Glendora Hyundai because the engine was making a loud noise a week later Mike from service told me that my car was leaking oil and it was fixed; when I when to get the car the noise was louder then ever, the master mechanic got involved and he said that something was wrong with the engine and he need it to order the parts; six weeks later NO PARTS, NO CAR not even a phone call to let me know what is going on I been calling every week  I been there 5 times and every time I go there no work is been done in my Santa Fe mean while I am paying for car rentals $450. 00 so far.

26282,25-Apr-13,"Took vehicle in for service. Received vehicle back with scratch on door frame. Dealer denies any involvement with scratch.

I wash my car weekly, I am very careful with my car. I keep my car detailed, taking great care not to damage the paint. There were no scratches until I left the vehicle for servicing. I received the car back with a scratch. The dealer ignores me, denies that they are at fault.

I spoke with the owner of the dealership, he loses his patience and has the nerve to hang up on me... the customer! Great customer service coming from a dealer! I expect far greater service, and understanding of customers, especially from a dealer! Not in this case, the owner, and all of its employees are careless, they don't appreciate customers.

All the service advisors are incompetant, they have no idea how to run an efficient operation. The customer is left wondering what is going on with their, they have to call and find out if the car is done.

Horrible experience, horrible employees and owner, what a horrible dealership!",6,38,1988
26364,18-Dec-12,"I bought my Hyundai Accent on 09/12 and I first contacted the Internet Department for which John Bryant is the manager. My impression was that I did not get the chance to interact with John because the car I was buying was the cheapest they have honestly. He asked what car we were talking about and when I said an Accent we said he was busy with another customer and left. I eventually was treated much better by Sam and Vince, which are friendly and knowledgeable really. I Called John a couple of days later to go pick up the car... when I got there the car was not ready nor it had the spare key. I had to wait for the car to be washed and I had to wait 10 days to get my spare key, for which I had to drive again to the dealer obviously. To complete the story, after more than 3 months I am still waiting for the manuals that are supposed to come with any new car. I really do not understand why a person like John is in charge of the Department, I always got better attention with Sam or Vince, though John is the manage and that is probably the reason why I still do not have my car manual!",6,38,-1

As one of the other reviews that I have read - I have had the same if not worse experience
On Saturday they have promissed me that they will get me a car  from another dealership / we have agreed on the price / and terms and other things as well
I had to pay the deposit - to make sure that I will show up and take the car from them 

They were to get me the car by Monday morning / On monday they called me and let me know what the car they were supposed to get me - They JUST DON`T HAVE IT and that they made a mistake 
They have advised me that they have located one other vehicle of the same color and package but i would have to PAY AN EXTRA 1200.00-1500.00 for the s=transportation because it is too far away .

He says it is, but since he work it up as the exact opposite of what I was describing, I will give it a week or so to check it.  I have had this vehicle for only four days.

So i took it the next step up and talk to another manager who also said he would get to the bottom of it and promised that he would call me. again never heard from them. My wife and i have had two Hyundais both bought From Glendora been having all services done by Hyundai except tires and brakes.

26427,26-Jul-12,"I've never complained like this about a dealer, but I've had an utterly unprofessional experience with Glendora Hyundai's service department. The details are as follows:

I called the Glendora Hyundai service department on Saturday 6/23/12 and explained to their service representative, Mike, that I was noticing unusual sounds coming from the clutch on my Accent. We setup an appointment for me to come in on the morning of Saturday 6/30/12. I came in on the morning of Saturday 6/30/12. Apparently, Mike had the mechanics go over the car to determine the problem. Based on the mechanic's inspection, Mike informed me that he ordered a throwout bearing which he expected to arrive at the dealership on 7/5/12. He said he would give me a call on Thursday 7/5/12 and schedule me to drop my car off Monday morning 7/9/12 to repair my car. Well, on 7/5/12 I did not hear from Mike. So on Friday 7/6/12 I called the service department and ended up speaking to Robert, another one of Glendora Hyundai's service representatives, who said  Mike was on vacation that week. I thought, really, so why did Mike say he would call me on 7/5/12 if he was going to be on vacation that week? Strange, no? Anyway, I said I would call early the next week if I didn't hear from Mike before that. I called again on Wednesday 7/11/12 to followup. Again I ended up speaking to Robert. This time Robert said that Mike had not been on vacation, but had had a death in the family. Confusing, yes? Robert then said Mike would be on duty in about an hour, and he would leave a message for Mike about my call. Well, I never did hear from Mike.

In summary, Mike simply strung me along for a few weeks and then hanged me out to dry while I was attempting to have a potentially or actually serious car problem repaired putting my car and me unnecessarily at risk.

I have to wonder what Mike's excuse is for such shabby, unprofessional conduct? I find Robert's behavior disappointing as well. He seemed more concerned with covering for Mike than helping me as a customer. It doesn't say much for Glendora Hyundai's management that it has loose cannons like this ""serving"" customers. I've notified various members of Glendora Hyundai's management about this. To my knowledge, they've done nothing to discipline Mike and Robert or take action to assure that incidents like this are not repeated.  

It's stunning that their employees would rather give customers the runaround when they could make hundreds of dollars on a repair job, create a loyal customer who would come back for additional service as the need arose and be a source of referrals as well.

Despite this, at least 5 other customers who arrived after me finished before me. My car sat out front for at least 45 minutes while the service person (Mike) completed the paperwork even though my car was already finished. Other customers that he also handled but came after me, were finished before me.

26455,02-Jun-11,"Avoid this dealership! I do not know how they used to be, but I had to deal with Morris, Mike and Alex.  They are dishonest and will try to take advantage of you.  Alex acts like he is on your side, perhaps he is torn on what to do himself, but in the end he is still shady.  Morris, is flat out rude and condescending (at least to females).  Mike can be professional, but can also be extremely prideful and defensive.  

When I first went there, Morris and Mike were not working with me (being rude, dishonest, etc.).  I still wanted to see if I would be approved, but the finance company was closed so they told me they will call me in the morning to let me know if I was approved. In the morning, I received a friendly call from Alex letting me know that I was approved and that I could come in.  (They knew I live an hour away).  Alex told me Mike and Morris were not in so he could work with me on lowering the numbers as well.  

When I arrived, Mike and Morris were definitely there, and he had actually raised the numbers (He had straight out lied to me and he didn't even address it or apologize even when I brought it up).  I drove an hour out there for nothing.  They refused to negotiate and I ended up going to Commerce Hyundai.  I saw AMAZING reviews for Ty and Arnold so I decided to check them out.  

They were amazing, kind, honest, straight up, and worked with me. Everything was very transparent and I didn't feel like I had to figure out what they were trying to play like I had to in Glendora.  Please learn from my mistake.  I don't want anyone else to get ripped off or tricked there because of the unethical things they practice in Glendora Hyundai.

Dealing with the car issues from the time of purchase to the time we surrendered the car was an absolute nightmare. I could write a book on the insane stories and run around treatment we received from this location. I will share one story, which was the beginning of the end. The service was for tire sensor light that came on. We were advised the tire sensors were faulty and all 4 would need to be replaced, when the car was returned we were asked if there were a lot of potholes where we lived, because there were Bubble bulges on all 4 tires. We observed the tires and noticed the rims  all had pry mark scratches that aligned with the bubbles on the tires. We refused to take our car off the lot and demanded they fix our tires and rims. In the days that followed we were told they were fighting with continental tires for faulty tires... The tires weren’t faulty, the employee who worked on my car that day was. 6 weeks later, we got our car back with new tires and “repaired rims” the scratches were still visible, they refused to replace them. My car at the time was only 4 months old. We finally got a lemon law lawyer and turned the car in.

Expect to pay at least $1000 (pay attention to the $995 on the paperwork) or more than what is advertised on a used vehicle and who knows how much more on a new vehicle. Even the Sales Manager is in on the game. He comes out and says he didn't agree to what the salesperson says he could do and that the salesperson's language barrier may confuse some customers. The salesperson was standing right there when he made that derogatory comment.  I have no time for games and deceptive practices. Who puts a bunch of hidden dealer addons on to the top of the price of a USED vehicle? Paint protection on a car that already has scratches and swirls. Nitrogen in tires. The air is 78% nitrogen. I guess we all should be charged for that. VIN theft stickers in case someone steals and dismantles your car. These add ons they are charging for say a lot about the dealership. In addition, any addons should be negotiated with the original owner or better yet not charged extra at all because they are done for the purpose of collecting hidden fees from customers. On a used vehicle you are making 2nd and 3rd owners pay for these same addons an additional time. Quit making customers have to come into your dealership to have to deal with your FINE PRINT fees. Then you as a customer are spending all your time haggling over these Add On costs at the dealer's attempt to distract you from negotiating a lower price on the actual price of the car. We were ready to buy the car but were not paying for these deceptive add ons and the sales manager said if we didn't want to pay for them we don't have to buy a car from them so we didn't.

In other words, screw the brand, we only provide the best service to our own customers.  Scott was basically saying that CardinaleWay Hyundai Genesis does't really care about the brands it sells, or its customers. WOW!!  This came directly from the GM!

On the day my cars was to be done, I did not hear from anyone.  I tried calling twice with no one giving me an answer.  The next day I tried again and finally after 2 tries and several hours of waiting, plus the insurance adjuster trying to get an answer I waited on hold for 15 minutes for Carlos to finally come on the line and tell me my car was going to be another week.  
Yesterday when my car was to be done and I can get it back, nothing again. I called Carlos for him to tell me it was done the day before and he meant to call me.  Since I didn't find out until too far into the day I had to wait until today. When I got there Carlos had told my adjuster if he sent proof their check was on the way I could get my car, but Carlis didn't tell anyone and then said no.  Turns out some confusion on the check from the day before which Carlos failed to contact me or Insurance to get cleared up.  So once again lack of follow-up.  I ended up having to pay 7800 out of my pocket and have the insurance company reimburse me in order to get my car back.  When I tried to get the manager to help he was rude an unhelpful.  I told him I fly out tomorrow and will be gone for 5 days his response was well we need to figure something else out because you can't leave your car here.  Even the manager has poor customer service.
My advice, stay away. I was going to trade my Sonata in on a Hybrid next year it will not be happening at this dealership.",6,39,15
26492,04-Apr-18,"They lied to me about the car I purchased. They told me that it was certified pre-owned. I had another dealership inspect the car due to several issues involving rust, and it turns out the car was involved in a frontal collision. 

Dealer told me that the car was never involved in a car accident. Caught in the lie. Second lie was when they said the car was certified and it passed inspection. It didn't because the hood of the vehicle has been patched along with the front bumper. 

Fighting with GM over the lies I was told is another issue. He sounds like a crook and uses vocabulary accordingly. ",6,39,134
26496,13-Jan-18,"This dealership lied, misrepresented, and said whatever it took to get us in a used car which ended up spending a month in the shop. We were called at least once a month for the last year of our lease asking us to come in and look around. Our lease was up in December. In October we saw a used truck on their website. We came in and liked it, but expressed concern about ending our lease early. We were told all we would pay was October's payment, and a restock fee of $400 because we weren't purchasing the vehicle or getting in another lease. Several times I asked different individuals, so I don't pay a lease termination fee, and was told no. The truck was a lemon. The day after taking it home, the check engine light came on. It spent 4 weeks in the shop, was even sent back to the manufacturer. During that time, yes, I did have to make November's payment on the lease, because I was lied to, I also of course had to pay on the truck (which was in the shop). This totalled $800 on two vehicles I was not driving. The general manager apologized that I was misinformed, but said there was nothing he could do about it.
After finally getting my truck back, I received a notice from Hyundai finance. I would be paying the restock fee, which I anticipated, but also a $490 lease termination fee. I will also be charged for any damages of course, which there are none and we also were well under mileage.
Nobody can help me resolve this. Everyone passes the buck along. GM blames the salesperson, corporate blames the dealership, finance says the dealership should reimburse me but they can't waive it.
I will tell all my friends not to go here, not only because they lie but Hyundai doesn't have a good corporate structure. I'll stick with Honda, which has excellent customer service and Norm Reeves Cerritos is the best. I have purchased 2 cars from them and leased one. I was even over the miles on one and the finance company waived it since I was a repeat customer.",6,39,-1

26503,18-Dec-17,"Most horrible dealership and the worst experience of my life!! Talked to Roman (sales person) over the phone and he gave the pricing for the new car and confirmed with the senior manager about pricing before I drove 2 hours to get to this dealership! He called me 4 times and confirmed that there are no scams and price that we had finalized on includes all taxes,titles and fees. He said that he will have the paperwork with the same figures and the car ready for me when I get there. After test driving the vehicle and sitting down for paperwork, he ended up putting $4000 more than the price I was told just 2-3 hours ago. I was so shocked and asked him what just happened! He was hoping that I won't catch the difference of $4000?? Then, we checked with the Managers working there and all of them seemed like SCAM artists to me. Even after the sales person agreed in front of managers to telling the price to me over the phone, they said they will NOT honor the price. They said either take the price with $4000 more or just leave! They started using bad language and rudely asked me to leave! I've never had anyone treat me this way and I don't understand how a dealership would tolerate this kind of behavior. I wasted the whole day and time! PLEASE DON'T come to this dealership and waste your time and money!!!! This is my first time ever writing a review online because I genuinely don't want anyone else to go through the trouble like I did. Please stay far away from this dealership and these scam artists!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

26515,24-Nov-17,"Worst dealer ever!  We have never been treated so poorly in trying to buy a car. I always try to give companies the benefit of the doubt, but  wow.... You guys are TRULY a piece of work and DO NOT care about customer service. I cannot believe you find it acceptable to tell us the car is available and to pick up, then we drive to pick up (after taking time off work to do so) to only have the car NOT be there. Then, when we question the dealer as to why, we're told it's OUR fault. Ummm..... No, it's your fault, and don't you dare try to blame your customers.

At this point, we should have listened to our gut with the whole ""fool me once, shame on you"" ringing in our ears, but nope.... We fell for your scams telling us the car would arrive that day and if we're there first thing in the morning with an appointment, it's ours at the price we negotiated. Well, shame on us, because we arrive a 1/2 hour before our appointment, and these spineless slime xxxxx are giving the car away to someone else because they're willing to pay a little more for dealer adds on you haven't even put on the car yet. xxxx, I'm sure you're reading this and saying, oh, well obviously it's your fault because that's the mentality your salesman have. 

We will NEVER return to your store, and we will make sure not a single person we know EVER sets foot on your premises. The only thing making me OK with the way you guys treat your customers is knowing karma will come back and bite you guys in the xxx.",6,40,130
26588,26-Jul-17,"I had a 10:00 AM appointment & waited for 3hrs to be able to speak with a finance manager even after having an appointment to come in and sign.  This was a lease deal, and the terms were already set and I had waited for the vehicle to come in for several weeks.  The leasing manager couldn't speak to the contract, and had to get advice and help from other parties while I waited.  The vehicle had scratches on the hood, and hadn't been detailed when I arrived.  I had to choose if I wanted to wait longer, or leave the scratches.  The vehicle also didn't have a full charge, and I was given the option to wait yet again for the charging to be done (which didn't get done prior to my appointment) or leave with it as-is.  I was forced to sign paperwork stating that the dealer would take no responsibility for this, even though it was completely their fault and mis-planning, in order to leave.  We had planned to go to LA that afternoon, but this through a barrier to that plan...  Then after about a week, I was contacted to come back and re-sign the contract because there was a mistake in the calculations.  A new contract was sent to me, as I refused to go back and wait, and when I received it I noticed a fee that was not disclosed to me on my initial visit.  I'm extremely dissatisfied.  I was told after the fact that the General Manager said that fee is fixed and if he doesn't agree to it he can just bring the car back.  What kind of customer-focused service is that?  He has never once had the courtesy to contact me in this experience.  The car has 2k miles on it by this point, can you imagine how much time taking the car back will take and what they'll come up with to charge me that that point?  I have agreed to sign yet another contract if sent or delivered to me since my time is so undervalued at Cardinale.  I wish you all the best, and its' obvious that many customers have had a much better experience than myself; but I will not be back.",6,40,104
26620,27-May-17,"We had a TRUECAR guaranteed price that Cardinale Way Hyundai  agreed on. They didn't have the color we wanted but they said they will get it.  The next day they called and asked us to come back to the dealership to sign a document showing our intent to buy the car.  They required us to place a down payment as earnest money and we obliged with a check.  

A couple of days later they called to inform us that the car was ready and we came that same day to purchase it.  As we were going through the price, we noticed some optional fees in the form of extended warranties, etc that we felt were unnecessary.  Right below the base price was an additional 'Installed Options' line in the amount of $995.  The sales person explained that it was for the nitrogen that they inflated the tires with and the 'edge guard strips' (plastic on edge of doors they put on all their cars) which was not yet, by the way, even on the car we were about to take home.  When we first looked at a car the other day, we were told that those features were already included in the price of the car.  So we were baffled why it was being added back on to the base price.  We asked to speak to the manager but we were told that he was already packing up.  We were very disappointed and decided to leave.  On our way out, we saw him, SCOTT JACKSON, general manager of this dealership and we were hoping he would make it right.  We asked why they are charging us those options that we do not want.  Answering from the door of his office, he flatly said the 'Installed Options' is not optional.  He got closer and with hands on his hips he said if we didn't agree with the price with the 'installed Options' price, we didn't have to buy the car and we can just go ahead and leave.  We told him that if he wasn't going to honor the guaranteed price that they agreed on then they just wasted our time having us going back and forth the dealership.  In an very aggressive tone, he had the audacity to say we wasted their time and yelled at us to leave the dealership.  They agreed on honoring the Truecar guaranteed price in the beginning but now they're trying to renege on it by adding extra charges in the guise of installed options.  But they're also saying the installed options is not an option?  That's deceitful practice.  

They're obviously trying to attract TRUECAR customers but as we learned, they had no  intentions of honoring it.  Therefore they shouldn't be in the TRUECAR business.  

This general manager SCOTT JACKSON just disregarded and disrespected us.  It will not be a surprise to see that lack of regard and respect for buyers trickle down, if it hasn't yet, to all who work under him.  He dismissed us and humiliated us and yelled at us to 'get out' or he will call the police.  

We are NEVER setting foot on this dealership again. There are other Hyundai dealerships out there who will treat their customers decently.  Just look at the yelp reviews for several years and you'll see a recurring theme of complaints about their deceptive practice and disrespectful treatment of customers from this CARDINAL WAY HYUNDAI dealership.  I don't know but it looks to me like they need a new General Manager. ",6,40,411

Exactly thirteen days later, my daughter was tboned and the car was flipped over and totaled. During the process of handling the aftermath of the accident, we found that the car was in another persons name still. Not a dealership, a person. So, we personally went to the dealership to get copies of the bill of sale and temporary registration  (all that was in the totaled car). Our insurance requires a pink dlil in the name of the current owner (my daughter) in order to process her claim. We are now more than half way through may and have repeatedly asked the dealership for the pink slip. At first my daughter was told that the car came from another dealership and they had to get the pink slip from them. Then she was told it came from auction and they had to get the slip from them. They are aware we need that for insurance purposes. We call daily and still have yet to get the pink slip.

September 20, 2015
To the General Manager:
I know you don’t know me and you may not care but I am going to take the time to tell you about my unfortunate experience at your dealership on Thursday, September 17, 2015. Which should have been a very happy day for me: in buying a brand new car, left me with the worst experience and feeling broken. 
I had already been to several other dealerships when a friend of mine recommended your salesman LaVelle Wilson and the Cardinale Way dealership. I was very clear with LaVelle from the beginning on what I wanted and I even went as far as telling him my quotes from the other dealerships. He insisted he could get me a better deal. I was very clear on what Elantra I wanted I had it narrowed down to two and wanted a price on them both. How I didn’t want to waste anyone’s time nor did I want my time wasted either. He text me saying he could get me a better deal. His manager even called to confirm my appointment and that they could get me a better deal. However, they would not tell me a price over the phone but kept saying how they could save me $4,000.00. Well I certainly did not save the money and this experience has not only been the worst but in the end I left with a brand new car which was switched at the very end telling me I had to sign paperwork because they grabbed a different car. I specifically said I wanted the bigger screen and this is a 4.3 inch. That is a huge difference to me. Why bother to show me and have me test drive a car and tell me yes you are getting this one just cloth seats and gray. Well I’m sad to say no I didn’t get gray I got a metallic gray and I certainly did not get the car I drove.
Not only that after we had decided on a price, this is at 11:30 am LaVelle said he was going to go over to the other dealership and get my vehicle. I asked him how long will this be or I can come back next week? LaVelle had me fill out his satisfaction sheet then. I wish I had not done now until after my experience because after 11:30 everything changed. He said this will not take long and everything should be done by 1:30 me out the door in my new car driving home. For me to driving in traffic I don’t like. I told him because if this is going to take longer I will come back next week; he promised and said no it won’t take long. That I needed to sign some finance papers and I said ok I’ll walk across the street and grab lunch and then I should be back to get the car. He took me to finance and left to get my car. (he didn’t return until after 4pm)
Finance- Jeremy Hollingstead
If I had to base my whole experience off this experience I would tell everyone to never go there ever! To not give a dime nor their time. This person was not only rude but extremely unprofessional! I sat down to sign papers and he started to go over the extra warranties. I told him I am not interested. Unfortunately for me I had the worst experience! I certainly wish I had left the dealership and walked out. The finance person Jeremy Hollingstead  told me ""What's your problem! I don't understand I'm trying to sell you all the added warranties! I'm giving you a good deal. I have taken it down!"" I kept saying no. Then he said, “I’ll lower your interest rates, I have points to work with.” As soon as I heard that it clicked in my head and I became upset! I said no, I don’t want that and I knew it, I know that I have good credit and if you can lower it now then why the xxxx are you playing games with me. I don’t like playing games. I said I’m done I need to go cool off, he said where are you going I said I told you I need to cool off your pushy and rude. I don’t play games get my papers ready for me to sign. That I have been here since 9 something in the morning it is now late and I’m tired and need something to eat. I said I’m going to walk across the street to In-n-Out I’ll be back. At this point is when I should of left the dealership. No manager was called no one offered to help and I felt like I was stuck. I went to go eat called my parents and then came back to finish signing the paperwork. Again I still got flustered because as he said sign here, here, here, and here. Just sign. I said I don’t know what this is for. He said sign; I said what this is for? He said LaVelle should have gone over all of this. I said stop, if we have a problem here get me someone else. I said I don’t care if LaVelle told me or not, I don’t remember and I’m asking now. He told me what it meant and said sign here, here, and here. I seriously wish I had just walked out. By now your salesman LaVelle is still not back and I am almost ready to be in tears. I paid cash for a car that I forgot I wanted to use my credit card since my interest rate is so low on that since your finance couldn’t give me a good deal. He said I need your check. I gave it and was flustered. He was so unkind and rude. Didn’t say a word like nice doing business nothing, just completely unprofessional. Certainly I will not recommend him. Really a person just paid cash for a car and you treat them like this? Here is another concern of mine. Would he ever talk to a man like that? Treat another man like that? I believe he treated me like that because I am a woman.
I went and sat in your lobby waiting for my car. I was getting upset because LaVelle text saying he is getting the car he will be back soon, and then they needed to switch the car a different car now. Now he needed to get it off the truck, it’s after 3:30 and how he needs to gas it up, detail it. I am completely stressing out because not only have I wasted my whole day I am realizing I am going to be in major traffic. He finally shows up and says we have to change all your paperwork because we got a different car and a different vin.
I am beyond tired now. Here is where I am so worn down I am making more mistakes. They changed the paperwork your jerk of a finance guy kept saying sign here here and here. Doesn’t go over anything now I am realizing he put the wrong address. I asked to have this changed. He put the wrong phone number and doesn’t change it. He scratches out and writes in pen on my dmv reg. sticker for the window which really come on be more professional print out a new one.
I finally walk out to see the car I am exhausted! Congratulations to your dealership on scoring a sale and getting my trade and having me leave with a less then vehicle then I agreed upon!!! Your detailer did a horrible job and this should be unacceptable. I had to ask to have him come back out and fix things and then I finally told LaVelle, I’m sorry I need to leave it is late and I told him I need to eat. My blood sugar levels are dropping and I know I have less than 10 minutes to put something in me or an ambulance will be called soon because I will pass out. He never said let’s take it for a test drive, and I don’t know if you have ever dealt with anyone in this state but they should not drive nor should they make a decision because really they are confused in this state. I left your dealership thinking I had the correct vehicle. As I was driving I realized the seats weren’t powered like I wanted, the vehicle didn’t have the sports button for the tighter driving  like I liked, it certainly didn’t have the bigger screen I wanted and most of all when I got home I realized it isn’t the correct color.
Then the next day when I went out and saw the vehicle and had to turn on the defroster I realized they didn’t clean the windows. This car was not detailed. This was a quick wipe down of the vehicle. 
This is a bad reflection on your dealership. In the end after all was said and done now I can look back and realize just how bad this was. Do I expect your dealership to make money yes I do. Do I expect for everyone to be treated with respect absolutely. Integrity and honor are big things not only in my professional life but in my personal life as well. I am sorry to say your dealership lacks both of those qualities.
Good luck to you and your dealership however; I hope you take the time to remind all of your staff about your company core values and your Company Name.
I have shared my experience with my friends and my co-workers. I have learned a valuable lesson and I can only say I am deeply saddened that this was not a more pleasurable experience for me.

We will not be coming back to this service department again. The staff were not friendly, not pleasant and not helpful. They were very hard nosed about the battery not being in warranty and were not willing to work it out. When I told them I would be taking the car to another dealership's service department they said ""that's okay."" I reminded them it shouldn't be okay with them as it should be all about customer service for which they did not give any. It was not only the service adviser but the service manager that had this attitude. At the other dealership I was given excellent service which was the opposite of what I received at Cardinale Way. (by the way the service department at the other dealership was busy which I am sure was in part due to the kind of service they give, whereas there had only been 2 customers at Cardinale Way for the 2 hours I was there...maybe due to the kind of service they give?)

26991,16-Apr-15,"I will never purchase another car from Cardinaleway Hyundai because of the service i recieved today!!

Over the last 4 years i have purchaded 2 cars and 1 Platinum extended warranty.  I brought my car in to the dealership (riverside) 2 weeks ago (taking off work early unpaid) and they refused to service my car because i hadn't changed my name to my married name.  After speaking with Hyundai Advantage, they said it wasn't required to change my name because i had my old ID.  So i wasted a day!

Then today i brought my car to the Cardinaleway Hyundai because i wanted my car checked before the warranty was expired AND the check engine light was on.  I was met unprofessionalism at its finest!   The man behind the counter (before he even looked in the system) said it would be $125 to look at my car.  I told him i had a zero deductible and with a smug look on his face, after looking in the system,  said ""it would appear so.""  I told him why i was here and he then said it will be an extra $125 for the certified technicians to go over my car.  I then asked to speak with the manager, Scott.  I told him my issue with paying any additional money and his response was, ""well we can get you in to a new car"".  To which i was utterly offended and disgusted.

I have spent over $30,000 on 2 cars from the Cardinaleway Hyundai and an additional  $1700 on an extended warranty that i NEVER USED and they want me to pay an additional $125 just to look at at my car?!  Because of this, on principle alone, i will never spend another cent with Hyundai....EVER!  You have lost a LOYAL customer over $125.",6,40,167

27090,02-Nov-13,"I called to schedule an oil change, the first person I spoke to was not able to schedule and said she would have someone call to make an appointment. 2 weeks later, after no call back, I called again to schedule an 8am appointment.

Arriving at the dealership at 7:55 and waiting in line (3 cars ahead of me) at 8am, we watched 2 service people walk back and forth and in circles for 15 minutes before helping even the 1st car in line. As I watched the one guy check everyone in (writing information on their piece of paper using peoples cars as his ""desk"" (A clipboard would be much better) I was finally tended to at 8:25am. I explained I had an appointment at 8am, he then proceeded to tell me it would be about 1 1/2 - 2 hours) I was very shocked at this time frame, and  asked if this was typical, he told me yes,  I decided to leave.
I called 1 hour later and was able to make an appointment for 10:00. that same day.

27096,27-Aug-13,"I am a fan of your Hyudai.  I own one and was looking to buy another.  

I wanted to bring to your attention fraudulent bait and switch practices at Cardinal Way Hyundai in Corona.

They advertise Certified pre-owned cars – and describe the inspections etc – at a price – I called to confirm availability – and then drove out to buy the car.

Eric Dance – the salesman was not familiar with the inventory and we had to go online to see what they had and if it was available – we did find the car and test drive.

We started the paperwork at the advertised price,  he started discussing lemon laws – and I asked if they sold lemons, he said that a Certified car would have any issues resolved – but that they would disclose if it was a lemon. 

Then he said the certification was additional to the advertised price.  I requested that they honor the advertised price and he said the finance guy would not.  I am sure this is illegal and I am filing a complaint not only with you but with the various regulatory agencies. 

The following is from their website – the day after they refused to sell it to me at the listed price – but instead said I would have to pay more for the certification – this is after 8 pm – when they also said I could drive the car home that night.   How could they do the inspection and reconditioning that night – clearly they had either already done it or not.

27097,05-Aug-13,"I went into the Corona location on 062213, after viewing an advertisement on a Prius that I had been interested in on http://cars.com. I went in just to take a look at the car, not really sure if I was going to purchase it because of my up-side down trade that I had. 
The finance manager named Regina Pham told me that my loan was approved. When I sat at Regina's desk, she congratulated me on my loan approval and informed me that I had some options. I then asked her at that time if my loan was approved and she said ""yes"". I asked her what bank had approved it and she said LBS Credit Union. I then asked her if she had spoken to the bank and she said, ""yes I just spoke with them."" Then she told me that the bank was giving me two options. The first option was to get my rate at 5.99%  for 75 months, I would have to accept a package, which included gap insurance, warranty package and an option of a new alarm system ..or two other features.

She told me that If I didn't get the package then my rate would increase to 8.99% because the bank was using money from the ""reserve fund"" to get me the lower interest rate. She also told me that some of her fellow co-works had  told her to just give me the 8.99%, but she told me that she wanted to ""help me out."" I agreed with her on the first option, which was the 5.99% interest because my payments were going to be lower and my interest rate as well. Prior to signing the documents I had asked her, ""so the bank has approved my loan?"" and she said ""yes"" and pointed at her screen. So I trusted her and signed the documents and left with my new vehicle. 

A week later I got a call from a Finance manager Scott, in which he informed me that I had to go back into the office to re-sign the docs because my loan didn't get approved and that they had to go with another finance company to approve my loan at a much higher interest rate. I called Regina and asked her why she had lied to me and she said that there was something wrong with the system and that it happens to one out of every 10 customers. I told her that I did not want to leave with a vehicle that was not mine unless I knew for certain that the loan was approved and I could afford my payments. She then tried to school me by telling me that I didn't know how the process worked and that there were three parties involved, the bank, the dealer and the purchaser and that we are not always all on the same page. 

I had to drive back to the dealer, which took me an hour in traffic to get there. Fortunately Scott was able to help me with the situation and get me a loan approval at 6.99%. I am just really upset with the way that this business operates and how finance manager Regina handled the entire situation, she was dishonest, rude and dressed very unprofessional. 

DO NO GO HERE, UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE RIPPED OFF.

27104,29-Apr-13,I negotiated with this Dealer directly on line with the Fleet Mgr. When I got to the Dealer they totally twisted the deal making it impossible to work with them any more. bad experience.... because they assumed I was putting additional $$$ down besides my trade....really bad communication on their part. I rate this Dealer unprofessional. I like Dealers to be up front and straight forward but this Dealer was by the far the opposite. ,6,40,66

Then looked at another car which was same make and model oh and same year with that same added sticker of 2900.00.  I didnt want all that extra so the would ""remove it from the deal"".  They acted like they did me a favor with the orig price of 17353.00.  So they made it seem like I got a steal!  Never negotiated the price.  I just left.

27213,30-Jan-19,"Took my granddaughter to purchase a used car,the price was set. A very slow rainy day, no customer's, finance manager had us waiting for him a couple of hours, he was in his office adding options to the contract that we didn't need or want. I asked the sales guy to go see what was taking the finance manager so long. He finally came out and sat at our table showing my granddaughter and I what he is going to do for us , by adding extended warranty and gap insurance, for an additional $2900 . We told him no, he went on and on about how good it will be for my granddaughter to have the extended warranty.We told him no again. Finally we get into his office to sign papers on the vehicle, but before we do he had another offer for us. The loan was for a 60 month contract, but his new offer for the extra warranty and gap insurance was now $1995. He was going to pay the first 6 months and the contract went to 66 months, he was trying to pull a fast one on us. That really showed me that he was a scammer. They also padded the interest rate that came back from the bank. Buyers stay clear of Ontario Hyundai. They will try to add as much as they can to a vehicle purchase. Trying to take advantage of my granddaughter.",6,40,45

27269,22-May-18,"I would never recommend Romero Motors to anyone. They are shady and deceitful. Here’s what happened to me.  I came in looking a Versa Note, and my wife and I wanted to look at other dealers to compare our options. In order to sell us the vehicle, they told us that they would “sweeten the deal” by “throwing in” a warranty as if it were new. That sounded like a good deal to me and my wife so we signed. They told us to sign “here, here, and here” and never even mentioned that they had added in $4,000 for the warranty, yes the warranty that they “threw in to sweeten the deal”.  Need I add that the Versa was only worth $9,000. They are a prime example of the stereotypical deceitful used car sales dealership. To make matters worse, I canceled the warranty to get the rest prorated back to me (I filled out the paperwork and handed it to them personally), but it was never taken off my loan value. The only thing that could make this remotely okay is if they took the $4,000 of my loan. Please advise your friends and family to take their business elsewhere. ",6,41,0
27270,20-May-18,"My husband and I came in to purchase a 2018 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport that I had already pre selected and reserved. My uncle works for the Hyundai corporate office so we came with paperwork in hand. We asked for someone from senior leadership to help us as this was a simple situation and we did not need anyone in sales involved. 

Somehow Alfonso ended up with our paperwork, and came to tell us that the price would be around $2400 more due to some “upgrades” such as special paint and some sort of additional insurance the dealership had applied to the car. These upgrades were not mentioned anywhere associated with the VIN number of this car, so we said no thank you, I would like the car without these upgrades, please honor my certificate for the price mandated on the paper. Alfonso wouldn’t do this and asked who my uncle is. I got my uncle on the phone so that he could explain that this certificate is a non negotiable paper from the Hyundai corporate office and they must honor it as a participating dealership. Alfonso said a few words, then hung up on my uncle and handed us the phone and walked away saying we are free to leave because we couldn’t have the car for the price specified on our rebate certificate. 

I was horrified and furious , I am 7 months pregnant and have never felt so disrespect at a dealership. We asked to speak to whoever is in charge and were introduced to Sam, who suddenly said they could give us the car for $400 more instead of the $2400 mentioned by his employee, so that they could break even on these supposed upgrades. 

We ended up leaving and driving to another dealership who had no problem honoring this certificate. ",6,41,-1
27299,19-Feb-18,"The staff at Ontario Hyundai lie to their potential customers and try to pull a bait and switch, they agree to one price over the phone then try to charge 40% more when you arrive at the dealership. ($12,400 for life of subscription + $5000 market adjustment)

I reached out to Ontario Hyundai through CarGurus.com on a 2017 Ioniq EV. I received a call from Nicholas and I explained to him that I would like to take advantage of Hyundai's Unlimited+ subscription that was $2500 down and $275 per month. Nicholas stated this car was available for this deal so I setup a time to get the car.

When I arrived at the dealer we had a test drive and while on the drive Nicholas casually mentioned a ""market adjustment"" and that I had to speak to someone inside.

After waiting 5 minutes a guy named Ken (I think) came up and asked me if I wanted to put $2500, $5000, or $7500 down on the car. This confused me as that was not the advertised or agreed offer and I re-clarified that I wanted the advertised and agreed $2500 down and $275 per month that is all over Hyundai's corporates website and Ontario Hyundai’s website. He then tried to explain how they have the lowest mark up and that mark ups could be $5,000-$7,500. I then asked ""so you want to change me $5000 extra for this car"", he said yes so I walked out.

He then called me back trying to claim he was being upfront (upfront is posting the actual price online, honoring the nationally advertised price , and not agreeing to a lower price over the phone). He then tried to negotiate with me, I explained that I was lied to by his dealership so I would only take the agreed upon price of $2500 down and $275 a month. He said he didn't think his dealership would do that but that it was above his pay grade. I then asked him to put his GM on the phone and he refused. He then said he would talk to his GM and call me back.

He called me back and again stated he would not honor the agreed upon price. I am guessing he didn't actually talk to anyone since this dealership has proven they will lie and deceive to try and make a sale.

Do yourself a favor and find another dealership.

27498,30-Jun-17,"So folks what we have here is a failure of the dealership to communicate empathy. 
Facts-
January  traded in a ford tarsus car for 2015 sonata. Not only did we get  we not get the price added options we got an outrages % rate of over 15 %  you can read about that in previous reviews from mine and others with similar experience.
March to present- The ford we traded continues to be in our name despite the dealer auction and sold the trade in . WAIT there is more kids... We have received numerous citations because the unknown driver likes traffic collecting tickets. what does the driver care, after all the car is still registered in our name. What does the dealer care the have the silver shillings  rattling  in their deep pockets . We care because suppose the unknown drive hurts or kills someone ? care is under our name ...

27530,20-May-17,"Please look at the negative reviews for this dealership.  They are totally true.  I was quoted a price and when the contract finally arrived it was $2,250 higher because of scotch guard, door edge guards and security system. This is ridiculous, when the car is advertised for a price, they should sale for that price or put those extra costs right up front in the add.  The add I came in said . ""Final Price"" but it wasn't.  Be very careful!!!!!!

The funny thing is that if you look at the old reviews, they were discussing the same issue.  The company came back and said it has been in business for 40 years and are truthful, please call so we can fix this.  But obviously it was never changed, still the same old shyster policies.",6,41,57
27552,25-Mar-17,"One of the worst experiences I have ever had with a business!!! My daughter is attending her masters program at SDSU and needs to replace her car so I start looking at Mazda dealerships because she wants a CX5 and I find Ontario Hyundai Mazda, also called Romero Mazda. I find a 2016.5 CX5 I like and set up a test drive with Brian Webb. I meet Brian and he shows me the car, I explain the car is listed online as a 2016.5 model and he says he's pretty sure that is accurate and will check, I test drive the car and tell him I will talk to my daughter. My wife and I have excellent credit scores and my daughter has been establishing very good credit so we will want to co-sign with her. I find another car listed as a 2016.5 on their website and call Brian for a test drive, I go in again but like the first car better so I set it up to come back with my wife and let her co-sign with my daughter.

The next day I see the car price has been reduced on the website, nobody informs me but I have to inform Brian Webb, was he going to sell at the higher price if I didn't see the reduction?

I want to trade in my daughters current car. I am offered $600 and I inform them that two days prior another Mazda dealer offered me $1000. I am told the car fax shows an accident which I have to explain was an accident that was reported to our insurance company but was not my daughters fault and the extent of the damage was a blemish on the bumper, we did not have any repair done. I say I'll take the car to Carmax and get more than $600, they tell me that with an accident on the record that Carmax will not buy it. I call Carmax from the dealership and find that Carmax has no such policy. I inform the dealership of their error so that they don't say the same thing to other customers. I sell the car to Carmax for $1600.

Brian Webb prepares a sale contract to fax to my bank for financing, nobody offered to beat the special rate my bank offered. My bank loan rep gets the fax and informs us the numbers are wrong and don't add up, Brian has to redo the contract and fax again. It is now late and our bank rep has left for the day so my wife and I go home. Our daughter will be up from school on the weekend and can complete her end of the paperwork. We get a call the next day that the second fax was not received and the first faxed contract was so bungled it was unprofessional. We inform Brian the second contract needs to be faxed again. 

We meet with another Brian in financing who informs us our credit is so good he can finance the loan himself and match our bank's rate, too late we are staying with our bank. Why weren't they offering this before? At every turn we are confronted with questions of their integrity.

On the weekend I meet my daughter at the dealership to complete the contract. I see on the final contract the car is listed as a 2016 and not a 2016.5 model, I ask Brian Webb is this true and he says it is a 2016. I explain AGAIN that the car is listed on their web site as a 2016.5 and was never informed otherwise even though I inquired with HIM earlier. Brian Webb tries to tell me that I should have noticed this earlier. Now I'm insulted and getting madder every time Brian Webb insinuates that I made the mistake which he does repeatedly. I researched the 2016.5 model and was under every impression that was what I am purchasing. I ask Brian for the difference between the 2016 and the 2016.5 models, ""I don't know"". Brian is not new to the dealership and does not know the difference? After more insinuation that it is my fault for not seeing the misrepresentation of the model, a senior salesman takes over. We research the issue for over an hour and find that the cars on the web site are listed as 2016.5 but are actually 2016, the difference is navigation and heated seats. Eventually I am offered the upgrades to close the deal. After hours of squaring away the ineptitude I was about to walk away but the senior agent was trying to rectify the issue in an earnest manner. After 4 hours that day, my daughter has her car.

2 weeks later my daughter gets a ticket, the registration tag is a year old and the paperwork placed by the dealer in a packet on the windshield was folded and not readable. I check the DMV web site and registration/stickers are mailed 5 days after electronic filing. I call the dealer and ask for Brian the finance manager who processed our paperwork, he's not available so I leave a voice mail to contact me and explain the issue. I call back 3 hours later, he's still busy so the receptionist takes my info and will give it to him to call me. 2 hours later I call and talk to someone who tells me it takes at least 3 months, wrong! I finally get a call from Brian the next day and the registration is being filed today, one month after sale. The dealer also was supposed to put paper plates on. We now get to go to them for replacement paperwork for the windshield, paper plates and spend time fixing a ticket.

Such a sad experience

But, a list of other items that were no where needing to be done. Specifically, brakes he told me I had only 5% left!!! On a 2011, Mazda 3 with 36,000 miles on it. REALLY???

I am so disappointed and nobody is there to help me out. I tried to complain to Hyundai, they said if there was a mechanical or technical issues they could get involve but I have to sort it out with the those crooks directly which is impossible.",6,42,6

27942,11-Jan-19,"I called the service department and talked to Ivan Avalos regarding my car's fuel range showing erroneous number.  I told him that in the last 3 years when ever I filled my gas tank, the range on my dashboard would show that the tank take me 400-420 miles (which gives a reasonable average of 22-25 MPG as advertised for my car, i.e. a Santa Fe 2015).  However the last time it showed 300 miles.  I asked for an appointment so this could be fixed.  I also mentioned that this happened after I brought my car for installing the KSDS software (a product improvement campaign by Hyundai).  He became defensive and argued with me that there is nothing wrong and they cannot fix my car.  He said you might have changed your driving habit, etc.  I let him know that when you fill the tank, without driving a foot, it showed 300 miles.  How is that related to my driving habit? He could not or did not want to understand.  At the end he said you can bring your car but we would tell you nothing is wrong!!!!  So much for your service Allen Hyundai!!!!",6,42,80
27944,11-Sep-18,"Hyundai has a 3 day return policy if you have any issues with a car you purchase from them, but it is not supported by all dealerships.  This dealership does not honor this policy, and was surprisingly unconcerned with customer service after they sold me the car.   Even though I brought back the car within 48 hours of purchasing it after I saw the issue, and even though the information they gave me about the condition of the car when they inspected it was different from what I saw when I picked it up again, neither the General Service Manager or General Sales Manager responded to emails or telephone calls to address the issue.  In fact, the General Service Manager could not even meet with me when I was at the dealership picking up the car.  I was told he was busy all afternoon and would call me, and he never did.  

It's nice when they treat you well when all is going well, but to me what is more important part is how they treat you when things go wrong.  I felt they failed really badly on that score.  There are better Hyundai dealerships out there.",6,42,-1
27945,28-Aug-18,Service rep tried to force a $135 diagnostic test on me to replace a $6 oil drain plug damaged after last oil change. I said no. He also said I would have to pay another $135 to check a noise in the steering I have had since I bought the vehicle new 6 years ago. I agreed because my mechanic friend said it could fall apart at any time. Service person said it would take three hours to check the steering and change oil. I spent over an hour on the shuttle to get home. 3 hours later I had to call to find out what was going on. They said it was fixed. I asked for the shuttle. Two hours later it arrived. Never again will I visit this ruthless dealership. On my previous visit my car was damaged. It took over one week to get scraped paint fixed. ,6,42,159
27946,13-Aug-18,"As much as I'm happy with my 2016 Hyundai Sonata Plug In, I'm equally frustrated and extremely disappointed in Hyundai's service and follow up. My car stranded me over 2 months ago. Although the car was under warranty, I had to call Uber to get home. The cost was out of pocket and Hyundai has not answered my request for reimbursement. The local dealer where I towed the car (Allen Hyundai Laguna Niguel) did not offer a loaner car until 3 to 4 days later when they realized the recall parts for my car were in back order (shocking… but Hyundai has not answered my request for reimbursement for towing either).  After 2 weeks without my car... and countless phone calls to the dealer and Hyundai Corporate, the dealership determined they could by-pass the recall and I could drive my car safely until the parts came in. I got another ride and picked it up and they said they would contact me when the recall parts came in. During the next few weeks, I made several calls to Hyundai Consumer Affairs (totally ignored me). Brandon at 714-965-7080 (the “so called” claim advisor who was specifically hired to handle these types of issues) is a complete waste of time and a joke. After several attempts to get in contact with him, we finally spoke and he assured me he was going to make everything right. Said ""you can call me any time and I will respond immediately"". That was a flat out lie. I've left him countless messages to no avail. The parts finally came in and rather than sending them to the local dealer near my house like I requested and Brandon (the non-responsive) agreed to do, they sent them to Laguna Niguel where lip service is their primary goal. Needless to say, I had to drive back to Laguna Niguel for the 7th time regarding this recall – a total and complete inconvenience. Prior to driving there, yet again, I called them and asked if they could loan me a car while they worked on my car for the next 3 to 4 hours...without hesitation, Ivan Avalos, the service advisor immediately said NO….something about we’re really busy and he couldn't help me. Fortunately, I was able to coax my wife into going out of her day and driving me there again. After dropping off my car, Ivan (the not so service oriented service advisor) totally surprised me by asking if I needed a ride or shuttle to my next destination. I asked why he didn't mention or offer that service when I spoke with him in the morning prior to begging my wife for a ride, and again he said, I'm sorry but we're really busy and I must have forgot. On every occasion that I asked for assistance, his initial knew jerk response was always NO. I guess he figures since Hyundai is experiencing so many problems that his job is pretty secured.
 
Bottom Line… great car…extremely terrible service and follow up from top to bottom. Ironically, Hyundai sent me a survey asking for my feedback…like they were actually going to do something about it. I can just imagine what my next anti-service experience will be like.",6,42,16
27949,02-Apr-18,"In attempting to contact the right people to try and solve a long lingering problem, I provided my current email address.  Not verbally, not even a hand written note, but electronically.  So all they have to do is copy and paste.  Instead they went to the archives and against my instructions used some other email that I have not used in year.  YEARS.  I am unsure how I could have been any more clear.  I provided my new email so very clear and I have no idea why they would go back 10 years to use an some other email I do not even use anymore.  This all seems to be part of an effort to try and NOT resolve my problems.  Why else would they ignore contact information provided weeks ago and instead use out-of-date contact information from 2008?  Maybe it is so they could claim they tried to contact me while they really had to go out of their way to ignore my instructions and dig in the files.

I left a very detailed message.  They have my phone, they have my email.  I don't know.  Seems to be unresponsive and the false hope of ""Making things right"" and ""Earning my business"" seems like hollow phrases to be added to bad reviews.  When actually called upon to ""Make things right"" they seem to just ignore the customer.  The wort part is I bought three, yes three cars from them.  It is time for a new one again, they will not get the sale.  Or the service.  Or the recall service which we all know is a super-profitable venture.

The will always send a link but they do not seem to listen to the question.  So for me, this was a waste of time on not one, but two occasions.  If I could call in I would.

27954,03-Feb-18,"After having purchased 3 vehicles from Allen and having all the service done, I was charged a ludicrous amount to change light bulbs.  When I asked about it I should have put my foot down, but I was assured someone would get back to me and it would be fine.  Well I do not know about anyone else, but after a year then never got back to me.  Now there is a recall for 2 of the vehicles.  We have been getting service done elsewhere but we all know how these recalls are good for the dealer.  So I call them and they are pretty much sticking to the fact it takes 45 minutes to change 3 lightbulbs all located in the trunk.  So we are just going to take our business to North County instead.  Maybe they have been good for you, but after spending thousands on service with them, not a penny more.  Now that I think of it, why did I even bother to call and check with them?  We all have bad days.  I get that.  But this is strike 3.  So long Allen, my money, and recall money, goes elsewhere now.

28071,28-Jul-17,"We purchased one of our vehicles (Santa Fe) rom Allen Hyundai and had a great experience.  We have a Hyundai Genesis as well that we purchased from another dealer.  We have serviced both cars here for the last 3 years.  I have to say that the service experience just keeps getting worse and worse.  We always end up having to take the car back because something wasn't done or something was done wrong.  I know things happen but it's over and over and over.  A recent issue was a 60K mile service and I have to take the car back because it's leaking brake fluid because after the brake service, things weren't tightened appropriately.  It's just always something.  It's too bad as I've given them the benefit of the doubt over and over hoping the experience will change.  I think it's time to find another dealer to service our vehicles.  Today was the last straw.  After another issue and the dealer is not able to resolve it after having the car for the week, I was told I could come and pick up the car as they were going to wash it for me.  I went to pick up the car, waited for them to bring it up.  When they finally brought it up, do you think it was washed?  Nope.  DId I want to wait another 15 minutes for them to wash it?  Nope.

Time for another dealer... ",6,42,-1
28094,13-Jul-17,"This was a very frustrating and disappointing purchase.  I'd like to state upfront that the people at the dealership that we dealt with were friendly, but they were woefully ill prepared to sell the Ioniq Elictric.  1.) They did not have a Level 2 charger. We received our car with only a 49% charge.  2.) We live about FOUR hours from the dealer. Before going we arranged everything over the phone internet. We were only interested in the Ioniq Subscription. We applied for the credit online (on the dealer's website) and were told that we qualified. They knew how far away lived. During the trip our salesperson (Chi) asked us to send him my license and insurance to expedite the visit, which we appreciated, and so we texted these to him.  3.) After traveling all the way to the dealer, they had absolutely nothing ready for us. We had to fill out a new credit app and other papers. (We purchased as HONDA the week before and all papers were filled in for us when we arrived; we only needed to sign and leave; literally 10 minutes; in comparison the HYUNDAI experience was miserable). After waiting some time, they came back to us and said they were sorry, but we did not qualify for the Subscription! This was after being told that we did qualify and after driving there for FOUR hours.  4.) If you truly care about your customers, please think about this situation for a minute! They either flat out lied to us to get us to come into the dealership, or they were utterly incompetent.  5.) Cameron Allen said he felt very bad about this and offered to pay us for our gas. While that is something, it in no way makes up for their blunder.  6.) Cameron did not have a good understanding of your Electricity Charging Reimbursement Credit that is an integral part of the Unlimited Subscription. When they discovered their blunder regarding our credit (791 FICO) they tried very hard to sell us the Ioniq Hybrid. The car is for my daughter to commute daily (Mon-Fri) to college. The commute is 105 miles, which is 2275 miles per month. So the unlimited mileage and the Charging Reimbursement Credit were critical to our situation. Since leasing the Hybrid has a mileage cap, he tried to sell us the Hybrid. But the cost of gasoline for my daughter would still be very high (nearly $200 per month). Cameron insisted that the Charging Reimbursement for the Electric was capped each month at $40. This is NOT true. It is capped at 50,000 miles total, but with no monthly caps. Estimating 2,500 miles monthly for my daughter's transportation needs, the rebate is on average $105.  7.) In the end, they threw their hands up and insisted we did not qualify for the Unlimited Subscription of the Ioniq Electric. This is not acceptable or professional. Hyundai dropped the ball and would not fix it.  8.) Since we needed this car for my daughter, I asked if I could call my brother-in-law to be a co-signer. They agreed, and since his FICO is 890 they INSISTED that he be top line on the lease. This made me extremely angry. He has nothing to do with the car and lives THREE hours away from us. But with his help we were able to get the car. My brother-in-law was a saint in this situation. What's the opposite of a saint? That's how I feel about Hyundai and this dealer.  9.) Insisting that my brother-in-law be topline also jeopardized all of our rebate opportunities, which are substantial: California ($2500), San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District ($3000), Southern California Edison ($450). Each of these want to see the name of the owner/lesee and address match the registration and insurance name and address and in the case of SJVAPCD the address is supposed to be in their district.  10.) We told Cameron that the car was for my daughter and that she was in fact the person paying for the car with her own funds that she has from a traffic accident settlement. She just graduated high school and has not established credit yet, but she was willing to prepay the lease entirely upfront. They would not let her do so. And in the end the only way forward was for us to use my brother-in-law. But if ANY of these three rebates fails becuase of their inistance tat my brother-in-law (who lives in Orange County) be top line, I will consider this nothing short of THEFT of my daughter funds. This was the farthest from professional business dealings that I have ever seen in my 52 years.  11.) We were stranded at the Allen Dealership for nearly EIGHT hours for this nightmare. Cameron offered to buy us dinner and we accepted and that was appreciated.  12.) Chi (salesperson) did NOT take us on a test drive. He did give us the keys to the Hybrid and let us drive that early on. I was very annoyed that the very first thing Chi did was ask us to fill out the survey of our car buying experience. This was right after we got there, and he encouraged us to give the best score for each question. It made no sense. The questions were about the test drive, the condition of the car, etc. At that point we had no test drive and we had not even seen the car! It was not until hours late when my brother-in-law was on his way that they finally allowed us to test drive the Ioniq Electric. The ONLY car we were interested in, even though they tried very hard to sell us the hybrid, which absolutely did not work for us and would consume way too much of my daughter trust fund in terms of payments, gasoline, and the loss of the rebates from California, San Joaquin, and Edison. Note: Chi is a very nice person, but this would have been totally unprofessional to have us evaluate our experience BEFORE it actually happened, even if we had had a stellar experience ultimately. The fact that our experience was the single worse car buying experience I have ever had and I've purchased over 20 new cars from just about every major brand in my lifetime and Chi had us report that it was all roses before we even started is stunning. YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED.  13.) Chi has absolutely no idea how to turn on the vertical light strips on the front of the car, the ones directly below each headlight. We asked him how, but he could not give us and answer. He said he would find out and let us know. He never did. We figured it out on our own a few days later.  14.) The Blue Link was not working properly from the moment we took possession of the car. Whenever we tried to use it or the phone app it stated that we needed to see the dealer. Since we live so far away, we took it to the Palmdale, CA dealer. They had the car for nearly TWO weeks before it was fixed. And they did nothing to fix it. It was Blue Link that finally reset something remotely and then it worked perfectly. The Palmdale dealership did give us a rental car that they paid for and that was much appreciated, but this was an absolutely terrible performance by Hyundai/Blue Link and it seemed like nothing got done until I got mad and called Blue Link and got them to call the Palmdale Hyundai Dealer (Rally Hyundai).  15.) No one explained that the car did NOT come with Navigation. While Apple Car Play is sort of a solution, it's not really. It requires cell phone data, which means the car has to be in an area with reception, and the driver had better have an unlimited cellular data plan. In this century, I have never owned a car without Navigation until now. It is beyond me how anyone would think it is OK to sell an All-Electric vehicle without Navigation as stardard!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Electric vehicles have severely limited range and finding a charging station is paramount. It's obvious the car has a GPS receiver since it know how far it is to the NEAREST charging station. But honestly, what good is that is you don't know how to get there? With electric cars, navigation CANNOT be an option. It has to absolutely be standard. We have a four-year-old Honda Fit EV. It is standard on that car. You CANNOT buy that car without navigation. They get it. You don't. Do you people even drive these things? Not everyone lives in the city. We live in the mountains far from the city and there are vast stretches with ZERO cellular reception. We like the Ioniq a lot, but I would not at least 3 stars off (out of 5) for the boneheaded decision to sell any Electric Car without navigation. Seriously, this is the dumbest idea I have ever seen.  16.) When I called Chi to confirm that the car did indeed not come with Navigation (at first I thought I just must not be seeing the proper button!!!) he actually told me that he just assumed I had done my research, which was highly inappropriate. And while I had done weeks of research, this simple fact totally eluded me. Every video on YouTube that I watched about the Ioniq Electric showed the map screen, and your website does not do a good job of pointing out this ""lack of navigation"".  I would greatly appreciate it if someone would call me regarding this survey. I am not a happy customer at all!  Note: Leslie Smiley was professional and nice.  Daniel Ferry (661) 750-2109",6,42,-1
28112,23-Jun-17,"I received an email from Hyundai offering a gift card if I test drove a car. After I downloaded the paperwork for this, my phone started ringing... Turns out a salesman was calling me to ""schedule"" a test drive. I have enough to do and would much rather test drive a car at my own convenience and not receive calls at work from random ph numbers. In any case I told Jaime - the salesman that called- I would see  him the following Sat. I met him and sat for a few minutes with him. His first questions was ""So what brought you in here today? Did you see our ad?"" I said ""No. A gift card promo offer and my lease it coming to term did it."" ... He just said ""Oh"". (Stupid me - WHAT WAS THE AD OFFERING ??? He sure as heck didn't show me). In any case here's the deal: Jaime is not perfect. Neither am I. I had to follow-up with him about the gift card.

I cannot say this for your Finance Manager, Alex. He is extremely rude, condescending and refuses to answer a direct question, lied to me - Jaime told me that to make this deal his Manager was going to pay my first month's lease payment. When I told Alex this, he quite rudely pointed to one area of the paperwork and said ""It says 35!"" (well, yes it does but upon later examination, another area of charges I'm responsible for it has the first month's payment amount = that make 36, Alex :) I'm just pointing this out for his ""own education""). In any event, a few days after the deal Alex called me at work and rudely insists that I come down that day to dealership because they cannot get the lease funded. I feel that he insinuated, more than once, that the problem was ME. I had to pull it out of him that there was an ""error"" made and I was charged for something I should not have been.

2. I question the knowledge of the workers a little bit because my ""factory set"" service indicator is set at 7500 miles, well I am told no absolutely not, it should be 3000 miles and you went over that by a longshot..., you will void your warranty if you go over that, (lie) ...now, if you pay double and get full synthetic you can go about 5000 miles...*sigh* whatever...When my car is finished the technician tells me be sure to have your oil changed every 3000 miles so you don't void your warranty....wth! This is not correct people. The factory set my vehicle up at 7500 miles, and I understand that synthetic is best for the motor, but do not feed me a line of crock so you can get me to come back more often so I can pay you to put high grade oil in my car that costs double, I am not new to this scene!

He  befiended the General Sales Manager Chris Tucker and said he would inquire with him to see if he could get me the same deal. Chris told him he would beat anyone's price and told him to bring me into the dealership to meet him. I met Chris and shook hands with him with a verbal agreement to give me the same deal as my famly member when actually it was several thousand dollars more than what he paid. Then when I called them on it, they just refused my phone calls, test's, and emails. When I emailed the General Manager, Tony Swain, I got the same cold shoulder. I received a TrueCar quote much less (by a couple thousand dollars) than the price they were trying to get, so Chris' account that he would give me the best price was also unfounded. This was such an miserable experience I have decided against buying a Hyundai. ",6,42,-1

29559,17-May-12,"BUYER BEWARE, I purchased a used 2005 Toyota Highlander SUV and unfortunately I had to drive 53 miles to find the vehicle I was interested in and it happened to be at this dealership, what a mistake!

This vehicle had been Certified to be in Good Condition by their own Service Department so I thought well I'm to far away and don't have the time to allow a Mutual Repair Service Station to evaluate the vehicle not that I even know this dealership would have allowed me to do that so I thought, it seemed to drive well so I will bypass having it inspected by another Service Center,""BIG MISTAKE""!

When all was said and done and I drove the vehicle off the lot after it was brought to me by the Sales Rep I got on the 101 N Freeway and as I picked up speed the Hood almost blew off because the Service Department had not checked to make sure it was secured after the prepared the vehicle for customer Departure!

You can imagine what that might have been like if it were you as the Hood was Shaking Violently before I was able to pull off to the service road almost causing a multi-car accident in the process! Lucky for me the latch did not disengage completely! So I got out and secured the Hood myself, God must have had an Angel sit on the hood so it wouldn't blow off completely!

Now I did sign a no return agreement so that means the vehicle is mine once I drove it off the lot! Yes there still is a 5,000 Mile or 5 Months warranty on certain components but needless to say I am not to motivated to let their Service department work on this vehicle now, WOULD YOU???

So, the Bottom Line is that I had to stick another $1500.00 into the vehicle to make sure everything that was working or was in poor operational condition and about to brake that should have been REPAIRED so the vehicle would be Safe To Drive!

Are you getting my drift yet, the Sales guy was very nice and I'm sure he did not know the specifics of the condition of the vehicle but you know MANAGEMENT DID!

CONCLUSION: BUYER BEWARE, this dealership has a hard time with being upfront & truthful because their Bottom Line appears to be more important than being HONEST towards the Customer and that means ME AND YOU my friend!!!!!",6,42,-1
29738,12-Oct-18,"I went in to look at car since i will be getting one soon and Christian, the dealer, showed me the cars. I told him from the beggining that I was on a time limit and would not be geeting anything ans he basically lied to me saying I would be leaving the dealiership by 1pm. I was so rushed through the paper work that I didnt pay attention to the paper and didnt leave until around 2:30pm, making my husband late for work and getting suspended as a result. When we got home, I was looking through the papers and I noticed they gave me the wrong car. I clearly told him I wanted a blue hyundai Kona 2019 and the sold me a 2018 and it made me mad. I came back the next day and they call christian, the dealer, and I told him he has messed up and that I wanted the Kona 2019 or another car since I was not thinking on paying the amount he told me for a car that is a year older when the 2019 is the same price. He made faces, called me a liar and has very disrestpectful to the point I had to leave the facility. I called hyundai and told the situation to someone else (apparantly the manager or someone in charge) and they ended up cancelling the purchase but not before leaving me without a car for a day and a half.

Long story: I took in my car to have the alignment check because my vehicle would steer to the right. I walked in with my appointment being at 9am. The representative told me it would take about two hrs to diagnose and they would get back to me to see if any work needed to be done.. I got their shuttle service back home and went about my day.

They told me the technician in charge would get back to me. 30 minutes later I received a call from the technician and he tells me that they couldn't find anything wrong with the car and they just added air to the tire( which was at 34psi and they added to 36psi). I asked if I could get the shuttle service back and they told me I would have to wait till 3:30pm. I got to the dealership at 4:25pm. And they didn't even wash my car like they promised..

29853,01-Sep-18,"I have had the worst experience. You expect your car to be repaired when you get serviced and not be taken advantage of. 

On 4/16/18, I scheduled an appt. as I had service issues with my Hyundai Tucson; one being the transmission and the other a leak in the front left tire. I left my car there for the entire afternoon and instead of being repaired, they said they couldn’t replicate the issue and that my tire had a nail in it that was not repairable. I asked them to show me nail but they couldn’t. I was mad and disappointed that I wasted my time, I swore I would never go back there. 

So my tire did not have a nail in it and I discovered that it is just a leaky stem and that needs to be replaced. Also my transmission was still acting up and not accelerating properly when I drive uphills and into the freeway which is scary. So since I’m on warranty, I decided to go back to the dealership to see if they could detect it this time. What a bad decision this was. 

On 8/30/18, I took my car in at 1:45pm. I explained the transmission issue again and the service advisor, Chris said that I would have to leave my car over night to be looked at. He also said I was due for a 30k mile inspection which I initially refused because it was expensive and my purpose was to fix the transmission. I was upset because the length of time without a car and then realized I still had to repair my tire stem. I went back to Chris and asked if he could repair and replace the leaky stem, I would also do the 30k mike inspection.  Chris said that he could repair and replace the stem, so I agreed to also do the inspection. I was satisfied hoping all repairs on my car were to be resolved. 

I pick my car the next day to find that again, the service dept. could not replicate the transmission issue. Also even though they did find find a leak in the stem, it did not need to be replaced but screwed tighter. However, they said they repaired the leak without having to replace the stem. The did do the 30k inspection which i really didn’t need or want and I was charged for that. I left very upset like I was just scammed. 

To top it off, the tire is still leaking air and it is now the left rear tire as they rotated the tire in the inspection. Not sure how safe that is. I was scammed again thinking they were going to repair my issues with my Hyundai Tucson. I feel like I should report to the better business bureau as my tire is still leaking after they state it being repaired. Hopefully my transmission issue miraculously disappeared with the oil change.  

Do not trust this dealership.  They only care about money and their attention to detail and high level of customer satisfaction is something they don’t care about.  ",6,42,145

29928,30-Jul-18,"I would like to bring to your attention my first oil change experience with the service department at Frank Hyundai. The service department was very helpful and understanding of my need to bring my own full synthetic oil to the service department and scheduled an appointment for an oil change to my 2017 Sonata on Saturday July 14th, 2018 at 3pm. 

Now the issue of much concern, on Saturday July 14th I arrived around 2:20pm for my scheduled 3pm oil change service appointment. During the paperwork for the oil change, instructions were noted on the form that the customer was providing both the full synthetic Royal Purple 5W/20 oil and an original Hyundai oil filter. After some back and forth interactions with several customer representatives, I agreed to pay for the oil change labor a total of $19.98. After about an hour and a half, I was told that the oil change had been performed, the car was washed and I was ready to go. However, upon receiving the car and before starting it, I checked to make sure that my purple oil was used instead of the regular Hyundai motor oil used by the dealer. To my surprise, the oil was dark brown in appearance and not light purple like it was supposed to be. I expressed my concern to the service departments representative and he proceeded to investigate on the matter. The representative asked the technician Pedro Chavez for the Royal Purple empty 5 quarts oil jug to verify the color of the oil. It took some time to get the Royal Purple container but eventually the representative got it and it still had about 1.25 quarts of new oil remaining inside the container. When I explained to the representative that my car has an oil capacity of about 5.07 quarts of oil both of us were concerned about the 1.25 unused new Royal Purple oil. Jose brought the issue to the Service Manager, David Constant who came out and acted defensively trying to make excuses for the oil to be dirty since according to him it was normal for oil to appear dirty brown due to the engine running from the service area to the wash area and then to the delivery area. I explained that I had been using this particular oil for many years and that this was not the case and presented the leftover oil in the Royal Purple container. The Service Manager looked very upset and argued with me that he had no place to put my Royal Purple oil and apparently went to his office to check the oil capacity of my 2017 Sonata SE with 2.4 liter engine. To my surprise, the service manager was not even professional enough to verify that in fact there should have been no left over Royal Purple oil had it been poured completely in my car and that he had no idea of what the technician had done. The representative went to speak to the technician again and was told that apparently(I don’t buy the story) he started pouring Hyundai oil first, and then realized that he had to use Royal Purple so he filled the rest of the oil capacity with my Royal Purple oil. 

I will never know for sure what the technician was thinking but as a result from this investigation I can guess that either the technician failed to read the service order instructions, decided to steal the customer’s oil or once he realized that he forgot to use the customer’s oil he chose not to drain the regular Hyundai oil and start over with the customer provided oil. In either case the technician tried to cover his unprofessional actions by not telling the customer or his Manager. This is both concerning, unacceptable and could be considered fraud. Equally concerning is the fact that the Service Manager who did not seem to try to remedy the situation from the beginning failed to come and apologize for the technicians unprofessional actions and for his incorrect assumptions on the appearance in color of the oil. I strongly feel that it is the Service Manager’s duty to investigate on a complaint, find the issue as well as an acceptable resolution and apologize to the customer in person. Instead, he delegated to the representative to deal with the investigation and resolution by scheduling a second oil change for July 18thy at 7:30am where the oil(Royal Purple 5W-20 5-quarts) and Hyundai oil filter would be provided by the Frank Hyundai’s service department at no cost.

Given these events, how can I trust the Frank Hyundai Service Department to continue to service my vehicle when the Service Manager is not closely paying attention to the technicians work and once an issue is found he does not act professionally regarding same. By the way, the main Hyundai Director Mr. Griffin was copied on this e-mail and as of now, he too was not even professional to reply to the e-mail. Terrible upper management customer service.

29983,27-Jun-18,"The worst experience of my life as a customer.
All in between lies, shady actions, rudeness, poor service and quality. It made me regret not going to Kearny Mesa, the closes Hyundai dealer, since I live in PB.
Lets start!

Would you buy a car from a dealership that let you bring your car home without really having the bank getting your loan?
They did, and asked me to comeback days later because they would have ""a better deal"" for me.
The better deal: Higher interest but the car would have a discount. Thats what Alex Cerda said.
You should see the body language of this employee, he should work at autozone.

Would you buy a car from a dealership that take off the loan the extended warranty, gap and insurance plan you purchased without telling you and having an employee lying to you saying the loan is lower now because he gave you a discount on the car price, so the bank could finance for you?? Would you?

Alex Cerda told me he was giving me a discount on the car price, but ""FORGOT"" tell that he took off more than $3500 in extra stuff I've purchased, letting me believe that everything would be on the new contract.
When I found out, I told the salesman I wouldn't sign the new contract, he was surprised because he knew they took everything out and he believe the guy told me, but he didnt, he called it a DISCOUNT.

Would you buy from this dealership?
The sales man Tim Brown left the room to talk to Cerda, who came back exalted asking on a rude way ""WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?"". Great customer service...
I told Alex that he was shady when he said he was giving a discount without mention he took off all the extra stuff, so he got pissed off, and on a aggressive way he said: ""YOU HAVE TWO OPTIONS, OR YOU SIGN THE CONTRACT, OR YOU GIVE ME BACK THE CAR!""...... seriously????????????? I tried to talk to him to show him that his sales techniques were being shady and not clear, but he was pissed because I figured out, so he started interrupting me again asking loud: ""IS THE CAR HERE? GIVE ME BACK THE CAR, GIVE ME THE KEYS, I CAN SELL THIS CAR FOR A HIGHER PRICE ON THE MARKET... GIVE ME THE KEYS"" but he figured out I wouldn't let him go forward with that and left the room without letting me talk.

Tim Brown, the sales man was chocked, he had no reaction... his mouth was open like :0 WHAT A xxxx IS GOING ON? Tim Brown and Mark Moore are the only professional people I deal at this dealer. Not even the Administration Manager is professional.

After all this stress, they put back the gap, so I signed the contract only because it was still a good deal for me, but I shouldn't because of the rudeness, but I needed this car because of my constant trips to Phoenix twice a week.

Got home and sent an email to the president of Frank Motors, who forwarded the email to the administration manager, who called me basically to protect his employee Alex Cerda, saying that he didnt meant to be rude. He also complained because I wrote a review on Dealer Rater.

Anyway, after a week with the car at my office covered I decided to move on and start to drive it, because all the situation there was so bad, that I didnt want to use that car.
They still should put the leather seats on, so I was praying for them to dont stress me again. I have partnership on 3 business in Brazil that I have to do the administration living here. A new business in Arizona and another small startup in San Diego, so things like that are not helping me at all.

The sales man told I could put the leather in one year if I want, but Tracy called me saying that I should bring the car next week, kind of enforcing me, so I did.
Do you think everything went well?? xxxx no! The company who put the leather is not Hyundai, so the seats wont look like original Hyundai seats and unbelievably the company delivered the car at Frank Hyunday with a lot of imperfections and A HOLE ON THE BACK SEAT!

I'm not sure if you know how much money that is, but 11 days of a car with insurance through Enterprise is HUNDREDS of dollars!  I had no idea until I was charged by Enterprise almost two weeks later.    I called the dealership to complain.  I spoke to a supervisor in the wrong department.  He wrote down my complaint and all my information, said he'd forward the information to the right person.  He asked me not to fill out the survey until I heard back from them.  I feel like two and half weeks is more than enough time to contact someone.  They obviously don't care that they totally screwed me over, which leads me to believe that they don't care about their customer service.  I would not recommend this dealership to anyone.  There are others within a 20 minute drive.  If you're going to buy a brand new car, go somewhere that values you.",6,44,-1

Sales staff is inexperienced and very aggressive. Most sales people are excited to make a sale and to make you happy, not at Frank Hyundai.

30173,02-Sep-17,"I believe it was Thursday, August 7, 2017.   We went to your dealership to test drive a Sonata.  I was considering a Malibu, Camry and Sonata.  Met with Marco Lucero decided there was a Sonata I liked but it was in a very difficult spot to get out so I test drove a different Sonata but was fine with that because just in the preliminary stages of deciding which car I wanted.  After test drive Marco and his manager Alexander gave us a written quote on the car I liked and we were on our way.  We were very happy with the quoted price.  Went and test drove the other cars.  Decided I wanted to drive the specific car I had picked out and called the dealership Saturday, August 10 in the morning to let them know.  Gave them the stock # of the car and told them we wanted to come by in an hour or so to test drive it.  We explained that it was on the back lot and at least 5 cars deep.  I spoke with Michael who said he was a Manager and we should come in.  When we arrived nothing had been done about getting the car pulled off the extra lot.  We were introduced to Liz and told Marco would be in later.  We were told it would take a while to get the car we wanted.  We actually left for about an hour.  When we returned a different car was pulled up front and they wanted us to test drive it.  We explained again which car we wanted to test drive.  We got in the car that had been pulled up front and it had no gas, it was completely on empty so we drove it a short distance to the lot and pointed out which car we wanted.  It took a very long time at least an hour for Liz and another person to get the car out while we waited there on the extra lot. I finally test drove the car I liked and decided to purchase it.  The paperwork with Finance went well.  When we finished with finance the car was pulled up front, it looked nice it had been washed and had a full tank of gas.   Liz was going to go over the car with me but was told that she had another test drive so another tall man came over.  He asked me for my cell phone and connected it up to the car’s system.  He told me I should drive on Eco to save gas.  That was about it.  I asked him why we were only given one key and he wasn’t sure. He looked in the trunk where the spare time is stored but did not see the extra key there.  He found Liz and she said she would have the second key by Monday.  Then I drove off.  No one had really explained much??????  We have purchased at least 4 Camry’s from Frank Toyota and our salesperson Jimmy spends a crazy amount of time going over all the features. I never got a call from Liz on Monday so I called her Wed.  She was too busy to speak with me???  Left my number.  Finally spoke with Liz on Wed.,  she said it would take 2 weeks to get the key, still don’t have it, but it hasn’t been two weeks since she told me that.  Also want to mention that sometimes when I call the dealership no one ever answers, it just rings and rings.  I am for the most part happy with the car.  I have an appointment because the headlights are pointed at the ground. Our experience was a very strange one.   Please call me if you want to discuss.  619.421.5769",6,44,-1

When I called for tow service, I was told that my vehicle was a 2008 Subaru, that it couldn't be found in the system, and that I had to pay out of pocket for the tow service.    The dealership staff's responsiveness to my concerns and needs has been less than adequate.  The fact that I sent my children home in a taxi cab because there weren't enough seats in the tow truck was never addressed - this was a traumatic experience for me and my children.  The fact that I paid $74 for tow service for a 2008 Subaru was never reimbursed.  I waited to complete this survey in the hopes that they would have gone above and beyond for my service and purchase experience, unfortunately I am still waiting.  Alex (manager) said that there would be an adjustment to my contract for the price of the KARR system and I'm still waiting for that to be completed.  I have wanted to purchase a Santa Fe for over two years, this is not how I envisioned my experience with my new Hyundai.  Customer service should be priority in your business.  When things go wrong, making me (your customer) happy should be priority.  I have purchased all of my vehicles at a Frank dealership because of my high school friendship with Leanne Fornaca.

30300,18-Apr-17,"The salesman Robert was very professional and helpful with purchasing my new car. The issue I had was with the finance department, they were very rude and pushy when I was trying to come to an agreement on price. Originally they had told me they did not have a white Hyundai Tuscon and they would have to order it from another store. When I was about to leave after not being able to come to an agreement on a price they sent in a person from finance who continuously asked me ""to help him out."" All the sudden they had a white Tuscon in the back lot that was $3,000 less than the one I was looking at. They then informed me that price was after rebates, which is not true because that was the sticker price in the window of the car. We finally came to an agreement on the price I was happy with, I signed the piece of paper agreeing to 0% financing for 72 months. When I went to sign the final paperwork it stated that I would be paying 1.9% financing for 72 months. When I pointed that out they told me that I was wrong and they never offered that. When I insisted they show me the piece of paper I signed it did indeed say that and they then told me ""oh sorry we made a mistake."" So now I am paying a higher amount than I was originally comfortable with. I was not offered any consolation for the mistake that was made on Hyundai's behalf.

30380,08-Jan-17,"I am extremely displeased with my overall buying experience at this dealership, especially with the finance lady that completed my car buying process. With regards to my salesperson, I don't have much complaints I think he was friendly and tried to help me get a good deal, however looking back I think I would have appreciated if he had gone over all of the features of my vehicle with me and how it was equipped. The problem I have is with the finance lady, I feel completely taken advantage of and I hope to get a resolution to my problem as soon as my paperwork comes in the mail. While discussing the finance of my car, I was offered the warranty which I declined, but I was sold the KARR security system and when I asked the lady what the price was I was told it was around $800 which I thought was excessive but I agreed because I wanted protection for my car. I have now learned that my car already comes with an alarm and a keyless entry I was never told this and had I known I would not have purchased this security system. I looked at my contract and I see that I am being charged $1995 for the KARR alarm- as stated in the contract. This is just ridiculous, and upon further inspection of the paper work I come to find an optional Vehicle replacement agreement with regards to the security system. The lady never told me this was an additional charge and she also did not show me the waiver, I feel like I was taken advantage of as she made it seem as it was part of the KARR security system and not an additional agreement. Also, I saw on my contract that I was charged $850 for a GAP addendum. The lady never told me this insurance was an additional charge and again she made it seem as if it was just part of the contract and gave me a 'recommendation' to always purchase a car somewhere where they offered GAP insurance. I had no idea what this was neither that I had to pay extra. The next day I went in to the dealer to talk to the finance people and since it was the Friday before the holiday weekend everyone was in a hurry and I was told to return the next week on the 27th. Another guy from finance helped me very briefly and I explained the situation and he said the the additional money I was being charged was for the optional Vehicle replacement agreement and he said that they would fix it but to come back. So, I did and I spoke to the finance lady and of course she was not very cooperative and kept lying to me. When telling her about the KARR alarm she said that the optional vehicle replacement was not an additional charge, rather the extra $1000 or so I was being charged was because I had agreed to purchase some finishing touches to the paint of my car. This is completely ridiculous, first she never even told me about any finishing touches, second why would I even want to spend extra on finishing touches for a brand new car, third, my due bill does't even say anything about the finishing touches and I never set up an appointment to do so. On my contract it doesn't even say anything about finishing touches it only says KARR alarm at $1995, I am not dumb and one thing has nothing to do with the other plus I had already been told by the other guy that I was being charged extra for the optional vehicle replacement. I was also asked what loan term I wanted and I chose the 66 months and we had already agreed to that as well as 2.9% APR and my contract says that my term is for 72 months and my APR is 3.99% and when I told her this she said that the term did not matter, but it matter to me because I had chosen the 66 months for a reason and she should not have changed that without telling me first. When I asked her about the GAP insurance she said that the person I was with had already bought a car there and that they should have known that they charge for this insurance. This is the most infuriating thing to me and I even told her that she cannot assume that everyone knows what this is and she should have told me about the charge since I am the one buying the car. I cannot believe that was her justification because every customer has the right to know everything they are agreeing to and she cannot make assumptions like that. Previous to going into the dealer I wanted to inform myself about this situation and I called the Hyundai consumer affairs number and I have a case open, I was told that the dealer can fix this problem and they are all able to cancel the KARR alarm and the additional charges, I was even told that it was a shame that I wasn't explained that my car has its own security system and this KARR alarm is not even needed. However, when I told the lady that I wanted this cancelled she said that it was not possible and I told her what I was told from consumer affairs and she said she would talk to the manager about it, but I don't trust her talking to the manager and I hope I have the opportunity to speak with him myself as soon as I get all of my paperwork in the mail. To make matters even worse, within the first week of purchasing my car the engine did not start twice and I had to call roadside assistance. The second time it had to be taken to the dealer and I was told my car's battery was defective and they replaced it. It is concerning to me that my car has failed twice already and I have only had it for two weeks, one would think that a new car would not have any problems and I hope this doesn't happen again. Once again, what this lady did is take advantage of me and I will continue to call whoever it takes to have this fixed and if it isn't fixed I will have to file a claim and take other measures because it is horrible that situations like these happen. It is a shame that the finance department takes advantage of young drivers like me, and they take advantage of customers being confused and tired after a long car buying process. I will definitely not be recommending this dealer to anyone I know because I wouldn't want them to gro thought the same fraud as I did with this lady.",6,44,-1

Then I was escorted to Finance and the price was boosted over 2100 dollars. I pointed that out and they proceeded to tell me I just agreed to it in the other room. I realize this is how it works. Yet when I said No way I do not want the window tint or the SWAT but How much for the door guards??? They became cynical and indignant and scoffed and said ""probably a 1000 bucks"" basically they were rude and shamed me in front of my daughter for not agreeing to the package deal they just offered and since I did not take the deal I would pay. After I made them find out exactly how much door guards were 285 and I received clarification on what a door guard covered, I declined.

That was supposed to make things better.  Sometimes I have to call a second time and, again, leave a message.

31176,03-Oct-16,"I was told that my car was ready on Friday, September 30th in the afternoon. When I arrived to pick up the car at 6pm, I was then told the service department ran out of time and was not able to clean my car that day. I would also like to add that I was told this was I was handed the keys.

 I find this extremely unprofessional because I was told the car was ready hours prior to my arrival. My sales rep told me I could bring the car back in next week to have it cleaned. After I drove off and further inspected the car, I contacted him immediately and told him I wanted the car cleaned as soon as possible and that I was disappointed in the condition of the interior. Even after reaching out to my sales rep, I was not given a confirmed time to return to have the car cleaned. I reached out again on Monday and was told to bring the car in to be detailed. 

Fast forward to today, Monday October 3rd. I brought my car in to be detailed and the car was returned to me in the exact same condition I dropped it off as. Let me repeat that for clarity. My car was returned to me in the exact same condition I dropped it off as. The car wasn't even vacuumed and nothing was wiped down. The cup holders were dirty and the seat belt buckles have a sticky substance on them. I wish I could attach photos because my car is in an unacceptable condition. I immediately told my sales rep that the car had not been cleaned and he responded very rudely and told me I was wrong. He refused to view the dirty vehicle and told me I could bring it back on Thursday. 

Resolution: After returning home with a dirty vehicle, I contacted a manager over the phone and was told to bring my car back in the same day (Monday, October 3rd). I was given a rental for the night and told my car would be cleaned in the morning. I picked up the car today (Tuesday, October 4th) and it was very clean. I spoke with a manager who was very kind and understanding of the situation. He gave me a one free oil change for the inconvenience. 

Overall, I feel that my time was disrespected here. It's hard to resolve an issue such as this because I have missed 4 days of work due to the condition of that car. I work for Uber full time so I either needed to pay out of pocket or wait for the car to be detailed. Receiving a clean car is not a perk of this inconvenience, it is simply the standard in which I should have received the car in. 

10/19/16: I wanted to update my review to include another side of my experience. My car has broken down twice within the first three weeks of purchase. On the 12th day of owning this vehicle, I brought the car into Hyundai to be inspected because the car wasn't shifting correctly and could not reach high speeds. I was told it was covered under my Nissan warranty and Manly's Hyundai was not responsible. I was forced to then drive this unsafe car to the dealership and denied a rental car for the inconvenience. A week later and my car is back at the Nissan dealership for another repair that Manly's didn't catch on the inspection. I find it suspicious that these things would be overlooked during an inspection and unacceptable that Manly's has provided me with no further assistant on a vehicle I purchased from them less than 30 days ago. I would never recommend buying a used car from this place. It's quite apparent that once you sign the papers for your vehicle, Manly's no longer cares for the customer experience. I have witnessed this through them expecting me to take a dirty vehicle after purchase and the refusal to assist in car repairs that happened within the first two weeks of purchase.

While test driving there was a noise coming from the left front of the car and I was assured it would be repaired in time for pick up on Monday.
After completing the trade and signing the papers, they gave me a loaner car until I was to return on Monday, perhaps Tuesday. 
I heard nothing from them until I called on Wednesday (from this point on, I became a customer who never received a call from Manly Auto until I called first, not a single one.) I got another call later that Monday telling me they were not going to fix the problem which I was told was the driver seat adjustment motor. So here I am, 9 days later, no car and another problem with the car that was not disclosed to me. Manly returned my call on Wednesday and I was told the car needed a part and it would not be ready until the following Wednesday.
Meanwhile, they kept putting new purchase contracts in front of me lowering the price as their promises began spinning out of control. So, I purposely waited until the following Wednesday to see if they would call and they did not. So I called Thursday and they promised to bring me the car on Sunday morning with a new purchase contract to sign.
So three weeks, no car and would you know that on Sep 2 the car BLEW A HEAD GASKET. I will be filing a Small Claims Court Action and Redwood Credit Union will be applying pressure as they were also sold a piece of collateral as fraudulent security for a car load.
If this review can save one person, no, five people from going to Manly Auto to buy a car, it is worth my telling this cautionary tale. Here are the names of the folks involved:
Gary Silva, Used Car General Manager, will not be fixing my car after his inspection of the engine.
Robert Trompeter, the Used Car Manager who left a week after I purchased the car.
Barry Silk, the salesman who first drove the car for me to test drive.
Clint Lyon, not anywhere close to the gutless wonders, but still working at Manly which says something.

I called the salesman that helped me with the car and he said just come in and we’ll fix it. I came in and talked to a finance officer and she told me it can’t be changed and I should have read my contract and it stated Feb 1st. 

I’ve now had this car for almost a month and still haven’t gotten a call for when I can get the tint put on. I could have saved money and went to a tint shop and gotten it done on the same day. The only reason I did it here is because I was told I would get a loaner car while they do the work, which after reading my contract I see also is not true. 

Now do I love the car, yes. Do I feel like I got cheated, not really.  It’s the inconvenience of it all. I shouldn’t be told one thing and not get it. That’s a real bad sales tactic.

A simple part replacement would solve the issue, and I would be happy, but they refuse to order the part, citing ""compatibility issues"" which, is still not a problem for the customer.  Also, if there are compatibility issues with certain phones and how they interact with their vehicles, then they are at the very least guilty of false advertisement as no where in the vehicle manuals, dealer documentation or advertisements that only some devices may work with their internal systems.
Again, they looked at my under warranty vehicle, ran some tests that had already been done before AND was documented (which they had access to) and the end result was still that they weren't going to fix the issue.

31814,02-Oct-18,"My review is not so much against Crown Dodge, but rather the Dodge vehicle I purchased. 
On August 25th, I purchased a 2017 Dodge Charger. After only 2 days in the car, I got a ""service shifter"" alarm. Also, the service department at Crown called me and said there was a recall on the computer software system, so I brought the car in. After they performed the upgrade, the computer system crashed. That led to them having the vehicle for 2 weeks while they tried to fix it. It required them calling the corporate mechanics because they didn't know how to fix the computer. They ended up having to replace one of the computer components. After I picked up the vehicle, I drove it for 2 days, then began having multiple problems. The check engine light came on. I also had erroneous readings that all of the tires had low tire pressure, and some sort of brown fluid was leaking from under the car. Back to the dealership. They have now had the vehicle for the past 2 1/2 weeks. At this point, I don't even want the car back. As far as I am concerned, this car isn't safe. I just want Dodge to buy the car back and allow me to purchase a vehicle that actually runs. The whole reason I spent so much money on a new vehicle is for the reliability. I am afraid that if they make me take this car back,  the computer system will fail while I'm on the freeway and I could seriously hurt or kill someone if I can's stop. Computers seem to have influence over just about everything in cars these days.  I have an open case on file requesting a buy back option. The case manager is in Texas, I believe, and she is very difficult to contact. This car is not safe, but I feel like my concerns are being ignored or at least allowed to drag on. I bought this car 5 weeks ago and have only actually driven it for a total of 4 days. The car is still in the service department as I write this review. 
The dealership itself has tried to be helpful throughout all of this. Alex, my sales manager has been helpful and is doing what he can, but the buy back option is out of his hands. The service manager has been helpful as well. Also, JP my service advisor has been an advocate. Crown Dodge has provided either a rental car or a free loaner vehicle for me while my car has been out of commission. ",6,45,-1
31827,12-Jun-18,"I was excited to finally find a car, I get a Jeep Compass which I was sold from first glance and test drive. Once the ink was signed and I drove it off the lot, the back up camera kept sticking, even in drive. The gas mph is supposed to be 22 in the city and 32 on the freeway. I have pictures now of my gas gauge is malfunctioning and not reading accurately. The radio switches back and forth from Media on it's on. I brought the car back in for other servicing to let them know. I reported both of these problems when I brought my vehicle in on May 7th. The customer service rep told me that I indeed needed a new radio and that they couldn't find anything wrong with the gas gauge. She would order the radio and it could possibly take a day or a month. What kind of timeline is this?! Especially on a brand new vehicle. It is not June 11th and I have yet to hear back from the service department on my radio. I am still having problem with the gas gauge and can show you pictures of the issue. I am very dissatisfied with this service. A new car should now have these issues and before leaving the lot should have a full inspection. A timeline for a part should never be a day to a month. The communication on this is ridiculous. I want my radio and gas gauge fixed! No more excuses. This is disappointing to pay so much for a vehicle to not get what you paid for. I will do a courtesy to call the service department today to see if my radio is in. I have already contacted the manufacturer. If this is not handled I will seek legal counsel.

31834,02-Apr-18,"We had a terrible experience at the Crown Dodge Service Department. I spoke with Kristin on Friday. I made an appointment for Monday morning for repairs to our new 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee. I called at 8 am on Monday to confirm. Kristen confirmed the morning appointment time as between 9 and 10 am. She instructed us to ask for her upon arrival. 

My wife arrived at 9:05 am. She parked the car and went to one of the offices in the service department. She spoke with Monte about the scheduled repairs. He asked who she had been assigned to. She said that we had only been advised to ask for Kristin. He reacted as if there was no Kristin. He took her to a window where there were three sheets of paper taped up listing the appointments for the day. We were not on the list. 
My wife insisted that we were instructed to ask for Kristin. He then conceded that he did know Kristin and advised where she could be found.

My wife entered the main office area where she found Kristin. Kristin asked where the car was. My wife said it was parked outside. Kristin scolded her for not getting in line. We were not instructed to get in line before. 
My wife moved the car behind the 20 - 30 cars that were in line. Why were we given an appointment, then placed in line behind 30 cars? What is the purpose of an appointment?

When she got to the front of the line, a young man tried to help her. He had to find someone who would work her in, since she was not on the list and had no one assigned to her. The young man was going from one person to another, but they were all saying they were busy.

Finally, Monte came to the car and asked what she needed. She told him about the trouble we are having with the car. 
He said he saw on his tablet that we needed “a loaner”, but there were none available. She said that was fine, she just needed a ride back. He told her she would have to take a shuttle, and there was not one until 11:00. She said okay and waited in the cold waiting room.
Luckily a nice shuttle driver came in at 10:25 and offered a ride.

At 3:48 pm Monte called to ask what was the purpose of the car being brought in. My wife had to explain the trouble again. The car had been there all day, and they hadn’t looked at it yet.

I called at 4:45 and asked when we could pick up the car. Monte said they wouldn’t be able to look at it until tomorrow. I was furious. We had an appointment at 9 am! We had been without the car for an entire day, and now they were going to keep it another day. I told him we would come and get the car.

My wife went to pick the car up. She went to Monte who waved her off and told her to go in the office for the paperwork work in order to pick up the car.

The car remains in a state of disrepair.

31886,27-Oct-17,Went to this dealership. I found 2 chargers with 20% off sticker on windshield. Just what I was looking for.. The sales person was jonny.. Which was great at first but then when it came down to price I noticed he wasn't adding the 20% off when I asked he said both cars were a mistake and they should have never had that sticker. He should have owned this from the beginning... How is this my fault? He then came back and said they granted me the 20% off which was still a lie.. he tried explaining how much money 20% off was. It never added up. I pulled out my calculator so I could show him how much 20% really was.. Which he was off by 1k. I went to car and by that time they took off stickers of 20% off.. But they really think we buyers are stupid.. I went to the other car took a picture of the 20% off.. And i took a picture of the car I was trying to buy. This is not the first time they mix up window stickers like this.. I came a month ago and had this same issue.. Also the car was labeled as a 2017 it was a 2016.. WOW.. I still was willing to give them a chance because of the car itself.. Didn't happen though. Jimmy decided to pawn me off to one of his managers.. I saw jonny outside when I was leaving.. Its my fault if you look at the reviews it would let you know about this stuff.. The manager I must say was nice.. Gerardo I believe his name was..

31896,09-Sep-17,I will never be using this dealership again it is unfortunate I have already bought two cars from them hopefully this review will keep somebody else from making the same mistake... both brand new cars I have bought from this dealership have been like running a marathon.. it starts with the sales people lying about prices and trying to manipulate the deal into a monthly agreement as opposed to an overall price of the car... twice they came back with monthly payments acting like I was getting a deal because they didn't understand I know how to use a calculator and when I did the math and showed them they were lying about the price I would be paying for the car.. they then come back and say oops we must have made a mistake... either you are so stupid you do not know how to do your job both times I tried to buy a car.. or you're a liar and a scam artist and you hoped I would be too stupid to catch it.. I'm pretty sure it was the second reason.. their service department is atrocious they continue with their lying long after you have bought the car the service people are rude unknowledgeable about what they are speaking about and overall horribly unpleasant to deal with.. basically their thought process is if we make this as an unenjoyable as possible for a customer they will not come back as often thus we will probably save money on warranties... my wife's car is only a year old and has been shutting off as she drives the vehicle when she called service today they told her nothing we can do for you you'll have to come by next week sometime and maybe we can take a look at it... that is absolutely unacceptable.. when I called back they just talk over you don't allow you to speak and then hang up the phone multiple times.. Crown Dodge is a disgrace the owner should be ashamed that his dealership is ran by such dishonest unworthy people..

31916,14-Jun-17,"Before I begin, let me say that I take no joy in writing such reviews. As a reasonable, patient and fair person to a fault, I take such reviews seriously. I would much rather submit a positive review (and I have done so for many organizations I have done business with), however, when really bad situations arise, I think it is important to share with those that could otherwise avoid having to go through a similar experience. This dealership is hands down the worst Jeep dealership I have ever encountered. I tried to purchase/lease a vehicle from them several weeks ago. I started off by speaking with Scott Walters, then was passed along to Darren Stewart and finally to Paul Mills. I have been a long time loyal Jeep owner with excellent credit and had many models of Jeeps both purchased and leased from various dealerships where I have lived/worked around the country. I generally always asked the same set of questions to make sure all the figures/terms are clear, so not my first rodeo as the saying goes. Crown Jeep refused to answer very basic questions that I asked verbally and in writing and then gave me attitude for actually asking the questions. Furthermore, I have tried on (3) separate occasions to make the G.M., i.e. Mr. Crown via his assistant Terry Vasquez aware of my experience so they could use as a learning tool to improve customer service for future customers, hence the reason I have resisted writing this review until now. I have never had the courtesy of a reply from her or anyone else at the dealership. Needless to say, I took my business to another dealership and was treated fairly, professionally, courteously while valuing my time. I even contacted the GM of that dealership recently to let him know how positive my experience was with the Internet Sales Manager. Do yourself a favor and avoid Crown Jeep. They are dishonest (deliberately did not apply rebates/incentives I was eligible for, probably to pocket for themselves), unprofessional and just outright rude. The place is dysfunctional and clearly it all starts from the top right on down. If I could give them zero stars I would. These people need to wake up and realize in the year 2017 that many people want to avoid the haggle and complete as much of the transaction by telephone as possible and then go in, sign the docs and be on their way. If you don't want your valuable time wasted, not to mention being unnecessarily frustrated/ripped off, then don't give this dealership your business. Go somewhere that they actually value the customer relationship and appreciate your business.",6,45,-1

Called 3 separate times. Every time was put on hold for close to 15 minutes average. First time the connection finally just dropped. Other two calls the receptionist came back on and tells me there is nobody available to help me. How hard can this be?Noticed they asked what type of service right up front. Maybe when they know it's a Safety Recall you go to the bottom of the pack (no big money there for them).

32040,27-Nov-15,"I am a medical student and my husband is an active duty service member stationed at the Port Hueneme Naval Base. I unfortunately didnt do my research before we decided to buy our first car together as a young married couple. I posted a review of my first experience with them about a month ago, but after I posted my horrific experience on 4 different review sites they decided to finally do something about our situation. Long story short- they sold us the wrong car to drive off of the lot. We asked for a V6 4x4 and we drove a 2016 Jeep Cherokee 4cyl off the lot. It wasn't until the next morning that our financial adviser pointed out that we were driving a 4cyl, which was NOT the vehicle I specifically asked for. I returned the vehicle less than 24 hours later and after being harassed by multiple salesmen as my husband and I walked across the lot due to the fact that we were already returning the vehicle, they told us I lost $10,000 in equity and there was nothing they could do for us. Not to mention they lied to us about the cost of window tinting, the rental car agreement for servicing, and the details of the car we drove off the lot. I had the financial manager give false information to us and thankfully my financial adviser educated me before I went in. I had to call Navy Federal representatives twice during the closing of our deal in order to prove that our financial 'manager' was dishing us negligent information. They called me back 4 days later after my detailed and explicit reviews were seen by the entire dealership and bought my car back at full price and I finally was able to drive my 2015 Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk off of the lot. I thought that I finally put my miserable experience to rest, but that was a joke of a thought within itself. I scheduled a detailing appointment with Cassie on Friday, November 21st.I told her in front of my husband that we are leaving for Tahoe next week so we need our car. She acknowledged the information I provided her and proceeded to schedule my detail wash appointment on Tuesday, November 24th. Well, it is November 24th without my car. I called Crown Dodge 4 times today asking about the status of my car. I dropped my car off at 8:45am this morning. At 3pm, they said they didnt even get to my car yet. I called back again and my service manager didnt answer the phone. I called again at 4:30 and my car still wasnt finished. I called again at 5:30pm and my service manager didnt answer again. My husband dropped me off for my friends funeral this even WHICH I LEFT EARLY FOR TO PICK UP MY CAR after service hours. I called them as I was walking away from the funeral to head to the dealership and they said my keys were not available for me to pick my car up that i dropped off to get a DETAILED WASH ONLY OVER A PERIOD OF10 HOURS. I am scheduled to leave for Tahoe at 6am tomorrow with my husband. I am supposed to pick my family up along the way and get there in time for a scheduled event while my husband is taking leave before deployment. They once again said their famous words, ""I'm sorry Mrs. Cann, but there is nothing I can do for you."" I gave them the benefit of the doubt for fixing my car situation and took down my reviews on all of the sites, but this is the final straw. I am now being punished for the fact that not one person called my husband or me to tell us that the car would not be ready by the end of the day WHICH WAS IN FACT GUARANTEED TO US TWICE. I am now xxxx BENT on making sure I can continue to make sure I can pass our experience onto others so prevent them from buying and servicing at your dealership. I already called the Better Business Bureau once and I will be doing it once again tomorrow morning along with contacting Crystler. You have wasted enough of our time. I will be seeing you guys first thing tomorrow morning.

The manager sat down and said that the truck was 35K. I told him that the paper and online said there were rebates that brought it down to 25k not 35k. He said that the only rebate he could give me was a $1500 credit....I explained to him that's not what the paper said and he said ""well if I could give it to you for 25K I still cant get it where you want the payments ""(acting like he was doing me a favor for giving it to me for what its advertised for). I told him that I understand that but wanted to run some numbers and see where we end up but he wanted to run my credit and he said ""if you don't help me why should I help you(being very rude at this point).

Two days later I had to call and was given some run around and was told there was a Chrysler bulleton out stating the jeeps were installed with faulty trans filters and that this would fix the problem. They made it sound like it was going to be covered it was not. 3 day later I had to call again and find out the status of my jeep now and again was given some run around saying they could not duplicate the problem and would I mind coming down to show them. Took off work early and took jim for a ride and duplicated the problem. 4 days later I had to call and find out the status and I was told they couldn't duplicate the problem that I had shown him 4 days earlier. I informed jim to stop all work and I want my jeep back and that I need it by Wednesday night at the latest he said fine and that he would do it and call me. Wednesday night no call Thursday no call until Thursday afternoon jim calls and says the jeep is done. The total is way to much for something that was played off as warranty. 
So I spent 13 days without a car due to jim not calling warranty right away so they could issue me a rental. This is why I purchased the extended warranty. Now after paying the high bill I get my jeep home and look under it to find the transmission pan is leaking transmission fluid as well as the front shock, control arms (upper and lower) as well as the half shaft and inner fender have a bunck of grease and oil all over them.

The Sales Manager said this is a Chrysler Certified Per-Owned Vehicle that they spent $2,000 getting it Certified. After numerous break downs and phone calls, I found out it was not a Chrysler Certified Per-Owned Vehicle.

Broken rear track bar bracket, axle could fall off and roll over vehicle.
Wheel lug nut where undersized and wheels could have fallen off.
Dislocated rear axle spring.
Rear Sway Bar rubbing through break lines.
Transfer case shifting cable broke first time tried to use it.

Oil press sending unit was bad.
Bad oil leak.

I contacted about 10 different dealerships, all with the same details: Give me your best price possible and I will buy a car from you today. Also, see what deal I can get on my 2010 Challenger RT. I was contacted by Richard Schwartz since I posted on the internet. We went back and forth. At once, I thought he was rude through email but its hard to tell if he meant it like the way I took it or not, so I brushed it off. I told him, here is a quote on the best price I have been able to find. Also what the best offer on my car as a trade in. He said, I can beat it, just come down to test drive the car and drive home in it. He said, come as soon as possible since I like to leave early since I have the day off. I said I will be there before 5. I even left early so Richard wouldnt be held back too much longer.

I get there and I notice the car isnt where it has been for the past few months. He said, oh, its been moved. We walked around for 10mins. He said, let me see if its somewhere else. I waited in his office for about 10 more mins and he came in to tell me it had be sold. OK, that happens, not happy, but I understand, you can always get another car. Then I am told the price I showed them wasnt going to happen. That it was a low-ball offer and no dealer could ever do that price. I didnt tell him it was a friends dealership that I have done business with in the past, I just told him and some other manager that I have gotten 10k off previous yr SRT8s. I wasnt even looking for that type of deal. Was told I dont know what Im talking about and Im pretty much smoking crack. 

Then as I am trying to leave and get my keys since they tested out my car to see what shape it was in, another manager told me pretty much teh same thing Richard did. Im a liar, dont know what Im talking about, blah blah blah. Well, Im never doing business there again.

I have been bringing my car there for a yr for service and had very good experiences with them, but after this, I will be driving 30miles somewhere else each time I need an oil changed or any warranty work done on my Challenger.

Another manager did call me to check up and see what the status was and from what she told me, this isnt the first time Richard has done this. If this is true, then why keep someone like that? If you know he is bad, why risk having a customer, like myself, be handled this way?",6,45,95

32149,21-May-11,"I took my vehicle to Crown Dodge starting in January/2011 after Chrysler instructed me to take it to a Dodge service center if I wanted potential assistance with unresolved issues with the car. The initial problem was in regards to an air injection code that had been in the vehicle since a little over a month after purchasing the used 2005 Dodge Stratus. After a little over a week, I was told that my car needed a new O2 sensor and then after opening it up they found that it also needed a cadillic convertor (spelling?). I agreed to replace these parts and the problem was still not resolved and I was up to about $3,000 in repairs. About a week later my service rep told me that there was a special emissions warranty on the car and that I would have to pay for any of those repairs. My car was at Crown Dodge service center for 6 weeks. During that time I got very few updates on what was going on and I finally let them know I needed to go out of town and needed to know if I would have my car. I was told to pick it up and I drove to Nevada. When I got there, my car had an oil leak and the air pump was still staying on. I had to disconnect my battery every day to keep it from being drained by the pump. I called Sandy (my service rep) the day I arrived and she told me to bring it back when I returned. I remained there for 3 weeks and on my way home the dash was glitching (back defrost turning on and off, radio/clock turning on and off) and about half way home the odometer readings started flickering all over the place. I returned home on Saturday and took the car in Monday. I was told there were 2 oil leaks (cost almost $800) and I got those fixed. They told me the dash was flickering initially but they couldn't repeat it so come get the car and bring it back if it continues. I paid for the oil leaks (3 weeks later) and didn't even sit in my car before noticing the dash was flickering. I left the car and then was told that there was a ground issue and they were having trouble finding where it was coming from. Eventually I was told they found it and that cost me $225.00. After I picked up my car there was a loud noise coming from my engine (it was heard over my radio) and the car was still puttering at slow speeds and stops. I took my car back and Sandy advised me to take it to my mechanic to make sure it wasn't the transmission and to let her know what they say. I did that and then took it to a transmission shop, per my mechanic. They confirmed it was not the transmission and that you could clearly hear the noise form the engine. I called Sandy back and didn't get a return call so called again a few days later. I was instructed to bring my car back in to Crown Dodge, so I did and after a few days they called and told me it was a loud alternator (Sandy was not there and I got a new service advisor, Jeff). I told Jeff that I wanted to follow up with Chrysler because I didn't understand how there was a new issue with the car that wasn't there before. I also asked him about the puttering and her told me it may be a core issue inside the alternator, but they wouldn't know until they replaced it and also asked me to follow up with the service manager, David Weber, about my concerns. I left a message for David and never got a call back. I also called Chrysler and after them speaking to David, they agreed to pay for the alternator. After the repair was done, I picked up the car and to my surprise it was still puttering. I left and immediately called back to Chrysler. I also found that a rodent of some sort had been in my trunk (how I don't know) and chewed up some papers and a piece of the weather strip in my trunk. I called and spoke to Jeff on a Saturday and he asked me to leave a message for David on Monday, which I did and he again didn't call me back. Chrysler got a hold of David regarding the puttering of my car and I was asked to once again bring back my car. I did and now they are telling me it needs 4 new motor mounts and the car isn't puttering. I told Jeff not to touch the car because I wanted to follow up with Chrysler because it didn't make sense to me how it now has another repair that wasn't needed before and how the issue it has had all along that was never fixed, suddenly isn't there. He asked me to call David and I said he doesn't call me back so who else can I call. He said Stewart, a new service manager. I left a message for Stewart that Friday and surprisingly David called me back Monday. I explained to David my concerns about the recommended repairs because each time I bring it back there is something else wrong with it that wasn't there before. All he kept saying was ""you need 4 motor mounts"", over and over again. I told him not to touch my car and I was following up with Chrysler, which I did. My rep from Chrysler called me back after finally getting a hold of David and told me that David said they are recommending I replace the motor mounts, but based on the mileage and year of the car they didn't really have to be replaced and they weren't really worn down that bad. For this reason Chrysler said they couldn't authorize a repair that was ""needed"", which is why I questioned it in the first place. Chrysler has offered to send me to another dealership service center for another look. I picked up my car from Crown Dodge on Monday May 16th and attempted to file a complaint against David Weber and the woman I spoke to attempted to address my concerns by bringing David in to speak to me. This was a big waste of time, David told me good I was going to another dealership and I also let him know I had filed a complaint with the Bureau of Automotive Repairs and he said ""ok, good"". I told him I didn't understand how my car continues to have new problems every time I bring it in and how he didn't return 1 phone call I made to him, except that morning after I left a message for someone else. He just kept shaking his head at me. Then I asked him about the weather strip in the car and he told me to have the new service center access it and call Chrysler. I said ""so Chrysler is responsible for damages that happened to my car while at your service station?"" and he said ""yes"". I said that doesn't make sense, how are they responsible for damages that happened at your service station and David said because a rat couldn't get in my trunk. I said I don't know how it happened, but the damage happened while it was at his service station and he told me to call my insurance company and file a claim. I said, ok, so now my insurance is responsible for the damages and he said yes. I said that doesn't make any sense, the damage happened at your service center and he said ""I don't know what to tell you, it's an insurance issues. I told him he didn't make any sense and I needed my key. I was told it was in my car and he walked away. I continued to express my concerns with the 2 women at the counter and 1 informed me that David and another guy looked at my trunk and said it was normal wear and tear and a rodent didn't do it. I showed her the pictures I took before I cleaned the trunk (to make sure a rodent wasn't still in there) and a pillow case with the stuff that was chewed on was in my trunk for them to see (I don't know if David ever looked at it). In total I was without my car for about 13 weeks and was never offered a rental car, except for 1 weekend when I was dropped off to get my ""fixed"" car and had to leave it there for continued issues. I am insulted by David's lack of returning any of my calls to him and his response to any of the concerns I presented to him and my service reps. My car is still not fixed and I have to take it to another service center this upcoming week.   ",6,45,-1

very average, nothing special that you couldn’t find anywhere else at a much lower price, the labor per hour is stupid expensive and the parts are marked up some
Only use them for my warranty/recall issues and oil changes which comes with detailed inspection and suggestion report which I take to another place that costs a lot less to repair 
Staff are ok, they’re just trying to do their jobs

When I spoke to the advisor she asked for me to go outside to get the service card And I had to explain what the previous person advised me.  She didn’t even have her name on the paperwork it was another guy who didn’t even help me.  For a simple oil change and tire rotation I took 4 hours to complete.  I didn’t get any updates while I was waiting in the lobby.  I had to ask 3 times the status and each time I asked they would say it was almost done and they needed 10 more minutes. Well those 10 minutes turned in 4 hours cuz They completed the service at 11:30 am.  I even had to ask if there was any recommended service still needed. Another service agent had to look it up and stated oh yes filters can be replaced.  I was frustrated because it was 4 hours of waiting and they didn’t bother to tell me the recommended filter change.  5 people that came in after me were able to get their service done with in 1 hour of their arrival and I saw they were getting updates.

I have visited this dealership a few other times and had a great experience, but this is my first time experiencing this bad of a service, I’m not sure if it’s a new group of service agents but they were the worst I’ve dealt with.

The Service advisor didn’t know one of the techs went home sick until the end of the day, which made my truck stay another day, no work was done to it on the second day. It took 3 days to do oil change, 3 recalls, program the infotainment system, and squeaking breaks. I got my truck back dirty with smudges and dust all over the interior, and to top it off I got the usual ""we can't duplicate the problem"", (breaks squeaking) that started happening 10 min after I left the dealer. When I asked how long they drive my truck for this issue I was told we can’t spend all day driving to hear squeaking breaks. Absolutely unacceptable. I sent an email to dodge corporate with the details of how bad of an experience I had but I have yet to hear back.

32297,19-Jun-19,"After extensive correspondence back and forth with their Online Sales representative, I thought the final price was settled and agreed upon. Originally the sales person quoted me at $923 for DMV fees, which meant they were calculating this 60k truck as if it cost over 150k. I thought this was insane so I used the DMV calculator from the official DMV website to double check and they were indeed up-charging like crazy.  I let him know that as a non-resident, active duty military I would be waved from some fees. Salesman came back with $110 for DMV fees. Sounded good.  When I visited the dealership and it was time to sign all the documents with their finance guy, they changed the sales tax because it was ""miscalculated"". Even though the salesman acknowledged my zip code multiple times in our emails. This I could accept because I didn’t expect them to pay it for me. I signed all the documents and called it a day. About 3 weeks later I get a text from the same finance guy demanding an additional $338 for DMV fees, after going back and forth trying to understand why I would absorb their mistakes, he threatens me with his office manager calling my commanding officer to collect the money. This is incredibly illegal and plain unethical and unprofessional. I then resulted to having the Base Legal Office get involved and rectify. Ultimately, after Legal got involved they accepted their own mistakes. 
Hypothetically speaking, these people could quote you $1 for certain fees and then threaten and demand different amounts. That’s pretty vile.

I was called back & credited with a FREE oil change on my next visit.

He told me that a rental was just turned in. What a coincidence! I left my car and took the rental. I explained that I bought an extra package from finance to cover any scratches on my Jeep. Of course he had never heard of it but would look into it. I returned to get my Jeep. They had detailed my Jeep but the scratches were still there. I was told to go out to the waiting room and they would bring my Jeep up in a couple of minutes. I waited over 30 minutes  for them to bring my car to me.

32382,15-Nov-18,"I had been looking around for the new 2019 Ram Rebel and on a RAM truck message forum (5thgenrams.com), I was referred to Max B as another local forum member just picked up a Laramie trim from Max.

This dealership had tons of Rebels compared to other dealers who had little to none. So I figured they have the most inventory means they know how to get one for me??

So I call Max B. and introduce myself and tell him that I was referred by a forum member.

1st red flag - Max did not care about the referral or his deal - he just wanted to sell me a truck. Max was offended when I told him that of the 35 Ram Rebels in stock that I could not pick one.

So he asks some questions and I give him answers.
I offered to send a build sheet from the Ram website so that he can look for an incoming Rebel that met my needs. 
I email him my build sheet and he calls back and starts to ask questions on package options and such.

2nd red flag - Max arrogantly states that a 3.6L engine (base) can not be had on a Rebel and never will be. That was a lie - there were a couple of 3.6L Rebels popping up in San Diego and Lake Elsinore using the Ram truck locator.  I could tell Max wanted me to just take a truck off their lot and forgo looking for a 3.6L engine.  I felt that Max was lazy and didn't want to pick up his fingers to locate an incoming or find a factory order D1 or KZ status.

3rd red flag - Max says why get a V6 engine when a REAL MAN drives a V8 Hemi. I try to explain that I am not going to haul, not going to tow, and need the truck as a daily driver. 

Max making that sexist remark is unheard of these days unless he came from a trailer trash area of Georgia.

4th red flag - Max would not tell me which is more affordable to lease on a Rebel when we started to talk about numbers.  He just said he has no idea about residuals and money factors.  Huge mistake - all salespeople are taught to give out base numbers when a customers asks - how do they close a customer ???

5th red flag - Max laughs at me when I try to change over to a Big Horn trim with a 3.6L engine and says that a special order will take 6-8 weeks. That was a lie - there were tons of dealers receiving Big Horns with base 3.6L engines. As a matter of fact I just test drove the Big Horn at an Anaheim dealer 2 weeks prior.

6th red flag - When asked about special ordering, Max immediately changed his superior attitude to that of condescending.  Max did not want to do a special order because it means he would have to work.  I could tell Max wanted to sell a truck to me now - not in 6-8 weeks for a special order.  How a car dealership survives without having some of their sales on a custom order is beyond me.

Do NOT do business with this person or dealer - he will lie thru his teeth to get you into any car they have.  
Max lacks basic customer service skills, no knowledge of financial numbers, will berate you if you want a special order, and make sexist remarks.  
Beware females who are independent - Max will rub you the wrong way as he did to me.",6,46,150

When I asked why wasn’t everything flashed as I asked and was written in the order I was told that was all I needed.  

The flash did not solve my problem and when I returned I was told they could flash everything but it wasn’t necessary because only the pcm controller the blower.  I told the service writer to again update and flash everything and was told “That’s a lot more work” and that I would be charged again.  When I asked if that was why they didn’t do it in the first place I felt like I was treated dismissively and I was not given an answer.  I asked for some consideration because the service was not done as I asked and the service writer was kind enough to only charge me 2/3 the price of the original price.

She gave me a ticket and said go to Kelsey’s desk. Kelsey did not wear a name tag, nor is her desk marked, so how am i to know who Kelsey is? She checked me in and said the wait would be no longer than 1.5 hours for an oil change. After two hours of waiting, i went to her desk. No one acknowledged my existence while i waited for Kelsey. I had to ask someone where she was and found out she went home for the day. Sure enough, my car was done, but no one let me know! I had somewhere to be after my appointment and didn’t make it there, unfortunately. No one was really friendly and didn’t seem like they enjoyed their job. It was kind of a downer to be there.

 In addition, i called 4 times to move my appointment back by 20 minutes and got hung up on every single time. So irritating! I was told by a manager their phone lines have been acting strange for a year. Needless to say, i am not very impressed by anyone at this service dealer. I will be finding somewhere else to take my car for a simple oil change.",6,46,-1

32465,02-May-18,"Where do I begin? Saw a sweet online price to get me in, wanted to purchase the vehicle too. After reading all of these great reviews of this dealership I was hoping to have a good day.  I dealt with Max, seems very friendly at first and was quick to write you up for the advertised price to make you happy, but after a while he makes you feel as if your wasting his time and was very condescending. 

After going back to the finance guy, they sneak a lot of things to add up the cost which I did not want, was not negotiated and he was not willing to take off. Also he was not aware of the price that was negotiated upfront. Somehow they were trying to sell me the vehicle at two different prices and clearly not on the same page in the upfront price with Max. I saw the red flag in their fishy process and all they were doing is playing games to con me. The nice discounted price disappeared. All he did was lower my monthly to make me happy since they did not budge on the net cost, but up their interest rate to 8.9%!!  I have excellent credit and should not pay their outrageous rates! As I was walking out, customers were upset in the waiting area. I am just glad I left and purchased elsewhere.

32474,11-Apr-18,"I FILED WITH THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU AND FEDERAL REGULATORS THESE PEOPLE ARE SO BAD. NO JOKE- BUY FROM ANY OTHER DEALER...Spoke to the CFO Armina Mgerian- she is fully aware of their illegal sales tactics and has no interest in discussing any of it because they have numerous complaints against them already and people still buy cars from them- her basic response ""what you gonna do about it""... BUYER BEWARE...Wow. Just wow. Worst experience ever. they did a bait and switch on the APR. Told me I should qualify for 3% interest on the loan. I agreed to come drive the car. I agrree to buy it and work out my trade in. Everythings great so far. Then after he runs my credit he LIES and says I don't qualify for ANY purchase loan and cannot buy the car. BUT he can offer me a lease a 8%... bait and switch. BUT it gets worse. I decline and leave... and sure enough the next day a DIFFERENT salesman contacts me and states he CAN get me the 3%. I respond anything over is unacceptable, but if you can really get me under 4%, I'll still buy the car. He comes back and offers 5.5%... They had my credit history PRIOR to running my credit. Then told me 3%. Then no deal but a horrible lease deal. Then magically the next day he can't swing 3% but can get me a loan for 5.5%. How does it go the night before from NO DEAL you are screwed... to 5.5 % the next day? How? Because they commit lender fraud and try and make you love the car, commit to buy, then state the only deal they can give you is HORRIBLE. IF you won't take the bad lease, they will send you home. Then they finally make a REAL effort for the loan, you grab the 5.5% and they get a kick back from the lender. I'm contacting Chrysler, the state of CA, the BBB and speaking with an attorney. I was smart and got the entire exchange in writing via email and the attorney confirmed they did a blantant bait and switch. Buyer beware and do ALL negotiating via email.

32591,15-Oct-14,"Stay away from these guys, COMPLETE DIRT BAGS!!!! My problem started over a month ago when I contacted these guys about a new Jeep Rubicon X. I was emailed back by a sales person named Garrett. He informed me he could give me 1k off sticker. I politley thanked him and said, I could get at least 3k off sticker at several other dealerships, at which point he became beligerant and typed back in all CAPS. I have purchased 4 different vehciles from this dealership in the past and forwarded his emails to the owner of Orange Coast, Jon Gray. I had his email from him thaking me for my prior purchases. Mr. Gray responded back saying that Garret's conduct was unprofessional and said that it was not indicative of his employees attitudes. I accepted his apology and he got me in touch with a new ""Salesperson"" named Ken. Ken assured me that I would be getting 4k off the sticker of the vehicle to make up for the service, which I thought was great.

It started out just fine. I was going to use OC Motorsports to build the jeep and we were going to wrap some of the cost of the lift into the financing. It took almost 2 weeks for the lift and pricing to be finalized through OC motorsports (Partly my fault since we priced out several different suspension packages). During that time they sold the vehicle they had quoted me on. When I inquired when they could get me another, Ken said yes, but now my discount would only be 2k as it was a new model year (Had I known that I would have been down at the dealership day one). The classic 1990's used car salesman bait and switch!!!! At this point I wasn't happy,  but I wanted to see where the numbers landed. Ken had all of a sudden dissapeared and wouldnt return my emails. After my third email he ""Apologized"" that he had been busy with end of the month (Like he couldnt shoot me a 2 line email letting me know that"" and said he would have my numbers shortly. 

Two days later I get an email, not from Ken, but from the original rude and inept sales person ""Garrett"". There was nothing written in the body of the email, just a screen shot of their computer screen showing a montlhy payment that was $140 higher a month with an additional $1500 down payment. Ken didnt even have the decency to send the email himself to explain why the down payment and monthly payment was substantially higher. This is one of the most unprofessional, classless transactions I have ever been a part of!

I have purchased over 23 new vehicles since 1994. I have never been treated with such contempt or indifference. I have purchased 4 different vehicles from this dealership, so to say I have been loyal to them is an understatement. I bought my 2014 Grand Cherokee SRT8 from Poway Jeep because Orange Coast wouldnt return my emails in a timley manner (Never contacted the owner on this issue). This dealerships service and employees are sub par and define why the general public cant stand the buying process. Buyer beware, absolutley an untrustworthy dealership!!!!!!!!!!",6,46,202

Ok experience. I came 3 times total. End up buy the jeep wrangler Sahara 4 doors here, because I like the car a lot. 
First time I came, no one outside great and show me car.

I asked him all kind of questions about the car and finance. Then I walked away. I told him ""can we do this tomorrow?"" He answered ""sure, I'll keep your file here. So you come back I have all info ready. "" at least he was not rude. 

Next day I came back at 7 pm. Talked to Cole again for price and financing. I got the car for Around $37000 total. Waiting for finance was really long, two hours waiting. Cole is experience seller. He gave me an impression that I had some good discount. This is my first time, so I was trick.

32594,07-Apr-14,"After several test drives of 09 Mazda5 at 4 other dealers, I went to Orange Coast Chrysler Jeep Dodge dealer to test drive one that they had advertised.  I spoke with the Sales Manager-Howard.  I explained to him that the price was fair but that I had seen another for approximately $400.00 less.  I told him that if he was willing to match it and address a ""check tire"" light and a grinding sound that I believed to be a suspension issue, then I would buy the car.  Howard explained to me that all their used cars have been inspected and are approved to be sold.  Nonetheless, he agreed to have the car looked at by the local Mazda dealer.  He specifically told me that a Mazda Mechanic would drive the car and make the repairs needed to correct the problem.  The following day I called Howard to confirm that the car had been repaired.  Howard told me that the car was still at the Mazda dealer but that it should be ready by the time I arrived.  Eventually I picked up the car.  About 15 minutes into my drive home the check engine light went on.  I immediately called Howard to inform him about the light (upon getting of the freeway I started to notice the sound in the suspension).  Howard told me that the car had been checked out and driven by the Mazda mechanic and that ""Leonard"" from the Mazda dealer told him that they had rectified the problem.  Howard told me that he would call me later to give me instructions as to what to do to have the problem addressed.  The next day I called Howard at the Mazda dealer following Howard's instructions.  Leonard told me that he was never told to test drive the car.  Furthermore, he told me that he was simply told to reset the computer in the car.  I relayed this information to Howard.  All he could say was that there must have been some sort of miscommunication.  Initially Howard agreed to correct the problems but then told me that he had given me such a great price that he didn't know if they had room to pay for the repairs.  I told Howard that I was willing to have the car inspected by my regular mechanic because I felt his prices would be more reasonable than that of the Mazda dealer.  After talking to his used car Manager Howard agreed.  My Mechanic inspected the car and wrote and estimate of the repairs.  Howard agreed that the repair cost was fair and would get back to me to arrange repairs.  The next day Howard told me they were only obligated to make repairs to the light issue because it was a safety issue.  Repairs to the suspension would be my problem.  I explained to Howard that quite frankly that was mildly interesting to me.  He had told me that the repairs had been done prior to picking up the car; Howard clearly lied.  Howard told me that they were willing to pay $200 to repair the problem with the light or to spend it any way I wished to.  He also gave me the option of returning the car back.  I told him I would call him back the next day with my decision.  The next day I told him I was returning the car.  Howard then told me that was not an option.  I told Howard we would be resolving the cost in court.  Howard told me that they have their attorneys ready for court.  A day or so later Howard called me willing to pay me $600 (total cost was $643.27) for the repairs. I paid for the repairs up front just as they asked me to and faxed them a copy of the bill.  I asked him to call me to confirm that he received the fax.  He did not.  I asked Howard assured me that the check would be sent that same day first class mail.  Thirteen days later and after several calls and voice mails, no check.  I eventually called Orange Coast (accounts payable) to inquire about the check.  They were quick to address my concerns and I informed me that the check had been sent out to my mechanic.  Clearly the miscommunication  and deception from the ""Sales Manager"" need to be addressed.  Howard at Orange Coast Chrysler Jeep Dodge is the epitome of a car salesman.  ",6,46,148

32622,27-Mar-12,"I purchased a 2011 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon in November of 2011. After two months had passed I still had not recieved registration, tags, or a license plate.  When I called in February to find out what was happening I was told that November was a busy month and not to worry, my license and tags would be coming. When March arrived I called again and  was told to talk to Alicia the DMV girl but every phone call to her resulted in a message on her machine and not one time in a weeks period did I receive a return call. In complete frustration I went to the DMV and was informed that the car was owned by a woman and they would not give me her name. The next day I called to the dealership and  was unable to get David Reed, Alicia or Brian Cole to answer there phones. When I asked to be transferred to the General Manager Pete Shaver the operator patched me in on his cell phone and I told him my worries and that I needed to find out who owned my car, that I had already paid over 35,000 dollars for. When he called me back the following day he said the DMV girl had accidently sent the pink slip to the woman who they had repossesed the car from.  He assured me that going to the DMV in two weeks he would straighten out the problem. After two more weeks I attempted to find out the situation and was told it might be easier for me to just go the DMV myself and take care of it. But then Pete Shaver said if I wanted he would at least get me the license plates. Well now it is March 27 and I finally recieved my pink slip,registration, tags but still no license plate even tho my pink and registration have a plate number on them. When I attempted to contact them again the exact same thing, message machine and no return calls, when I called the Jeep factory complaint line I was told to go to the DMV  myself and report the plates stolen and just get new plates myself, of course at my own cost. The amazing thing is that Jeep themselves don't care and told me there was nothing they could do and they did not want to talk to Orange Coast Jeep about this. I am wondering if there is some sort of legal issues involving this dealership and the rules of business involving the DMV. I am sure this letter will just be removed and discarded, because not one person I have talked to at this dealership or at the Jeep factory has ever wanted to actually do the job they are paid to do. I can promise you I will never buy another Jeep from any dealer, I am 55 years old and have bought many cars, Toyota, Ford, Chevrolet, and others and I have never experienced anything as horrible as the experience at this dealer.

32646,04-Feb-11,"Brought our 2001 Dodge Intrepid here for service several days ago because the check engine light was on.  They found several pressure leaks and repaired same for 1,000.00.  
The day we picked up the car, I got a call from their service manager asking me to return the car because they may have forgotten to check something. So, they let us drive the car away without verifying that it had been completely repaired.  In the meantime, my wife called me to tell me that the car was running very badly now.  We did not have this problem before taking it in for the engine light; the car has always run beautifully.
We left the car all day again.  They called me and told me that they had fixed the problem, apologized profusely, and told me that there would be no charge.  I picked up the car and everything seemed fine.  The next day, the check engine light was back on, and the car stalled in an intersection and kept stalling every time I started it.

32667,30-Dec-10,"I bought my car at this location -- horrible experience -- my recommendation is to never, ever do business with this dealer.  I received the worst service at this company.  This firm refused to secure my car after it flooded and I was waiting for Jeep to determine if they would cover the defect in the windshield that caused 3 inches of rain to puddle in my car. (This event follows several other instances of  of replacing the same parts repeatedly due to other defects -- which were very costly).  I had to demand that the Customer Service Manager secure the car so that no further damage would occur -- and only after I told him his firm would be legally liable did he take action to secure the car from further damage.  When I asked to speak to the General Manager, the Customer Service Manager refused to transfer the call, stating that the GM was was out of town (I had already confirmed that the GM was onsite that day with the front desk staff). 

When I finally spoke with the GM, he was very condescending when I requested answers as to why I had been given poor service and poor treatment -- he stated that the firm had been in business 30 years and I keep coming back so they must be doing something right.  Are you kidding me???!  I'm not here paying for rental cars (repeatedly) and paying for repairs of obvious defects because I want to -- I expected a higher level of customer service since they sold me the car.

32668,16-Sep-10,"Summary: This dealer employs rude, arrogant service managers who blatantly attempt to take advantage of female customers and their perceived naivete.  This is also the most expensive C/D/J dealer I've ever visited, and I've used at least five throughout California.

The first time I visited this dealer, I was shopping for a Jeep.  The saleswoman thought that the best way to sell me on a Jeep was to take me for a test drive and then turn donuts in a local parking lot.  I left, convinced she was insane.  

The second time I visited, several years later, I had had my Jeep towed in because of a dead battery (jumping wouldn't start it).  The dealer sold me a battery for close to $300.  I had no choice but to purchase, as my truck wouldn't start.  The whole time, the service manager was conversing with his cronies and barely looking at me as he shoved paperwork at me to sign.  I was asking questions about my car's behavior and getting vague, ""you're a woman and wouldn't understand"" answers.  

The third time and fourth times I visited (failed LED lamp and transmission flush), the quoted prices were OBSCENELY high compared to either Pep Boys or other dealers.  I also got the same jerk as my service manager.  Although I no longer live in LA, tomorrow I'm driving 50 miles back to Buerge Jeep who will do the transmission flush for $100 less than Orange Coast. Unbelievable and unfortunate that Orange County lacks a respectable or even remotely competitive C/D/J dealer (Tuttle Click isn't any better).",6,47,-1

I reiterated that I was interested in the red vehicle specified in my online inquiry and asked Adam to send me the exact out the door price, as I intended to purchase the vehicle using cash.

Shortly after driving the vehicle, I was told that my vehicle is more expensive than what I’d been quoted, and that the quote I was given was for a grey vehicle. I had fallen victim to a bait-and-switch and ended up driving over three hours for no reason.

I would also like to add that I have never purchased a vehicle at this low of a price point. I’ve negotiated deals with BMW, Porsche, Lamborghini, Rolls Royce and have never been treated this way. I don’t have much experience working with the lower end dealers and find it disgusting that they treat their customers the way I have been treated.

32683,20-Nov-19,"When coming to a deal on the price for a vehicle I was going to lease from this dealership, one of the things that was instrumental in my agreeing to the price they quoted me, was that i was told the vehicle and the lease terms would qualify me to be able to claim the CA Clean Vehicle Rebate (CVRP).

However after they had told me multiple times during the negotiations, including answering affirmatively when i directly asked them before signing, I found out later that in fact the lease did not qualify. 

Attempting to contact the dealership about this resulted in long strings of being ignored, given a run around, and  being told they would get back to us soon then they never did, over and over. 

At this point they have not in any way attempted to reconcile after their sales team lied to us. If they would at least work with us to reconcile the situation I would assume it was a misunderstanding and be glad to work with them. However, as of now i can only assume they knowing lied to me in order to get me to sign the lease.

- when my father inquired about the delay (because I needed a ride there), he was told, ""if she doesn't like waiting, she can just leave""
- when I was signing paperwork, the DMV document noted a ""lienholder"" as Chrysler Financing, when I was paying cash for the vehicle.

- purchased a brand new vehicle and it was not clean, and they only gave me a half tank of gasoline (see photos of 63 miles on a new car and only 1/8 of a tank left on Yelp site)
- sent me a text message with a link to the video to explain my new purchase - the link didn't work; emailed three more times and got no response - it finally took another general manager to intervene (see pictures added on Yelp site)
- one of the ""general managers,"" Bob Mann, called me personally and said that, based on what I reported to him, he was going to fire his finance guy for incompetence, then called back to tell me I'd be getting an email apology (that never happened)
- I emailed Scott DePeralta three times to ask for the regional manager and his/her contact info - he never responded
- at one point, Scott emailed me and said I could just bring the car back, but the sad thing was that I couldn't because I had already used a $500 rebate that could not be transferred to another dealership
- I finally found a regional manager named Piyom Ghavimi who said he would assist - forwarded all emails to him and never heard back

From beginning to end, they treated me as if they were doing me a favor and could care less about customer service. There is nothing good about this dealership - go elsewhere. #worstexperienceever #dishonest #unethical #unprofessional #gameplayers",6,47,-1
32715,02-Dec-18,"I had an absolutely terrible experience with this dealership. I called Browning Grimmett the day before I planned to come in to see a used Hyundai Accent and we agreed upon a 1pm appointment. He asked me to call him again once I was on my way, which I did. Only then did he mention that the dealership would be closing early that day. He told me it was closing at 3pm, when I arrived I discovered it was actually closing at 2pm. After an hour drive, he was completely unprepared to show the vehicle I indicated. In fact I had to remind him which car it was. It was in their sister dealership in Morgan Hill. After wasting 45 minutes to go retrieve the vehicle, we got through paperwork only to be told that we would need to come back the following day to finish financing. Though upset that at this, we agreed, and he said he would meet with us at 11:30am the next day. When we arrived at the agreed upon time, Browning was nowhere to be found. Only after waiting for 15 minutes did we discover he had not come in at all. Tony Truong abruptly came up to me, asking for my insurance documents without any greeting, and did not introduce himself to me until prompted by the fact I was clearly confused. I was then called ""distraught"" when I expressed my uneasiness at not being informed of what was happening. At this point a gentleman who did not give me his name began to intervene. He told me he didn't know what I wanted him to do. I asked if there was any price negotiation that could happen because of how much we had been inconvenienced and said that it does not instill a lot of confidence in me to make such a big purchase when I am being told so many different things. I was responded to in a very defensive, blame shifting manner, trying to make it seem as if it was my fault communication had not been clear. I was told if I did not have confidence in their dealership I shouldn't buy the car. And I didn't. I found the entire experience slimy and disrespectful. I was fully prepared to give this dealership my money, but was literally talked out of buying from them, by their own team. It was clear that because I was trying to buy an economy car that they wouldn't turn a profit on I was not a valuable person in their eyes. ",6,47,-1

We went down in person and they were very rude and said they would help us if we were going to buy out the lease or buy or lease another vehicle, but if not we needed to go to another dealership to turn it in. Finally talked to the general manager and made an appointment to drop it off, but when we came in we waited over an hour for them to tell us that they couldn’t do it today and that we would have to come back tomorrow.

The day we were told it would be ready WE had to call to find out when we could pick it up and they told us the part was on back order and it would be a few more days. Once again, after a few more days WE called to check the status and were told it was going to be even longer. Finally after TWO weeks and little communication on their end we picked up the vehicle. My husbands truck is an essential part of his business so we had to spend money out of pocket to rent another vehicle while they held his hostage and he even had to postpone a very important business trip because of it. After being a really pissed off about the whole situation I thought to myself ""Well they will surely make up for this with at least a small gesture (like a complimentary oil change)"". Not the case what-so-ever. They even had my husband pre-pay for his next oil change. Might I add my husband is the easiest going guy around.

33089,30-Aug-15,"My experience with this dealership is that it is non-responsive and their rating is untrustworthy. After the purchase of Jeep Cherokee Limited last weekend I received the Thank You email from the GM of this dealership. The email states ""You may be receiving a questionnaire from Jeep soon. If you cannot give us a completely satisfied rating for any reason, please call me so we can better serve you as our valued customer"". I responded to the GM’s email and tried directly contacting him to discuss issues and to offer suggestions, instead he directed the sales person to contact me though I wanted to talk to the GM per his email. I find it absurd that despite the GM’s original email he was not accessible and he did not even respond to my several email requests which shows his lack of commitment. Apparently he might come up with the excuse that he had no time and was too busy.

Both the Sales person and Finance Manager were courteous. But I observed during the purchase that the sales person pleads to the customers to give the dealer 10 out of 10 rating when the survey is received so that the he and others can receive bonus. This practice appears to be unethical leading to misleading rating for this dealership. I believe the rating should be transparent without any influence. Apparently his focus was to get him bonus from my purchase that also seems evident from his text message.

I went to the dealer after the Sales person sent me an email with out-the-door price for the Cherokee Limited that I wanted, but during the paperwork in his office for the same SUV he said that I will have to pay $1000 more if I refinance with 0% which shocked me because he did not state so in his email and my preference was to get this refinance but I could not. Also, during the price agreement paperwork with the Sales person in his office he did not go over the option of the cooling-off period which I find misleading. Also he provided illusive response when I asked him why I can’t get the other vehicle from the front lot that was the same make/model with the same year, features and the sticker price.",6,47,-1

It saves everyone time and saliva from speaking and negotiating so much.  They won't deal with you via email because of ""high demands"".  More very old sales car tactics to bring you in.  Lets go back to that, high demands.  In this pandemic where many dealers are closed, lots are overfilled with unsold merchandise, and cars still on cargo ships where they are not unloaded because there's no room on any lots.  Sure looks like there is more inventory than demand.

Then they do the most irresponsible thing and maintain their old car sales tactics by bringing you in when we're in a pandemic and are in a shelter in place.  That is irresponsible on their behalf and comes to show they are more interested in profits than people's health.  I will not bring my wife and I to simply negotiate and possibly get sick.  We can do negotiations via email or telephone, then when we come to a price we both agree to, then we can come in and sign papers with minimal exposure.  Even my last two car purchases way before the pandemic allowed this (Lexus and Tesla).

I would avoid this dealer and if this is tactic is across the board, go to a different manufacturer that actually cares about people and willing to adapt and negotiate online or over the phone.

I hate to do this, but they (HB Chrysler Dodge Jeep RAM) got me. If it sounds too good to be true, with this dealership it probably is... I thought I wasn't getting scammed, but they just waited a week to start twisting everything around. 

First, was the chip in the windshield that they told me would get taken care of and replaced.  A month later, it still hasnt been taken care of.
Then I was given a copy of a clean Carfax, but I got home that night and noticed a basketball size dent in my bumper. I did not hit anything, and after telling the dealer about it, they reviewed their security footage and I was told they are ""not required to disclose damages unless they are a safety concern."" And that's not all...

A few weeks later, I was called back in for a better deal with a better bank and I need to come in to sign the papers or I'd lose my loan. I thought my current loan was decent, but better? Ok, I didn't think I was lied to yet, of course I'll come sign for a better deal. I get into financing and this time it's a paper contract (the first time it was all electronic and I was given a USB with all the files.) The finance manager has every paper stacked on top of one another covering the tops of the pages and only exposing the signature lines because ""the documents are all the same as before, only the finance company changed and we got you a better APR and monthly payment."" 

My original contract: 17.63% APR $368 monthly
My ""better deal"" contract: 22.89% APR $428.67 monthly

I purchased the truck for $11,500 and brought enough to pay off the truck that day. The finance manager told me if I want to build my credit get financing and just put money down. So I put $6,000 down in cash and was led to believe (all the way through driving off the lot) my financing was only for $5,500 +tax and license.  
 
I bought my first new truck from this place 20 years ago and I remember how comfortable and confident I was with all the decisions being made. It was the best vehicle purchase I ever made. When I went back to buy another truck last month, they gave me that feeling all over again. However, Huntington Beach Chrysler Dodge Jeep RAM aka Surf City Auto is not a dealership to be trusted.

The sales guy said they are a no haggle dealership like Carmax.  Cool.  We pulled out the checkbook and were ready pay and take our new car home.  Easy.  Then we waited for two hours for the finance guy to bring the paperwork.  When he arrived, he looks at the computer screen and says he'll put together an estimated cost.  We curiously said ""ok?""  He then quoted $5,000 higher than their sticker price.  We very clearly said ""No!""  He asked what we want to pay, to which I replied ""If we are making up prices now, $9,000."" He then says, ""I can't charger more than our advertised price.""  So, I pulled out my phone and showed him the advertised price that we were willing to pay.  Then he said there were $4,000 worth of negotiable items already installed that they had to charge for.  We said we do not want to pay for what we do not need and he asks ""You don't expect people to do work and not pay for it? It's already installed.""  I turned to the sales guy and asked what this was all about, and he said he explained that to us earlier.  No he didn't.  We then said ""our time is valuable and you've cost us by wasting it.""

33224,07-Dec-19,"Stay away from this stealership.

I spoke to the internet sales person, Bryan. I said I’m traveling from 2 hours away via rideshare if you can confirm that the price advertised is the price you will honor. I told him i don’t want any miscommunication or surprises if I’m going to travel all the way up there. But if the price is true, I’m ready to buy it. 

I told him I had financing through my bank already pre-approved. He said yes, that’s the guaranteed price. He acknowledged I have my own financing. 

I show up. He tries to make me sign a credit report per homeland security for OFAC. If you are not financing through the dealership, YOU DO NOT HAVE TO DO THIS. It’s a scam well documented amongst crediting agencies and websites like Edmunds.

He brings his manager over, they say it’s cool you don’t need to to do it. He makes some side comment about if my credit is low and if I’m worried. No, Bryan, I’m not worried, you simply don’t have authorization to check my credit.

He then tries to sell me on this $3900 buy up package with paint protection and security. He tells me it’s already on the vehicle so that’s all he can do. 

Aka, we’re not gonna sell you what we advertised.

They will try to get you to finance through their bank at 7.4% APR, they will tell you that's the  going rate on vehicle loans.

I would have left if I had the option.
Basically they have this great text option that Henry would keep me updated on my car and respond quickly to my inquiries. It is great when they use it.
This experience had absolutely NO responses to my text messages. Attempts to call all went unanswered once transferred to my service tech. Messages both with operator and voicemail went unreturned. I did have a loaner (since it was believed to be a covered issue) so I wasn't too worried about when I got it back but I just wanted to know the status.
After 8 days of trying, I basically BEG to speak to ANYONE about the status of my car and magically my tech picks up in 2 rings.
I am then told I need two things done which will cost almost $800. (Almost $500 for new spark plugs alone). I ask if it is driveable and go to pick it up the next day. Total days...10!
After paying $150 for a diagnostic fee.I received it running (the two women I dealt with this time were amazing.) and immediately drove it to the family mechanic who works on the other cars. He is only about a mile away so I pull up and park. When we get to the car to have them bring it in the shop, the battery is COMPLETELY DEAD! 
I ended up with MORE issues than when I dropped it. The next day I got a shifter warning when I went to pick it up. It was the battery. It rated ZERO even though they charged it before they were done and moved it out for pickup.

33235,09-Oct-19,"Get ready for a fight, or they will take you to the cleaners!

Found a 2018 Ram 2500 4x4 for a great price here while searching on the internet. I live about 6 hours away from Huntington Beach but this price was about $4k cheaper than everywhere else I could find this particular truck. I called the dealer, spoke with a Bryan and confirmed the price. I asked if there would be any surprise add-ons and he promised me that was the price I would get. I told him I was already approved for the loan and he said that was great!

My wife and I took the next day off, drove 6 hours, and got a hotel room so we could be at the dealer in the morning. This seemed like a good idea to save $4k. 

We went inside, asked for Bryan, he wasn't there but there was another nice kid who would be happy to help us. I told them I didn't want to cut Bryan out of his commission, they said no worries, he would still get it. 

We sat down with new kid. First thing he tells us is there will be an additional $4,000 for Theft Protection GPS, Surface Coating, and Service Contract. (All Optional in final contract, but I was told this is the only way I was getting that internet price.) Additionally, they insisted I used their financing even though I came in with a pre-approved loan. Their loan had an APR that was 3.4% higher than mine. They said I could refinance after 3 months. I said that would cost me three payments of nearly pure interest and they looked at me like I was crazy.

I said no way, I didn't ask for or want any of that crap. All I wanted was the price I was promised before I drove 6 hours and rented a hotel room. 

We fought all day. We left no less than three times. First time I left was because they didn't even have the truck there, I told them I didn't even want to talk to them anymore until they produced the truck so I could test drive it. We went to the beach and walked around with our feet in the ocean until they called us back and said they had the truck. 

After the test drive the fighting continued. All I wanted was the price I was promised and they told me I was being unreasonable. The manager said ""Okay, I can't earn everyone's business"", and walked away. We left, they ran us down in the parking lot and said they would come down by $1,750, but I still had to use their financing. I said no, they walked away. We drove off. 

We got about 5 minutes away and they called. This guy said he was the GM and he didn't want to loose my business because of financing. He said I could use my financing and take off a total of $2,300. We decided this is close enough and we took the deal. I know we could have nickle dimed them down some more, but it was getting late and we still had to drive 6 hours to get home. 

Now, this may be knit picking, but these guys got me on Yelp for the first time, so here we go...

After the the papers were signed, we waited a long time for the truck to be back from detailing. We were walking around the truck and my wife noticed a 2"" gash in the paint right on the edge of the front wheel well. I can't believe we didn't notice this before, and we had already signed. (Not really a deal breaker anyway.) I went inside and had the GM come out and look at the gash to see if there was anything they could do. ""Sorry man, AS-IS..."" and basically walked away. I thought, ""Really? Brand new car and I get AS-IS treatment?"" Still not a deal breaker, I can fix this anyways.

We were waiting some more, they couldn't find the rubber floor mats that were included or the spare key. They never found the mats, said they would be ordered and shipped. While waiting the same GM asked me to leave them a good review on Yelp and I said I would. I hope he didn't mean favorable, cause I would have said no.

This was an awful experience. This isn't my first time buying a vehicle, but I have never felt like I was dealing with such a crooked dealership. I left two stars because after a day of fighting and headache, we still got the truck cheaper than I could find it listed anywhere else in a 500 mile web search.

If you're up for a fight, got a day to burn, and don't mind walking out a few times to get what you were promised, then you might not mind buying a car here. Just don't travel a long distance and expect them to be upfront about pricing before you get there. All promises are out the window once you sit down with sales person.

I doubt I'll ever see those floor mats...

Steer clear! These guys are con artists. I have purchased many cars over the years. I called ahead of time about a specific car asked them for their bottom line OTD price, told them exactly when we'd be there, yet the car had to be chased down for 30 minutes. Test drive finished, we were ready to buy the car at the already agreed upon OTD price. xxxxxxx finance guy comes in and suddenly the price is up by over $4000, I told them, as I said before, we weren't interested in financing and wanted to get the paperwork signed for the previously agreed upon price. Finance guy says they can't do that, so we walk. Get a call a few minutes later, again promised if we come back we could have the car for the mutually agreed price. Now a new guy enters the picture and tells me he can sell it for the price listed on the internet, which is about $350 more than the agreed price even before they add all of the additional thousands of dollars of junk they try to force on you. we walked again, right into a reputable sellers store, and bought a the same exact car for less in a nicer color, including the extended warranty.

33240,10-Sep-19,"Too bad I had not read the reviews on this dealership well before wasting my time, gas & effort. Just reading the past 30 days of 1 star negative reviews sum up allot of how this illegitimate place works. Nothing but lies after lies well before you get into this dealership and then they continue when you arrive with the “Bait & Switch” tactics along with more lies. My opinion is that they need to be investigated & shut down for good.

I initially made contact with supposed salesman Androw Mansour on a RAM truck & was told the truck was available. I informed Androw that I lived in Hawaii & that I would be paying cash. He told me that they do not take cash or deposits on vehicles. He also said he worked in finance. I had been conversing with Androw for four days ensuring the truck was available & he confirmed it was. I called Androw on a Sunday & I asked him to please text me by the end of Monday night on the availability of the vehicle. I indicated to him that I would be flying all day & arriving late Monday night & would not be able to receive messages during my flight. I also made sure that he understood that I was driving to the dealership early Tuesday morning from San Diego to Huntington Beach.
   
Androw never contacted me on status and availability on Monday night as he said he would so I called him early morning Tuesday & he enthusiastically said “yes, the truck was still there”. So we started our 77 mile trip all the way to Huntington Beach. We were about 12 miles from the dealership when Androw called & said you’re not going to believe this and that the truck was just sold 10 minutes ago. He said however that there were 2 other trucks available, a Black & White one with the exact same features.

Not believing Androw, when I arrived at the dealership I immediately asked for the desk manager whose name is Jock. I inquired about the vehicle status that I came out to see & was told that it had been actually sold the day before. One of the other sales man Andy did a tracker on the truck and located it in Los Angeles. So I told Jock the desk manager that I had driven all the way from San Diego for this truck. Jock replied that they are the #1 sales dealership in the country & vehicles are continuously being sold. So I told him that this is what every dealership says which is a bunch of B.S. I also told him what he didn’t know and that was if the truck indeed had been sold the day before then why would your salesman Androw lie to me just over an hour ago & tell me that the truck was there. Jock’s reply was that he was going to have a talk with Androw.
 
When I asked Jock about the supposed Black & White trucks that Androw said were available, he then directed salesman Andy to look them up. Sure enough there were no trucks that Androw could produce however there were trucks at a higher price. So I asked Andy to get a hold of Androw & ask him where are these supposed trucks that he indicated on the phone that were available. Andy left & later came back & said he cannot find Androw. So I said to call him on his mobile & he said he didn’t have his number. I asked why is it that I have his number & the dealership doesn’t. He couldn’t provide me with an answer only to say that there are no trucks as Androw described however he again had higher priced trucks. I believe the kicker to this whole scheme is that Androw & Andy are one in the same person who is trying to cover up his own lies & mistakes.

So now it seems obvious that I too are another victim of being lured into this dealership by their false advertised pricing, con artist lies and illicit salesmen tactics all while at my own expense.
 
The good news however is that I did purchase a truck at Dave Smith Motors in Idaho. They literally are one of the highest volume dealerships in the nation with thousands of vehicles and availability to choose from. They don’t lie, are honest and pricing is unbeatable.

Victor was our salesman and he greeted us with kindness and enthusiasm and told me the car was in the back lot.  I was surprised to learn that the car I wanted was $2000 more than listed online. So George came in to explain it to us but instead we were met with arrogance and rudeness.  After a short but disturbing conversation/argument  he told us "" he's been doing this for 30 years and maybe we should leave and go think about it"".  At this point, my boyfriend left the desk to go ask for another manager and I told George I was no longer speaking to him. I have never been treated so badly.  George needs to realize that without me and every other customer.....he doesn't have a job.  Frankly I would of fired him if it were my company.

Now we're waiting for another manager, and Joe comes in and we have to start the process all over again after telling him how completely disgusted I am with the treatment I received from George. 3 hours after my appointment time, I finally get to see the car .....it is filthy.... dirt and debris everywhere.   It's so bad I don't even want to sit in it and there's no gas in it to take it for a test drive.   Also the rear passenger matching tire is not on and that needs to be replaced.   I'm told it will take an hour to change the tire and to clean and detail the car.   This is how they present a car to someone who wants to buy it??

An hour goes by... just 30 more minutes, 15 more minutes.... lie after lie. 2 1/2 hours later my car is ""ready"".   But I look in the car, it's still not completely clean and there's no gas in it.   Joe explained to me that the cleaning is subcontracted out, and they have no control over how long it takes for them to do their job. Really? This is the standard that is acceptable and you make excuses for them??

I arrived at 9:30 ready to buy a car..... that car and it is now 3:30.   The level of BS that was handed to me that day was ridiculous and insulting?   I love a jeep but I will never step foot back into that dealership again other than the required yearly visit through my warranty... and believe me I'm telling everyone and anyone.   And here's a suggestion stop eating at the front desk. Nobody wants to come in to buy a car and see you with a mouthful of food.  

Finally driving home I notice he Stop/Start is not working so I called and talked to Dan.  Who told me that it really doesn't save gas and is really hard on the engine, so I shouldn't worry about fixing it.  REALLY??  I buy a car that has 360 miles on it....EVERYTHING should work on it.  But after all his daughter has a Compass and hers is turned off and I should do the same.....  

The above is a sugar coated version..... it was a miserable day and experience.......it pains me to the know that I am part of their salary earned that day.  Buying a car should not be that miserable .....it shouldn't be miserable at all.......  and yes I could of walked away but I've had two Jeeps before and believe in the car.   I just I wish I had read the reviews before and gone somewhere else.......  the low price was not worth being treated like crap for he most of 6 hours.

33253,28-May-19,"Bad sales service experience at Huntington Beach Dodge. I've bought 4 new cars before and I have never experience the largest disappointment as this dealer. I took thee trip to finally come to my senses that it was a waste of time to try to buy a truck advertised in Autotrader by them. On the first trip, the truck didn't have the options I was looking for.  The second trip to the dealer, I asked that the truck be brought to the site so I could look at it before starting the paper work and they told me that its not how they do things there. Who buys a truck without seeing it, right? My third trip I was interested in purchasing in another  truck listed in Autotrader, but they told me they could sell it. They told me it was missing parts due to a break in. I spoke to the manager and  I expressed my disappointment with the whole situation. It almost seems like they have no interest in selling a vehicle, or the adds are just a catch. I called, I emailed very little interest in them returning your calls or emails.  I am very disappointed.  ",6,47,346

It wasn't until his manager stepped in with my ""deal"" when things went south. First off, they are telling me the price of the wrangler I want to purchase is $32.5K then this dingo walks in and tells me my monthly payment is going to be $797 over 72 terms, they clearly werent looking to sell a car. They add in their $4k dealer accessories kit which is smoke and mirrors, and tell you that you must finance the vehicle through the dealership for atleast 3 months at 7% APR, then you can refinance with any lender. As someone with very good credit, I've never seen modern cars selling with 7% APR. I managed to shave $2K off their dealer accessories and took out the other xxxxxxxx warranties they tried baiting in as well, so for those that say its non negotiable, it is but they wont take it all off. The final straw for me was the insult of an offer for my trade in, they were a good 30% under its fair trade in value, I have other offers from dealerships and carmax to back up my ""fair value"" assesment. I walked, too much smoke and mirrors, hidden fees, etc. I will be buying a wrangler but certainly not from them. They'll also reply to this and likely say something along the lines of we sell 10,000 cars a year all at our advertised prices 100% of the time, but if you read all the reviews here you'll quickly understand that is total poppycock.

They have multiple different lots and in the 2 1/2 hours we gave them to find the vehicle, they did no such thing. We got there and the vehicle was not there, however they tried to pressure us into starting paperwork to buy a vehicle we have not even seen?? We waited an hour and nobody even knew what lot the vehicle was even on. We talked to 5 different people and nobody was actually knowledgeable enough to help us. Everybody promised they would find out right away, only to never see them again. We then got a call 2 hours after we left the dealership incredibly upset, only for them to ask where we were because they had our WRANGLER ready for us to look at.

ALL PRICES YOU SEE ADVERTISED ONLINE ARE """"""NEVER"""""" THE PRICE YOU WILL PAY, according to Mario the salesman who told me this dirty secret that this dealer recently changed their policy. EVERY THOUSAND OF VEHICLES IN-STOCK (NEW AND USED) NOW REQUIRE A MINIMIUM OF $4,000 MARKUP PRICE ($1,500 more for RAM trucks) FOR THE JUNK DEALER AFTERMARKET ACCESSORIES INSTALLED before they will sell the cars to you, AND IT IS """"""NON-NEGOTIABLE...""""""""

Their markup price may be possible to negotiate on very-rare case basis, but only good for few hundred dollars off max. If you are a guy, FORGET IT, you are required to pay the full $4,000 markup price. Only ladies can negotiate the $4,000 markup aftermarket price for few hundred dollars less. They are very-PREJUDICED and BIASED on who will get the discount or not, and I saw all these events on my face personally overhearing from other customers nearby. Not every people will get the same price, opportunity, and discount.

I lost my patience and anger, their stupidity, and stormed out. I would be happy to keep this bait-and-switch dealer a secret and give them 5 stars today (and not post this review) if they didn't screw up on me.

33265,24-Jan-19,"When you go to a dealership and buy a car new from the lot, you're not just buying a car but you're buying a piece of mine that anything that breaks on it is covered for the next 36,000 miles. You're not expecting them to all of a sudden after a year-and-a-half turn on you and try to rip you off looking for any reason they can. My radio broke a year ago and I took it out oh, this does not void the warranty, even though he's trying to convince me it does and trying to convince me that my air conditioner knob won't turn because I took my radio out of year ago. Not only that, I've been bringing my vehicle to this place for the past year since I got it and the last two times I brought it it didn't have the radio in it and because I didn't get this bearded self proclaimed mechanic as a service provider... it was never a problem and all the issues that were covered under warranty we're fixed. I wasn't asking for the radio to be fixed. This time it was my door latches and my air conditioner knob would not physically turn and he's going to try to tell me that that's because I took my radio out a year ago and it's so ridiculously underhanded and is blatantly transparent they are not out for customer service or do you good because you bought a vehicle from them...they are out to suck as much money out from you as they possibly can even as a loyal customer. I don't understand it because these guys, at the front desk, if they're not getting the money you've figured they would understand and it would try that help you get your car fixed...not try to say $150 to bring it in when it's under warranty. Yes you heard me $150 to bring it in and it still under warranty it's only a year-and-a-half old. I did not install any more systems I did not alter anything electrical inside I simply took the radio out of the dash. They wouldn't even compromised to fix my back door latches on my patch on the back because you know that's directly related to the radio(sarcastic) and makes a whole bunch of sense there. I really wish he wouldn't have been so stubborn with this, it's just not right, taking the radio off does not effect the door latches nor the A/C components and DOES NOT void your warranty... and he kept thinking if he explained it enough  to me that I was going to believe what he said. So basically they are trying to rip me off and weasel their way out of a signed contract warranty...when there's been multiple repairs on this thing...in the same condition as it's in now...so there's nothing really more I can say to get the point across. The Dodge I had bought had broken multiple times within the first year and they had it for upwards of two weeks at a time, 2 weeks and I didn't say nothing I didn't complain at all because they had me covered and they fixed everything that was wrong with it... everything that was DESERVED to be fixed. Now for a couple little things it would have taken maybe an hour and a half to do all of them, they're going to cause me and themselves this much trouble trying to squeeze a hundred something bucks out of me which...I got...but it's not the point. The fact that they serviced before in the same condition and now they're not lets you know that the inconsistency automatically leads to the conclusion that they're ripping us off every chance they can get...any time they can think of. I know this is common knowledge, that dealers rip you off....but I'm not having it this time....you should have just fixed my doors and A/C....I talked to my lawyer friend...my warranty is still valid....stop jerking people around.

Turns out the Ram truck that was advertised was just a ploy to get customers into their door.  The truck is a Ram 2019 Longhorn with a stock number 50505 was advertised as an MSRP of 58K when the actual vehicle was 62K, they then proceeded to tell me that I had to buy 4500 dollars in additional dealer services to get the vehicle at the advertised price.  Makes sense since the garbage they sell as ""extra coverage"" is 100% pure profit and the sale of the truck is a just s small fraction into their pocket. 

The sad part of this story is my wife is 8 months pregnant and we spent 4 hours there just to be taken advantage of.  I even bought a vehicle here in 2014 and got the vehicle and at the advertised price.  Not sure if what they are doing is legal but its sad to see places like this are still in business.  Even contacted Ram which didn't have much to say.

Henry then told me that they would only need my car for a day because these were all very ""simple"". 
    My car was dropped off at the dealership at 7:05 am.

I then reiterated the issues that needed fixing, and Henry said ""oh yeah"", and hung up. I then called back at 5:49 and asked Henry when my car would be ready, and he said I couldn't pick it up until tomorrow. I told him that it was crucial I get my car back, because I was taking my godmother to chemo in the morning & I had school. Henry very nastily replied ""yeah, well"". Then Henry lied and said ""We didn't have the tires in stock"". When I told him that wasn't true because I confirmed that there were 5 tires in stock before I made the appt. he again nastily replied ""yeah, well"". I then said ""If you had any issues you should have just called me"". Henry again ""yeah, well"". I asked him why he didn't call me; he gave no response. I then said ""New tires are simple and quick, you still have time to do it today."" Again Henry nastily replied, ""yeah, well - no I don't"".

While you are waiting you would think they would be prepping your car for delivery to you , however that is not the case.

I had to call back the next day to learn that they tried to hide a FOUR THOUSAND DOLLAR extended warranty in those numbers, hoping that I wouldn't do the math.  We never once discussed an extended warranty, I never asked for it, and they never disclosed that they were adding it to the total amount financed.

If you absolutely must buy a car from this place, make 100% sure you know what the price of the car is...and what else you're paying for.

They said I had to come back and sign new papers, they couldn’t get the interest rate promised (after realizing it was 11%), but they had gotten down to 9%. They neglected to tell me they “added “ an extra year on my loan and I did not pay attention to that since they said nothing had changed but the rate. Also I had so many inquiries on my credit report. Also the “finance charge that they supposedly were charging cause they were financing the loan was still added into the loan along and they sold my loan to capital one with the interest rate a month after buying the car. So I ended up paying $23,000 for a $14,000 car with no bells or whistles and no power locks or windows, I did notice until last year why my loan was paid off that they had changed my loan terms, so when I signed with new interest rate Also I’m paying interest for my loan with capital one. I thought I was so lucky and referred two people here. I hope that they go out of business just like mortgages people for lying and cheating to their customers. There service is terrible and molar warranty is a JOKE, don’t get it! Or the gas in tires! Don’t buy a car or refer people ",6,47,-1
33301,24-Apr-18,"If you are a bit scared of the whole 'buying a used car from a dealership' scenario, or intimidated about going to a place that sells cars and getting conned by a savvy knowledgeable used car salesman; Then have absolutely no fear when you come to HB Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram... Crap...( whatever else is in their name), you wont have to worry about encountering that at HB Jeep. If your intimidation stems from the thought of a savvy used car salesman and feeling dumb for not knowing basic information about how the whole car buying or financing process works dont worry none of these sales rep do either. Their salesman have absolutely zero and i mean zero knowledge about what it is that their doing there. Literally hire guys with zero experience, and does it show. Simplest questions such as ""What kind of insurance must i have to drive off the lot?"" is met with a face of confusion and followed with ""ummm... Im not.... let me find that out for you"". By the way that is how most inquiries are responded to. its either that or ""we'll go over that once we process it and find out ummmm.... im not quite sure"". Every question is answered though. ""Do you need proof of address?"" ...umm..im not quite sure.... let me find out.  ""Does the cosigner need to be here for me to apply?"".....we'll go over that once we process it and find out..... ""what are the terms of the financing company. what requirements must be met?""...... ummmmm.. I.... let me find out for you.. ""Do you have a bathroom?.... we'll go over that once we process it and find out. ""do you have a brain?"" im not quite..... let me find out for you...
Seriously save yourself the time the headache, the display of disrespectful grown men talking and acting like a bunch of school boys. Cussing in front of you and figuring out how insurance for a vehicle works.
I would be a bit more understanding about the sales rep they hire there but they are just as much at fault as HB Jeep is. I would not go apply in a field that i know absolutely nothing about. Nor would i hire someone who knows nothing about the product im selling. You dont see landscapers applying to be brain surgeons.  And the people they hire there to sell us cars are just that know-nothing guys. But I guess that is how much respect HB Jeep has for its consumers. I really wish these guys got more training other than how to log into their dealer website and more Customer Service training but from what i saw the lady conducting part of the training was more concerned with letting the new herd of dumb flesh know how much more dedicated she is to the company than anything else. Maybe instead of continuing to hire herd after herd they should spend the money and commission theyre giving to these guy on some real training for how to treat a customer and most of all on a legal team or someone with some understanding of how advertising works. I guess nobody really cares of or has heard that false advertising is a crime. And maybe theyre just that disconnected and dont think that a knowledgeable and apologetic rep would mean the difference between a frustrated understanding customer and a pissed off misled consumer filing a claim for false advertising. Get your xxxx together HB Jeep. You wont be in business much longer if your lawyers are as good as your sales rep ",6,47,-1

However, I soon find out that the old body shop manager I had been in Correspondence with left the company. So I assume the new body shop manager will probably come and talk to me instead. Nope, my new guy they had hired Steve, just blows me off when I try to introduce myself and shake his hand. Yet, the guy is too busy to even acknowledge my existence.  Then I look at my car and one side is darker in color than the other. They suggest to just ""buff it out"" and once it's in the sun the new paint will fade down to the old. So they're asking me to buff out the paint job they just did? I'm wondering why they're asking me to do their job after $8000 in repairs. In addition, I get in my car and drive home with a better indignation only to find out that my pants are soaked in oil from the seat. Apparently one of the mechanics leaked oil in my front driver seat, resulting in a new pair of pants ruined.

33307,05-Jan-18,"I purchased my vehicle here back in 2013 with extended warranty. I've had all mechanical work performed at this location. I took my vehicle over the holidays due to engine light going on, was told it was due to open thermostat which was not covered by warranty or extended warranty. When I asked why It was not covered under Federal Emissions warranty, the service provider simply stated it was not listed on computer and therefor not covered. Furthermore, he could not see how this would be an emission issue.  Their initial price for replacement and thermostat and flush was over $500.00. When I complained about their lack of adequate response for not being covered, no effort was made to provide me with proper response.  Furthermore, if I didn't have work done there, I would still be charged 150.00 dollars just for read the code.  They also suggested I get work done which had already been performed, i.e. tires.  When I informed them that I had recently purchased new tires, the response was ""well this is just stuff the computer prints outs as suggestions because of the miles""",6,47,11
33308,03-Jan-18,"First of all I had a bad experience with this dealership!! When I purchased my vehicle back in May 26,2017 I told them that the car didn't have gas and that they needed to put gas in it. When I told them too they said that they didn't do that there. I was furious because I drove all the way from Riverside to Huntington to get a Jeep. Therefore I had to put my own gas. My first purchased vehicle at a different dealership made sure to put a full tank. Even at the dealership where my boyfriend bought his RAM truck at BMW of Murrieta put a full tank of gas and it was a used vehicle too. I was so disappointed after that. Back in November 2017 when I had my first car service I went in for a regular oil change and maintenance check. When I get there to check in the representative tells me that my car had a recall and I'm thinking like 'DID THEY SELL ME A CAR THAT HAS A RECALL AND THEY ALREADY KNEW ABOUT IT!?' I kept asking the representative what kind of recall and he said it was a sticker from the VIN number that I was going to receive a letter in the mail. Till this day I have not received any letter! The recall is supposedly called a T12? I tried using google to see what a T12 recall meant and nothing came up. I even went on the website where you search up vehicles with recalls and my car did not show up at all. I was so confused at that point. I don't know what kind of dealership this is and what kind of service they hold but my car service was not completed. All the checkups that they supposedly did they obviously did not complete the job. I got a description of all the services they made and they checked off that they checked all the fluids in the vehicle. Lies! I dropped off the car with low washer fluid and I never refilled it because I knew I was getting the service and they were going to refill it. I get the car back and it still had low washer fluid. I know what to expect when it comes down to car services because Valvoline would walk me through it, even Valvoline has better service then this dealer! I tried to complain about it and they said that they forgot to reset it. I had my boyfriend check and they didn't refill anything! I contacted the dealership and gave them a review on their website but they obviously did not care to reach out. I am an unhappy customer.

On a Friday, I got an "" out the door"" price on
A new Jeep. I called back around 6pm.to confirm my appt. for Saturday morning. 
I arrived on time. They shuffled me through a couple of different sales people. First they told me the car was gone. Sold last night. No one called to let me know!. The sales mgr, acted like it was my job to call them in the morning,  to make sure it was there. Then they found a more expensive model , with options I did not want or need. I have them the sales price I was quoted , then came back about 90 minutes later. After 2 more hrs.,they finally appraised my trade in . The LOW BALL GAME!
I had researched the trade in value on numerous credible sites. They OFFERED ME NEXT TO NOTHING! OVER $5,000 LESS THAN IT WAS WORTH. This included a litany of stories. They also came back with a price on their vehicle much higher.. The real difference between what I was quoted and my experience, including trying to steal my trade in was some $9,000+.

The managers are very unprofessional and the sales team has no idea about anything they are doing. Usually when you go to a car dealership they try to be nice to you, and try to earn your business, they pretty much told me to get out when I called them out on their shady tactics. I offered to pay cash for the vehicle and they were not interested in that either. I would have been totally fine getting a loan through the dealer if it was a credit union, Ford financial, or any reputable loan company.

33323,29-Aug-17,"I went to HB Dodge to buy a Ram 1500. I was down to one vehicle in my family and needed to buy soon. After doing my research online, I walked in knowing exactly which stock numbers I was interested in. After meeting a salesman and relaying the trucks I wanted to see, it took 90 minutes just to get the vehicle from their offsite warehouse to the dealership. When it arrived I looked at it, then went back in to get the keys from my salesman, only to be told that it was already sold. Huge bummer, but I'm determined. My salesman recommended I go grab lunch and he would call me when my next choice was ready to view. After TWO HOURS and no phone call, I call him and he tells me it's ready but he forgot to call me. I return to the dealership and sit down to make a deal. My salesman was doing at least three other things and got up several times. He also was less than informed and had to ask his manager for the answer to every question I asked. I didn't appreciate being charged an additional $900 than the advertised price because I had already secured my own financing. They also refused to honor a Ram $500 military discount for which I qualified. The manager had an opportunity to smooth things over and step in to save his struggling salesman, but instead was rude and unapologetic. After several mistruths and an overwhelming feeling that I was not valued I stood up and left. Second best decision I made that weekend. The first was going to Orange Coast Dodge after I left HB to get my vehicle. ",6,47,83

It obviously took this site awhile to post.  To the readers researching this dealership, you can see by the owner's reply that he is rude and not concerned about his lack of customer service skills. I implore you to check out responses by other dealers.  Most don't use profanity, inflated egos and turn the blame on his disgruntled customers.  Again, I stand by my comment, that if I  can warn even 1 potential customer, it is worth the effort.  I believe customer service is extremely important.  This guy can't help but throw a tantrum every time someone complains.  Buyer beware and best of luck if you choose to go forward with a sale here.

I am just trying to understand any fees that i will be charged, which is a simple request.  The dealership states I need to physically visit the dealership.The only conclusion i can make is they want to charge extra dealer fees and the dealership does not want to expose any information that would risk killing the deal. They want me to come into dealership hoping you will just agree to the fees and buy the vehicle.  I am located 2+ hours from the dealership, so driving 2 hours to receive an OTD number is not a reasonable request. In buying 10+ cars over the last 20 years i have never dealt with such an unprofessional sales team. Why would you not provide a simple OTD itemized quote.

They ran my credit cards without my permission, contacted me from private numbers to handle their screw ups.

33361,14-Mar-17,"So let me start this review by suggesting that I have purchased a multitude of cars from various dealerships and manufacturers ranging from inexpensive to very expensive! Never have I ever encountered a more unprofessional, disorganized and wasteful entity in my entire life! I essentially spoon fed them a sale! I called early in the morning and spoke to Oscar (this gentlemen is the internet manager and judging by my experience with him, it's really no surprise that the organization is as horrendous as it is). I told Oscar what car I wanted to test drive, when I would be there and reiterated the importance of timeliness as I made a 2 hour commute to get to the facility. I had also prequalified for a loan and secured financing prior to my arrival. In addition I got my trade appraised, through their website, and had my pink slip in hand ready to make my purchase! When I arrived, on time might I add, I had to wait nearly 30 minutes for my sales rep to acknowledge my presence. Afterwards he took me to the vehicle I was going to purchase. It was unkept and filthy! All of this was of little consequence as the vehicle was being sold at a great price and the inherent value was present. As I went to test drive the vehicle Oscar realized that the dealership had lost the key to the vehicle. They initially thought they locked it inside and I had to help them POP THE LOCK! (As far fetched as this sounds I'm not making it up.) we spent nearly an hour popping the lock to find the key wasn't in the car! It took nearly two hours to get a locksmith to make a new key! Again I waited through this process kindly and patiently! Durning which time I waited in a dilapidated showroom that was clearly not being maintained from an aesthetic or functional perspective with one of the most unprofessional managers I've ever experienced. Yet still I waited trying to give the dealership the benefit of the doubt! As my visit approached the three hour mark I finally test drove the vehicle and came to agreeable financial terms. One would think that after the courtesy and patience I demonstrated the duration of my experience would be seamless...however you would be wrong! Another two hours past as I sat aimlessly waiting for this inefficient, disorganized, and unprofessional people to get together the paperwork for my purchase. They could not manage to do so. I arrived at the dealership at 6 pm and at 11:15 pm I decided that I would take my business elsewhere! When I told them to cancel the transaction I did not receive so much as an apology! Very frustrating experience! It is no wonder that this dealership and the entire Chrysler, Jeep, Dodge brand is going under! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME HERE!",6,47,0
33365,22-Feb-17,I had to talk to 3 different people online about getting the lease special. I told them what the lease special was and which vehicle I wanted. They told me to fill out the credit application which I did. Then they called me and said that vehicle is not in stock and tried to sell me something else twice the payment I was looking for. Thanks for wasting my time.,6,47,-1
33372,09-Feb-17,"The problem started when I first leased the car in November 2016, the advertised price was 24, 000 $, after we agreed on the terms and everything, we signed the contract, and the Finance manager, David Gold, told me that there is no need to read the contract, just sign it. After I went home, I read the contract and the Purchase price was 34,000$, not 24K. I went back and tried to resolve the issue and cancel the contract, they said they are ""Sorry"" about this mistake, but they can't cancel it because the car have already been sold. The next problem happened last monday. I received a call from the dealership. The person told me that I owed them money. I made all of my payments on time and have paper proof. They said that If I am not going to pay, I have to come over to the dealership to talk. Today, I drove 2 hours to get to the dealership, spent 4 hours there and drove another 3 hours back due to traffic. And the problem was not resolved. They had me drive all the way to give them a couple of papers where I could have just emailed them back. I then tried to trade in the car I bought for another one, but the new manager told me that I cannot do that, because I agreed to pay so much on the first car that I will have to lose so much money If I want to trade it in.

33412,18-Oct-16,"Huntington Beach Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram -- Deceptive, Dishonorable, Disappointing – DO NOT TRUST THEM! 
Having purchased vehicles from HB Jeep before, and having recommended them to many of my 940 clients over the years; I was EXTREMELY disappointed today in their lack of integrity – even after admitting they screwed up!
I saw them add for 2 vehicles I was looking for, contacted their sales person and made arrangements to purchase before the 1 ½ drive each way and verified the pricing!
Within 10 minutes of arrival, I noticed that the MSRP on the vehicle’s window sticker was significantly LOWER than what they said in them adds; making their discount less than advertised.  I pointed this out to the salesman, who said – “I’ve never seen this happen before.  My apologies.  I’m sure my manager will honor the error.”  I mentioned that maybe the other vehicle was correct; sad to say, it too had the same deceptive error.  What are the odds!  If you’ve ever bought from them, you were probably quietly screwed too.
1 ½ hours later, after having most all the work completed to purchase the vehicle; the manager admitted the error; but, said that “in small print, it says if a mistake is made, we don’t honor them”.
I’m an employer, if my employee makes an error – I will do my best to honor it and serve the client.  They admitted the error but was unwilling to make even a ONE-dollar adjustment towards the $1,000 error.
Thus, they went from being a vendor I would recommend to a deceptive, dishonorable dealer.  I would suggest that you avoid them.  HONOR DOESN’T MATTER IN POLITICS; but, it should matter in business!

33415,16-Oct-16,"EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED in how this dealership handled customer service.
After TWO WEEKS, our brand new Jeep that we bought at this dealership would not start. This was disappointing in itself, but my review is based on how inadequate the situation was handled. 

When the car did not start on a Saturday night, I tried to contact the dealership but found that not many people were there, which was understandable. I left a message with Tom Cruz, the sales manager, and I left two messages with Jacob Jacobo, the man that helped us buy the car. I also left a general voicemail with the receptionist that night for ANYONE to get back to me. 

I received no calls back the next day, so I left a separate message with each of the men above another message with a different sales manager, and another message with the receptionist again for anyone to get back to me. I had to have the car towed TWICE from one dealership that was the closest to me, then to Huntington Beach. This was covered under warranty, but essentially our day was gone while we waited four hours to get the car to the dealer. 

My husband and I work in San Diego, and we needed to get into a rental or something to get back and thankfully, the service department helped us with that, which is why this review is in my opinion worth one star (even if there is no option for zero stars). Although our car was not in the dealership's possession, they put us into a rental, but this would bite us in the butt later since we didn't get paperwork for the mileage coming in.

We still did not receive any correspondence back, after FOUR days, and after leaving voicemails every day with the receptionist, it was finally ridiculous and I sent an email to Tom and Jacob. Then Tom emailed me back right then and there and told me that him, and his whole team were out, and this was why no one had contacted us. I find that extremely hard to believe because the day before the receptionist let me know that Jacob had been in, but left early. After telling Tom this via email, I hadn't heard back from him, and still haven't. 

My Jeep was ready after almost two weeks of being in the service department, and while I appreciated that our car was worked on, when we got our car back there was almost 200 extra miles on the car. Now we did not have the paperwork as I mentioned with our situation of the car not being in when we received the rental. But the service department gave us the invoice letting us know the car came in at 1420 miles, which it did not, had been driven 5 miles to check if it worked, and it says that we received the car back with 1426 miles on it. However, we have pictures that our car came out at 1423 miles. Something wasn't right, and this whole situation was just wrong in the first place. 

I would caution everyone about coming here. It was not only disappointing, but just upsetting and a huge hassle that no one should have to deal with when buying a new car.",6,48,1491
33437,21-Sep-16,"This is regarding my experience with Dodge Huntington Beach... I was sold a certified pre-owned Dodge Challenger RT. The sales process was smooth, I don't really have any complaints about that. However, being a first time buyer, I was unaware that the dealership is required to give you a copy of the supposed 125 point inspection. Within 3 months of purchasing the vehicle, while driving down the freeway with my wife, we heard a loud 'clunk"" sound. That was the left radius arm coming out (think of it as a ball and socket joint) I got the vehicle home and had it towed to the dealership. While at the dealership, the service tech told me they would not likely get to my car that day and offered a loaner car, I accepted his offer. I get a call from the service tech the following day, demanding I return the loaner car. He proceeded to tell me over the phone that the type of damage was not covered and therfore, I was not approved to have it. Then he explained that the radius arm was damaged and/or broken and all 4 tires were bald. Also, there were missing nuts and bolts. I asked what could ha e caused this type of damage? He could not give me a definitive cause, he resorted to mere speculation. That it must be due to negligent driving. I have a 6 year old daughter that wants to go with me everywhere. To the fathers out there, you know what I'm talking about. There is no way in xxxx, that I would risk my daughters life, driving in such a manner. I reviewed the Carfax that was given to me, the previous owner was in a minor accident to the front, no further details. This was not disclosed to me at the time of purchase, which is my fault, I'm told the dealer is not required to reveal that to me. However, for the sales rep. to tell me that is has not been in any accidents, that's a different story. The Carfax report also shows the previous owner had all 4 tires replaced, then oddly enough, he had all 4 replaced only after putting less than 4,000 miles on the new pair. This is a 5 year old car, but it only had 16,xxx miles on it. Why would he replace the tires only after 4,000 miles on the new pair? Why did my tires go bald only after putting 9,000 miles on them before I had it towed to the dealership? I researched it and a suspension issue would cause early wear on the tires. What was affecting the vehicle when the original owner had it,  is clearly affecting my vehicle still. I pointed out all of this to the service tech. I purchased an extended warranty contract from them at the time of purchase. I contacted them, they told me to have the dealership call, to start the process. I asked the service tech to call, I waited 3 days, still nothing from the extended warranty company. I called the service tech to see if he had called. He said he hadn't, cuz he said he knew they wouldn't cover it. Well, I didn't know he had the right to make that decision. He agreed to call but it sounded like it bothered him to do so. They were no help at all. Finally, I get a car from Patrick, the rep. who the extended warranty company sent out. The dealership did not even make me aware that he came out to inspect the vehicle. Patrick told me that they could not cover the repairs due to they don't cover missing parts. He further explained to me, the missing nuts and bolts mentioned earlier, did not appear to be sheared off. Indicating, that someone forgot to put them on or did not put them on correctly. Patrick told me to ask the dealer how did this get missed on the certified pre-owned inspection? I pointed this out to the service tech and to the manager. I did not hear one response from them. While Patrick and I reviewed the Carfax so I could point out the original owner replacing the tires after only putting 4,000 miles on his new pair. His copy of the Carfax did not show this on the history. His copy just showed they were balanced. How does this type of pertinent information, that would be favorable for the dealership be taken out of the Carfax history? Now, the service tech changed it from we don't cover the type of damage, to my vehicle was out of the warranty period. My argument is that the problem existed before the time of purchase. All the things I pointed out clearly show that. The dealership has given me speculation with no definitive cause. They still would not cover the repairs. They still haven't. Mind you, what I mentioned wasn't a fast process. This is about 4 months after I brought in my vehicle. I'm paying for a car, I haven't been able to use. It was only out of the warranty period,  less than a month. You would think they would cover the repairs for a disabled Iraq veteran, after I pointed all of this out. I explained to them that I was a disabled veteran and I deserved better treatment from them, instead of being ignored for months. They didn't acknowledge this at all.",6,48,1657
33451,01-Sep-16,"DERRICK IN SERVICE TRIED TO SCAM ME FOR $800

I brought my vehicle into HB for Transmission service 5 days ago . 
the day after the service I noticed my vehicle was leaking fluid. (it has never leaked before) 
I called made and appointment with derrick yesterday . today he acted like I never called or spoke with him . 
  Derrick diagnosed my leak  as "" the gasket around the oil pan is leaking."" he said there was dirt caked around the oil pan on the edges holding in the oil . some of the dirt shook loose and now its leaking . he quoted me $ 800 . I told him that diagnosis does not sound accurate. I drive on the freeway . I don't drive through dirt for it to get caked up . I took my keys and went inside to talk to the General manager.   I waited for 10 minutes. Derrick came to me and said he wanted to put my car in the air and show me the dirt .. I said ok .. he took my car back and I am waiting for 20 minutes while its in the air.. finally I go back to see what is going on .. I then see derrick and the mechanic looking all under my car with flashlights and talking about where the leak could be coming from.. 

derrick comes back to me and says. 
"" well maybe the leak is coming from the top"" let me lower it and look. they lower it and look. 

then derrick says well maybe the leak is this.... we need to take some stuff apart to find out what is going on .. 

then derrick has the nerve to say I am looking at him like he does not know what he is talking about  . and he has been in the business 25 years and this is what he needs to do to diagnose my vehicle. 

I told him he is right I am looking at him like he does not know what he is talking about 

45 minutes ago he diagnosed my vehicle and quoted me 800 for repairs.. 

when I wanted to talk to management HE came back to ME and said he would SHOW ME the dirt caked up ect.... but once the car was in the air . he COULD NOT SHOW ME THE AFFORE MENTIONED DIRT WHICH HAD CAKED UP AND WHICH WOULD COST 800$ TO REPAIR . HE needed to look into it further when im under the car saying WHERE IS THE DIRT ?? 


this man Derrick totally tried to scam me.. I was at the dealership for 3 hours and I still do not know what or why my car is leaking . I purchased a jeep Laredo and a jeep patriot fromt his dealership and they  tried to scam me.


DERRICK TRIED TO SCAM ME WITH A 800$ DIAGNOSIS. TOLD ME HE WOULD SHOW ME THE DIRT UNDER THE CAR AND WHEN I WAS UNDER THE CAR WITH HIM LOOKING THE ENTIRE STORY CHANGED AND IT NEEDS FURTHER DIAGNOSIS..

33524,18-Apr-16,"Found my dream car and drove up from San Diego, had preapproved loan in hand just needed to verify it was the car I wanted.   After waiting an hour to get appraisal, finally got into finance, I was assured final dealer prep would be done before I got and finance wouldn't take that long, wrong on both.  Even though my bank had instructions for EFT finance insisted I needed a cashiers check, I told the finance guy this was the 4th car I had purchased with this bank and never had they given me a check.  He also didn't know how to use their touch screen system, which is supposed to speed things up, it didn't, had to bring in another finance guy to show him.  Spent well over an hour in finance and was now in my 4th hour overall.  Well at least my car would be done...it wasn't, also prior to going into finance I had requested the my personalized tags and tire valve stems be put in my new car...finally the salesman brought the car out after another hour of waiting, now well into my 5th hour at dealership.  The salesman said he had to do the prep, even though the car is gorgeous still had stickers and some marks on window, but now I was just ready to leave.   The tags and valve stems weren't in the new car either, even though I asked...got on the road with less then 1/4 tank of gas, my wife said just go, we were starving so went across street to grab some dinner before starting back to San Diego.  Got call from salesman, he still had tags, still trying to be cheerful went back and grabbed them, asked him about a tank of gas and he said they had to cut back....so it wasn't an oversight, I just spent $60k on a car and they don't even give you a full tank of gas!  I was now in my 7th hour at dealer, figured I should just be happy and get on road...

2 weeks later I notice that HBD still hadn't paid off my bank for trade, even though they had already sold the car.  My wife called to sort out the problem and almost immediately the finance guy started yelling at her...she asks for his supervisor and he wouldn't let her talk either...I get on the phone and he tells me they have 13days by law to mail the check and they mailed a check on the 13th day, I asked why this wasn't brought up in finance and they basically accused me of lying, when I told him we had been assured they process it in'a couple of days'...could hardly get a word in and by now the conversation was becoming more heated...

33609,06-Aug-15,"I went to the dealership to buy a vehicle yesterday. I called before making the 3 hour drive to confirm the vehicle was still available. I also told them I was buying it and asked if they would hold it for me if I made the drive. Tom told me they don't normally do that but would ask his manager. He put me on hold a minute and came back saying that his manager approved it. They would hold the vehicle for me to purchase if I drove down that day. I take off work early and head that way immediately. I arrive there and we immediately sit down to go through the numbers to make the purchase. Keep in mind, I agreed to the purchase price of the vehicle before making the trip. I did not haggle with pricing at all. It was the price on the front window which was a decent price for this vehicle. They run my credit which is approx 800 credit score and I'm approved for the loan amount. I'm also putting 7500 cash down. I decline their extended warranty that they continued to push on me. After declining that, there is still 2k in hidden fees according to the length of the loan, monthly payment, and the interest rate they are giving me. I could of used my own financing but wanted it to go smoothly as it was late in the day and my bank was closed. I agreed to the 5% which I knew I could refinance in a few months with Chase @ 1-2%. They wouldn't show me the total and were playing the normal sales hidden numbers game. I ask one question - the break down of the fees. I never get this. After sitting around waiting, Tom comes back and tells me he cannot make the deal because the vehicle just sold! We are in the middle of a contract and they sale it? They failed to tell me they were doing two contracts at the same time for the same vehicle! They wasted 7.5 hours of my time and did not keep their word. If you cannot hold a vehicle, say so. If you tell someone you will hold it; keep your word. Why waste my time, get a bad review, and run my credit if you are going to sale it to someone else after promising to hold it?

33642,02-Apr-15,"I must tell you, In the collection of automobiles that I've purchased - this  car buying experience was the worst that I've ever had. 

 

I initially inquired about a Ram truck online, and was contacted by Robert Bauer. I spoke to him on the phone and by email a couple of times and made an appointment to see him. I arrived at our scheduled meeting time, and he wasn't in yet. I waited about a half hour and he finally arrived, I introduced myself and he had no clue what I was interested in or seemingly who I was. He finally pulled up my info and proceeded to find my truck - I waited another half hour. He took me for a test drive, and when I inquired about the air suspension option and standard warranties he said that I really didn't need those options. After the test drive, we went inside to discuss price and an already lackluster experience spiraled out of control. I told him what I thought the truck was worth, he was offended and said that the dealership was already discounting it. So I tried to get an out the door price from him and he said that he couldn't do that till I was in finance. I explained that part of my decision making process was knowing the finance options , and he retorted by pressuring me to make a decision. I said that I wouldn't make a decision without the numbers in front of me and I didn't like his sales tactic. I said that we were done and he told me to take his card - and that ""you'll be back""

Fast forward two days -  I was still very dissatisfied with the experience at the dealership, but I decided that I would give it another go. I asked to speak to a manager and got Nick Farber. I explained the situation and he said that he would take care of me personally and try to make the situation better. I asked for an out the door price and he said that was against company policy.  I made an appointment with him for 9:30 AM on Friday March 27th. He called me later that day and said that he would be tied up in a meeting and wouldn't be available till 10:30, I agreed and appeared at the dealership as agreed. When I spoke tot he receptionist, she told me that Nick wasn't there, finally another manager told me that he wasn't in yet that morning and wouldn't be in till noon. At that point I was pretty irritated because he had blown my appointment off - I was told that Dan would be helping me in Nick's absence. Dan had no clue about the situation, so I had to explain everything all over again. I had secured financing with my credit union and had decided to go that way, I asked Dan to get me an out the door price so that I could make a decision. He told me that I would need to fill out a credit application so that he could take it to his manager before he could get me an out the door price. I went round and round with him, and explained that since I already had approved financing I just needed to know what the final price was going to be! He came back by telling me that I was being difficult, and that he thought that we were done. I was furious, and raised my voice. Another manager came over, and I asked to speak to the sales manager - after about 5 minutes Danny came over and spoke to me. He agreed that I didn't need to do a complete credit application since I was using my own financing. He got me an out the door price with all the incentives that were available, and I hesitantly agreed to make the purchase. 

He then sent me to Tom Cruz' office to complete the paper work. Tom had no idea who I was or what was going on, again I had to explain the situation and waited for them to get things together. Soon after that Nick Farber arrived, and took over the process- I was not happy at all by then. 

Finally, I went into the finance manager's office and explained that I was very frustrated and would like to make this as quick as possible. I explained that I wanted NO extras, however he proceeded to try to hard sell me an extended warranty, paint / interior protection, a maintenance plan, alarm, etc. I explained that I wasn't interested, and he persisted, and I lost it. I ended up signing the papers and getting out of your dealership as quickly as possible. 

In good conscience I could not suggest this dealership to anyone nor would I be likely to purchase from them again. It seems that customer service is the last priority at this dealership, and that hard selling / sleazyness is the corporate culture. If I'm contacted by Ram, I will let them know what my experience was like and how dissatisfied I still am with it. ",6,48,-1

He said he could do nothing. He would be losing money. He is the epitome of the sleezy used car dealers. No wonder they have such  bad reputations. I have spoken to several mechanics since then and all of them agree I should not have needed new brakes after only 2 months.

33657,18-Feb-15,"Called and e-mailed concerning a new 2014 Jeep Cherokee, was assured the car was still available.  Upon arrival at the dealership, I was informed the gentleman I was communicating with was busy and Tom Cruze gave me John Dreyer to help me.  John said the Cherokee was at their offsite storage area and drove me to that lot and proceeded to frantically look for the Jeep finally giving up in what seemed to be forever as I was standing among all of these dirty dusty vehicles in an unpaved parking area.  John was kind enough to allow me to drive another Cherokee back to the dealership so I could at least access whether I wanted a 4 cylinder Cherokee.  Back at the dealership he again began trying to locate the vehicle and somehow determined that is was at another lot and someone had disabled the GPS system the dealership uses to keep track of the vehicles.  Well, he finally got the vehicle to show me which was caked with dust and the wheels looked like it had been doing some off-roading.  This all took over an hour and a half and I had to leave for another appointment.  I called John when I got home and arranged for an appointment at 10 am the next day to perhaps close the deal on the car, he assured me the Cherokee was still available and someone would be there to appraise my trade-in.  Arrived at 10 am, John was there but no Cherokee, so he ran off to find it again.  I sat cooling my heels for 30 minutes and finally sent him a text to find out what in the world was going on.  He informed me he could not get in the gate at the offsite lot and was waiting for someone to open it - he said "" we just opened and I should understand that with over 2000 new cars, it is hard to keep track of them etc, etc"". I sent him another text to see if the trade-in could be looked at while I was waiting and was informed by John that he could not locate the used car guy.  I waited another 20 minutes and then left.  What I do not understand is why he did not arrange to have the vehicle ready and detailed for me to look at seeing that I showed a genuine interest in buying it and had made an appointment.  Called another dealer on the way home and inquired about a similar vehicle, it was at the dealer when I arrived 15 minutes later, even though the salesman had to go off site to get it.",6,48,282
33683,18-Nov-14,"A used car was posted online at $17899.  We went to buy the vehicle and low and behold the numbers were not adding up.  We know that on average tax/license fees total to approx 10% of purchase price.  This salesperson kept quoting about $2700-$3000 of closing costs which didn't make sense.  So when we were working the numbers out it just didn't make sense.  We asked to see the workout sheet and when it arrived the taxes, doc fees, registration all added up correctly but we couldn't figure out why the price was about $1000 over what we were adding up.  Then in a little line item directly under the price that is advertised for this vehicle online, was a weird term ""aftermarket"" and $774 added to the price of the vehicle.  So be very wary of buying anything from this underhanded used sales deparment.  We even asked the salesman to explain the line item and he blew us off and basically said he had tried his best!  I think they could be held liable for false advertising but I would rather pay $1000 more anywhere else, than wait forever to be messed around with.",6,48,-1
33759,25-Apr-14,"This was the worse vehicle purchasing experience that I've ever had. I went in and drove a new Durango RT based on an ad at a specific sale price. The salesman and finance guys negotiated the deal, sale price and payment terms on a car that I'd never even seen or driven. The claim is that there was a mix up with the inventory ID. All of a sudden the car that I drove was NOT the one in the ad. The one I drove was more expensive of course and had AWD. The dealer in attempt to ""make things right"" insisted on working to match the deal as close as possible on the car that I drove. It suddenly became a numbers game on the monthly payment amount in attempt to meet close to the payment amount and terms that was originally pitched on the car with less features. Consequently, I ended up with a car that was out of scope of what we originally planned for the purchase. We were handed of to 3 different salesmen during this process, which made it even more of a unnerving experience. It was a completely confusing and misleading process from the car to the warranty, where the finance guy uses the misleading terms that the warranty covers ""everything"" for as long as you own the car. Lifetime warranty, yes, but it doesn't cover everything. ",6,48,-1

I wanted to pay cash for a jeep patriot and pick it up in 5 days. I got the complete run around from these clowns. For some odd reason me paying cash had to be approved. Everyone I talked too talked over me and did not listen. How many times did I have to say I did not need financing? Well atleast 10 because no one listens. How many times was I told I do not matter? In many ways atleast 5.They basically treated me like trash because I was not there to pick up the vehicle TODAY.  They stated we have customers here now and your not. I ended up purchasing from Van Nuys Dodge along with another new vehicle that my son happen to see Van Nuys was a good dealer and took the very little time required to complete the deal. 

Do yourself a favor if you want to be treated like a human being and be heard do not buy a vehicle from Huntington Beach Dodge. The whole experience was a nightmare.How can you screw up a easy cash deal. I wire you the money and pick up the vehicle in 5 days. Why is that so difficult? 

Why did the sales manager Sean pass me off to a new sales person that had no clue about anything? Because they don't care.If you want more information on this horrible dealer email me @kenronni@yahoo.com. if you want first class service and a great experience call Dennis Dillon Dodge and have your vehicle delivered they have the best prices in the country and will make any transaction easy and take the time to LISTEN to your needs.

Talked to dealer the next morning...""No problem-we will take care of you"" well a few days later I did take our jeep in with about 126 miles and the service manager did hear it very clearly and of course our salesman said ""I dont hear anything""and walked away. WOW is that how they that take care of you? We have purchased 3 new jeeps from this sales guy in 2 years!   A 2011 Rubi Unlimited, A 2013 Rubi Unlimited and this 2013 Rubi 2 door.

If the jeep was making that sound when we test drove it NO WAY we would have bought it. So the dealer has turned their backs on us!  WOW!  over  $100,000. we spent there and this is how they """"NO Problem- We will take care of you"""" Please buy from another dealer - no car is made perfect, but this is how they treat a GOOD returning customer. Salesmen- Rob Trachman. and Service Manager is Rick B. I mean these guys really looked me in the eye and said that they would take care of me..........right.

34022,12-Sep-06,"BEWARE!

I had such high hopes for this dealership. Nice website, responded to my e-mail inquiry, etc, etc.  Not so!

Came on the lot with a 2002 Range Rover ready to trade.  My buddy and I got onto the lot where two saleman actually saw us and turned the other way.  We were to meet a salesman who does their internet sales who I can only describe as a scrawney pale Martin Short look-a-like with too much mouse in his hair making him look like ""The Heat Miser"" from that old Christmas show.  But I digress.

We came in our casual t-shirt and jeans and they treated us like dirt which is funny because we both work in the film industry (Director and Photographer respectively) and I plan on telling everyone I know to stay away from this dealership.  Simply rude and they assumed we were dumb enough to fall for their ""very slick"" sales techniques.  

Tried to sell us a car with a damaged front and rear and all they said was ""so do you want to buy it?""  Yeah buddy, I want to by your damaged goods and pay WAY over Blue Book.  They forget they're selling a Jeep, not a Lexus.

The Internet sales guy didn't even take the time to show us the car.  He pawned us off to what I can only describe as ""Cousin It's"" moronic brother who kept calling us ""bro' and drilled me with so many questions that I finally had to tell him to be quiet so I could listen to the ""clicking sound"" the car made as I drove it.

When i wanted to see any other inventory, they took us ""out back"" and showed us a Grand Cherokee that was not only filthy but looked like it had been caught in a flood.  I laughed until my buddy pointed to the License Plate on the car and it was from ""Louisiana"".  Katrina Salvage anyone?

I have to say, once we were going to walk off the lot, the ""original"" sales guy ran out and tried to wheel and deal, but by then I was so disgusted we politely excused ourselves and left.  Later we looked at each other and thought, here was a great example of why car dealers get such a bad rap.  The type of place that makes you want to take a shower afterwards.

I understand people have to make a living and people need to sell, but you don't have to be a jerk about it.  There are too many other dealerships that you don't have to subject yourself to the indignity of one like Huntington Beach Jeep.  Yeah guys, your ""Monkey in the Trunk"" logo fits you perfectly!

I made it clear that I was NOT applying for one yet, but gave them my information, so they could do the credit check in order to get interest rates.

well, I get this call that said, ""Congratulations, we found you a loan, you can pick up your car!"" I said ""what? You were just supposed to be getting me figures!"" Of course, the figure was too high, and by then I was most unhappy that they had secured a loan without my permission.

He then proceeded to take me to his boss which I'm guessing runs this poorly managed lot and that was even worse because he wouldn't even acknowledge what I was saying. His counterarguments were ""I didn't drag you in here you came to us"" and ""I should stop complaining because I'm going to make my girlfriend feel bad about the deal and I should be supporting her instead"". Who in the world is he to tell me that? These individuals have no integrity or customer service values needed to run a successful business.

I chose to go to this place over Pacific Honda, because it was closer and more convenient for me to get to.

Unfortunately, they were the same transponder code - meaning they did not reprogram the car... they simply did what was cheapest and easiest for them.

To add insult to injury we were chased to our car and yelled at by a sales manager telling us to take the car.  He screamed four times that the car was ours and he was going to leave it on the curb (they have possession of both the car and the keys.)  Then he threatened that he would ruin my 87 year old mother's credit.  I informed him that she (a widow) had paid cash.  He said we were taking this (our simple key issue) too far.

I was irate for his total lack ,of people skills,and quite frankly somewhat amazed that he would let me walk without making the purchase. When I told him fine than I wouldn't buy the car, he put a gentleman named James Dunning on the phone. Mr. Dunning tried to make excuses, that possibly Mike didn't understand what I was asking him, and apologize for Mike's lack of professionalism, and courteousy, but my mind was already made up about him he was a total JERK.

34602,09-Mar-12,I used the Costco program and I was never even asked for my Costco card. I was not shown a sheet that showed a Costco discount instead they told me some formula used on CPO cars.  Once the papers were signed I was sent on my way with out being shown how any of the technology on my car worked. I was not given an owners manual or even a tank of GAS! They gave me the car with just enough gas to get home! It was awful.  I won't go back.  Oh I am a single woman and I guess they felt they didn't have to treat me very well. ,6,49,1082
34632,14-Sep-11,"I had emailed to get a quote on a new Kia Sportage.  We decided to test drive and if we liked to purchase.  Frank said if he was not available to ask for Jennifer.  When my husband called both were out but there would be someone to help us and the car was still available.  

We arrived at the Kia dealer and the first red Sportage they showed us was not the car with the quote but they would find it for us. We could test drive this one. After 2 tries at trying to get the car started the salesperson gave up and went to look for another Red Sportage which was on the Honda Lot.  We took that out for a quick test drive. The car was ok and had plenty of room. 

When we got back the salesperson kept saying this is not the car from your quote we can't find it but we will.  So we waited and I was getting very irritated at this point.  What poor service all around.  Then the salesperson said he would check on the price we could get this sportage but he would have to see his manager.  OK now we have to play the stupid manager game.  He came back with a quote of $22995 which we had a internet price on a similar vehicle for $21,695.  Now I know I asked for a $24,400 red Sportage but he said there was no way the would sell a $24,400 car for $21,695. He said the internet departments only job was to get customers in not to quote them. Excuse me didn't it say get a quote right online?  

Well we just walked away. Went to Nissan, purchase a cute little Juke and drove away in our $24,000 car.  

The bottom line here is we were willing to go to $22,00 but did not want to play the game.  You lost a customer and you lost any of our future business.  It is really true what they say about a happy person really doesn't share with that many people but someone that is unhappy shares with many. So no I won't be buying a car from Ball Automotive Group and I sure won't be recommending them to anyone.

34641,02-Jul-11,"Referred to your dealership by COSTCO and was expecting costco prearranged pricing for the car I was looking for. Test drive went fine, Jose was very helpful in the process. We sat down while Bernard was attempting to locate the car we were looking for. When I asked what the costco price was for the car I was interested in, he told me that the costco pricing for the CRV had been ""cancelled"" due to high demand and low inventory brought on by the Japan tsunami. If I had known their was no costco pricing, I would never have driven across town to your dealership when there is one practically in my backyard here in Chula Vista. Great Bait and Switch tactic. When I called Costco why they sent me to a dealership whose prearranged pricing had been ""cancelled"", they were just as confused because they were not aware of the ""cancellation"". I think Ball Honda was just trying to squeeze a little bit more profit. Well good luck because you will not see me in your dealership again (plus I will tell as many friends and neighbors about your scam).",6,49,150

We finally came to Ball Honda and fell in love with the 2009 Honda Fit!  It really is a great car.  It's not so much that the people are messed up directly to your face here at this particular dealer, it's just that there are people there who seem to have no pride about their work.  Rich Reinbach was a manager and he was actually very caring, but I don't envy his job at all.  He works with people who seem to either have no integrity or are so blind to their incompetence that they just keep working there with no problems.  There were a number of issues we had with this dealer that made us furious and my wife normally does not get angry easily.  First of all, the sales person was ambiguous on which car we'd actually be driving home.  Minor, but these things add up.  When we went inside the room to sign papers, we asked that we change the credit card to be swiped because we remembered that that card was near its max. We wrote the new credit card info on the paper and he said he'd take care of it. The guy ended up swiping the wrong card anyways causing us to have to pay a overcharge fee.  The dealer didn't do anything to compensate.  Then when we drove the car home, the antenna on the car was missing and I noticed that there were some paint chips near the door handle.  The detailing on the car was poor quality too.  At this point, my wife is already regretting we came to this dealer.  I call the dealer and he says to come by and pick up the antenna and tries to tell me that we don't really need.  The radio would work out without it.  I listen to mostly AM radio stations, and I do NEED it!!!  That day I'm supposed to drive there ( I swear I'm not making this up) my battery dies!  I realized that my headlights were on for about an hour accidentally.  But this should be a new battery!!!  How could the battery die within an hour of the headlights being on!!!!  So I take responsibility for that, but my suspicion was that the battery was not as new as I thought.  I call the dealer to explain all that's happened to us, and all he says is...   ""Come in for a free car wash!!!""  I DONT'T WANT A FREE CAR WASH!!! I want compensation for the overcharge fee on the credit card and a car that has all the accessories on it when I purchase it, scratch free with a brand new battery!!!!  You already failed on that.  He made no further attempts to appease me and I never heard form the dealer again.  We regret coming here.",6,49,-1

Car was NOT COMPLETELY DETAILED and showed a lack of ""Attention to Detail"".  Body shop also demonstrated a lack of ""Attention to Detail"" by not correcting ""agreed to"" paint damage.

Another salesman was not totally truthful when questioned about which fluids & filters had been replaced.  And a sales manager tried to convince me a large dent on the roof (close to the moon roof) was there upon agreement to buy?  Both were wrong!

I had changed one on another of my cars in the past and it was an easy job. They quoted me over $750 to change a part held on by two screws near the top of the engine! Unbelievable!

They told me that since it was an after market product it was not their concern, but it was utterly ridiculous because everything from that car was bought from the dealership.

We were moving from Hawaii to Albuquerque, NM and needed a car to drive our family from CA to NM when we landed. Because of the reputation Lexus and Lexus Certified Pre-Owned vehicles have, we purchased it sight unseen. We landed in CA got a ride from a family member to the Lexus dealership to pick up our new vehicle. Literally walked around the vehicle for one minute, went in and signed papers. Moments later drove it across country. When we got to NM I had to wash the vehicle and this is when the issues arouse. The car had significant repairs to both back and front bumpers (never disclosed). Whoever covered up the issues used a slightly off colored paint, painted over the parking sensors, over spray on the taillights, mud flaps, and luggage protectors. The texture is horrible, when you get underneath the car you can see paint drips from excessive paint. On the front of the car, the same exact issues, paint over the parking sensors, paint on the accent lights and a cracked grill. Lexus of Santa Monica refuses to make this right. They will not cover any of the costs to get it corrected, rather they want me to drive to CA and maybe they will take care of it. I am stuck fitting the bill for something that Lexus should have corrected immediately.

This is just the beginning, the windshield wipers were not adjusted correctly and were hotting the windshield pillar, there are massive transmission issues that have creeped up, and the tailgate does not lift automatically. Yes these items can be corrected over warranty, but the underlying story is that the Service Department did not do their jobs or did them extremely poorly.

I have so many bad things  to say about this place! But what is the point!  .... Take my advice Go Some Where Else! 

This is only one of many problems I had with this place.  

I had my coils changed on my car... (this is my first visit since I moved back to LA) let me add the service person  who originally help me was horrible. Left me standing there... told me he would be right back... and forgot about me.. I had to get out my car and ask for help! 😳

Let me fast forward... I got my car back... 1 month later I needed to get my oil changed.. I was talking to my husband ... I just so happen to pull up on the lever to open the hood cause he wanted to check the oil stick... and the lever was broke! Lexus was the last one with the car .. so I brought back in. They said it was minor and they would reattach it. I waited 15 or so minutes... they said it was fix... I believe them and left.. when I got home my husband ask if it was fixed.. I said... they fix it ... he said....did you check.. I said ....no.. I pull the lever ... it was the same! Nothing done! 

Ok... I was beyond mad... this Place is a 20 minute drive on the freeway one way.. I called to tell them it wasn’t fixed.. I was told to leave a message on my service person phone cause he was busy... I told The service lady .....I was on the way back.. and I better have someone take care of it cause I was mad as xxxx.

35297,12-Mar-18,"The Santa Monica, CA Lexus dealer and Corporate Executive Office, REFUSE to replacement panels due to employee mishandling of order. I first made contact with Lexus of Santa Monica in October of 2016, regarding the panels with Service Assistant Victor Jimenez, he told me to come in for an inspection and told me it would be a while until the panels came in because the factory in Japan was running slow and he already had a customer who had been waiting several months. He told me to call in and check with him every three months or so, and I did exactly that. I would leave voicemails and he would call me back most of the time. Every time we spoke he would give me an update mentioning some customers were waiting over a year, and the factory delayed and at times halted production, and he would call whenever the panels arrived. I called in on 2-19-18, and asked to speak with Victor and was told he was no longer works with Lexus of Santa Monica. A woman needed Lorraina Flores, took the phone call, she very quickly told me there was no record of the panel being ordered their system, I replied no way there must be some mistake I have been speaking to Victor about this for order a year now. Lorraina replied there were was no order in the system and there was no text communication regarding the replacement. I was shocked and asks why would I have texted him about the replacement, I only text him when I was bringing the card in for service there was an issue and it just so happened that we discussed the replacement over the phone and in person and I didn't think I needed to document the conversation because the car has had several recalls and I have had them all and never had a problem, I would have never foreseen something like this. Lorraina also told me she was unable to contact Victor and insinuated I was not the only person this has happened to, she then told me I could reach out to corporate office where I was given the complete run-around for about a month. I first spoke with several customer experience representatives a woman named Cassy then it was ""escalated"" to Brook Malacen, then it was ""escalated"" to Marion on 2/21/18 and finally ended with Executive Corporate Office, a very koi and dismissive woman named Lindsey Tor, who told me there is nothing she can do and it is not a corporate problem the best thing I could do is to call the dealer back.

What do I do? Do I sue Lexus?

Being that the car is a 2010 with an extended warranty, I was told they needed to further test it and would call me when it was ready.  Over the course of 5 weeks, Victor somewhat communicated with me via text. I had left several phone messages and zero was returned.

It is Lexus’ job to notify me and provide me with updates as to when the vehicle will be ready.  It's not my job to keep following up.   Angel was my guy in the past and nobody compares to Angel, except for Douglas, who I was informed is no longer there, as well. In addition to the horrible and unacceptable customer service, my gas tank was on ""Reserve"" when I got it back. This leads me to believe someone drove my car without my authorization while it was SUPPOSEDLY being serviced.  In addition to an empty tank, my car had three VERY obvious dings and marks that were not there before.  I called Daniel Cabrerra again, and never received a call back to resolve my issues that Lexus Service Department created.

35492,29-Jun-17,"My husband and I have been excellent, loyal customers for over 15 years and have leased 6 expensive cars from Lexus Santa Monica. 

Our salesman, Ron Holbrook, has never had to ""sell"" us a car. We've always called him a couple of months prior to the end is the lease to arrange for the next model. We are easy, no problem, customers who have never missed or been late on a payment. 

Ron has always encouraged us to turn in the lease a month or so early and they would ""take care"" of the last payment of the old lease. We know, it's, most likely, been wrapped into the new lease payment but we never complained. 

Last April, we received a 3 payment waiver offer from Lexus.  Ron told us to bring the car in about a month before the end of the lease for the best deal. There was, as always, 1 payment due on the old lease. Of course, the word from Ron was, ""we'll take care of it"".  Not to mention, we had the 3 payment waiver offer. Whatever that really means. 
Lexus Santa Monica took our old car, we signed the new lease papers and we were finished. 

4 months later, we receive a statement from Lexus for 1 lease payment and over $600 in ""damages"".  We were shocked and contacted Lexus SM to help sort this out. 

Unfortunately, it turns out, they don't really care about good, loyal customer issues are after you drive off the lot.

The GM, Mr. Unger, especially doesn't care. We seem to be pests to him.  He will not even provide us with his attorneys name and number.  
We waited for a month, fully expecting Lexus of SM to ""take care"" of this mistake, we received no response.  We, stupidly assumed they ""took care"" of it.  

Then, we started receiving outrageous phone calls from a belligerent collection agency.  Again, we were truly shocked by this treatment.  Interestingly, the collection agency told us that the dealerships will ""say anything to get the sale"" 

We contacted Lexus of SM several more times about this. They just passed the blame onto Lexus corporate. No help what-so-ever. 

We finally had to get our attorney involved and finally got the 1 lease payment removed, but not  the ""damages"" we were never made aware of until 3 months after the new lease papers were signed. Apparently, there is a hole under the front bumper. We had never seen it. How do we know they didn't cause the damage?  Why were we not made aware of this at the time we turned in the car?  Why were we not given the opportunity to repair this on our own? 

We reached out to Ron and Mr Unger at Lexus SM again. Again, they blew off our request to ""take care"" of this issue, as promised. 

My husband and I have been in sales our entire lives. This treatment is flabbergasting to both of us. Neither one of us would ever treat a customer this way.  At this point, it's purely principal. We told Lexus SM we would never buy a car from them again and they simply don't care.   

Wow...  is a few hundred bucks really worth losing a loyal customer who has leased  from them for 15 years?  


Things have changed at Lexus SM, so buyer beware! If you have a problem with your purchase or lease, after you sign, you can just eat it!

Next car, BMW or Mercedes. Hope we can find a dealer who respects loyal customers.

I flew down from the top of the state to purchase a 2014 GX,Josh picked me up at the airport (which I greatly appreciated ). The GX was advertised as 'L\Certified', low miles and perfect condition. When I arrived the GX was dirty, scratched, and the certification had been revoked due to a airbag being deployed. I did test drive the SUV and discovered that the drivers front door did not close properly. When I asked to speak to the head of certification, I was left sitting for two hours in the service department while they tried to track the man down. Finally I was able to speak to the manger of certification Tim Nelson, he had no idea why the car had gone through the cert process and had a door that didn't even close. No apology or even excuse. 
Suffice to say I had to switch gears and start the search over again. 
Paul expressed reasonable paitence with me as I had to test drive another 5 GX'S. 
After several hours I finally had it down to two SUV's and asked to discuss numbers with the manger. Roger the used cars sales manger came in and proceed to verbally barrage me with how much money he lost on the car I had rejected. He refused to negoiate a single penny. He left me in tears in Paul's office. I was appalled and insulted. I nearly walked out. However the fact that I had already sold my BMW the day before and was 700 miles from home left me with little choice but to move ahead and purchase a car. 
Being that I have a lot of experience in purchasing used cars I decided to try negations once more with Roger. It was an awful experience. However, I did get the price down by $500. 
I purchased a 2015 GX 460 'L\Certified'. The certification document that was supposed to be included in my final paperwork and documents was not provided. While driving the SUV home I discovered two of the seatbelts did not work and underneath the back seat was a cigarette butt. 
From my research cars that have been smoked in do not qualify for the 'L\Certified' program. Also the 161 point inspection for certification is supposed to review and test each and every safety belt. Clearly they did not throughly inspect the car. 
I have been reaching out to the dealership on multiple levels for several days with hardly response. Paul has returned my calls, only to say that he doesn't know where the certification document is.  None of the management, or finance department has cared to return my calls or emails. (I feel like they got my money and now don't care. Typical used cars salesmen).
 I called the nearest Lexus dealership to me and spoke to their head of 'L\Certifed' and used sales and they said that car I purchased should not have been allowed on the lot or at least priced appropriately to reflect its true condition. I also learned that I should have received new floors mats for the front, back seats and the rear storage area, as well as key gloves for the remotes. I only received mats for the front and back seats. 
If you want a true luxury car and experience go to BMW or MERCEDES. They at least deliver quality for the price. And most likely the sales manger won't yell and make you cry. 
Don't bother buying a certified or pre owned car here, their quality control is a joke.

35808,10-Aug-15,"I have never had a worse customer experience in my life as I did at this dealership. After being quoted a price and lease terms, I waited 2 days while my salesman (Omar) was on vacation. I left work early on the day he was finally back and went to pick up my car. I then met with the financier (Roger) who, after trying to tell me I had agreed on a 24 month lease (which I had not, I would have only ever agreed to a 36+ month lease) and calling me a ""liar"", he then yelled at me and asked me to leave when I told him the monthly price of the lease I had agreed on with Omar was less than what he was claiming. To be honest it almost turned me off of Lexus altogether, but luckily I had the polar opposite experience at Jim Falk Lexus in Beverly Hills and was treated fantastically. I was very close to boycotting the brand and I have already written to the Better Business Bureau about my experience at Lexus Santa Monica. ",6,50,-1

There was clear offer and acceptance and we took steps to closing the deal.  I had all my finances ready for the purchase.  I emailed the salesman, Paul Pourhashem, my loan approval and copies of my Dl and insurance policy.  Because of the weekend, salesman informed me that he would follow up with sales contract on Monday.  On Monday at 11:23 a.m. (CST), Mr. Pourhashem texted me saying ""I came in now and the car is sold find you another one.""

We, including my wife and kids were, very excited about this awesome vehicle and now we are super disappointed.  In hind sight, I feel defrauded and misled by this salesman and his dealer.

Later on, when we confronted him about the incident in the morning, he lied that he offered the option first before printing anything out.

35906,01-Mar-12,"Kevin Emamian is a young salesman not experienced with the sales process of all types of cars and in particular ordering special orders.
I just have had a very unpleasant and frustrating experienced ordering a brand new special order IS350C convertible with many upgrades.
After waiting almost 4 months for this dream car, it arrived last week at the dealer without a simple upgrade option: the wind screen hook up holders.  This option is critical on any convertibles, which Kevin is obviously not familiar with, because after placing the order, which we agreed with a handshake and a written confirmation which I still have on my hands for proof, he ""forgot"" or did not know how to ""follow up"" on.
The only answer Kevin could give is ""I am sorry"", this was my first special order. Now he and the dealership are trying to forget about their mistake because they don't want to spend the couple of hundred dollars of the wind screen installation kit. Very poor, unethical and unprofessional way to treat customers and their written commitments
I am presently placing my complaint with the main Lexus customer service which so far understood and were going to follow up on solving Santa Monica Lexus's mistake. 
Overall this dealership is embarrassing, not having the professional decency of trying to fix Kevin's inexperienced mistake.  ",6,50,-1
35912,09-Dec-11,"I have been to the Lexus Santa Monica service shop 3, or 4 times now and all of my experiences, except this last one, have been great. The service was unorganized and exceptionally unfriendly during this visit. Not that everyone there was rude but that the employee I was working with did not give me all the information I needed and he simply did not make me comfortable. It's widely known that getting service done at the dealership is more expensive than other mechanics and of course studies have shown how women are more likely to be scammed by mechanics or repair shops than men. Yet, until my most recent visit here I did not feel that was the case. I researched the price and types of tires, front wheel & side mirror I actually could have gone with and the cost of parts, labor + alignment at another shop would have saved me over $600! The person helping me of course neglecting to explain the different options I could have gone with leaving me to think my model could only use one type of tire. When I asked for a write up of all this he didn't include any details! It was a ludicrous report and because it was a holiday weekend I really felt pressured into agreeing quickly so he could get the parts in before my trip out of town. The parts were still late and my car was ready days after the estimated date which had me rushing back from NorCal to return the loaner car before incurring the late fees ($60/day). I could go on about other details but basically the service is hit or miss here and like anywhere, you need to do your research beforehand. ",6,50,-1
35913,30-Nov-11,"I would never buy any CPO Lexus vehicles here again and would certainly not recommend this dealership due to the very poor quality of the vehicle and service of this sales gentleman.

I bought a 2008 RX 400h from this dealer in February this year. Before making a decision to buy this vehicle, he explained to me that this vehicle used to be a lease to a private party and was very clean & no accident/damage. The CARFAX reported that this dealer provided was also showing that there was no accident/damage.
9 months after the purchase, I had a chance to see the latest CARFAX report of this vehicle and have been very shocked to know that this vehicle had an accident in July this year (BEFORE I PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE) and the CARFAX began reporting it in June this year (AFTER I PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE).
Considering that this vehicle was a lease from this dealer and this dealer certified it as a CPO before selling it to me, it is impossible for me to believe that ""They did not know if this vehicle had an accident before selling it to me and they are now checking with the CARFAX."" 

It has been more than a week and he has never called me back to update the status as to what to do. 

This is nothing but a fraud to me and thus, I would never recommend this dealer.

35918,30-Jul-11,"May have been the worst experience I have ever had buying a car. 

Upon my first trip to Lexus of Santa Monica, I was greeted by Jimmy Kim, a very nice sales/loan manager.  After looking at the vehicles, I told him exactly what I was looking for- a Tungsten Pearl Rx350 w/ navigation and luxury package w/ grey interior.  I also gave him the competitive price I was quoted from another dealership (Glendale).  Jimmy told me that while the quote was low, he would do the deal in order to gain my business.  He didn't have the exact car in stock that I wanted, so I waited a couple weeks and finally Jimmy called- the car I wanted was in!  

The only hitch was that it was a 4WD vs. 2WD.  Jimmy explained that this should be no big deal- maybe about $5 more per month. So I came into Santa Monica, saw the vehicle, filled out the paperwork, spent about 3 hours through the process.  Finally, they went to process my  paperwork and suddenly the manager realized that they didn't want to make this deal on the car I had been promised and waited weeks for.  Lexus would be losing thousands on the deal, they said.  

Instead the manager pulled the old bait and switch and tried to sell me on a Blue 2WD vehicle!  Additionally, the manager became very rude and defensive when I questioned him on this tactic.

Leaving the dealership, I truly felt like the customer was not valued at all.  They told me what I wanted to hear, so that they could try to earn my business, and then when it was time to close the deal, they were hoping I would just roll over and let them up-charge me. 

This experience was so frustrating and wasted weeks of my time.  A similar experience happened to me at their dealership 3 years ago.  I would absolutely recommend that you avoid this dealership at all costs.  I have had great experiences at Lexus of Glendale- they've always at least been honest with me (too bad they're so far from West LA!).",6,50,-1

When I explained that I was only there for a routine oil change (and I had Prepaid Auto Care), he became cold, resigned, and ""needed to speak with his Service Manager."" When Jose explained the details to his Service Manager, Daniel Cabrera, Daniel treated me rudely. He informed me that after 3 years of loyal and faithful patronage to Lexus Santa Monica, they would no longer honor my Prepaid Auto Care because it was purchased through another Lexus dealership and is not profitable for them. Daniel then walked away and Jose took care of another customer. I am horrified by the lack of customer service I experienced at this dealership, as it is not what I have come to respect and appreciate from Lexus.

35964,15-Oct-10,"Smoke and mirror sales!? - ? Don't shop here!

The sales manager said she would beat the price we had and quoted a so-called Costco and AAA discount over the phone but when we got there the price was higher than the price we were trying to beat. 

To make up the difference she sent us to Car-Max on Manchester to get a better price for our trade-in. We went on a leap of faith that she was honest and knew what she was doing. She told us she sends lots of customers there and they have gotten far more than SM Lexus could give. 

What's really interesting about this is that Santa Monica Lexus had appraised our car about six weeks before for $1,500 more. At that time we were thinking about a pre-owned vehicle - now we decided to go with new. 

Anyway, the Car-Max adventure was a total and complete waste of time! One other thing....this manager insisted that the salesperson explain that the cost increase was due to the new and improved braking system on the 2011 model. The add-on is to stop the vehicle if it's going over 80 mph and the brakes fail. Let's do a reality check on this....I see this as strictly a compliance requirement to keep people from getting killed from a known defect in design. This ""spiel"" was almost enough to make us shop for another brand!

The inside of this dealership is pure faux (aka - phony!) and so are the people.If you are serious about buying a car - go to a dealership that is up front and straight forward - not SM Lexus!!! 

We bought the same car the next day for a far better price at a dealership out in the Valley - they were honest, respectful and priced to sell.

35967,13-Jan-09,"Well, I can only speak about my own experience, I have read some positive reviews as well before.  I had been shopping around for a new Lexus for about 2 weeks through the internet.  I spoke with Scott Allen over there who wanted to know the best deal I had to see if he could match or beat it.  After I told him of the deal, he said he would get back to me.

The next day he called and said they would match the deal and throw in XM, which made Santa Monica Lexus the place I was going to buy.  I then agreed to buy it from him two days later and asked that they email me the quote which he agreed to do.  The next day arrived and still no quote, so I called Scott and he said he wasn't sure why it had not been sent, but not to worry as the deal for my car (which was a specific model/color) was still  good.  In fairness to Scott, he said his boss approved the deal and it was his boss who would be sending out the quote to me.

The next day (the day I was supposed to buy the car there) came and although there was still no quote, I went to go  buy it at the agreed appointment time.  That's when things went down hill.  I arrived and was not asked by anyone if I needed help.  I made my way to what appeared to be an information desk in their beautiful showroom and asked to speak with Scott.  The woman was a bit rude, but paged him and that was all I really needed done anyway.  No harm.  

A couple of minutes later Scott came out and not only barely remembered me, but had no idea of the car we talked about.  After going to a desk with a computer that didn't work, he got up to go see about the car.  He came back with some papers shuffling around and then we went to a different desk with a working computer.  That's when the games started.

Keep in mind, we already did the deal over the phone.  Went over everything from exact color, model, price and even the out the door price.  Now, all of a sudden my car was not in stock.  He starts telling me that all I could do was take one of the other models they had, a different color or take the ""base model.""  When I stated that I was not going to compromise the color I wanted and that he promised they had for me, he rudely said, ""Well, we're compromising on the price, so you need to compromise.""  Don't blame me for a price that you agreed to do.  I was very offended that.

Can you say Bait And Switch?  In addition, I was never offered that they could order my car.  Hell, I was never even offered a water that I saw many others being given by one of their staff.  My experience here was terrible and really left me with a bad taste in my mouth for Lexus in general.

Your experience might be different from mine,but a word of caution, if you do go the internet route here, be weary of their lines to get you in there and don't go in until they send you the quote on the car they have for you WITH the VIN number.

I hope you have a better experience than I did there.  I ended up going to another Lexus dealer who although they didn't have the car in stock either, put an order in for it at the agreed price.  I had two other Lexus dealers in SoCal inform me that although they would have done my deal, they unfortunately did not have my car in stock.

37009,29-Feb-16,"I leased my first Lexus ES350 Jan of 2013 from Keys. It was a 2 year lease, and together with it I bought a ""Protection Plan"" that I was told would cover up to $7,500 worth of wear and damage. I rarely drive so my car was in pristine condition and with only 3,000 miles, however, it had a crack on the windshield (which was covered by the protection). In December of 2015, a month or so before my lease was up, I went in Keys Lexus to discuss getting me on a new lease and out of the old one. After a lot of back and forth, we agreed on a price, and I was told that ""they would take care of the old lease and all I had to do was to cancel any automatic payments"". I handed them the old keys - they handed me the new keys, and I was on my way. At that time, I only gave them one set of keys because I couldn't find the second one - I was told that they'll take care of it and I had nothing to worry about... that I should just enjoy my new car. 

Fast forward to two weeks ago, mid-February, I receive a bill for $1,500 claiming excessive wear and use of my old lease from Lexus Financial. I was surprised to receive any type of bill, since I was told that it was taken care of, so I called Keys. I was told that the manager was not in (it was the weekend) and that I should call Lexus Financial and see what it was because I shouldn't have to pay for anything since I had the protection. 

I was obviously frustrated, but assumed that it was just the windshield so I called them to clear it out and move on. Apparently they didn't know I had the protection plan - they said that they'll remove that charge but that I still owe about $500 because I have to pay for ""sales tax for the windshield"" and for a ""missing key"". I immediately called Keys Lexus and asked them to sort it out because I shouldn't have to pay anything as we discussed - I was told that the person who sold me the car was no longer working there and that the lease agreement was between me and Lexus Financial so there was nothing they could do. I spoke with Karim who was the manager of the old salesperson and he told me that ""keys are the customer's responsibility"" which of course makes sense.. but when you are told that a Lexus dealership will take care of your old Lexus lease and they get you in your new Lexus lease then you expect that they'll honor that and won't claim that it's not their problem after they get your business. 

I had to chase Karim down and call over and over again, after he kept claiming that he would call me the next day and didn't 3 times in a row. At the end, he said that it was my responsibility and there was nothing they would do to honor what was told to me by their salesperson when I closed the deal.

Sure enough, the next day I checked my car the detail works was not completely done. The car still has stained and very dusty in the car.  I had informred the manager Darleen twice but nothing was done to the vehicle.  This is the worst experience I had with this key dealer.  I wanted to let you guys know before visiting this dealer.

37163,07-Apr-14,"these guys are very rude and disrespectful. Ben (sales manager) is just a flat out liar. told my wife i was there the first day haggling for a price for an hour and a half while a was there for only 45 mins tops with the test drive. then told us he did not tell me this and that the first day we talked. sales associate Khristophe know about that deal because we even talked a few times about the deal Ben told me. by the way, Khristophe is genuinely nice guy hands down.

2 days after, we went there to get a CT but asking for a better deal because price he told me that day was so different from the first day (i guess he knew we wanted the car that's why he took advantage). and i guess haggling for a price is normal when you're buying a car knowing how very tricky these car sales people are (nothing wrong about that i know it's their job) and then suddenly told me ""i think you shouldn't be buying a Lexus"". me and my wife felt insulted. it felt like he was telling us... you don't have the money, go somewhere else you could afford a car. 

today i called the Ryan (General Manager) because i felt like he should know what kind of people he have but it seems that he does not want to listen that's why i'm here writing this review. 

we were ready to buy that CT that moment he finally said he cannot go any lower but Ben's last few words made us leave.
he was very rude! 

anyway, we went next door at Mercedes and ended up getting a Bnew C250 coupe that same day. i guess it's not all about the money huh, Ben?

At the beginning, I was still thinking purchasing a car or leasing a car, but he told us that even if I were to make the lease, in two years, IF I WOULD BE ABLE TO PURCHASE AND PAY OFF THE CAR WITHIN 10 DAYS I WOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY SALES TAX.   He was very sure about what he said and he even said it’s the government’s law. So after he told us this, I decided to make the lease agreement instead of the purchase.
After the purchase, I found out what he said was not true and it actually cost about $1200 more for me to make a lease agreement instead of making the purchase. Because I do have to pay sales tax even if I purchase the car in two years within 10 days.  I just feel so upset about this purchase. He told me false information and misleads me to sign the lease agreement.  I have already sign the contracts, so I know I can’t do much about this.  But I still gave it a try and contacted them and said I just want to change to a purchase instead of leasing but no one replies me. I even sent an email to their VIP Manager.

37214,07-Oct-12,"Purchase lease on 2013 RX 350 Keyes Lexus. 10-06-2012

Keyes took advantage of our desire to avoid personal conflict with the sales staff and “Walk”.        

At every step of what should have been a very easy transaction Keyes sales management (Joey Yerkanyan) Lied about what RX350’s they had available with the options we had originally requested. As we discovered this cascade of ongoing misrepresentations about the features installed on the RX we were forced into repeated renegotiations.

After we made the long drive into Van Nuys because Keyes said they “had the car with the features we had very carefully specified in stock” this turned into a very unnecessary 4 hours of “used Car sales tactics”.

Driving home the bad taste in our mouths about finalizing a deal with a dealer which employs such dishonest tactics made us decide to return the car the next day and cancel the deal. Unfortunately the Lexus Lease contract we signed has a “NO Cooling OFF” clause. After 4 hours we were a little too impatient to leave and didn’t check all the fine print.

After checking around about Keyes more thoroughly with other Lexus dealers it is clear LEXUS is willing to turn a blind eye to the Keyes sales treatment of Lexus customers as long as they move their products off the lot. We can only assume all the Keyes Auto dealer sites employ the same tactics. Our advice is never walk on a Keyes lot because you will regret it.

37256,22-Mar-11,"About a year ago, Lexus announced their new CT 200h hybrid hatchback would be coming out the following year. I did my research then and became obsessed with the car. I had recently totaled my first Lexus, a 2007 Lexus RX350, which saved my life, so I figured I'd go with Lexus again.

I did my research and finalized my pricing decisions.

As time went on, it looked like Lexus was not going to supply the US with many of these CT 200h's; most were slated for the European markets. That, coupled with rising gas prices anticipated this summer, along with the tragic disaster that struck Japan, many dealerships were not only not willing to sell below MSRP, but were also starting to mark up their cars.

I spoke with Sam Santoso, Internet manager, over email on several occasions. He told me he would beat any best offer I received from other dealerships.

Keyes Lexus, which is literally a 5 minute walk from my house, was one of many dealerships I actually stepped into to make a deal. I had my numbers ready and was ready to deal. They didn't have the car I wanted exactly, so I moved up and decided to get the fully loaded one they had on their lot. I believe I went in on Tuesday, 3/15/11. Sam, the internet manager was leaving, so he said hi to me and passed me onto a sales associate. The sales associate was young and probably new, but we connected because of our age. Unfortunately, when it came time to deal, the sales associate had to pass us onto a more experienced sales manager, who played games and refused to sell us the car at below MSRP, which the internet manager had me believe we could make a deal. This was after weeks of dealing with several dealerships in the area. I was getting frustrated and fed up with the whole game. I would either get this car at the end of the month, or wait until the 2012 one came out so I could get a used one. 

The problem with Keyes Lexus is multifold.

They foist a bunch of dealer-added accessory onto all their cars, and they don't give you the option of removing such add ons. Keyes Lexus is known to chrome ALL wheels of their new cars in stock. In fact, this is such a widespread problem that when other dealerships want to trade stock, the have to exchange the wheels as well, since Keyes does not stock unchromed factory wheels.

Additionally, the sales managers seem to like to play games and do the whole runaround the customer. I was on the defensive the entire time I was in the dealership, which is unfortunate. Whether you've done your research or not, the sales managers will always find a way to make you feel inferior and will actually get so offended when you offer a starting price that is below MSRP. They need to understand that for an entry-level car like the CT 200h, they shouldn't be expecting major profits as they normally would with their higher-end models. I ended up walking out feeling frustrated, disappointed, and insulted.

On Friday, 3/18, Larry Ellis of Vista Lexus in Woodland Hills got in contact with me to see how I was doing. I offered my price, but it was too low. However, the one thing Larry did right was to actually negotiate with me until we could both find a number that we would both be happy with. There was also a $1000 Lexus Loyalty Rebate that Larry was able to dig up and qualify me for, which none of the dealerships I talked to even mentioned. In the end, Larry was able to get me the car I wanted for $1500 off MSRP, fully loaded except for PCS/radar cruise control.

The whole deal took 1 hour, which consisted of me filling out paperwork. Larry and I made a verbal contract over the phone prior to this and he stood by his word and did not try to pull any fast tricks on me when I actually arrived to his dealership a few minutes late due to LA traffic.

The icing on the cake was, Keyes Lexus tried calling me 6 times while I was filling out paperwork. When I was in the office w/ Roger, who is excellent, btw, I finally picked up my phone and Sam, the internet sales manager who passed me off at Keyes Lexus asked me if I wanted to come in to deal. I happily told him I was at Vista Lexus filling out the paperwork for my new CT 200h and that he was too late.

It's a shame Keyes Lexus has to resort to such low handed sales tactics in order to make a sale. I can't imagine how they'll treat me once I'm their actual customer.

Each and every time they never fail to consistently treat customers rudely with horrible sales tactics.

One - they run credit even before they allow you to see or test drive a car.  No other Lexus Dealer (or Mercedes or Acura dealer) runs credit when you ask to see a car.
Secondly, they use delay tactics and hold your driver's license to keep you in the dealership waiting forever in their offices while ""they look for your license to return it to you.""
Finally, they use the hard-sell techniques of constantly sending in a higher ""manager"" to offer you a better deal three times over.

Why Lexus doesn't cut these guys out of the network is beyond me.  It's also stupid of me to have gone back over the years.  I should've learned the first time that they are run by a franchise owner with no understanding of customer service.

I'm sure Hyundai in 2011 will treat their customers better than Keyes Lexus.

""attention to details!!!""

i contacted internet sales dep. i got contacted by Sam. we agreed on a price. at that time, i thought i was getting super good deal.
but once i got there, i couldn't find Sam, but Omar and Fred had to show me around. 
Sam was ""out for lunch"" so i said fine.
i found out that the test drive car had some scratches and glue residues. a brand new car. Fred, assit manager, said he deals with this type of problem all day everyday. new cars w/ scretches? wow so i guess i don't have to worry about it!! good work there.
so he said ""full detail"" and if it doesn't go away, he'll chnage the whole panel or  painted. or replaced. to a new car? come on. but anyhow, the deal was so attractive i couldn't pass on. 
so i gave my information and they ran my credit. i request to see the invoice. 
They gave me the deal we agreed on. however, they added LDA for ~$900. so basically the deal + LDA = actually worse than i got a quote from other dealer. i had to waste my whole weekend and drove 50 miles just to see this non-sense? so i asked, what's LDA? Fred told me he doesn't know. that doesn't make sense. he's assit manager. he should know what LDA means. and it's ~$900. he refused to explain it to me and he told me i didn't trust them. 

last time i saw other dealer's invoice, (Lexus of course) i did not recall LDA fee. if i saw one, i'd remember it. it's not just couple of dollars. it's ~$1000. we are talking invoice - couple hundreds of dollars and do you think i don't recognize that number? anyway, he refused to tell me what it was. so i walked away. later on, i found out that it's Lexus Dealer advertisement fee. what? I (not Lexus dealer) have to pay advertising fee??? hello. oh one more thing. their finace sucks too. before i went there, i did my homework. i got pre-approval from my bank. let say it came out x APR. their finance gave me x+3% APR. why so different? i understand that there will be some difference but not by 3%...

37375,07-Aug-19,"I cash purchased a 2011 LX 570 through Newport Lexus Internet Sales Manager, Mr Ostergaard. Because the vehicle was being sold “As Is” and it was being shipped to MN I asked MANY questions to determine its condition.  I was assured there were no mechanical defects; body imperfections, including the most visible ones on the rear spoiler, were cosmetic; the entertainment system, a feature my grandchildren were excited about, was fully operational.

On arrival, my LX 570 presented with 2 prominent body parts completely missing (I do not recall them missing in the ad pics); a rear spoiler broken in several pieces and well-beyond repair; warning lights indicating the Tire Pressure Management System was malfunctioning, and the entertainment system missing components necessary to operate it. My local Lexus dealer estimated the cost to remediate these defects at about $5,000, including an oil change that was apparently overdue.

I appealed to Newport Lexus Internet Sales Director, Mr Locastro who reiterated the vehicle was sold “As Is” and implied I had no right to rely on the veracity of Manager Ostergaard to honestly tell me what the “As Is” condition was. We are not under that duty. Hoping to strike a compromise, I offered to pay labor if Newport Lexus would help me out with the parts. Mr Locastro laughed at me and said “that’s not going to happen”. Mr D’Amato, General Manager, backed his management staff and tacitly endorsed their sales practices. Lexus Corporate, on investigation, said they would not intervene as each dealer is independently owned and is free to conduct business in whatever way best suits them. 

Newport Lexus, and Lexus Corporate for that matter, hypes their high-minded commitment to customer satisfaction, but all levels of their management team have demonstrated themselves to be nothing more than typical car jockeys; shysters willing to say anything to make a sale. Non-local customers are, apparently, of little incentive or importance to Newport Lexus. Internet buyers be very wary.  ",6,51,735
37401,10-Jun-19,"This place has been a nightmare since the time we drove off the lot. We purchase a used vehicle with Newport Lexus and have felt like they could care less about servicing customers. I am going to say the worst part first so people will read this. The worse part (which happened after the other parts) is they sold us a Car that they didn't have a title for (pretty sure this is illegal). We purchase our Van Feb 6th and 2 months later were notified by the bank that they did not receive the title. I called Newport Lexus and they said they would get back to me in 20 minutes. 4 Hours later I called them back and they would not take my call. I spent 2 days trying to get a hold of some to fix this. My Bank also called them a handful of time and could not get a hold of them. Finally we talked to someone on May 1st and they told us they did not have the title from the previous owner (whoops on their part) and they talked to the DMV and the title was on its way. Fast forward to now (June), I was notified by my bank that they still have not received the title and I realized I still have not received my registration (its now been 4 months since the purchase). I called Newport Lexus again and had to call back 4 times to get a person on the phone. Like usually they said they would get back to me and nothing. I called my bank and learned that Newport Lexus had lied to us on May 1st saying it was taken care of when in all actuality they didn't file with the DMV til May 24th (pretty much a whole month went by). My car which is now past the 90 day temp registration is un-drivable because its not technically registered. These guys got there money and don't seem to care to help. As this is still all going down. 

Now that the worst part has been stated I want to tell you about the fun we had when I drove off the lot with bad front breaks (that they passed on inspection of the car). I had to take the car back to Newport Lexus 3 times for them to fix, which they didn't. I finally took it to Honda and made them pay me back.

37447,19-Dec-18,"I purchased Lexus IS 200T from Newport Lexus in September,2018

I am writing this for customers who deserve better services and treats, based on facts.
I had an issue that should’ve been remained a small issue with management & dealer, and it was about my 2nd key and their attitudes.
Let me just saying problems I think of this New port Lexus overall.  MY DEALER didn’t answer my call, email or voicemail.  In other words, it was very unprofessional behavior about A/S.  His attitude to customer wasn’t great; he literally stopped talking to me after seeing bad review on him from me instead of fixing the problem with me via much smoother way. I just did my right to do as a customer who spends a lot of money on what they are selling. Speaking of which, even I sent an apology email to the dealer about the review, for god sake! 
About the INTERNET SALES MANAGER, he said “There is nothing I can do about it, since I didn’t make a dime from the deal between your dealer and you, sir. You have to talk with your dealer”, the reason I talked to him was just because the dealer is not responding me at all. In my perspective I believe that he didn’t want to be in charge to solve the problem. I just gave up on him after what he told me. 
I emailed to the GENERAL MANAGER to discuss about this, he is the exactly same like others. Through Yelp, he said that he is willing to fix problem, but all he did for me was ignoring me and passing around the responsibility to others. 
Here is what happened. Since the dealer ignored me, I talked with the internet sales manager about 2nd key. He emailed me that says “OK perfect so wait till receive the registration. As far as the key, dealers have different accounts. We cannot do that. If you want to go there (other Lexus dealership), that is fine then you shall make your key and send us the bill so we get a check and mail to you”; from my email. He made me to get a new key ($477), then refused to pay back, just because it was too expensive and he didn’t want to pay it from his pocket.  
So I had to open an official claim through Lexus HQ to get the reimbursement. This whole process was so messed up and frustrating to me. Hope anyone read this, please reconsider where you want to get your car.

Lexus has a program where you can turn in your old lease early if you lease a new Lexus which we always do. To my surprise today Fred the sales manager decided they would only cover 2 months and would not honor what they said 2 weeks ago when we bought the car. Luckily I had lexus financial on a 3 way call with Fred and they heard and recorded the entire conversation. Thankfully the representative from Lexus financial was apologetic and said she has never encountered a call like this with a dealership before. I have never been disrespected and yelled at over the phone by anyone like this before and I will never buy a car from this dealership again. If you tell your customer you are going to do something you should do it  instead of yell at your customer over the phone like a animal. We have been loyal Lexus customers for over 10 year and will never step foot in Newport Lexus again!  An animal like Fred should not be allowed to speak to customers over the phone and should have some self respect rather than yell at people over the phone because he lies to his customers. Fred should be required to take an anger management class or should not be in a position that has to deal with human beings. If your going to go back on your word to your customers at least learn how to talk to people with respect! ",6,52,-1
37487,04-Aug-18,"My husband died  in February at the age of 53 with double stage 4 cancers.  He had purchased a RX330 which I loved and was a great car. After he passed I knew it was time to get a smaller vehicle and I went to Newport Lexus because that is where my husband bought my first car.  I found a great car which I fell in love with.  

The problem is I was completely taken advantage of with my trade on. They didn’t even give me low Kelly Blue book on my trade.  And, when I questioned Mo, he insisted it was a VERY good deal; he basically lied right to my face.  I texted and emailed Mo about my trade in and got NO response- nothing. 

I am not sure if it was because I was a vulnerable widow, woman or first time buyer, but I recommend doing your homework as to not be taken advantage of.  The plus side is I love my car, and still
love and trust my Lexus vehicles.",6,52,46

I arrived 30 min later and the cashier said they would start to wash my car. I guess It was too much to wash it when I asked.

I've received 3 months waver Directly from Lexus corporate and Ali promised that for a returning customer Newport Lexus will wave addition 3 months of my lease payments so I could trade in my car 6 months early. Upon my arrival to the dealership Ali completely forgot about this promise. I do not want to call him a liar but he is very forgetful (More on this below).
Over the phone we agreed on the discount that I was looking for and Ali called me within an hour confirming that my deal 14% off of MSRP was approved. I was negotiating for a car with MSRP of $57K so I was expecting to see negotiated price in a range close to $49K (57-14% = 49).
Upon arrival Ali showed me my final price of $51.5K I informed him that this is not what we have agreed on the phone. Ali informed me that this is the best the he could do.
I had another quote from dealership that is about 60 miles from my home so at this point I informed Ali that another dealership can do this deal.
After another back and forth and meeting some other people I had no interest in meeting I have agreed to the deal that was worse than what was originally promised and another dealer was willing to do.
Upon signing documents I’ve asked Ali when is he going to look at my current leased car that I was exchanging to which Ali replied that today he is just selling me another car and I will have to deal with lease return on my own. Here Ali forgetful again. If you still decide to deal with Ali make sure you get everything in writing because Ali will not remember anything that he promised.
Of course I leased from another dealer.

- I was told it would be about 1.5 hours for an oil change. Dealership said they would call me when it was ready, and I walked to get some lunch. Came back after a little over 2 hours, and my car was sitting in the lot ready. Would have been nice to get a call when my car was done so I could get my car back earlier. 

- Received a 'low engine oil' alert a few months after getting oil changed at dealership. There was still about 1 month before I needed my next oil change. 

- Had a pair of sunglasses stolen out of my car

- One time my car was somehow lost in their system and they were unable to physically locate my car. Eventually they found my car, but I had to wait a while to get it back. They made up for it with a full tank of gas, but the overall experience was irritating. 

- I used to justify the high price of the oil change because of the loaner car. They no longer offer a loaner for oil changes, so there really isn't much of a difference between the dealership and a mechanic.

This was the worst experience I have ever had.  I went to pick up the car that was confirmed in email of day and time to be picked up. 20 minutes before I was to arrive, I got a call that they sold it and no apology.  Just that they were having another car sent but it wouldn't be ready til the next day.  They inconvenienced me and expected me to drop everything. 

I went to the dealership.  Fred's answer to why did you sell it when you knew I was coming was ""I have to sell 400 cars a month.""  I said ""so my business isn't important?""  His response -""ma'am, I have 400 cars to sell a month.""  

Sales 101 - listen to the customer, let them vent and then try to make it right not argue with them and say absurd things like you have 400 cars to sell.  I walked out and the GM responded to my email and voicemail but I realized I never got an I'm sorry for the way his management acted.  I also have email to backup the communication around this sale.  

I'm embarrassed for them the way that this was handled and I have also contacted corporate Lexus.   I was going to let this stay under the radar until my friend was contacted by Yelp that her review of what she witnessed while she was with me was removed because Newport Lexus didn't want the review there. Here is my review based on my experience.  Take it for what it's worth but Fred was horrible in his actions and behaviors and did not treat me well.  Had they taken responsibility - I wouldn't be posting this.

Update:  Thank you Tony for the response.  As I mentioned when we talked, I was told I did not have to have the financials done until I picked up the car.  I forwarded you that email that stated that even though I tried to submit them on Sunday, July 24th when both Lexus and I agreed on the terms of sale - I was told Thursday would be fine when I picked up the car.  

Let me clarify that this review was not about the fact that the car was sold before I got there, but this review is about the way I was treated by Fred.  Had he apologized for what happened and not said the absurd comment of selling 400 cars a month - I would have still purchased the car.  At the end of the day, it was the way I was treated not that the car was sold.  ",6,53,29
38097,21-Jun-16,"Came here recently for a test drive.  Not sure why, but this sales guy just wasn't interested in letting us get on the freeway (the dealership is only 2 blocks from the 73 Freeway, FYI, and no, it wasn't rush hour).  We went maybe a couple miles on surface streets, going no more than 45 mph because of traffic and red lights.  How is anyone supposed to know whether they like a car's performance going THAT slow?  I was bored to tears on this test drive and left very disappointed.  The guy also had this look on his face like he didn't think we were serious, even though we had every intention of buying a car that day if the car, the experience and the deal were right.  In this instance, both were just miserable (although, to clarify, Michael was actually a nice guy otherwise).

In the end, we ended up buying a car from Fletcher Jones MB instead.  Visiting both dealerships made us realize just how superior Fletcher Jones is to Newport Lexus.  The salesman we did a test drive with at FJ had  a lot of energy and enthusiasm, even though it was after 7pm and was probably beginning to wrap up his workday.  When we test drove out of the dealership, he immediately asked us to get on the freeway (unlike Newport Lexus).  As soon as we got on the 73 Fwy, a CHP cruiser passed us.  The salesman told us to ""punch it"" and speed past the police officer so we could test the performance of the car.  We thought he was joking and didn't do it for fear of getting a ticket, but he later told us he was serious because FJMB pays so much in taxes to the city that the CHP does not pull over anyone for speeding if they are doing a Fletcher Jones test drive.  I LOVE THAT!  100x better and WAY more enjoyable experience than at Newport Lexus, hands down.  Drove off the lot with that Mercedes-Benz that night.

I drive all the way to their place of business to be turned down and not given a fair opportunity like everyone else, this was a terrible experience.

I had a make and model in mind and he did not want to do any leg work to locate one, he just wanted to sell what was on the lot. When I explained to him that I was not interested in those he became very hostile and annoyed that we were even there. We ended up leaving.  

I then explained this to Howard, a nice, helpful internet manager who said that he DID have the make and model coming in on Sunday. So I arranged childcare (this is not easy for me) so I could come in only to find out that the car he said that I wanted was sold a week prior. He could of called me!?!? But no it was just a way to get my husband and I to come back in person. But Howard is does not even handle sales so we were handed off to Chris. Chris was nice, but constantly ""mis-spoke"" about facts about the cars he had to which we had to reconfirm and correct him. He did have the make and model of the car I wanted, he said it was a 2015, we started to talk pricing and we agreed to a price, I just off hand confirmed again this is a 2015 - he then said oh wait no this is a 2014. I then explained to him that we are not willing to pay the same amount for the 2015 as 2014. I do not know if he tried to save face with his manager and not inform them of his mistake, but all of a sudden the price was firm since this car was in high demand.

38628,29-Jun-13,"Horrible experience.
I bought  a new Lexus IS250 in Newport in 2009, also we bought additional 5years tire insurance there the same day. After that, we did every single maintenance there without suspecting anything.
The last maintenance there I was done on 01/16/2013, which is 25,000miles. I was told everything is perfect. Four and half months later (June 6), my car got huge noise from my tires when I was driving  on freeway. I parked the car and call roadside assistance, and they can't even disassemble my tire since there was a long rubber/metal strip from the tire tangling on the wheels, so they have to tow the car to the dealer.
The service manager checked the car, found that both front tires had the damage, then I was told that I need to buy two new tires because my tires were NATUALLY WORN OUT. I can't agree with that since it was only four and half month/3500 miles after my last maintenance done there, and there was no problem based on them. Tires NATUALLY worn out can't be happened suddenly. Either it was caused by car misalignment they didn't find last time, or it was road hazard which the tires insurance should cover. However, they insist that it was NATURALLY WORN OUT.
Then I bought tires from Costco and did alignment check/alignment in Firestone. Based on the visual inspection and measurement they performed, my car had misalignment problem and the tire unevenness was VERY obvious and not happened within 3500miles.
I called Newport, they insist that it was not their responsibility. They insist that they performed tire check and it was even and 5mm above in Jan which was good. And they said that when I towed the car in, it became 3mm BELOW, should be my own problem. But the truth is: even when the accident happened, outside of both front tires were still very new(should be more than 5mm above) while the inner side of both front tires got serious damaged (should be much more than 3mm BELOW). I didn't feel any unusual during these four months, and all my four wheels are good without even scratch. I can't understand why they decided a such UNEVENESS tires as naturally worn out. And I can't believe why they didn't inspect my tires (though they said they did). 
When I called in pretended that I am a new customer, they will assure me how wonderful their service is, and they will definitely check tires unevenness every time etc....DON'T TRUST THEM. But when I told them my situation, they will change immediately, said SERVICE MANAGER's decision is the final decision!
Their neglect out me into dangerous, and I will never use their service again. 
STAY AWAY FROM NEWPORT, don't buy any additional services they provide, premium price will not make you worry-free there!
They make me feel that it was my big mistake to buy Lexus from them and used their service for almost four years. BTW, my car is still under warranty, and I still kept my two front tires in my garage as evidence and I was remind of the HORRIBLE experience every time I saw the tires.

Few days later during the weekend, the sales person (Mark) called me  and asked me if I am still interested to get a Lexus. I told him that I would only buy it if he can sell it $1K above what I already offered him the other day. He said he has a SUV Lexus in the inventory (in the lot) with less features that he would be able to sell it at that price. I told him that is not a problem. He asked me what time I can come to the dealership to seal the deal. I told him I would be there in an hour. So, I drove all the way from Los Angles to Newport Beach to Newport  Lexus dealership and I was asking for Mark. As soon as he saw me he said that he did not think I would show up! He said he does not have any car at my price. Can you believe it?!!! I got completely shocked that he changed his words and wasted my weekend time that I could spend with my family. I expected him to apologize for breaking his promise and making me drive from LA to Newport Beach, but he was so disrespectful and rude. I left the dealership and called the manager.

38644,03-Apr-10,"Do not buy here. 
This dealership is only interested in the sale. Go to Longo, Tustin, Riverside or any other Lexus dealer.  After the sale, their follow up was terrible; in fact, they did not follow up at all. When an issue surfaced they were non responsive and it was quite disappointing. And we are speaking of the management staff as well.

We had to call the dealership over 10 times in a 3 week period, each time getting transferred or leaving messages (that were not returned), trying to get a response-it never came.  After finding the salesman had retained a key for the new car purchased at Newport Lexus, the management team was unwilling to call him to try to obtain the key that belonged to us. We found that the salesman had separated from the company, but we did not view that as our issue, he worked for them and represented them, so we felt the dealership should try to rectify the situation. Instead of helping find a solution, Desk Manager Bobby S. insulted us by saying 'he found it hard to believe that we didn't receive the second key' and that 'they don't make it their practice to cut keys after the fact'. We ultimately had to go to corporate for a resolution. Corporate makes it their practice to listen to the customers that buy the cars. There was only one key delivered with this new car. Corporate understood and made it right but it's sad we had to spend so much time, effort and frustration trying to resolve a simple matter.    

Very poor judgment, customer service and absolutely the worst lack of follow through of any dealer thus far (we have bought over 16 cars at dealerships). Completely against the grain of Lexus' brand 'pursuit of perfection', this scenario was handled as if we were dealing with a used car lot on Harbor Blvd.

Do not buy here and put yourself in a situation where you may need follow through or customer service in the future; because these guys cannot deliver. Sadly, we found the poor customer service comes from the top (after speaking with the Sales Managers and ultimately the GM), so it’s likely that it will get worse before it gets better. 

What we found was this management team simply does not understand how to operate as a luxury brand should and they really do not understand how to retain customers (or have people raving about their location, facility or staff).  They really are not doing the Lexus nameplate any favors, but have in fact, tarnished the brand in Southern California.

38647,27-Jul-09,"This is from 2008:  I was negotiating on a particular LS460L that Newport Lexus had
on their showroom floor. In the course of several phone calls and emails, I was quoted a lease rate of $1,400.00 per month, plus tax and license.  When I made the 
arrangements to come down and pick up the new car, all of a sudden the lease rate was $1499.00 per month, plus tax and license.  Bottom line:  I was lied to by the salesman, Nathan Cooper and the sales manager, Tony Delmonte.  Since this was the only car exactly like it available in the So. Calif. area, I ended up taking it, but with a VERY bad taste in my mouth. After I had taken delivery, I even wrote a formal letter to A.J. D'Amato, the president of Newport Lexus, but he never even had the courtesy to answer me--so much for customer service/appreciation.  The car now has 30,000 miles on it and I have NEVER been back to Newport Lexus for service or anything else.  I have owned SEVEN, brand new, top of the line LS models along with a new SC. I have never been treated like this by any other Lexus dealer.  Needless to say, I will never deal with Newport Lexus again, nor will I deal with Tustin Lexus, which is under the same ownership.  The people at Lexus corporate need to do some serious house cleaning with the Newport/Tustin dealerships--a forced change in ownership would not be too much to ask.",6,54,4

I was wrong and clearly judging a book by its cover. The purchase experience was perfect the salesman was polite and courteous. So was the financing department. 
I brought my car back a week later to have the paint treated to prevent swirl marks. I know it was probably a scam, but my car is black so I wanted to keep the paint looking new.
When I brought the car I was directed to Mike Sanders who was my service adviser. He seemed nice and polite and genuinely had my best intentions at heart. I was wrong again. When I got my car back the next day, the exterior looked great. Granted my car at the point was only a week old. However, the inside was dirty and came back with stains on the seat belt and the inside of the drivers door. I immediately brought this to Mike's attention. He said he would order a new replacement seat belt and get the interior cleaned when I brought my car in again. So far there has been no follow up and I know a replacement belt only days 1 or 2 days to come in.

However, on my most recent visit to address the engine light on my instrument panel I was informed that it was a transmission problem/leak and that I should return it to Aamco, that had replaced the transmission only months earlier and that I should not drive it there although I had driven it to Lexus with no problem.  After having it towed the few miles to Aamco, I was informed that while replacing a broken fitting, which caused the leak, they noticed that my rear suspension air bags were broken and that the solenoids were stuck as a result of the system not being disconnected prior to being raised by the Lexus technician when checking underneath the car, which resulted in an extremely bumpy ride back to Lexus after my phone call explaining the problem and complaining about the condition of the suspension.  I was told at that time that the service rep had no knowledge that there was a need to disconnect the system before raising the vehicle.  Later that day, I was told by the same service adviser that the technician assured him that it had been disconnected prior to being raised despite the fact that he had told me previously he did not know of any such requirement.  When I complained that I did not feel that I should have to pay to repair something that was apparently caused by their own conduct.  I was told it may have been the tow company or Aamco that caused the damage and that I would need to pay, and did pay, another $1100.00 to replace the rear system at the insistence of the service manager.  It should be noted that at all times the service Adviser named John was very courteous, helpful and cooperative, but I believe that the decision of the service manager was unfair under the circumstances and that I should not have had to pay for those repairs.",6,54,-1

39412,07-Sep-16,"This rating is for Nate Persall. I will try to be very objective in this review and will let you judge if I was treated fairly or not. 

I went to test drive a car last week, and Nate happened to be the person who we bumped into on the parking lot. 

So he brings us in with a big smile and asks us what we are looking for. I tell him that I am looking for a Lexus NX, and would like to test drive one. And then the first question he asks is when I am looking to buy the car, and I said a week perhaps if I like it and once I have test driven a couple of other models. Fair question, right? And I could visibly see his interest level drain. Even more apparent was his reluctance to let me test drive increased exponentially. 

Nate did not let me take the car on the freeway, as apparently he will do so only if I decided to take the car home that day, just before signing the paper. Really? Every other dealership I went to on Stevens Creek including Volvo and Acura let me drive the car on the freeway and you won't let me till I promise to sign on the dotted line?

Also, when Nate asked how would I like to pay for this car (i.e., lease or finance), and I mentioned I would like to buy it, he said, and I paraphrase, 'Oh! I thought you would be leasing this."" Really Nate, what makes you assume I am unable to pay for a Lexus? Please do tell. 

Oh, and finally, if you have ever test driven a car, you know they give you a printout with the estimate per month pricing etc. Nate refused to give that to us as apparently he cannot justify this to his managers! 

I am sorry Lexus Stevens Creek that you are employing such an unprofessional and rude sales associate as Nate Persall. It's been a long time since I have been treated this badly by a sales rep and if you claim to be a winner of the ""consumer satisfaction award"", you should at least treat every customer fairly and with respect and dignity. And I hope you will employ sales rep more professional than Nate, as he is clearly not one.

39523,05-Mar-16,"Lexus Stevens Creek Service didn't track and manage my 2015 Rx350 case. With a scheduled appointment for my Rx350 engine system noise problem, I brought my car to Lexus Stevens Creek Service at 7am on Nov. 7th, 2015. Service Adviser Carlos Munoz met me and handled the appointment. A technician spent about an hour with me to diagnose the noise problem. He test-drove my car, measured the engine idle speed (the RPM was normal), and compared my car's noise with another Rx 350 (which had similar mileage to mine) and one Lexus 350 sedan. Apparently, my car's noise was higher. He also opened the hood and listened my car's engine directly. The engine itself was quiet but we did heard the noise at the front seats. At the end, Carlos told me two things: (1) Stevens Creek Service wouldn't be able to do anything with the noise problem and will pass the case to the Lexus manufacture and (2) Stevens Creek Service would follow up the noise problem again at 5000 miles maintenance after the car system further ""broke in"". I did request Carlos to record the noise problem and investigation result, and Carlos promised to do so. 

By the time at the 5000 miles maintenance on Feb. 6, I learned that the noise problem and my scheduled problem check on Nov. 7th was not on Stevens Creek Service's work record and the Service Schedule had ""no show"" on my Nov. 7th appointment record. And there was no record for my previous visit and associated technician work for the same problem in October 2015 either.

39952,25-Apr-13,"To whom it may concern,

When i came in to view the car i saw online, it was scratched on the outside and had burn marks on the inside and (apparently) was listed with a certified pre-owned price. Herman made no concession on the price for the damage as it was already ""such a great deal"". I learned that the dealership would not review the car for what was needed to certify it (so i wouldn't know what the problems were if i bought it without being certified) unless i opted to pay the increase. The cost to have it certified was almost 7% of the total sale price! After deciding (with help) that i should pay the increased, non advertised cost, I found after the inspection that the car needed 4 new tires, wipers and a slew of other minor fixes! that $1,000+ cost is something you would have hit me with blindly after my next required check in to keep my certified warranty valid! What happened to the idea of selling a car for what its listed at? Just tell me the price up front, no gimmicks!  

I had to wait an unknown amount of time for the inspection and changing of tires. I was told a few days, but it took over two weeks and I had to do the mole work to find someone who could provide me a straight answer on an expectation of when i would get the car that i had already put 15K down for. I personally had to call the dealership to find the service number (different location), the service manager then had to get back to me once he figured out what car was mine and still could not set my expectation for when i would get my car. 

All in all i was unable to get an effective expectation on anything, be it the price, problems, turn around or delivery date of my purchase. 

None of this included the finance manager who insisted i was STUPID for asking what the FINAL price would be (has he tried to up sale quite a bit, presumably due to his commission structure) since ""that should have already been covered by the salesman before i met with him""! I felt like the JPmorgan customer being refereed to as a ""muppet""!  

Please don't infer from the negative connotation of this message that i am an overall negative person who's incapable of being pleased. Quite the contrary, i simply expect to be treated fairly, up front and made to feel as if i am a customer and not the middleman between a company and its $. needless to say i will not be looking for any other business from this dealership. Should i need service or another car i will be going to another Lexus dealership and recommend the same to any who ask.

40039,29-Dec-12,"I was here already 4 times, and tomorrow I am going there for the LAST TIME I WISH!!! The reason why it is the last time is these:

I was there for the first time at the 16th December, 2012. We chose one 2013 Lexus GS 350 with F Sport package. We agreed with the car and it's price at the same day. After agreeing in everything I asked them to give me their bank information, but they told me to get Cashier's Check in order not to wait until they receive the wire transfer.

The next day, December 17, 2012 morning we(me and my father in law) got the cashier's check and went to the dealership to get our car. We signed everything, did everything, saw our car again. And we told that we will pick up the car the next day.

I came with my friend to the store to pick up MY CAR, but they started to ignore me. Everybody in the office started saying that they told me ""Cashier's Check needs to be cleared after 10 WORKING DAYS!!! AND YOU CAN GET YOUR CAR AFTER THAT!!!"" which was a LIE!!!
I returned back home in SHOCK!

Next day I went to the bank, and got the statement. Took that statement with me to their office. The statement was saying ""MONEY WAS WITHDRAWN FROM THE CASHIER'S CHECK AT THE 18TH OF DECEMBER, 2012"" which was the next day when I gave them my Cashier's Check.

Yesterday, the 27th of January I told them that I will call my Lawyer and bring him with me. Even though, they told me ""You can take your lawyer and come to our office"", they even don't care about their clients.

I am calling everyday 3-4 times. Most of the times they even don't answer the phone. The salesman ignores me. The operator lady named Maya is also saying the same thing which Salesman says to me.(not only salesman, also a finance manager and the guy called Brian, who helped us to sign all the documents)

I told them at least to return my money back. They don't return my money or car back.

And now they tell me that they will give me my car at the 2nd of January. It will be 2013 and the car will be 2012 year produced. IT WILL  HAVE DISCOUNT ON IT.

I need some help to solve this problem! If any suggestions please send me an e-mail to this address: hajyatayev@gmail.com

I told him that the dealership was far, but I would make the trip over there if he could assure me , that the car was not involved in any type of collision.  I told him that I was searching for a new SUV and that I had been to several Lexus dealerships over the past few months.  I also told him if the car was clean I would purchase it. I was told that the car was clean and that their philosophy is that the manager would never sell a car, that he would not sell to his own mother.

I rearranged my schedule and drove an hour and a half to the dealership in the heat. I also had to bring my 2 year old son along.  When i arrived at the dealership, the car was parked in the outside lot. It had not been washed and was quite filthy. The color was black, which makes it harder to see the repairs. After examining the car, I noticed that the front bumber was not aligned. I also noticed that the paint on the door did not match and was not smooth. The salesman said the stickers were still on the door jamb, but they can easily paint around them. I left the dealership annoyed that I had wasted my afternoon.

I took the car to Lexus of Cerritos in March of 2017 and they replaced the dashboard. After few months the dashboard started making noise. It got to a point that the noise became very annoying. So I called the dealership and explained the situation. They made an appointment for the next day and even said that I would get a loaner car. Next day when I took the car to Lexus of Cerritos they said in order for them to examine the problem they would have to remove the dashboard and that by itself would cost me $495.
I explained to their service assistant manager, Sonia, that the noise comes from the dashboard that they have installed and I should not pay for them checking their poor workmanship. She talked to the manager and agreed to check the dashboard free of charge. And she said there were no loaner cars so I had to wait 3-4 hours or take an Uber, go back home and come back again. Since I live about 40 miles away, I decided to wait for the car. After about 45 minutes, their technician came and said since each technician is an independent contractor somebody has to pay for the work.  Lexus of Cerritos would not pay them and therefore I would have to pay. Once I said that I would not pay so they can check their work, he agreed to remove the dashboard and check the noise. Ten minutes later he came back and said he doesn't need to remove the dashboard and the noise is not from the dashboard, but the connection between the dashboard and speaker. A total nonsense. When they replaced the old dashboard they would have to disconnect the speaker and reattach it to the new dashboard. So if there was noise coming from the connection, it must have been because they did not connect it well. To make the long story short they refused to take responsibility for the lousy job they did.

I got the general manager involved and he just brushed it off and still dealing with this problem. They even damaged my leather seat in the process of installing the dash. I do not recommend this dealer for service or any continued business because they do not have a heart. Simply they give you the run a round.",6,55,-1

Today I stop ty to purchase 2 cars the GX460 and GS350. Mr. Maher (he pronounced: /My hair/) caught us first. He probably having a bad day and mis-communicate with me a lot, but I totally understand that. My friend has been dealing the car with the dealer and he got a deal $34k on the $35.4k price, so it's a $1.4k off. My friend asks me a favor to go and purchase the car from this dealer and helps him drive it back (SF Bay Area) for him since I'm traveling down SoCal. 

When we test drive, Mr.Maher seems not interested in things I say, just keep going on his own with an extremely aggressive tone of voice. But It seems he having a bad day so I'm not mad at him. 

Here the thing, when I come, Maher manager act as he doesn't know about the $34k. My wife, sister and I were sitting in Mr.Maher room, and Mr.Maher told us his manager summon us to his room, which to me is really rude to customer. I ask him that since we 4 all already here, why can't he come? Then Mr. Maher went to see his Manager, came back and said: ""My manager is busy right now"". Wow, busy that quick. Good job!

To me, I know that being a car sale person doesn't require a B.S or B.A but I doubt that someone could be a ""manager"" without one. However, Mr.Manager act as if he doesn't have one.

Hello my name is Pamela Drake and I purchased a car from your dealership on 8-6-2013. Allen Johnson was my sales person. He provided great service and was awesome with helping me choose the right vehicle. My experience at Lexus Cerritos was going great until I had to sit down at the finance department with a lady name Katina. She was very aggressive and unpleasant to deal with. She didn't explain much just was pushing the forms in front on my saying sign here, sign here. I felt very uneasy and was very upset and not happy with the way I was treated. At serval times I felt the need to just end the whole deal because of her very rude behavior and very bad customer experience. But because Allen Johnson has done such a tremendous job helping me that day I decide not to cancel. I felt very uneasy and disrespect as a customer. I want Lexus to address these issues with Katina and I would like some extra training for her in the area of customer service experience. I'm sure Lexus of Cerritos has received many complaints with this same issue. Until Lexus of Cerritos handle this serious matter. You will alway lose great customers because of Katina. ",6,55,43
40160,29-May-13,"I bought a Lexus from this dealership, and I have bought many cars from other dealerships in Los Angeles and San Francisco before, so I have had a lot of experience in how things work or should work when purchasing a car.  Shopping at this dealership was unquestionably the worst experience of my life in car buying.  For one thing, the salesperson was an arrogant, condescending jerk, acting as if he was superior to me because I am a woman.   Ironically, he kept on telling me that if I gave him an excellent review, he would give me a present, trying to bribe me.  
Also, Cerritos is about one hour and 30 minutes from where I live, and since I drove up there to buy the car, it was agreed that they’d deliver it for me.  I talked to the sales guy on Friday, May 17 to remind him of the delivery, and today, one week later on May 24, he was finally going to deliver it at 1:30 pm.  I called 3 times when it did not arrive and every time, the operator connected me to a voicemail.  And the one time I was able to speak to one of the managers, he said he’d call me back but never did.  Finally, at 3:30 pm, I called and began yelling “Where is my efing car?”  I then found out that it was still sitting in their lot!!!!  And when it got here 3 hours later, the driver said he would send me a voucher for a free oil change to make it up to me.  
That is all fine and dandy, but I will never shop at this dealership again.  Car buying has always been a fun venture for me because I love cars.  This time it was stressful, and exasperating, thanks to the Lexus of Cerritos.

Re:  Service appointment request for my IS300

Dear Management team,
On February 24, 2011, I phoned Lexus of Cerritos (877-203-0544) service line and spoke with a rather curt female to request an appointment for my IS300.  This woman asked me if I had ever had my car into Lexus of Cerritos before.  I have not and answered “no”.  Next she asked me for my VIN# in order to create the appointment.  Caught off guard and sitting in my office, I did not have this information.  She ungraciously informed me that in order to make an appointment I would need to have my VIN#.  Surprised I mentioned that “…the previous owner of my car had always serviced it at Lexus dealerships so certainly the car would show up in there system.  Once I brought it in she could check the number.”  Reluctantly she made the appointment  
Circumstances out of my control were such that I was unable to make that appointment.  On March 4, 2011, I once again phoned Lexus of Cerritos and spoke with a male about a new appointment.  A male answered and once again asked me if I had ever had my car into Lexus of Cerritos.  I said “no.” Next he too asked me for my VIN# and I replied similarly saying “I do not have it with me but the car has been there before with the previous owner.”  I was coarsely told that I must have a VIN# in order to make an appointment.  In order to navigate around this man’s customer hindrance I had to explain how another woman at Lexus of Cerritos already made me an appointment last week without the VIN#.  That wasn’t quite good enough and the unpleasant conversation continued to the point where the Lexus of Cerritos employee was speaking over me. I have an appointment for next Friday at 6:30 which I have no intention of keeping now that this all has soaked in.  Please cancel that post haste.  

After being pushed to annoyance with Lexus of Cerritos (without ever stepping foot on the property) I promptly phoned Lexus of Westminster.  Answering the phone was a delightful professional woman very happy to help.  She did not ask for a VIN#.  This is the Lexus service I expected.  In more than 20 years I’ve never once been asked for my VIN# when simply making a service appointment.  Volvo does not ask me for my VIN#, Mercedes, nor did BMW, not even the Saturn dealership I frequented in college request a VIN#.  My assumption now is that these two individuals have either been instructed to prevent appointments without the VIN# or are perhaps lazy and would rather not type in all of the customers details.  
In a down economy to be anything but uncomplicated and pleasant when setting up appointments with new customers is a very confusing customer retention practice.  Personally speaking this experience has prevented Lexus of Cerritos from ever handling my vehicles.  Furthermore I shall not consider any new purchases from Lexus of Cerritos, nor shall I refer to it favorably.  

This letter is not a request for resolution.  As far as I am concerned the situation was resolved by Lexus of Cerritos.  I shall never step foot inside of Lexus of Cerritos under any circumstances.  A copy of this letter has been sent to Lexus corporate and I will also be commenting on the community review website Yelp about my experiences.  Incidentally Yelp already shows 3 out of 5 stars for Lexus of Cerritos; a rather poor score for a company JD Powers routinely rates at the top of Customer Service in the US Market.  Clearly my opinion of Lexus of Cerritos is shared by many.

I am very disappointed because of the lack of customer service that was provided.  The unprofessional attitudes I encountered were unsatisfactory and unlike any other Lexus experience I’ve encountered to date.  In short, I can buy a car from anyone.  Lexus of Cerritos has made it abundantly clear that I now know at the very least, where I won’t be buying a car.  

Yours sincerely

Paul A Kaiser

Picked up car and sure enough sound was still there. I dropped it off and another advisor, Kevin confirmed within 4 seconds the problem. My advisor, Eddie, said I kept stating it was the axle.

They also lack the ability to at least educate themselves in regards to their own job.

Last oil change I was told by your customer service representative that I would be to have my brake fluids changed within the next service or so. He quoted me around $300 and I told him I would most likely do it the next time I came in. This time I came in and the cs rep mentioned nothing about the brake fluids needing changing but then gave me a list of over $800 worth of services she recommended.

It was 2pm and I had not heard back yet so I decided to call to get an update. I was then informed that the vehicle had been ready. Excuse me, so why did I get a call to inform me of that my vehicle was ready. I didn’t say anything and just picked up my vehicle. The next day (June 21), I hear the break still squeaking. I called and was told that Kevin from the service department was on the line and would I get a call back.

I explained the situation to her and she asked me to bring the car in again, mind you I had to get a day off to bring in the vehicle. at this point, I am frustrated because I asked for the day off work had to pay for two Lyfts and the car was not fixed which was the reason I brought it in the first place.

Wednesday my father and Brother go in to take the car. Eddie was rude to my brother and not answering him why or how long for the part to come. He avoids my brother and calls the sales man who sold the car, his name is Nardos (Nick). He was extremely rude to my family to a point where my brother told him back the F... up and they left.

I called and was told that they don’t offer rentals and that what they did provide was a one way Lyft voucher, I then mentioned that I had received a postcard with a rental offer and she said ok when you come in prove it. Then I asked how long it would be she said it would be around half a day. I said ok, thank you. I then call the 800 number and fortunately spoke to the same person that I had spoken to before and he called the dealership spoke to them and assured me not to worry everything is set up. I finally show up to my appointment and as soon as I let the service technician know I’m getting a rental he looks at me with disdain and was appalled then proceeds to tell me that I don’t need a rental and they don’t give out rentals for this type of Service.

The letter indicated that I would receive a notification when the parts arrived, so I could make an appointment. The first quarter came and went, and I never received a notification. When I called the service department, I learned that they had the parts. The service representative was not friendly and in a short and dismissive tone, told me that, ""Ford does not offer service for safety recall cars on Fridays."" I was stunned when I heard this! Fixing safety recall cars should be a priority at Ford: these defective cars can potentially cause an accident, as your letter clearly states, and endanger my safety and others.  
Then, when I took my car for service, Ford didn't want to pay for the Lyft driver because my work is over 10 miles from the dealership--my work is only 12 miles away from Glendale. In my opinion, this must be part of the ""free of charge service."" 

Finally, when I went to pick up the car, the cashier who called to get the car from the service department, was unfriendly and not even made eye contact with me once. She made me feel as if I had done something wrong for taking my car to fix the defect.

I always praised Ford not only for its quality of cars but excellent service. Now, I have nothing good to say: Since I bought the Ford Focus, I have taken it 3 times for service all related to the defect engine and CPV. And all three times, the service has been mediocre. I definitely, won't buy nor recommend to friends and family to buy a Ford.

I took my car for a diagnose again since they were not able to repair the shuddering transmission and long delay acceleration last time I took it, and for me to qualify for the settlement of the lawsuit I needed another diagnose. They had zero understanding, they just wanted to get rid of me and told me that now they had a new error code on the throttle body. And until I would not fix the throttle body ($1,200!!!!) they could not diagnose the transmission. For the record, the throttle body is a small part that costs $37 and a normal mechanic can replace in literally 15 min for $20.

I'm sure for basic service they're fine. When it comes to system updates or anything ford warranty related - they simply don't know what they're doing or have hacks to get around the system.

When this happened to me they held my truck and I had to fight to get it back in working order. The switched my person several times in the name of convenience, but the reality is they do this to change the story on you so that there isn't any accountability on what the previous person promised or said.

I was told it would be a simple update. No more than a couple of hours. Day one I was told it was the wifi, then i was told it was Ford, then I was told it was my truck. I couldn't afford to leave it with them as it's my main means of transport or income. So they made me wait two more hours to get it ready and updated. A week later I bring it and told the part is in stock and it should take no more than an hour. 8  hours later I'm told it's the wifi, then that it's Ford, and that I have to leave my vehicle.

41480,04-Mar-19,"I wasn't planning on writing this review but as I keep finding issues related to my car being serviced at Star Ford last summer I feel I should let others be aware as it continues to infuriate me. In July 2018 I took my 2018 Shelby GT350 with 7k miles in to have the engine replaced, it had a mechanical failure which apparently isn't an uncommon thing with these vehicles. It took nearly 3 weeks for Star Ford to even get around to inspecting the car and having Ford approve a new engine via warranty, I had to call in regularly to see what was happening as their level of contact was rather minimal.

After 6 weeks of the car being down I go to pick it up. This is what I find:

1) A nick in the driver door handle.
2) A nick in the dashboard.
3) A scrape on the rear bumper.
4) The interior was absolutely FILTHY with trash in it from working on the car and a layer of dust from presumably having the windows down for weeks at a time.
5) The driver side wiper was mis-adjusted too high and missing the cap on the nut.

Needless to say for a premier car by Ford I was thoroughly disappointed.

Now over time I have noticed other issues related to their work such as:

1) Damaged washer fluid hose from removing the hood.
2) Improper clips over the battery cover.
3) Steering wheel came loose while driving! For some reason they had to replace the clock spring behind the steering wheel when the car was in their hands, they obviously didn't properly tighten down the steering wheel nut. This is a serious one and could've resulted in an accident.

Frankly I am surprised the engine is even bolted in correctly at this point (maybe it isn't), needless to say I would avoid their service department at all costs. Maybe their sales team is fine but this would be the worst experience I've ever had with a dealer in regards to service.",6,55,6

I returned to service area and waited for 3 more hours til 10:30..
They finally brought my car and I was led to Parts Dept. to what I thought was pay for the 2 fuses that I know cost no more than $4 or $5 dollars.. to my surprise the total bill was $147... I was never told that it would cost that much.. I know it took only about 2 minutes to change those 2 fuses.., which are right on top of motor.. I told Seta that I could have done that myself in no more than 5 minutes.. She replied that “well, it’s already done!!”.. I went to the service center with a great deal of confidence in the workers.. I just went thru a severe heart operation and walked in there with a false sense of trust that I could get help with such trivial a matter.. it was 3 1/2 hours to change 2 small fuses which takes not even 5 minutes.
I understand the deductible part.. but even then, I was never made aware of what it would cost... I guess I was expecting friendly courtesy in making me aware that my suspicions were right and that I could just change the fuses myself.. Sooooooo disappointed..
I would hate to think that you are the type of establishment that would want me to install a new transmission when all it needed was a quart of oil..
3 1/2 hours to change those 2 little fuses .
$147 for 2 little $4 fuses.,.. and to top it all off.. the charging system still doesn’t work..!!!!!!!
It probably was never tested..!

People that showed up after me without an appointment were helped before I was (they said this was fleet service, but it was just a guy in a mustang).  I was then told they may not be able to do the repair and only the service.  I was not happy.  I was asked if I could leave my car overnight, and I explained that I was on call the next day and could not, but to no avail.  Luckily I ended up not needing the repair.  Also they didn't clean the car.  Everywhere I have been, a cleaning is part of the basic service.

Basically, I spent 40 minutes waiting to just get in for my appointment and ended up with a very basic service.  Not sure why I can't show up and walk inside instead of standing by my car.  Very lame and poor service.  Some of us have things to do besides waiting for service.

41645,09-Jan-19,"Selling absolutely quick. Think as you were dealing with scammer. After you signed the paper, you are done. No communication AT ALL after purchase. I bought car as promised, so I decided to buy it. Already over a month, and I still haven't receive replacement for my car because dealer said OEM is too expensive. So, I guess this dealer does not use OEM due to pricey on OEM. Imagine what they would put inside the engine, mechanical parts, aftermarket??? Of course, OEM is too expensive, so this dealer will try everything to get the cheapest, lowest cost possible. I know something is not right when signing the paper and wanted me to drive the car home because I am not in a hurry to buy a car, but I made a very very stupid decision. Now, I think I should better pay someone to inspect my car because OEM is too expensive from what the dealer told me. 

So, if anyone want to do one-time business, buy from Star Ford Lincoln. Otherwise, think twice before you buy from them. Like my co-worker said, ""You're screwed"". Yes, I am screw this time.

I’ve been a customer with this dealership for more than 10 years and I’ve bought three cars here but I had the WORST experience today with Freddy Camacho (financial manager).
1) Freddy was extremely rude and did not care about good customer service. He made me go home to get documents that he could’ve easily pulled up. 
2) Priced are not stable! For an oil change they charged me $48 the first time I came and WITHIN THE SAME DAY when I came back (with the documents Freddy was too lazy to look up) the oil change was now $58!!!

Ford even told enterprise where I was renting a car a few days.  They gave me 3 days on the rental.  Thank goodness for open ended contract, but I was paying for it. 
It took them more like ""several"" days to just diagnose where and why my car's gasket  leaked water into my car and verify my back up camera worked intermittently. 4 business days to do just that!  I called for update.  Ford rep left message without any info other than to call them back.  Phone tag ensued where I requested for detailed messages.  Several calls later only to find out it took 2 more days to do the job to just clean the gasket.  
900 dollars later,  including rental,  I got my car.  Got home and noticed they chipped my key!

I heard nothing from the advisors at 3pm. So I called to get a update and was informed it would need to be held overnight. This is what happened on the second visit and I informed them I can’t be a day without my vehicle as I use it for my work. They got me into a rental, but I was still responsible for insurance costs. 

I call the following day and my service advisor, Randy, is not in the office. This is his scheduled day off and he told me nothing of the sort. So the previously in the day as I was text messaging him through the system, I was not getting a response. That prompted the phone call, which I was informed it would need to be held overnight again. Finally at the very end of the third day, just an hour before service and Enterprise Rent A Car closed, I was told to come pick up my vehicle. 

No more than 24 hour after picking the vehicle up, the parking sensor issue is back and the infotainment is buggy. Bluetooth is constantly dropping and the screen freezes. 

I emailed Randy, no response. I called yesterday to speak to Manny or Randy, both were busy. I left a message for the manager to call me about my issues and I received no call back. It it now 2 days later and I’ve heard nothing.

Seta advised us to contact the service manager (Manny) so we sent him an email a week ago - no response.

41729,03-Dec-18,"After having some work done to my 2008 Ford Focus I noticed that the Anti Theft (PATS) system had been triggered and wouldn't allow me to start my vehicle.  After doing some research I found out that the only way to have it reset was to take it into a Ford service center.  I called ahead to see if/when it could be serviced and was told by the service rep that it could be reset for $145 and that it would take approximately 2 hours to do it.  I told the service rep that I would bring it in the following morning since it was close to the end of business that day.  Once I brought it in I met with the service rep with whom I had previously spoken to over the phone and he brought out the service tech who would be servicing my vehicle.  I explained all the parts that had been recently replaced and that the PATS system needed to be reset, hence why I brought it into the dealership.  The tech said that we may need to have new keys cut and programmed and if so then it would run me $250, otherwise it would be $145 just to have the PATS system reset.  I was then told by the service rep that it would take a couple of days because of how ""busy they are"".  Having no other choice, I left the vehicle with them and waited for their phone call.  After a day I received a call from the service rep.  He told me that they were unable to turn off the PATS system because another part needed to be replaced (the ignition housing switch) and that it would cost $700 for the part and service.  I asked if they could turn off the PATS system without replacing the part and he told me no.  This didn't really make sense to me so I told him I would come by the following business day in order to speak with the service tech himself in order to see what could be done.  After arriving the next day the service rep brought me to the service tech and I further explained to the service tech that all I wanted was for the PATS system to be turned off and didn't want them to do all of the extra work of trying to figure out why else the car won't start.  After saying all of that the service tech then told me that he DID turn off the PATS system but that the car still wouldn't start unless we replace the ignition housing switch.  At this point I didn't know what to think.  First I was told that they could turn off the PATS system, then I was told there was no way to turn it off without replacing the ignition housing switch first, then I find out that they did in fact turn off the PATS system like I had originally asked.  The service rep then reminds me that it would be $700 for the part and service and by this point I was just ready to leave.  I told the service rep I would have the car towed to a mechanic that I know and have him replace the part.  The service rep then said it would be $195 for having the PATS system turned off.  We got into a little back and forth because he originally quoted me at $145 for that service and all of a sudden it shot up to $215 (""he factored in my AAA discount, thus bringing the total down to $195"").  After a while he agreed to the original quote of $145 and I had my car towed home.  It wasn't until I got home that I decided to actually see if the car would start, and to my surprise IT DID!  I didn't even have to go through the hassle of having it towed again, but because the service rep and tech told me it wouldn't start I believed them.  I'm giving this dealership 2 stars only because they reset my PATS system, but only after a few days of hassle.  I like to see the best in people, especially in the service industry, but I can't help but feel like these guys were trying to make some extra money off of services that I not only didn't ask for but ultimately didn't even need.",6,55,11

We noticed the valve cover was leaking a bit of oil and brought it to the service advisors attention. He said it was just sweating. Then we hit a small rock and took it to Ford. The undertray was pretty torn, battered, and saturated in oil. So the service advisor recommended we bought a $400 replacement.

The first time I notice that the service rep did not explained services done on my truck so I was ok maybe next time, the second time I took my truck again I had to returned 3 times to rent a car due to the lock of customer service and the lock of correctly servicing my vehicle mechanically speaking as well. My truck was left on the roof of the parking structure with not only parts not working but windows open which causes for dust, tree lifts, etc. to go inside which I had taken to be detail days before, once truck finally given back after 2.5 weeks I had to speak with Manny (the manager) that promise me the heaven and the stars after I brought the issue to him that this will never happened again but guess what they just did it again today, pick up my truck as had to complaint to Angie, service department that other dealers have courtesy shuttle, she replied that they are only allow to use Lift but one way, unheard but finally she then send lift to pick me up this morning, got to the dealer with a positive attitude that this time my experience was going to be different meaning will be treat the right way... first after Angie at least took me to pay for service provided but never explained what was done nor at least a thank you, my truck was left outside under the climate, full of water due to the overnight weather, I had detailed it a week previous which frustrated me but thanks Lord Jesus contained myself then found inside the seat plastic cover laying on the passenger side along with the numerical tag on top of the dashboard so I said enough then I walked to Manny the manager to let me know that it was again an oversight ""again"". I conclude that this a pattern and that I should never go again since if this happened 3 times in a row that only tells me that Manny does not make his staff accountable
 sine the only question he asked me was "" what do you think I should do about it instead of telling me what he should do about it. 
I work at a hospital and believe I know about customer service as the hospital I work in has named 3 years in a row one of best 100 hospitals in the nation.

I approved this cost and then a few days later the check engine light was back on and my car quit running and I had to be towed to the Star dealership.  This time the serviceman told me that it was the coolant system and that I also had a gasket leaking for a total cost of $1500.  I had to approve it because my car stopped running.

So for a total of over $2500, my car is running.  I do feel like the first time that the engine light came on, Star Ford diagnosed my car incorrectly and I paid for a wrong fix.  I also didn't' need to have the gasket replaced because there was a very minimal oil leak but I felt that I had no choice.

So I walked through the arithmetic with him on one of the options, and it seemed like one was a good deal, so I agreed to it.  On my way home, I went back over the math and realized that there was a mistake in the arithmetic and it was a really bad deal (paying $900 for $450 of value).  I called Freddie immediately, told him to cancel the package, and returned to the dealership to sign the corrected paperwork.  Freddie had told me earlier that transparency was very important to them. However, not correcting the math error when walking through the calculation with him was not exactly transparent.  Brush up on your arithmetic before you go in, triple-check your calculations, and don't buy any of the optional maintenance packages!

While the MKZ Hybrid is a great car in itself Lincoln definitely has issues catering to their upscale customer experience that the other luxury brands do not. Unfortunately when it’s time for service for a Lincoln you have to take it to the Ford/Lincoln dealer where they aren’t capable of giving the kind of service and experience to a luxury car owner. This last trip to the dealer took them almost 3 1/2 weeks to get my car back to me for a variety of screw ups. The first time I brought the car in was for a broken seat so I got the oil changed at the same time and the next day they said come in your car is fixed. Of course they never touched the seat and had to bring out a tech who said he knew what part needed to be ordered which took another week to get and I had to bring the car back then. So now onto the 3/12 weeks of nonsense next, supposedly the part that came in the first time was not all they needed they had to order another part. Then a week goes by and that part came in broken I believe it was. Then they reordered another week goes by and supposedly they got the wrong part. In the meantime I get no calls from Seta their one and only Lincoln service advisor because apparently she is so busy to keep her clients informed on what is going on with their cars. Seriously I am expecting to get the car back maybe the next day after the parts come in and then days go by and nothing. I have to call or email to get status and of course we apologize for the inconvenience and I stay in their loaner car which is their only saving grace! So onto the last week when I call days after the part was supposed to be in she tells me the part they need is on backorder!! Wow so I ask her how long will it take to get it and Seta says parts dept has no idea, this was on a Wednesday and then only 2 days later I get the email my car is fixed. Wow I am shocked because only 2 days before the part was on backorder with no one having any ideas when the part was coming in..right! Personally I think they jury rigged the part because the seat still has a part on the side that makes a new noise that was never there before. Also all 3 times that my car was in for service over the last year it always took them one week to fix each item seriously!

Instead of addressing the problems.He went into a long LECTURE, ON Black VEHICLES. The more you looked you would find more marks,and stains.

41998,01-Sep-18,"After purchasing 4 Lincoln Navigators from Star Ford, one would think that they would receive prompt and courteous service.  Not the case this time.  Over the past two months, I have spent over $10,000 in repairs.  My last repair:  Brought the car in for a diagnosis and repair.  After being told that the repair was $199.00, I was relieved.  Then I was told they missed the cut off time for a part so had to wait another day.  Then told the part didn't arrive.  Then told the part was defective.  Then told the bill would be $1400 (all via email btw).  Then heard nothing from the dealership for days.  

I reached out to Alex Tamez, the General Manager, via email to voice my concerns.  No response.  I left him a VM on Thursday.  No response.  I left him a VM on Friday.  No response.  I went to the dealership and left word with reception and service department that I""d like to speak to him.  No response.  

Apparently, he doesn't care.",6,56,34
42002,18-Aug-18,"I have NEVER been to a dealership who promised to save me so many dollars (with never clarifying how many dollars they were going to save me) and proceeded to run my credit rating before even talking price let alone settling on a price.  Now I have a hard inquiry on my credit report and was made an overpriced ""deal"" for a new 2017 car when the 2019's are already out!!!  I went to a different dealership, Galpin, and received a much better price for a new 2018!  Galpin's entire staff was professional and courteous.

42003,09-Jul-18,"Took my non working Keyfob in, they said it was probably batteries and that they would not check the key fob unless I purchased new batteries.  They sold me a CR2032 (normally a 2.99 for 2 batteries everywhere) for over 8 dollars for one.  When the fob still didn’t work they said they would try to reporogram it for $145.00! in less than 5 min they came back and said that the FOB was broken and I needed to buy a new one.  Total cost for programming and new fob WITHOUT cutting the metal key was $363.00!   I asked for the old broken fob back and they said they threw it away as normal procedure, but when I insisted they got it out of the trash and gave it to me.   That night I went home stuck the supposedly broken key fob into the slot in the car and followed the reprogramming instructions in the manual and the old key fob reprogramming worked just fine.  Really, $145 for that!  I don’t even think they tried to reprogram it!  They just lead you down the path to milk you for every dollar they can.   I plan to go back tomorrow and try and return this new keyfob and complain about how I was able to program that key fob in 2 min, when there service department told me nearly immediately me that it was completely broken, and then took over an hour to program the new one they forced me to buy.",6,56,46

If I can use the machine it won't cost anything'.  I didn't have time to do it that day because there was a wait so I went back today.  This time when I hand the SAME service adviser (Charlie Garcia) my key and ask to have it done he give me an estimate of $130.  I complained and he said he would 'try and do something on the price for me'.  I let them do the work because I had wasted enough time already trying to get this done.  When he the work was done about an hour later he said he knocked the price down to $110.  Thanks a lot, for only ripping me off for $65 instead of the $85 you had planned to.  ($130 - $45).

42010,15-Oct-16,"Sales:
I tried to purchase a vehicle in April from Star Lincoln in Glendale, CA without avail.  I went in with printout of the same vehicle (identically equipped) from a local competitor with similar miles and said ""If you could come within $500 of this price, I would rather purchase from Star as it is closer to my home.""  They tried to explain that it is not the same vehicle when was clearly the same except for the color (black vs. red).  I am a realist and understand not all deals can be made based on a number of variables.  They did not want to make the sale, so I purchased from Vista Lincoln (GREAT dealership!) that evening. 

Fast forward approx. 30 days ..... 

Service:
I took the vehicle I purchased in for service as there was a suspension/steering issue.  They said they fixed the issue and replaced a strut.  After getting it home (nearly 10 days later), one issue was fixed and another created with the steering. I brought it back that week and another part was replaced.  Got it home and the same issue was there (approx. 10 more days later).  I made an appointment, brought it back and another MAJOR part was replaced.  Got it home, same issue existed.  
By the sixth time I brought it back (yes, 6th!), and after being in one of their loaner cars for over 30 days between May 1 and September 30), I was told ""the noise/feeling is normal.""  This was after multiple service advisors and the service manager (Manny) all sat in the vehicle and agreed prior to taking the vehicle in that there was an issue.  It took a call to Lincoln customer service to start a complaint process to get anything moving forward.    
The General Manager at Star Lincoln in Glendale, CA and I connected and he asked if I could bring the car by so he could personally drive the vehicle (Alex).  He was very nice and genuinely seemed as if he cared.   I drove to the dealership and he drove the vehicle and agreed there seemed to be an issue as he never felt steering like mine in another vehicle.  He asked what he could do as I explained that I had an appointment to bring the vehicle to another dealership for another opinion.   He said he wished he could have one last shot at it as he would ""personally oversee the repair.""  Again, he seemingly seemed like he wanted to figure it out, I agreed and he whisked me off to service and put me in a loaner minutes later.  Approx. seven (7) days later, he informed me that the issue was ""normal"" like the tech and Service Manager said.  He was very nice about it, but I knew he was wrong and was nearly infuriated and frustrated at that point.  In my mind, Lincoln would never be able to compete against the other luxury brands with dealerships like Star and I gave up.  I wasted enough valuable time and was on my way to trading the car in for a Lexus which is what it replaced.  I never had such an issue with Lexus (or Audi, Nissan, Honda, Chevrolet, Infiniti, etc.).  
After sharing my disbelief with my assigned customer service representative, she suggested that I bring the vehicle to another dealership for one last opinion as her hands were tied (at this point, I was ready to go to arbitration per the Lemmon Laws in California and actually started filling out the paperwork).  I chose to give it one last try and brought it to Advantage Lincoln in Duarte, CA, where they took me in with open arms.  After actually listening to what I had to say, they found the part that was causing the issue and replaced it.  Less than one week later, I had the car back and guess what, it was fixed! Moving forward, I am driving 25 miles out of my way to service our two Lincoln vehicles at Advantage as they earned my trust, respect and ultimately, my business.  
While all this was happening, I had my wife's vehicle in for service at the same time (we were expecting our first vehicle back by this time) which is under factory warranty.  They did find that her battery was weak and needed a replacement, but wanted to charge us over $160 to replace it.  Had my wife picked up the vehicle, she would have paid, but luckily I asked ""why would we pay when it is under warranty?”  It turns out the service manager did not check to see if it was under warranty.  Really? 
At the end of the day, Star Lincoln in Glendale, CA has fundamental communication and systems challenges to overcome as they are greatly flawed.  Things happen in business, I get it.  This situation was simply ridiculous, avoidable and probably due to the laziness of people who did not want to take the time to find the real issue.  After reading a number of reviews on this dealership, it seems to be a common thread.  
I can say that Vista Lincoln was GREAT to deal with on a purchase.  As a person that has owned 24 vehicles in my lifetime, I have seen the good and the bad from the Midwest to West Coast.  Vista Lincoln was open, honest and genuine from the get go.  Not like Star Lincoln in Glendale, CA.  
I can also say that based on my experience with dealership service departments, Greg at Advantage Lincoln in Duarte, CA is world class.  He communicates with the customer, provides updates and is honest about his findings.  Not like Star Lincoln in Glendale, CA.  He earned my trust to the pint that I said “If you tell me the issue is normal as Star Lincoln in Glendale, CA  stated, I will admit I am wrong an 10 dozen doughnuts to the Star Lincoln in Glendale, CA service department as an apology (I can admit when I am wrong).”  As you read above, I did not have to buy the doughnuts as Advantage Lincoln in Duarte, CA found the issue on the first try.  
I would not recommend Star Lincoln/Ford in Glendale, CA in any capacity.  Buyer beware.

Star was unwilling to work with me about providing alternate transportation, cover rental costs or anything.  Whenever I called, they had to ""get back to me"".  Which they NEVER did.  There had been THREE delays in delivery.  No apologies, no offers of compensation.  I had no guaratee that there might be more delays, and be kept hanging.  Customer service is below the 1 rating.

Finally I look up Bill's extension and call him directly. He immediately answered even though ""no one is available in that department."" I ask why I haven't heard from him and his reply was ""what time did I say I would call? I don't recall."" He then proceeded to tell me what his ""technicians thought"" was wrong with my car. It's already 4pm and they don't have an actual diagnosis for the car because ""we think your battery is dead and your ugh low on gas"", and they have not started work on my car. Even though there was no diagnosis for my car because even though they are a dealer they can't jump my battery, Bill here still tried charging me the $150 diagnosis fee.

42147,26-Sep-15,"When I first went to this dealership on 9/3/15  I was shocked and ecstatic to be driving a new 2016 Ford Fusion with a payment budget that worked for me and my family. I was amazed that Ford Fairfield gave me $4300 in rebates and traded in my old car  which covered down payments and the first payment.  I am scheduled to make my first payment on October 3.  I was also told that a Lease agreement was a better option for me to help build my credit.

What has since transpired is straight out of a tragic comedy routine and not a good one at that. I was contacted by a Finance Manager (22 days after driving away) by the name of Matt yesterday at 1:30 in the afternoon (an hour before I was scheduled to go to work) and subsequently spoke with the Finance Director Kenny Calderon after several attempts to actually speak with this individual. Their reason for calling was to tell me that funding had fallen through and that I needed to return my new vehicle to their dealership (in fact was demanded to return by Matt), unless I was able to secure a
 co-signer who has more credit than myself or the car will be repossessed. 

How can a car be repossessed when the first payment is not due yet and not late??????

What dealership runs a business like this? Why was funding not secured and in place before I even arrived at this dealership? I did all the online application requirements.  I was assured repeatedly by Adam Herren, the Sales Director (who I had been dealing with before even stepping foot into the dealership) that all was taken care of. I even spoke to him the night before and was told that funding was still all set.

WHAT is the problem up there? Do you have any idea the amount of strife and emotional turmoil and panic that you have placed me and my family through and nobody seems to give a rip up there, all I am told is it's just business!  I am left with no car for my family because our trade in has already been destroyed.  Our family is now faced with having to walk to and from school and work, because we are being threatened to be completely without a car now.

And why was I able to get the car fixed up with ______ and NO ONE said anything to me while I was up there at the dealership then??

We are not getting any real answers from anyone because every time I call and ask for this person or that person that helped me on that first day, I am being told ""they are no longer working here"".....right down to the General Manager!!!   

Am I caught in the middle of something???  

Why am I not even given the opportunity to make a first payment to Ford Credit whom I was told held the lease.  I am left in confusion by all of this.  I don't know what to do, who to talk to or who to trust.

I will never ever recommend this dealer to anyone I know and will be telling everybody not just people I know but everyone that I come into contact with about how this experience at FORD FAIRFIELD was totally life changing in one moment and a Nightmare the next! 

I even did a Yelp review on their behalf and this was the response that I was given:

42163,10-Aug-15,"Things started to go downhill after a great experience here. I knew I should have waited a month before posting my first review...

After a week and a half with the car I noticed my so called ""factory tint"" started to peel at my back window. After close inspection, these were not factory tint as my interior had water marks that I had to wipe off. (The marks reappear when you wet them by the way.) So, I had to bring the car in for Jeff Perkins to see. After ""speaking to the manager"" he pointed me to a local window tint shop called Pacific Sound & Protection that did the tints and told me he had no idea that the tints were aftermarket. I know, I should have inspected the vehicle before delivery but I trusted this dealership to know what they are selling. Honestly, I would prefer the tints to be removed and have another place of my choice to install them professionally at the dealership's cost.

Then this week I get a letter from the DMV called ""Notice to Suspend Registration"" on the car that I traded in because DMV says I have no insurance on it. Duh, it's not my car anymore so I transferred my insurance to my new one immediately. Of course calling the DMV with their ""stellar"" customer service didn't help but them pointing fingers at me that it was my fault. So I called Jeff Perkins about the situation. He told me he was going to make a phone call and then just hung up; I'm sitting there going ""hello?"" Since the letter gave me till Sept. 14 I decided to wait on any response. The next day I received an email with a subject ""DMV"" and a message ""Lisa should be calling you today."" I have no idea who sent that email because that message was literally the only thing in the body of that email. Two days passed and I responded to that email that I have not received any phone call what so ever. Then another 24 hours passed till I get a phone call from Lisa who left a voice mail that the Notice of Transfer and Liability was sent on the 27th; a week after I handed over my keys to this dealership. I have a feeling this is not the end of this.

Now, I could have sold my old car and get a better price than what all dealerships would offer. I know that for a fact but I didn't want to deal with the DMV part and obviously I had to deal with it anyways... Now that I read a few of my fellow Yelpers on here it seems this place has DMV issues.

Oh look I just found a bubble on the passenger window tints today, great...

42197,11-May-15,"I bought my car from Ford Fairfield. The buying process was excellent, they didn't pressure you, they gave you time, and it was easy. However when I started having mechanical issues with my car, thats where the problems started. I use my car every day to drive to work, and i bought a new car so i wouldn't have to worry about not having a car. So I took my car in, and it was going to be in the shop for at least 3 days. They told me that a loaner car was not available because they don't do that. I had bought the car less than 6 months ago and they were going to leave me without a car after buying a brand new one. I fought for nearly an hour with the service advisers before they finally caved in to give me a loaner car. They had the car for 10 days, then after getting it back, less than two weeks later I lost my electric steering and had to take it back. I lost the steering due to them failing to put a ground wire back on properly. Again, I had to fight for a loaner car to get to work. 

Less than two months later i had the same problem with the ticking. I took it back to Ford Fairfield. This time they would not allow me to have a rental car or a loaner, even after fighting them, so I will no longer give them my service.

42343,12-Oct-14,"I have been to the dealership for service 4 times and to purchase a vehicle once. First service they overlooked a major problem that should have been evident. Second service they took the fuel filter out instead of the oil filter. They also left a double gasket on the oil filter. Third time they serviced the transmission and left something loose and it leaked all over. Had to bring it in twice to fix this problem. Fourth time they only changed one of the 2 filters and were going to roll it out charging me for changing 2 filters when they changed one. Ordered a new truck but it waited 5 weeks before it was actually ordered. Several times I was told it was ordered but it wasn't. Then finally it was ordered but it was ordered wrong. Increased the oil change prices to almost double. Refuse to honor other quick lane purchased warranty.

42383,03-Sep-14,"I purchased a brand new 2014 Ford F-150 FX4 and got a great deal.  The experience was great in the beginning, but then it all started bad when I had to come back at 400 miles with a broken Navigation and Bluetooth.  My audio module in the truck was bad so the service department at Ford Fairfield fixed it and I never had the problem again.  I only had the truck for 2 days and had to give it back to them for 4 days so they could repair a brand new truck.

I didn't start having problems with the truck again until at 4600 miles my check engine light turned on and my truck was accelerating poorly.  I then had to race home from work and take it to another Ford Service in Novato.  They determined after plugging into their computer that multiple codes came up that related to the wiring in the car.  After having the truck for the next couple days, they determined it was a loose harness so they took apart all the wiring, checked the connectors and then put it all back together.  They then drove the car for 90 miles and released it to me saying no errors came up when plugging the truck back into the computer.  I then drove it for another 500 miles and three days later the same problem occurred.  I then drove the truck up to Ford Fairfield where the service department is now trying to figure out what is wrong with it.  

I brought these problems to sales at 400 miles and 4600 miles where I told them I wanted a new truck because this truck was already having so many problems.  They proceeded to work with me but concluded that they couldn't help me any further and I would have to take it up with Ford.  They attempted to run some numbers on getting a new truck for me and buying my current truck back but told me the value had dropped on the truck.  This would, therefore, increase my payments to almost double paying for the same truck with no problems.  I said I was not going to do that and we would have to work it out.  They were nice enough to give me a loner truck for the time being but forgot to mention it was a 2 day loner.   After the 2 days was up, I was told by the salesman that sold me the truck they couldn't work with me on getting me a new, safe, working truck.  He  also proceeded to tell me he needed the loner back and I proceeded to tell him that I work in Dublin and had no way to get the truck back until the coming weekend.  I was then told they could report it stolen if I didn't return it and I told him to help me out because there was no way for me to get it back.  I eventually got this matter worked out with a manager who was able to get two drivers to pick it up no questions asked and apologized for the experience.

To sum this all up, the buying experience at Ford Fairfield after I started having problems was absolutely HORRIBLE and I would never buy a truck or car from this dealership ever again.  I know it was not their fault that the truck they sold me was having all these problems, but as a dealer you are supposed to keep your client happy and help them out anyway you can.  I have been told constantly by sales at Ford Fairfield that they can’t help me, but in order to keep a client you have to help them when there is a problem any way you can and not dismiss them.  Unfortunately, this didn’t happen and I will never go back to Ford Fairfield to purchase a Ford product.

I though transmission was making a clunking noise and service told me they reset the computer control on the transmission.  Did not help.  Took it to another Ford dealer and was told the problem was actually with the driveshaft and Ford had issued a bulletin to dealers making them aware of the problem and providing a fix for this problem.

42685,04-Nov-11,"You, and Ford Motor Company, deserve better.
Working with this dealership has been one of the most frustrating experiences of my life, with the sales and parts departments and dealership management proving themselves to be idiots or imbeciles time after time during the month that we tried to purchase a new car through the dealership.
During the summer I ordered a 2012 Ford Mustang GT from Ford Fairfield. In early September I was told that the vehicle was being off-loaded in Benicia, and should be ready for pick-up in the next day or two. Two weeks later it finally reached the dealership. 
Once at the dealership, three standard ""dealer installed accessories"" needed to be installed to complete the vehicle (these were standard parts that are shown at ""build and price"" section of the Ford website, and the accessories were spec'ed at the time we ordered the vehicle). When we first arrived to pick up the vehicle, none of the accessories had been installed. During the next few weeks Ford Fairfield tried to get us to accept accessories other than what we ordered, argued that the standard vehicle already included the accessories and otherwise lied and mislead us. Four times we were told that the vehicle was ready to be picked up, and four times we showed the salesman the parts that were missing - even going so far as to show the sales manager the parts on the Ford website and show the salesman the parts on other vehicles on their lot. Four times we walked away without the car since it was not as ordered.
The sales manager blamed the parts guy, but after weeks of addressing the same problem, that excuse was no longer believable. 
We contacted the General Manager of Ford Fairfield to voice our dissatisfaction with the way his organization had handled the delivery of the vehicle. While he was astonished to hear about our experience, and promised to investigate further, we never heard back from him or anyone at the dealership. 
Everyone makes mistakes, it's how you handle those mistakes that determines your reputation. Sadly, Ford Fairfield has shown that they are incapable of providing a vehicle as ordered, or taking the steps to get the vehicle completed and ready for delivery. Their salesforce is ignorant of the standard options offered on thier vehicles, and their parts department is equally ignorant and unable to provide the correct parts to complete a vehicle. 
There is no way that I would buy a $10 part from these imbeciles, let alone a $35K vehicle. If my experience is any indication of the competence of the individuals at this dealership, I  imagine the service department is equally incapable and can not imagine letting them put a wrench on my vehicle.
So, really, you're going to spend $20-50K on a new vehicle. Would you rather spend it at a dealership run by and populated by idiots and imbeciles, or go elsewhere and work with honest, intelligent people who will take care of you and appreciate your business?
Please don't spend your money at Ford Fairfield - and let's hope Ford Motor Company fires this dealership group and gives the franchise to a group / organization worthy of all of our business.",6,57,631
42708,15-Jan-20,"This was the 1st time I've ever bought a Mazda and it will be the last. Maita Mazda on Auburn Blvd in Sacramento is the worst. DO NOT bring your car there. Paul, one of the salesman overcharged me 3 times, then had to go back once I explained the details. I brought it in for an initial problem with the engine. I bought the extended warranty, everything should have been covered. He tried to charge me for that. Once the major work had been completed I got my car back, but the navigation didn't work and there was a rattling under my dashboard. I had to bring the car back into the shop a week later to get those fixed. He tried to charge me $140 to diagnose the issue. When I explained to him there shouldn't be a charge because it was their fault, he looked through his notes and took off the charge. (No apology). They did not give me a loaner car even though both issues were their fault. I paid $40 for UBER to get me back to the dealership. They said the navigation still couldn't be fixed because their main guy was out. I brought it in a few weeks later (7am appointment). Paul once again tried to charge me to diagnose the issue. The guy called in sick, so I had to reschedule again! I had to make another appointment, which Paul said he would call me. A month later I had to call because Paul never called. I spoke to another person and made an immediate appointment. I spoke with another salesman who said they would look into the issue. After waiting 30 minutes, Paul came over and said they don't know what's wrong and they need to call Mazda. He wanted to charge me another $145 for diagnostics and said it would take at least 4-5 hours to figure out the issue. I told him to go xxxx off and give me my car back. I wouldn't give them a dime because he tried to charge me 4 different times and never got back to me about anything. This entire process lasted over 6 months. FIRE Paul!

He gave me a higher price than he quoted me previously on the email (it's $1,500 different). His reason was the previous quote was for hatchback. However, I confirmed the price is correct before I came to the dealership.

I brought my brand new Mazda in for the apple car play agreed to have my car washed while it was there. They took about 3.5 hours with my car. When I came back to pick up my car, they pulled it up and it was dirtier than when I left it. When I said something the service writer said sorry it was under a tree when your drive the dirt will blow off and ran back inside. When I got into my car it was filthy, there was no respect for my vehicle. I couldn’t stay and deal with the issue because of time constraint, however I called them on my way home only to be on hold by service department. I called back and just told the receptionist to have them call me when they are free. Once at home I went over to passenger side opened my door and my seat was never put back together the plastic pieces were just left on the side of it between the door. I also hate a chip of paint on the door handle. Even more furious I called back again and they were still too busy to discuss the issue. Instead I fixed the seat myself and I am having the chip in paint fix else where but I’m never going back to this dealership again.

42792,30-Nov-18,"I brought in my Mazda 3 for a check engine light on a Saturday, and was told that they were closed Sunday so they would start work on Monday. “Fine”, I thought, thanking them and taking the complimentary lyft back to my apartment. “Couple days without the car, I’ll just bike places.”

From this, though, we spiral downward. Monday slides by without a single call, voicemail, email, or text message. I call after getting off work. “Oh didn’t you get my phone calls?” Nope, I didn’t. “Oh we’re having an IT issue.” 

This, I can only assume, means that the issue is they didn’t do IT (pun very much intended). But we press forward. “We did the diagnostic and it’s a recording issue, the technician said the test drive was fine so we’ll finish it tomorrow.” Oh, fantastic, price doesn’t seem out of hand, great I can pick it up tomorrow at 2.

Tuesday rolls around. No phone calls, no nothing. 2 comes and I call them. Again. A new rep picks up the phone. “Your rep isn’t in today, so we’re going to do the diagnostic today and it should be ready for pickup tomorrow.”

Excuse me what? I could’ve sworn we just did this. Now, slightly worrying I’m trapped in a Groundhog Day situation, I ask what he means. “Oh I don’t know, it’s not my file so I’m not sure what is being done on it.” I mean, sure, but how about we don’t tell the customer that we have no idea what’s going on.

“We’ll give you a courtesy car though.” Fine, whatever, I just want my car back. I go to pick up the car after I get off work, and meet rep 2. He begins sassing me for not having my insurance on me, since like a normal person I keep it in my car, especially when I don’t have a thought that I’m going to need to get a courtesy car. Huffing and puffing he helps me get the courtesy car.

Now we hit Thursday through Monday, where we have nothing but silence. So I call. Again. Rep 1 is back. “Didn’t you get my calls?”
Yeah, you didn’t call me. At all. “So the issue wasn’t the issue, and the technician says that he didn’t actually do the test drive. But he isn’t comfortable doing it until you replace your wheel bearings, so $900 and then we can try to fix the problem. But don’t worry, we took the price of fixing the not issue off the bill.”

What. The. Absolute. H.E.L.L (edit: I guess the swear filter decided to pick this up. Funny, I thought I was self censoring this.)

Now we get to me being angry. “You’re telling me that not only do you not know what’s wrong with my car after having it for a week, but now to find out I have to spend almost a thousand dollars before you’ll even do it? And on top of that, the technician who is working on my car and telling you things is lying about the work he’s doing on my car?”

“Oh, yeah, that sounds bad...”

Now I have to speak to the manager. I used to work customer service, I hate being the “let me speak to the manager” guy. And these idiots are making me do this.

“What’s the problem sir?” Insert almost verbatim repetition of above comment. “I’m just as angry as you are sir.” No you aren’t, but I’ve been there you’re saying the same things you’re supposed to. “I’ll have my foreman look at it. But he isn’t in today.” Of-flipping-course he isn’t. “But I’ll call you with information tomorrow morning.”

Uh huh.

Tuesday morning, no phone call. No nothing. 11:30, I get a text. “We’re working on the diagnostic now.” Isn’t it funny how now the wheel bearings aren’t a problem? “I’ll give you a call in a couple hours with the results.”

Uh huh.

That night I get another text message (see: things that aren’t phone calls). “Issue resolved, we are going to make sure it’s fixed but the car will be ready tomorrow.” I ask when I can expect his phone call. “10 am.”

Uh huh.

Wednesday morning comes and goes, and now it’s later in the day. My phone rings. It’s Rep 1! “Your car is ready for pickup, total bill is $240.” Isn’t that just fan-freaking-tactic?

I get off work, I get to the dealership. It’s close to closing, and Rep 1 says “didn’t think you’d be coming in!” 

The last of my brain cells slowly seep out my skull as I struggle to say “yeah I had work, and your call was later than I expected.”

Rep 1 doesn’t notice any of my popped blood vessels, and keeps going. “As I was getting the paperwork together I noticed how bad it all looks. So we knocked it down to $140. But hey, we gave you the same estimate to fix the wheel bearings if you want to come back!

I pay. I get my car. I leave. The words “as I looking at the paperwork I noticed how bad it all looks” ring in my head. They haunt my dreams.

I give this dealership a 1 out of 100, as in “Give me 1 good reason to ever come back to this terrible excuse for a Mazda dealership.”",6,58,223
42844,16-Oct-18,"I normally work with Christian @ the Mazda Maita, but he was out the day I needed my car serviced. Two odd alerts continued popping up in my dash, two of which the manual said were emergent issues and to be serviced immediately. After the 3rd time this occurred in my vehicle, I decided to bring it into the dealership. Paul, whom I have never worked with, vaguely explained the situation and did not guarantee a fix as this wasn't a consistent occurrence. He said if it takes longer than 10 minutes to isolate the issue, that he would indeed need to charge me $145 for the labor. (10 minutes of ""looking"" = $145). I then asked him then what would I need to do to make sure that these lights didn't pop up again? Paul said I would need to just bring the car back in. I told him I would take a loaner car as his next availabe appointment was @ 715am the following day. I get into the loaner car; there is less than a quarter tank left and the car is dirty with past passenger trash in the vehicle. I figured the less than quarter tank would at least get me to and fro the dealership to home to work back to the dealership. No, not enough so I fill the tank with $15. I get off work expecting my car to be done as my appointment was at 715am. It is 2pm and I am approaching the dealership. Paul answers the phone and says the car has not even been worked on as my battery died the night before? The night before? If the battery died the night before (unbeliavable as my full car check up said my battery life was good), why didn't he call me the NIGHT before? Why did he wait until i called him to PICK UP MY CAR? I had explained to him the night before that i would not have any service as work as I work in a hospital, so that anything that needed to be discussed needed to be doneso the night of or early morning before. Paul said he called 4 times and left 1 message. I did not have service. Calling did nothing. So because my battery died he had to wait to isolate the issue and look into my car. I was frustrated and explained to him that because of this, I now needed to fill up the tank with an additional $10 to just get back home and back and that with this I needed to purchase a $150 battery. My total spent on this car BECAUSE the lack of communication and lack of professionalism cost me over $300. THe issue? The battery was ""dead"". So now apparently all the emergency lights are fixed and they still charged me the ""service charge of $145"" because it probably took barely over that 10 minute mark where if it took longer than 10 minutes, they still charge. Paul wasn't there the day i picked up my car, so i explained to christian my frustration. he apologized, yet still did nothing about reimbursing me for the gas that i had to pay for. Paul explained that some passengers don't filll up the tank so that is why the gas was so low. ...So I have to pay for other drivers gas?? A $35 worth of gas? Unbelievable. I really enjoyed coming to Maita Mazda for my car services, but I am positive I was overcharged hundreds of dollars and also positive that they have no regard for the customers as they did not apologize or reimburse me for the gas of other car loaners.

Unfortunately a few days after taking this lightly used vehicle home I noticed that the stereo control panel was unresponsive, none of the buttons responded to being pushed and I was unable to change the radio or select a different audio source. I immediately called the dealership and was told to call back to schedule an appointment (I live in SF, the dealer is in Sac). A few hours later I got back in the vehicle but this time the control panel worked, being optimistic and not wanting to spend a whole day driving out to Sacramento I called the dealer back and said that I thought it was working again. The issue persisted into the next few days and I decided to just bite the bullet and go back to have it fixed. I called Taylor directly and explained the situation, after going back and forth with mechanics and various others at the dealership it was decided that because i didn't buy the $1,200 extended warranty they would not be able to help me. Essentially the dealer had sold me a poor product and was refusing to stand behind it and fix the situation. I expressed my dissatisfaction to Taylor and he said he would get me in contact with someone else at the dealership. After not hearing from anyone for a few days I sent him a text message with no response and wrote an email to the dealership (also no response). I highly recommend that anyone considering Maita save themselves the trouble and buy from someone else. The feeling of forking over 16k to a business and then having them refuse to even fix your radio a few days later is not one i'd wish upon anyone. Happy car hunting!",6,59,-1
43235,15-May-16,"I was referred to Maita Mazda via the Costco Auto Buying portal.  Although I was contacted shortly upon submitting my inquiry, the people who reached out to me were none of the folks listed in the email confirmation from Costco.  One identified themself as the ""Costco Director"" while the other, although claiming to be a Costco sales rep for the dealership, seemed to be part of the regular sales consultants.

Later that morning, I decided to go by Maita Mazda since I could get an oil change while I was there, and check in with their Costco director.  I did check-in with my contact.  We weren't interested in a test drive that day since we knew what we wanted, and unfortunately, there was nothing on the lot that interested us.  I told my contact what I wanted to see if I can get a Costco dealsheet.  I was told since they didn't have anything in stock, they couldn't produce one, but basically the Costco deal is $500 off invoice.  Unless you are getting a car in high demand, you can get $500 off invoice if you sneeze at a car lot, so I was surprised at how underwhelming the Costco deal seems as portrayed by the staff.  I had previously purchased a Mazda 2 year ago through Costco at a dealership in Roseville and knew from the deal, the Costco price was so good I bought the car on the spot.

While I was there waiting for my car to finish its service, another roving sales person approached me.  I told him I was just there for a service, and he flippantly said something like ""fine, I'll buy it back for a trade-in.""  I am perfectly happy with the current Mazda and didn't appreciate the hardsell.  I told him I was already working with the internet department to make him go away.

Before I left the dealership, I let my contact in the internet department know that I am interested in obtaining one if they can get it or get more in their inventory.  The next day, the other sales person who originally emailed me called again to see if I was coming in and I told him I was already there yesterday.  He tried to get me back in the dealership again, but I made it clear that because of work and family obligations, I didn't plan to drive out their from Davis just to chitchat.  If they had my car, then fine, otherwise, it would not be a good use of my time.

But over the next few days, this guy kept calling and emailing me, which eventually led to him texting me.  I contacted my internet rep to let them know that I'm fine working with either them or this other sales guy, but they need to figure it out who's to be my point of contact.  Again, I emphasized what I was looking for and asked to be notified if they get that or more stock for me to consider.

In case the Costco deal was truly underwhelming and not just a misrepresentation or poor representation of the savings by the dealership, I decided to try another online car buying portal called TrueCar.

Through TrueCar, I was networked to the Mazda dealership in Elk Grove.  I reached out to them by email on a Monday morning, and casually exchanged emails with their General Sales Manager throughout the day.  It was low key and no pressure whatsoever to get me out to their dealership.  Using the Mazda USA website, I thought they had a similar vehicle to what I was looking for, but when I asked, they told me it was their error and that vehicle was unavailable.  I told the sales manager what I wanted, and within the hour he responded to tell me it was available in the region, and he can get it transferred to Elk Grove by the next day.  Without even committing to the transfer, the sales manager was willing to explain to me the TrueCar deal and break down the costs for me.  I confirmed that the deal being offered would be for the vehicle that wasn't even on their lot yet, and was told yes.  When I agreed to the fair price (which I was able to confirm beforehand through other sources), Mazda of Elk Grove was able to transfer the car the same day and arrange for a pickup for me the next day to finish the deal.

This was a deal that could have potentially been done through Maita, but because they seemed wishy washy and was more focused on getting me back on the lot rather than working with me online to make the deal happen at a fair price, they turned me off with their overbearing nature and hardsell practices and drove me into the waiting arms of Mazda of Elk Grove.

43310,10-Sep-15,"I'm usually not the person who takes time to write a ""negative"" review online. But this was my first car buying experience in USA and it was the worst. I am extremely unhappy with the quality of service and want to voice my opinion on this forum.

I had been researching on new compact and midsize cars for a couple of months and decided to get a mazda. I test drove a few cars at a couple of dealerships and decided to go with Maita Mazda, Sacramento. The salesperson, one Mr. John Reid, was not at all responsive and seemed so uninterested in selling the car. 

I finally got an appointment from this person to complete the purchase process and he said he would be there. On the day of the appointment, after I left for the dealership, he ""texts"" me saying that he may not be able to make it. I couldn't believe that a salesperson can be so irresponsible failing to provide the customer sufficient notice before trying to cancel the appointment. However, he was able to make it and was late to his own appointment. By this time I was a little doubtful about his interest in selling me the car. He was callous in taking my details for the credit application and after an additional wait for about half an hour, came upto me and said the car was gone and that somebody else bought it. This can happen to anyone so I tried to ask if there was a chance for a dealer trade. 
At this point, he started making passive aggressive comments while he was talking to me and my friends saying that I lost a perfectly good deal by being late in making a decision. I ignored it and waited for the dealer trade option.  I felt so unaccommodated at the counter that I wanted to leave . After an hour long wait, he came to me and said mazda doesn't finance people with an immigrant visa. I confirmed this over phone before I made an appointment and he said everything is absolutely fine. It seemed like he was trying to find reasons to send me away..lol! 
He told me it would take him a day to get back to me regarding the financing option. 
I never heard from him again after that. It almost felt like he knew the car was gone but just didn't care to inform me about it. Maybe he thought he could sell another car to me on the spot..I don't know. I DO NOT RECOMMEND this dealership to anyone or at least I advise caution while choosing the salesperson you deal with.

I got my newborn baby ready and drove all the way down to the dealership. When I got there it was a different CX5 from the one I picked out and my payments were $100 more than I wanted.

But, some of the folks in parts and service side need to be replaced.  I had to take my 2010 Forester in 3 times to correct an issue with the interior mirror that had become loose and would vibrate and clunk while driving.  I would point out the issue and the techs were able to duplicate the problem.  They even went as far as to replace all parts of the interior mirror, except the part that was bad.  

On my visit last weekend, they finally corrected the issue.  After living with a loose and rattling up mirror for 15k miles.

Last weekend I also decided to purchase wiper inserts from the parts counter so that I could install them the following day.  I left the counter with the front two inserts and had wanted to replace the rear one, but they don't stock the part.  Anyway, the following day (Sunday) I attempt to replace the inserts and low and behold, I was sold the WRONG PART!  I guess it's too much to ask for a dealer to supply the correct wiper insert.  So, I called the office and found that they are unable to do anything about it until later in the week because the parts department is closed.   The lady who answered the phone less than understanding and didn't appear to care about the issue.

I event went as far as to write the parts and service manager through Maita's website.  It has been a week and i have not received a response.  

I WILL NEVER VISIT THIS DEALER AGAIN.
I WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANOTHER SUBARU AGAIN.

When picking up my car, I talked to Roy Wells, who was friendly and pointed out that the car wash seemed to have ""missed"" one side of my car (there were in fact new streaks on my car, which I assume happened during the servicing). I did not have time to stay an additional 30 minutes for a new car wash, and so I left with a car that was dirtier than when I came in.

He said that my back breaks were completely gone, down to the metal and that my front breaks were already past the point of being okay. I thought this was really weird because I had not noticed the slightest change in my breaks, not one of the typical warning signs of having low/bad brakes have been noticed and if I was down to the metal then I should hear some form of squeaking/grinding right? Or am I wrong here?  He told me it would be $299 to change out just the back breaks. I told him I could not do this at the moment but to please make a note of it for me. He calls me back and tells me that the manager wanted him to double check with me to make sure that I did not want to change my breaks because it was critical that I do it and that they would charge me just $199 for doing the back breaks but that $100 discount was only available to me at that very moment and would not be available if I went back another day. I still said no being that I felt my breaks were fine. A few days later I took my car to someone else to check it out. I told them I needed new breaks. After they took my car and began working on it they came back to me and asked why I thought I needed new breaks. I told them what happened at Mazda and they said that my breaks still had quite the miles left in them and that it was not crucial for them to be changed right away for in the near future.

Star Mazda's only benefit is their competitive pricing. Other than that they are as sketchy as you imagine a call dealership would be.

We found a Mazda CX5 on their lot with low mileage and a fair price. We wanted to trade in our car and put down a significant down payment. We weren't able to agree on a trade-in value and so my wife and I left the lot without purchasing the car. Later that day they called and came up some on the trade-in. After researching other Mazda dealerships, we believed that the price they were offering was the best amongst all the Mazda dealerships.

The next step was to negotiate financing for the remaining balance. My wife and I are very fortunate and we both have credit scores over 800. Since this wasn't a new car, we didn't have the option of 0% financing. They offered us a very high rate and wouldn't budge much. So we went to Capital One, which is our credit card company. We found a more favorable rate and actually negotiated some additional perks through our CC by going with them. Star Mazda said that they couldn't go any lower. Star Mazda is a preferred dealer with Capital One, so it should be an easy process.

We called our salesperson at Star, told them the rate we negotiated through CO and said we wanted them as our lender. Get the paperwork together and we'll come in the next day to sign. They agreed and we were off. 

Next day we went into the dealership to sign our papers and take our car. Our salesperson was fine. He had been as helpful as a salesperson can be. While waiting Don McCurdy, the Finance Manager, we updated our insurance to reflect our purchase. During that process we were asked by our insurance who our lender would be. We chose Capital One and were presented with addresses to match our lender. We asked our salesperson to verify with Don the lender address. He told us the address that Don chose.

Then we were ushered into Don's office to complete paperwork. This is when it got really interesting. We were there with our 10-week old baby. She's the reason we were upgrading to a larger car. She was in a stroller. Had already been there 45 minutes. She was getting a little fussy and Don asked if the baby was a girl or a boy. We said a girl and he said, ""Oh yeah, girls are the fussy ones. I have three daughters.""

Which fine, not a big deal. Sort of a playful dad banter. Then he goes on to say that his daughter got married this past weekend. We congratulated him. He said, ""I didn't go. She had wanted me to walk her down the aisle but she said she wanted her mother to walk as well, so I refused.""

Then he rants about his three daughters. Rants about how he used to have a female dog but now he has a male dog and it's so much better. Female dogs are terrible.

He looked at our credit score and saw that my wife had a higher score than me and said that it was unusual for the women's to be higher because ""women have more credit cards than men."" 

My wife has an MBA in finance. She is very good with money. In fact, she's the reason I even have a reasonable score. Once I told him that, he asked what my wife did and then belittled what she did. My wife and I continued to look at each other, like xxx. 

We signed and left. We were just happy to get out. We got nearly everything we wanted, so it was a win.

A week later we get a call from Wells Fargo saying that they were the owner of our loan. We thought it was a prank call or someone trying to get us to give them our personal information. So we called Don to get the scoop on what was going on. He didn't return two calls and voicemails.

So we called the store to ask for a manager. They verified that the loan was in fact sent to Wells Fargo, not to Capital One. So the benefits we negotiated were out the window. We spoke with a few managers that weren't very helpful and finally, Don called. He got on the phone with my wife.

He told her that he bundled us with a less favorable loan. At least that's what she got after talking over him because he refused to let her speak. He told her ""not to get excitable"" on the phone. He then told her that he decides where the loans go, she doesn't. 

Needless to say, we're waiting for Star Mazda to change our loan or to at least apologize. They aren't doing either.

If you want to go to Star Mazda, just be aware that they are pretty sexist. They are extremely dishonest and they don't care to have your input when it comes to financing a car. They believe that THEY DECIDE. Not you.",6,59,-1

I am really emotionally distressed since my last night experience in this dealership.
Please please please watch out about this dealership and do not deal with them.
So this is my story….
Last night after spending 8 hours looking for a car, finally we found a pre owned car in this dealership. On the sales tag that was displaced on the car windshield, the car was advertised with limited warranty for 3 months after purchasing. The salesman was a very professional and a nice man. He helped us and answered all questions we asked. We did test drive and decided to purchase the car. 
First of all, we wanted to purchase the car full amount with my credit card without going through leasing or financing with them. However, somehow they were pushing us to pay with my personal check (since they didn’t want to be liable for the percentage the credit card charge them to be extra expense for them). After going back and forth with their nonsense request, then they finally agreed to accept the payment with my credit card!!!!
When we start signing the papers (after 1.5 hours in there), the finance manager put a new sales tag (that says there is no warranty for the car) in front of us and he said “by signing this form you are informed that the dealer sold this car as is and the dealer doesn’t have any responsibility toward this car” !!!!!!!!!!!!
We were surprised. We told him that probably he made a mistake because the initial sales tag on this car was offering limited warranty (for 3 months) on the car. The finance manager denied it and he said there was no warranty on this car from the beginning. 
I called the sales man and asked him that if the car initially was advertised by limited warranty or not and the salesman admitted the limited warranty was included.
The salesman was very surprised and went to the finance manager. I heard that the finance manager was very rude to him and shut him down very disrespectfully. I heard that the finance manager said that they made a mistake to put it on the shield initially and now he decided to not provide the warranty any more.
I went back in the room and told him that even if it was a mistake, since it was advertised that way to the costumer from the beginning, they should honor it to their costumer. 
He rudely raised his voice and told me that he won’t give the warranty back on the car and either I take the car this way or the deal is off. So I refused to sign it and I called off the deal. 
I asked him to give a copy of all papers that I signed for my record (including that 3 months warranty form that initially I signed it in front of the salesman before I went to finance manager office to sign the rest). 
However the finance manager refused to do that. He gave only one and kept the rest. I asked him again politely to give the copy of the rest of the papers to me. I told him that by law he is obligated to give me a copy of any documents that my signature is on it, however, He refused and all of a sudden he stood up from his chair and insulted me by saying ” Get the F… out of my office or he is going to that”.  
I was so shocked that my whole body starts shaking since I never ever been to any place to purchase something for my entire life that an employee treats his costumer that way. He stood up and screaming at me to leave his room. Of course being a 5’5’’ petite female, I felt very unsafe and started recording the rest of the conversation. He kept saying I won’t give any paper to you and leave my office, get out of my office. I went directly to the manager’s office and told him what his finance manager done and he didn’t even get up from his chair to apologize or stop his unprofessional behavior. The only he did to pick up his phone and called that guy from his room and tried to calm him down.
The only person that looked so shamed and shocked was the salesman. He walked out with me and apologized for all the things happened. 
I am still emotionally distressed and so in shocked for their behaviors that I am not even feel confortable that my contact information/singed documents are is still in that company (dealership). 
I really recommend to you not even consider purchasing anything from this dealership because of their upper management team (Department manager/finance manager) are so unprofessional, disrespectful, unprincipled, unreliable and untrustworthy people.

Please “BE AWARE”

44190,08-Jun-18,"We arrived at CJ Mazda when the light on the dash of our 2015 6 Grand touring indicatied we needed to check our battery management system. Everyone was friendly as usual and offered to check. After examination we were told that they were unable to see if our iloop was working properly, because their $4000 machine was broken and the dealer did not see the value in buying a new machine since the iloop has been discountined. Also, they were unable to tell us if the battery was the problem, since they didn’t have ONE $450 battery to replace ours  At that time we were told to go to another dealer that had a working machine or another battery. 
Up until this day we were planning on buying our next car at Mazda, but we are reconsidering. Our vehicle has only 50,000 miles on it and had my daughter been driving it cross country (like she has) to school, and this had happened....I would want to know that the dealer would find a battery at another dealer, take a battery out of a car on the lot, take my car on a truck to another dealer that has a working diagnostic machine or give a loaner vehicle. 
Warning; do not purchase the additional bumper to bumper warranty, as thus far nothing has been covered or honored under this agreement including peeling finish on the wheels that we paid extra for.
Now we are left to find a solution on our own. ",6,59,25
44191,05-Jun-18,"I was previously very impressed with the professionalism of your service center when

44241,15-Mar-18,BAssam brought me to tears. I have never been treated so unkindly in my life. I would have walked out but I wanted to buy out my lease.,6,59,80
44248,17-Feb-18,"Before I begin, I bought my Mazda from CJ Wilson and the sales department was great. I have also been taking my leased car there for service for nearly 3 years and have always had a great experience, but today's was awful.
I had an appointement for my 5K mile service at 1pm. I arrived at 12:50. It was a bit busy so I didn't mind that my service person finished up other customers and took calls while I was waiting to get an estimate. The junior service person assessed my car and three tires were in the yellow and one in the red. I asked how much the tires were and they were about $200 each. I told the service person I would want to buy two tires today as long as the mechanics found nothing major wrong with my car. The service person said we would start with the basic service and see - and he would call me to let me know if they found anything. I stated again I would want to put 2 new tires on the car. I went to eat at the cafe next door.

Normally, I get a call in a half hour with the service person telling me if anything was found. I got no call for an hour and 45 minutes. I've never even waited that long for service. I called at 2:45 and the person answering the phone said they were just taking my car to be washed. I said I didn't want it washed and no one had called me about being able to put two new tires on the car He said he'd get my service person to call me back. I waited another ten minutes and he never called so I walked back to the place and the junior service person said they were taking my car to be washed. I said I didn't want it washed after and hour and 45 minutes and I didn't even get the option to put two new tires on. The sales associate finally came in and he said, ""looks like they recommend new tires."" 
This made me furious. I told him I arrived at 12:50 for a 1pm appt and her said they would call me after assessing my car - now my car was all serviced - an hour and 45 mins for just the 5K mile service - and it was 3pm! He said he doesn't know why no one called because he went to lunch. I told him that he was my serviceperson and he should have seen to it that he handed over instructions.
I was so mad I said I just wanted to pay and leave. I went to stand by the very nice and understanding cashier while I waited for my paperwork. As I was walking away, my service person told his colleague, ""It's really not my fault no one called."" That was the last thing I needed to hear!
To add insult to injury, I gave my service person a $10 discount coupon that he didn't even include on the total for my service! I noticed when I got home - on my bill - and when I called, the cashier said I'd have to talk to my service person. I just couldn't do it - so I paid $10 more for my service as well.
I now have to go somewhere else to find tires for my car and wait while they get put on another day. I probably won't get the higher quality tires they have at Mazda - but it is not at all worth it to go back there when I shouldn't have to go back in the first place.
I also have no idea now where to get my car serviced. I either have to drive to Thousand Oaks now - or get my car serviced by a non-Mazda place. 
This has been such a bummer experience - and I don't know what to do when the next 5K miles rolls around.",6,59,-1
44259,22-Jan-18,"I recently posted a yelp review about my experience in September 2017 when the service department failed to reattach correctly a service access plate on my Mazda MX-5. The plate worked itself loose two weeks after my service and nearly caused an accident while I was driving on the freeway.
With the help of AAA, I brought the car back to CJ Wilson Mazda, which reattached the service plate correctly for no charge.
While I have heard of negligence by other auto service centers (forgotten screws, bolts, etc.), I feel that CJ Wilson Mazda service department did not consider their mistake with the seriousness that it merited. This attitude leads me to believe that such negligence could reoccur. Even though this service center is conveniently located for me, I will find a different dealer for future service.",6,59,569
44266,27-Dec-17,Agreed upon a price with the salesman via email only to find extras on the car when we actually went to buy it. We traveled a couple of hours to buy the car to get the good deal and was hit up with $600 of extras like window etching and clear coat garbage. Would not remove charges and had the entire family waiting in the car. Turned an otherwise good experience to one that felt like somewhat of a scam. An awesome purchase price quickly turned into just an OK price. Buyer beware.,6,60,-1

44359,27-Jun-17,"Kevin seems like a genuinely good guy, sweet man, family man. I've spent over 7 years in sales so I get how a shameless, sleazy office culture can seem normal once you're part of it. I purchased a 2016 new Miata grand touring, electing to finance. I was shopping around on cargurus and auto trader. CJ Wilson's price was discounted but $1,000 above another dealership. Kevin says he has approval to match and beat their price. He texts me I'll be saving $5600. I told him I'm not driving to his location to save only $1 or $10 because the other dealership is 20 miles closer. We talk and text during the day and he says I'm going to be very happy with the price, but he can't guarantee an exact quote over the phone. In good faith, I let him run my credit. My FICO is 792.  
Example 1: At the dealership, time to talk numbers. He quotes me $5 less than the other dealership. This is also less than the $5600 in savings he texted. He says sheepishly, ""but that's why I'm taking you out to lunch after.""
Example 2: re: numbers. I'm wondering why my monthly payments are as much as they are. FICO is 792 and I'm putting down more than $2k which should cover taxes and licensing. He says we're either going to get you on a large downpayment or we're going to 'get you' on a high interest rate.

Wouldn't you be insulted by this xxxxxxxx? Why would I want to have lunch with someone that just screwed me in any way?  

Example 3: human error. The dealership is suppose to give you 2 keys. Somehow one of the keys was for the wrong car. Kevin took a picture of the overnight package, but didn't send it till I, as the consumer, took responsibility for the expense to ship the key back. Does that seem professional to you?

Again, I do think Kevin is a good guy, and he probably doesn't think he did anything wrong. Because 'we all need to get paid' and 'that's just the way things are'. I get it. ",6,60,-1
44362,26-Jun-17,"If there was a zero star I would give that rating, even below zero! In June 21st, 2017, I took my Mazda CX-5 2016 for oil change and a regular service. Jennifer from service department aggressively took over my car once she knew I might trade in my car for a new CX-5 2017. She wouldn't release paperwork to me, she kept saying it is not your car, it is not your car! I was telling her I have not made a deal yet and it is my car give me the copy of the service papers but she refused!  Bennie from sales had invited me for a promotional plan to upgrade with no penalty release of my lease on my Mazda CX-5 2016. He told me I have equity on my car and I need to bring in my car for him to give me a payment on a new car. When I met him that day he introduced me to Heather Massey the sales person and said she'll help you. I asked Heather how much equity they want to pay on my Mazda CX-5 2016, and how much the monthly  payments would be on a new Mazda 2017. Heather kept going back and forth to Mahmud the general manager's office and eventually came back with a piece paper on her hand saying that they would pay $950 on my 2016 as is and they will pay off the remaining lease meaning I do not need to make any payments in June and I will pay the payment at the end of July for the new 2017.  She said my payments will be $410/ month.  I told her that my car is clean, in a very good shape has low milage of 11056 since we leased it in Dec 2015 and I had an allowance of 15000 miles per year. Heather went back to Mahmud's office and came back saying that's what Mahmud is paying for my 2016 car $950 as is, I wouldn't pay anything for that car and they would pay for the remaining balance on the lease.  Regarding the payments I negotiated with Mahmud and he agreed to bring down the payments to $390/ month on the newCX-5, 2017 and he agreed to the rest of the foregoing.  Since it was late, they kept my old car not to put milage on it Mahmud said and I went back home with their loaner car. The next day, Heather called and said my new car is ready , so I drove back to Ventura to CJMazda. It took two hours for Mahmud to prepare the lease agreement. Heather kept saying they are going to give you all the paperwork at the end when I was asking about the trade in of my CX-5, 2016 and the amount of $950 equity documents and how it is going to be applied on the ending of this lease and starting a new one. Heather kept saying they will give you that in the finance department, when from the beginning I was asking for it.  Eventually Mahmoud came and took me to Andtew the finance guy's room and said he will have you sign the lease agreement while he sat next to me and took every piece paper that they asked me to sign with himself to his room and it took more time for him to come back with an envelope handing me saying these are your copies, When signing I asked Mahmud how much did you purchase my old car and he never mentioned anything about negative equity and never pointed out that he had not applied that $950 equity promised to me. He said you don't need to pay June payment on Mazda 2016 any more and we will pay off the remaining lease balance. So the first payment  on the new car was waived. Also, your 35 payments for the new Mazda 2017 will begin in the end of July.
Then they made me to pay $2000 as a down payment on the new Mazda 2017.
Exhusted and drained from this slow paced tedious process eventually I left the dealership with the new car! 
Once I sat in the car, I had a gut feeling that something is off, therefore, I started reviewing the lease but I could not find the $950 equity for my trade in in any part of the lease. Immediately, I contacted Mahmud and asked him where did he apply the $950 that was promised to me for my old car's trade in. Mahmud started yelling at me that you had no equity on your car, you had negative equity and he pointed out for me to look into number 4 the part that had the breakdown. I couldn't believe it that he had duped me in this way, the negative sign was hidden on the line of the paper and he had put $1911.00 that I owed on my old car which then he had added to the price of the new car!  I told him that this is not right and it is not based on what we agreed upon my trade in because if Mahmud had told me he wants to give negative equity on my old Mazda 2016 I would never ever agreed with this deal to trade in my Mazda CX-5 2016. My car had 11056 miles on it and I kept it clean, it was running great and with no accidents. The value of complete similar milage Mazda online is $27,000 and Mahmud has given a trade in purchase value of $22,000 then has made me liable for the $1911.00 and as I said added that amount to the value of the new Mazda 2017. 
Such shyster and violent person that when I went back the same day (June 22,2017)to the dealership (CJ Wilson Mazda Ventura) for him to rectify this fraudulent lease he hid in his office, Heather lied again that he is with the customer. Heather lied saying that they had never offered me $950 equity on my old car. My daughter over the phone had witnessed our conversation with Heather and I had discussed the $950 equity with my daughter in front of Heather while we were sitting at her desk! Heather blatantly lied and denied ever telling me about $950 trade in and later she became vicious towards me and started verbally abusing me yelling that I am disgusting! I called my daughter to join me in the dealership(CJMazda Ventura) because I felt threatened and alone under attack of Heather. Mahmud never came out of Hiding in his office to resolve this matter. I found the used car manager to discuss what had happened to us that day. Heather was standing outside his office looking through the windows telling me I am disgusting, then she began video taping with her phone and giving me looks, shaking her head and harassing my daughter and I. Since the dealership was closed we got up to leave, Mahmud showed up talking to Heather, my daughter felt scared so she asked the used car manager to escort us outside to our car! Meanwhile, Mahmud joined Hearher bullying  us and verbally abusing my daughter. On our way out, Mahmud violently invaded my daughter's space while telling my daughter she is disgusting! Then, while pushing us out vehemently slammed the door at my daughter's face while she was going out! I wanted to call the police and report Mahmud's assault and violent conduct, verbally abusing us, but my daughter said mother lets go home once she saw that I am drained and traumatized from this whole ordeal. 
(I am told by my doctor that I should avoid stress because I am heart attack prone) so that my daughter was afraid for my health condition.  Therefore, we left feeling blathered and abused that night and still after six days past we feel damaged and hurt! I wake up at night with heart pulpitition and my daughter cried for what she witnessed that day her mother and herself being verbally abused and attacked by Heather (sales person) and Mahmud 
(general manager) at CJ Wilson Mazda  Ventura!
We have consulted an attorney and we are told that definitely Mahmud and Heather has used deception in making sales and trade in which is illegal and fraudulent!
I am writing this in the hope that others will read it and no one would fall prey into the lies and deceptions
 of Mahmud and Hearher in CJ Wilson  Mazda Ventura. Mahmud is definitely a shyster and a crook using his position to defraud trusting people Like us.He is violent, obnoxious and unprofessional! He hid in his office and did not come out to talk amicably with us instead he yelled at me, verbally abused us and violently slammed the door at my daughter's face!  Mahmud should not be in the management position that he is right now at CJ Wilson Mazda Ventura because he doesn't know how to be civil and interact with customers. His gang like appearance and behavior frightened my daughter and I , we regret ever going there!  If Heather and Mahmud showed their true face in the first place we would never set foot in CJ Wilson Mazda Ventura let alone buy a car from them!
Therefore, I urge customers not to fall into Mahmud and his accomplice Heather's trap and be fooled by their false friendly smiles because once they set  their claws on you their true face and true color which is so ugly and evil comes out! If they did it to us, I am sure they have done it to others too. Buyers Be Aware!  Don't go CJ Wilson Mazda because they will dupe you and abuse you and take advantage of you in the process of purchasing or trading in your car!  Definitely not worthed to go through what we went through with dishonest low lives such as Mahmud and Heather at CJ Wilson Mazda Ventura!

44379,01-Jun-17,"I took my car in for a scheduled service on Tuesday- later in the day, I received a call that one of the front tires had a nail in it and the tire could not be repaired.  It would need to be replaced with a  new tire at just under $300 for one tire. I opted out until I could check pricing elsewhere. When you are a senior living on a fixed income $300 is a lot of money- imagine my surprise when I took the car to a tire service business to get a quote for a new tire from them and to discover they would  not only just charge  me half what Mazda would but during their investigation- they found no nail in any of the tires. Tires were fine. Needless to say, I am not feeling very good about CJ Wilson Mazda.

My husband is ill and had he been the one to take the call when it came in about the tire, feeling as he did, he would have told Mazda to go ahead and replace the tire. I am just thankful it was I who took the call.

Jennifer Lange was very helpful, Explaining to us how to correctly work several of the many features that the car has, features we had not been able to figure out. So many thanks to her-

44520,26-Sep-16,"My wife went to you dealer with check engine light.  I was told over the phone that the code was P0128 ""coolant temperature below thermostatic temperature regulating temp"" and that both a coolant control sensor and the thermostat had to be replaced.

There was no attempt to diagnose the problem as one time event due to a long down hill coast that brought the coolant temp too low for a short time.  That could have been done by re-setting the code and driving a short distance.  The service people refused to re-set the code.  

I beleive the service department took advantage of my wife, since she was on a trip and did not have any other options.  The description of the problem was over-exagerated and I believe we were ripped off with an unnecessary repair.  This code appeared a few years ago and was re-set at the Santa Barbarsa Mazda dealer and never re-appeared until this time.

Victor could not explain how the dealer would use the Warranty, but emphasized that we would be billed for repairs.  Finally Jennifer intervened, found the Warranty online, and set up the service.
We left the car over the weekend to wait for parts.  On Monday, I never got a call letting me know when the car would be ready.  When I called in the afternoon, Victor told me he was ""waiting to get paid"" from the Warranty, and I had difficulty finding out when my car would be finished.
Customer service was poor, as we were not greeted when we arrived (2 representatives ignored us at the service desk, then one told us they were ""multi-tasking"" and would get to us later).  When we picked the car up, Victor gave the completed paperwork to the cashier without reviewing or discussing the service.  We were left to find the car out in the parking lot ourselves.
In the end, we paid for diagnostics which we believe were covered by the dealer Warranty.  The recall was completed to our satisfaction, but we declined to have the dealer do repairs because of poor customer service and communication.

I went here, even though I live 45 minutes away, because this was a better deal than what I could get where I live. When I arrived, I was told tire rotation was an extra $20 and I needed it done. That's the same price I could have paid at home, so I was already annoyed. I wasn't told this on the phone. Then, I waited an hour and 40 minutes. They tried to get me to pay $390 for some things I could do myself for less than $100. I said no. Left. Got on the freeway and my steering wheel was shaking like crazy. It felt dangerous! I can't believe they let me drive away like that. I immediately came back and they then realize (somehow not before I left) that I needed my tires balanced for an extra $70. I was so annoyed and had already been there so long, that I just said no. Reverse my tires back. It took over an hour. Again. I did get my $20 back, but what a waste of time. I won't be back here. I bought my car here but no more servicing here. 2 stars because the lady who helped me, named Jen, was so friendly. ",6,61,-1

Made it clear that I will be buying a top end luxury car but am just researching as I've got 6 months til the VW is done. and I'm yet to decide on the Model S, LS, A8l or 550. Id even asked him to get my details so I could test drive an E class with the upgraded suspension - he never took down my info.

Less than 40 minutes later, he calls to say my car is ready.  Im surprised at the cashier with a $604 repair bill.   The service rep tells me it costs $202 in labor (less than 40 minutes) to change a battery.  Really?!  Dishonest!  I ask what the hourly labor rate is and I'm told it's a flat rate.  Hmmm....I wonder what the CA Bureau of Auromotive Repair would think about that one!   The Setvice Advisor tries to tell me it's an exhausting process and the seat must be removed.  Dishonest again!  Maybe he should watch the 8 minute YouTube ""How to"" video to see how it's done.  Yes...it took only 8 minutes and the seat does NOT have to be removed.  First...I was told it was $247.

I had my 500SL in for repairs and when I picked up my car there were scratches/dents and the back tail light was broken and not once did they mention it to me.  I am well aware they had hoped I did not notice.  Upon returning my vehicle to the dealership a second time, I was lied to by Alex Flores.  He was the most rude person I have ever dealt with.  He should be fired, as he completely lied to me about the repairs to my car and this is the kind of representation they present.  DISGUSTING!

I selected Mercedes Benz of Long Beach because it was my closest dealer and I assumed prices would be similar at all dealers in the area.  The man in the parts department quoted a price of $259 dollars which was higher than the price I had been quoted elsewhere but since I would save time, I was planning to pay that price.  Then he explained that after the key arrived, it would be necessary to bring the car in to have the key programmed -- another $65 charge.  That would be a total of $324 for a lost key.  I challenged this fee and was told it was Mercedes policy.  Then I refused on principle and left.  I then contacted Laguna Niguel who had quoted $250 for a lost key and asked whether there would be a programming charge and was told no.  

I recontacted the parts dealer at MB of Long Beach to point out that they were absurd in their pricing and was told that MB of Laguna may be different because there is a different owner.  I pointed out the reason they told me about the pricing was that it was Mercedes policy.  

Later I decided to contact MB of Newport Beach, expecting the highest price, and was surprised to learn that the cost was $234 with no programming charge.  

In addition to the price differences in the area, MB of Long Beach said it would take three to four days from the time I placed the order, MB of Laguna Beach said it would take two days, and MB of Newport Beach said it would take one day if the order was placed before 1 pm.

I contacted him again a few weeks later to see if he may able to find a car with my preferences (I had previously clearly indicated my color and option preferences and the model year). He asked me to call him so I did, thinking he was able to locate the car.  Instead he told me he has another car with a different color with many more options than I wanted and at a much higher price. All he kept insisting on was for me to meet with him at the dealership.  When I asked him about the invoice price, he arrogantly responded by saying they never discount the price on this type of cars.

I found his dishonest attempt at bait and switch was extremely insulting and infuriating.  When I let him know that I was displeased by his dishonesty, his response was ""did I promise you a 2016?"". It's people like this guy that makes me despise dealing with car salesmen.

I had a very bad experience with DTLA few years ago and had thought the situation had improved; it clearly has not.  I will never approach DTLA Motors again.

If you are looking to buy a car, steer clear of this dealer since they are not willing to offer a good deal while many others would.  Rusnak, Fletcher Jones, and House of Imports were all much more responsive, straight forward, and they all offered me at least $12,000 off.",6,62,-1

And still my car isn't fixed!! This was a no brainer- I show up with my car in the condition it is in, usually I get a laundry list of things to do and quotes so that I can have it fixed. Since Ball Honda is closer to me, I figured it will be easier for me to have my car repairs done there, and I wont have to stall any longer on getting my car fixed.
I chose to go to this place over Pacific Honda, because it was closer and more convenient for me to get to. I was hoping to get some parts covered on my existing warranty and then pay for the rest of the damages that my car has. They haven't bothered to go over any of the additional items that need fixing and replaced, which for a supposedly reputable car dealership is pretty strange. They dont want my business, which is unfortunate and looks bad on them. Thanks for judging and discriminating towards me, I really appreciate it.",6,63,-1
46826,24-Jun-16,"This dealership lost one key transponder for our new Honda.  First we were told the key was misplaced, and then they said it was secured in a mechanic's locker for the night.  The next morning they admitted it could not be found.  We asked that the new car be reprogrammed and two new keys be provided.  They agreed and kept our car for over 4 hours (we were told this was a 40 minute procedure.)  They said they would deliver the car to us.  Then they said they had no one available to deliver the car.  We went to the dealership and they tried to give us two keys.  Unfortunately, they were the same transponder code - meaning they did not reprogram the car... they simply did what was cheapest and easiest for them.  The made us wait hours to add to their ruse while they simply made a single duplicate key. To add insult to injury we were chased to our car and yelled at by a sales manager telling us to take the car.  He screamed four times that the car was ours and he was going to leave it on the curb (they have possession of both the car and the keys.)  Then he threatened that he would ruin my 87 year old mother's credit.  I informed him that she (a widow) had paid cash.  He said we were taking this (our simple key issue) too far.  We bought a 7 year warranty and all other recommendations with this dealership.  Within a full 24 hours of the purchase, we know this is not a company with whom we wish to do business.  They are dishonest, unethical and a little frightening.  My mother feels uncomfortable and doesn't wish to return for service or anything else.  The Ball Honda sales management turned a joyous experience for my mother into a terrible nightmare and it's still ongoing.   ",6,63,-1
46835,22-Mar-16,"We took our Suzuki Forenza to this place trusting that they know what they were doing, the shift stick gear was locking, the backup lamp wasn't working and just that day the check engine light in dashboard had turned on, they told us that just for inspection and diagnostic they would charge $115.00 and we agreed on. We left the unit in the afternoon around 3:00 pm,  next day I received "" in my cell phone""  the call from Jose, the assigned mechanic to check the car, he told me that the check engine light was due to the gas cap was lose, he would charge me the $115.00 for that issue, I  told him that was abusive and he told me that he had to run a lot of test to come with that result, an experience mechanic or agent could know that, lose gas cap is the most usual issue for check engines lights comes on, most yet, when cars are owned by women that they haven the same pressure to tie a cap like men. Even thought the lady who received the car the prior day told my girl friend all issues (3 diagnostics) will be covered with the $115.00 Jose told me that to check the other two issues will be $230.00 dollars more, I felt ripped OFF but I had not other choice. That day around 1:30 pm finally Jose called me at ""my cell phone"" again and told me that there were a switch that controls the back up lights that had to be replace, I told him the the principal problem that we want to fix were the shift gear stick locking itself and he assured me that switch could be the problem, at the end he charged me 496.00 for the whole thing and he was making me a favor of not charging me for the labor of replacing that switch. I say he charged me because he was the one giving me the prices. He started checking the car around 11:00 am, I received the first call around 11:30 am, by two o'clock the car was ready for pick up. that same afternoon we went for it and my girl friend stop at the market for some groceries, and what happened? When she tried to put the gear the shift stick still were doing the same locking thing, by now who ever is reading this nightmare must be tired, so, resuming, we took the car back to them on Tuesday and what happened, after back and forward, they FOUND last friday that the whole shift gear had to be replaced witch will be other 260.00 dollars and they are making the favor of not charging for labor. today, one week later I found a message in my house line answer machine from yesterday, the car was ready for pick up. We asked them to call us to our cells, we asked we work all day long, every time that we were there they wrote in work order our cells numbers, at the end of the day are ending paying 756.00 plus almost two weeks without car for a problems that could be repaired if they were more efficient.

46922,10-Aug-13,"Well after my horrible experience at another honda dealer near my home I wanted to deal with the o-so friendly guy kevin :0) he said he can work us a smoking deal we met him in our car search so we decided to go back to national city to have them sell us the car we have researched and saved to buy for 6 weeks. We pulled up, guys jerry and jerry took us for a test drive and drove us back into kia. We told him several times we are pre approved from my own bank and need to do is make the deal :0). We were only told they would not help us and can sell us a car for 15 thousands?? We have preaproved funds at our bank we reminded him of this 5 timed he basically called us liars and repeated he would NOT get us in the car we came to buy.  We left walked over to honda talked it out with Tony and Mike were at least kinder. But was only willing to push us into a used 40 thousands mile pilot with body damage and cracks but yet still giving us a quote of 30000? For a used car wow... they had a white 2013 on the lot and remember we have 29000 to 30000 of my own money and they also refused to work the numbers on the pilot marked at only 30000. I had two awful experiences went home in tears spoke to my bank on sat they said dont go back to honda your loan is golden and you have nothing to worry about and we are :0 (. Sooooo disappointed in honda national City!",6,63,85
46998,12-Mar-12,"My experience with everyone I mentioned was exceptional; with the exception of the sales manager Mike Vallarelli. He was a complete idiot. He would not even acknowledge what I was asking him; in fact he told me either I was going to purchase the vehicle his way, or he was not going to sell it to me! I was irate for his total lack ,of people skills,and quite frankly somewhat amazed that he would let me walk without making the purchase. When I told him fine than I wouldn't buy the car, he put a gentleman named James Dunning on the phone. Mr. Dunning tried to make excuses, that possibly Mike didn't understand what I was asking him, and apologize for Mike's lack of professionalism, and courteousy, but my mind was already made up about him he was a total JERK. Only because of James, Dave, and Kevin I purchased the vehicle. I will never do business with that other gentleman Mr. Vallarelli again, if he is the only sales manager that I must deal with, this will be the last vehicle I will purchase at Ball. If you have any questions about my experience with Mr. Vallarelli, please call me at (619)654-1084, and I will be very happy to tell you excactly how he treated, and disrespected me and my wife. Thank you for everyone else who helped me, they were great. It is unfortunate that I was compelled to rate my experience at Ball with the lower marks, but it was because of the major ordeal with Mr. Vallarelli that drug all the other marks down. The survey asks for overall, and unfortunately he had such a negative impact on my experience at Ball that it greatly affected the overall rating, sorry but I had to be honest and I told James Dunning that I was going to give the dealership poor marks because of that JERK, Mike Vallarelli.",6,63,29

Once the papers were signed I was sent on my way with out being shown how any of the technology on my car worked. I was not given an owners manual or even a tank of GAS! They gave me the car with just enough gas to get home! It was awful.  I won't go back.  Oh I am a single woman and I guess they felt they didn't have to treat me very well. ,6,63,47
47030,14-Sep-11,"I had emailed to get a quote on a new Kia Sportage.  We decided to test drive and if we liked to purchase.  Frank said if he was not available to ask for Jennifer.  When my husband called both were out but there would be someone to help us and the car was still available.  

We arrived at the Kia dealer and the first red Sportage they showed us was not the car with the quote but they would find it for us. We could test drive this one. After 2 tries at trying to get the car started the salesperson gave up and went to look for another Red Sportage which was on the Honda Lot.  We took that out for a quick test drive. The car was ok and had plenty of room. 

When we got back the salesperson kept saying this is not the car from your quote we can't find it but we will.  So we waited and I was getting very irritated at this point.  What poor service all around.  Then the salesperson said he would check on the price we could get this sportage but he would have to see his manager.  OK now we have to play the stupid manager game.  He came back with a quote of $22995 which we had a internet price on a similar vehicle for $21,695.  Now I know I asked for a $24,400 red Sportage but he said there was no way the would sell a $24,400 car for $21,695. He said the internet departments only job was to get customers in not to quote them. Excuse me didn't it say get a quote right online?  

Well we just walked away. Went to Nissan, purchase a cute little Juke and drove away in our $24,000 car.  

The bottom line here is we were willing to go to $22,00 but did not want to play the game.  You lost a customer and you lost any of our future business.  It is really true what they say about a happy person really doesn't share with that many people but someone that is unhappy shares with many. So no I won't be buying a car from Ball Automotive Group and I sure won't be recommending them to anyone.

47039,02-Jul-11,"Referred to your dealership by COSTCO and was expecting costco prearranged pricing for the car I was looking for. Test drive went fine, Jose was very helpful in the process. We sat down while Bernard was attempting to locate the car we were looking for. When I asked what the costco price was for the car I was interested in, he told me that the costco pricing for the CRV had been ""cancelled"" due to high demand and low inventory brought on by the Japan tsunami. If I had known their was no costco pricing, I would never have driven across town to your dealership when there is one practically in my backyard here in Chula Vista. Great Bait and Switch tactic. When I called Costco why they sent me to a dealership whose prearranged pricing had been ""cancelled"", they were just as confused because they were not aware of the ""cancellation"". I think Ball Honda was just trying to squeeze a little bit more profit.

47053,01-Apr-11,"My wife and I were going dealer to dealer looking for a new car since I got in an accident and my car was totaled.  We finally came to Ball Honda and fell in love with the 2009 Honda Fit!  It really is a great car.  It's not so much that the people are messed up directly to your face here at this particular dealer, it's just that there are people there who seem to have no pride about their work.  Rich Reinbach was a manager and he was actually very caring, but I don't envy his job at all.  He works with people who seem to either have no integrity or are so blind to their incompetence that they just keep working there with no problems.  There were a number of issues we had with this dealer that made us furious and my wife normally does not get angry easily.  First of all, the sales person was ambiguous on which car we'd actually be driving home.  Minor, but these things add up.  When we went inside the room to sign papers, we asked that we change the credit card to be swiped because we remembered that that card was near its max. We wrote the new credit card info on the paper and he said he'd take care of it. The guy ended up swiping the wrong card anyways causing us to have to pay a overcharge fee.  The dealer didn't do anything to compensate.  Then when we drove the car home, the antenna on the car was missing and I noticed that there were some paint chips near the door handle.  The detailing on the car was poor quality too.  At this point, my wife is already regretting we came to this dealer.  I call the dealer and he says to come by and pick up the antenna and tries to tell me that we don't really need.  The radio would work out without it.  I listen to mostly AM radio stations, and I do NEED it!!!  That day I'm supposed to drive there ( I swear I'm not making this up) my battery dies!  I realized that my headlights were on for about an hour accidentally.  But this should be a new battery!!!  How could the battery die within an hour of the headlights being on!!!!  So I take responsibility for that, but my suspicion was that the battery was not as new as I thought.  I call the dealer to explain all that's happened to us, and all he says is...   ""Come in for a free car wash!!!""  I DONT'T WANT A FREE CAR WASH!!! I want compensation for the overcharge fee on the credit card and a car that has all the accessories on it when I purchase it, scratch free with a brand new battery!!!!  You already failed on that.  He made no further attempts to appease me and I never heard form the dealer again.  We regret coming here.",6,63,476

Car was NOT COMPLETELY DETAILED and showed a lack of ""Attention to Detail"".  Body shop also demonstrated a lack of ""Attention to Detail"" by not correcting ""agreed to"" paint damage.

Another salesman was not totally truthful when questioned about which fluids & filters had been replaced.  And a sales manager tried to convince me a large dent on the roof (close to the moon roof) was there upon agreement to buy?  Both were wrong!

Was told 4 times the car was ready for pick-up...and it WAS NOT.

I know how engine works and have a service manual myself, I asked them to take a look at it and specifically check the sensors (Oxygen) and timing belt since I hade the belt replaced recently.

Back then I was not living in Staten Island but now that I do reside on the island I decided to contact Dana Lincoln to service my lease.  My car will be going back in a few months, but since the engine light has turned on I wanted to check it since I drive with my infant son everyday. When I called Dana Lincoln Service the woman who answered did not even listen to my issue for service but rather saw I had months left and instead of scheduling an appointment put me on hold and all of a sudden I am on the phone with a sales rep. She did not tell me she was forwarding me to sales nor did I ask. What I asked for was an appointment for Service.  When the sales rep sent me back to the original woman I spoke with she dismissively said that since I wasn't looking to return the car and lease a new one at the moment, that and I quote ""due to the holiday season they are backed up and will not be able to get me an appointment to check the engine till FEBRUARY 24th""!!!!!!!!! Of course my response was absolute shock and to which she sighed and asked what color the engine light was and responded that ""it should be fine to drive with the engine light on but if it turns red that I must stop driving it and have it towed."" 
I explained to her that this was unacceptable and dangerous .  My husband then spoke to this woman and she left us on hold for over 10 minutes to speak to ""Keith"".  She finally came back and said Keith was unavailable to speak to us as he was with a customer and would contact us back in 10 minutes.  It has been two days since.

My ten year old car was experiencing transmission problems and before I was stranded with no car I decided to trade it in for a 2015 Subaru Forester for $17000. After the car was delivered to me and my old car was driven away I noticed that the rear hatchback for the trunk was a manual open. This posed a serious problem for me and a deal breaker since I’m disabled and lifting it is very difficult for me.

After some serious thought after six weeks with the Forester I decided to trade it in for something more practical for my needs and also receive some of my money back in a trade. I was also uncomfortable spending so much money on a vehicle. So I started researching cars under $10000.

I went to the dealership on Wednesday May 30 to test drive the Altima which I wasn’t so thrilled with. Before I knew it I was in the showroom and they’re showing me a brand new Ford Fusion, and I kept telling them I can’t afford $27000 if I’m not comfortable with spending $17000 on the Subaru.
After much cajoling by the salespeople before I knew it i left with a brand new car that I couldn’t afford. They kept insisting everything would be ok.
Oh, it will be fine!” she said. “We’ll work with you”said another salesperson. “It will be great!” Naile said.
Well it’s NOT great for anyone other than the person who received the commission. 
This is going to put me in financial ruin!!!!!!

The next day I called them to speak with the manager because I can’t afford this vehicle. He wasn’t in and I was told by the salesperson, Naile Telic that he would call me Friday when he was in. Well of course no one called and I called in the afternoon to find out what was going on. This conversation with another manager named Juan led to a shouting match. I called again later in the day and reached Juan again who also insisted everything will be find after telling him again and again that I can’t afford it.

Now its Saturday June 2 so I decided to go straight to the dealership to straighten this out. I met with yet another unnamed manager who threatened to call the police on me after telling him that I can not afford this car. Another manager came and took me to the dealerships supervisor in which after about a half hour he told me there’s nothing that can be done and I’m stuck with the car. He gave me another 15.000 miles a year and I still don’t have that in writing!! 
He also suggested that I can afford $200 a month to pay off the lease. The fact is, I receive $1200 a month in disability benefits. Living on that is difficult enough. How thoughtless and cruel it is to even THINK of that for anyone!!!

They used my Forester as a three year “downpayment” and after three years will be financing the remainder of approximately $13000.

The issue is in three years I will be 63 and not finically able to pay off a loan and in no position to do so now either. As i stated previously i am disabled and receive a fixed income of $1200 a month and will not be able to afford to make payments of any kind. So after three years I will not only not have a vehicle but out of all the money I needed returned to me from the Forester to buy something much more affordable.

Oh, it will be fine!” she said. “We’ll work with you”said another salesperson. “It will be great!” Naile said.
Well it’s NOT great for anyone other than the person who received the commission. 
This is going to put me in financial ruin!!
Not once were my needs considered.. that the fact that I’m disabled and receiving disability of $1200 a month! That at the age of 63 I’ll have car payments? I honestly don’t know what I’m going to do!

They REFUSED to take the car back even though I called the next day to do so!! Who does this to a disabled senior citizen!!

Naile Telic you repeatedly asked me for a review, here it is! And thank you for acknowledging ANY of the emails I sent you in which you completely ignored.

Dana Ford and it’s employees have left me NO choice but to submit a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and as of Monday June 25 2018 I will be contacting the Staten Island Advance. If I get no satisfaction from that I will contact the New York Times and every local television news to resolve this.

I can NOT afford this. I want to return the car ASAP. I NEED MY MONEY BACK!!!!!",6,63,-1
47086,16-Jun-18,"I started a lease approximately in December of 2017. Not even over 2,000 miles on the car, since day 1, the car has been in service more than I’ve driven it. Starting with paint blemishes, and electrical issues, not to mention the occasional downpour that I get inside my car, like I’m on a water ride. Back and forth and back and forth, the dealer refuses to fix the issues. Instead I’m told that the issues can not be duplicated and therefore cannot be fixed. The owner is nowhere to be found to back up his faulty product. The service manager is unprofessional and rude. I demand that my vehicle be bought back and for me to be treated like a human being as any other Paul g customer. I pick the top of the line Lincoln so I could enjoy myself and this has been the WORST experience and extremely depressing. The only positive thing that I will say is that my service writer Deb, who’s no longer there, and Chuck, still works there, are amazing people and extremely helpful. Let me add - I finally got my car out of service today. After the dealer tells me that they can’t find anything wrong with the vehicle, I go to put my 2 year old in the car with a moldy smell!  Buyers beware! ",6,63,104

This stealership is terrible never again will we buy another FORD 10 more months and we will be returning ford explorer. Service manager agrees with us about the demo miles and still does nothing about it. Complained to FORD CORPORATE and they refused to help as well... BEWARE OF DANA FORD NEVER BUY HERE .

47088,14-Feb-18,"I tried to return a lease to Dana ford, and they told me they wont take it because the car wasnt for them. Instead of the manager being all nice about it, he was yelling and screaming. Saying I am not making money therefore I wont take this Fu&% car back. I went off on them on their facebook page. They responded that if it was over 70 miles from the original dealer they would take the car. The dealer i got the car is exactly 84.1 miles away fron Dana Ford. If the manager had good customer service skills, he would have taken the vin # down and excused himself while he looked it up on the computer. Instead when my white ford fusion pulled into the service garage he came out like a crazy man. Asking what do we want. My mom and brother was nice and said we need to return the lease it over. That is when he started screaming and yelling. He told my lease guy who came with me becuase ford had a policy where the owner needs to be there. The manager came running out the showroom and told the guy I told them I am not taking the car. To get off his lot. Lucky I make my mom record stuff like this when I am not in her presents. If you wanted to be treated with respect and dignity DO NOT GO TO DANA FORD. Bring your business someplace else. Where they will respect you if you did or didnt get a car from them. ",6,63,622

47091,02-Oct-17,"My first review was unethically removed, but as my car goes back today (to a different dealership thank God), It's only fitting to walk you through my entire 2 and half year lease from Dana Ford. I'm going to list all my experience in bullet points, as it would come out to a short novel otherwise...

Day 1 after buying the car, I call to see when registration is being sent: I was told both salesmen quit.

Soon after, a tire needed replacing. Upon buying the car, I was told my tires and wheels were fully covered for ANY Ford dealership. Guess what? They snuck in a 3rd party warranty, forcing me to come back to their dealership for any repairs. 

Later that year, I needed a wheel replaced. I was told it would take 1 day. 3 days later, they still didn't have it fixed, and I was being LIED to by 2 different employers at the dealership. Each telling me my wheel was undergoing something different. NOTE: I was a college student, and this was my ONLY car. 

Throughout the next year, employees I was trying so desperately to work with continued to be FIRED, leaving me with NO connection to anyone in the dealership, time after time and again. 

I noticed a strange popping sound coming from the steering column of my car, so I took it in to Dana (Unfortunately). This is where they took the car, and kept it for OVER A WEEK. They REMOVED the steering column, but could not figure out what was going on... so they put everything back in, and handed me an even more broken car.
PLEASE UNDERSATND WHERE I'M COMING FROM. The first day they took the car in, they told me it will be fixed THAT DAY. I waited in the dealership for EIGHT hours. I missed a full day of work, and class, and had to have someone pick me up, even though they really couldn't. This is where I met other disgruntled customers, and heard their stories. 

My first review on this website ended here, before it was removed unethically.

I was approached by the dealership, and they asked me to come in and see if there was anything they could do to help (they wanted me to take down my review). They put me in my car with the ""mastertechnician"" (lol)... We drove around Staten Island, while he showed me pictures of his motorcycle, and girls he likes (while he was driving).

I was asked that same day, oh so kindly, to remove my review. I DECLINED AND IT WAS REMOVED ANYWAY. 

All of this is only the main points that make Dana Ford a MUST AVOID. I don't care how many positive reviews they're getting. Stay away.

Did you know Dana Ford uses their ""New Giant Dealership"" as a selling point, when someone was actually killed during construction?

Going into this dealership in my early twenties literally changed the person I am today. I simply did not think xxxx of this nature existed in the front lines of local business. I HOPED that it was reserved for top tier politicians, and sociopaths, but I was very wrong.

I was lied to about the date the car I wanted was supposed to be arriving on, bear in mind I had put a deposit down on this car so I was serious about purchasing it. For over a month I was given the run around about when it was supposed to arrive, but I finally decided to just take one of their stock vehicles sitting on the lot because they already had my money from the deposit for the car I actually wanted and there was no clear date when it was actually going to arrive at the dealership It was ""in transit"" for over a month according to them.

I must have been over to that awful place 5 times in total, each time I went it cost me $17 in tolls, plus gas, and the time out of my day. They never reimbursed me for my tolls and the staff are shady as anything - they're more interested in being on their phones than helping you and they're clueless about anything you ask them. I was told originally my payments would be so much a month, but then when I actually came in to sign the papers the price had magically gone up $90 a month for the same car.

REALLY????!!! Did they hire David Copperfield in the parts department ?!!!  To say their behavior is disgraceful would be an understatement!!!",6,63,-1

Dealership refused to fill up the gas tank, after fighting with them they told me to come back another day when I came back they refused to fill it saying someone had to go with me to the gas station and no one was there that could.

47130,25-Jun-11,Absolute worst experience of my life!!!!  Went in and test drove a 2011 Ford Explorer. Called the salesman Steve on Mon morning and told him we would be in at around 6:00pm to purchase the vehicle.  When we got there we waited a little bit because we were early and he had another customer.  We sat down with him and then it all went south.  He had no idea how much the lou had quoted me on sat and i could not remember the exact number.  I did ask for the number in writing on sat but the refused to give it to me.  After waiting in the dealership for over an hour my husband and i left.  I wanted $500 off the price they were offering me because i had to wait so long.  I spoke to Doug the General manager and he informed me that he would not reduce the price because he did not feel he should lose money on the deal.  Even though we know they are not losing money that is fine that he did not sell me the car.  For a manager Doug is very unprofessional and i'm not saying that because he refused to budge on the price because the funny part about it is if they would have had everything ready for us when we walked in we would have purchased the car for the original price.  I ended going to ALL American Ford and it was the best experience. We were offered coffee as soon as we walked in.  Our salesman Chuck was very helpful and knowledgeable.  We ended up leaving with the car that same day and paid less for it.  STAY AWAY FROM DANA FORD!!!!,6,63,116

47135,18-Mar-09,In response to scouter.. Well obviously you are connected to Dana Motors and Doug Hanson cause everyone I speak to has the same response.  They are a bunch of lying thieves.  The only reason they are still in business cause they are independently owned and Ford does not stand behind their product.  Obviously they are aware that they manufacture garbage and dont car what the dealers have to do to sell their cars. Unlike other manufacturers who would not allow this kind of behavior from a dealer representing their product.  And Dana Motors does not care who they screw or about the safety of their customers that they are putting in unsafe cars.  I guess they need to have someone get seriously hurt or die in an unsafe car that they sold or serviced under fraudulant circumstances to develop a conscious. ,6,63,-1
47136,17-Mar-09,"Dana lincoln mercury is the worst dealership to deal with.  The employees and owner will do anything to take your money.  They make empty promises to make a sale.  Then when you have problems with the car, they resort to demeaning you in orfer that they think you will back down.  I purchased a 09 Flex which had problems with a leaking trans which they tried to fix but just made the problem worst.  Then the car had problems with the brakes that they could not fix and told me that it was under investigation by Ford which they stated in an Ro.  When I asked for a loner til the problem was fixed cause I did not feel safe in the car.  I was told by Alex that if the car won't stop to use my emergency brake- thats what there is for.  Their customers arenon-existent to them once you drive off their lot.   As Doug Hanson said if you want them to come thru on their promises then you should get them in writing cause they just make them to make a sale and dont intend on following thru. It s part of their business. Spoke with the owner who thinks he's a gangster and makes inappropiate remarks to try and cover his employee's mistakes.  He is not a honest businessman.  Don't see him surviving much longer with his attitude.  So if you want to buy a lemon and be abused in the process you should buy from them..  But I would recommend going to a dealer who cares.  There are plenty in New Jersey..   Thats where I got my new car that I am thrilled with and the service was great.",6,63,50

Can't say enough bad things about them. Can't believe they are actually still in business. I was lured in with the agreement I was to get a Lincoln MKX with specific options.  Trusting these scum bags, pressed for time, I signed the lease.  I had to leave then come back to pick up the car.  The car I drove off with was not the car we had agreed upon.  Upon noticing the problem, I called them. Their answer was ""too bad we just screwed you.""  Anyone who is happy with the service at Dana should have their head examined!  Ford is no better. I have been faithfully leasing with them for the last 12 years.  When telling them the problem, their answer is that Dana is independently owned and operated and there is nothing they can do. So much for quality job one.  I strongly urge you not to buy or lease a vehicle at Dana. I seriously doubt my next vehicle will be a Ford!  I wish I had seen a review like this before I went to Dana. Buyer beware!",6,63,122
47139,27-May-08,"I purchased a loaded top of the line 08 MKX from Dana Lincoln Mercury on Staten Island.  All I kept hearing from Joe (the sales manager) was that the dealership was ranked top whatever in the country for the number of sales it made.  I really felt like the only thing that mattered was the volume the dealership was producing and not the quality of service it was providing.  They proved that as I had several problems upon delivery. Just to name a couple, the automatic start did not work and there were several scratches on the truck.  When I tried to have them rectified by Doug Hansen, this is some of what he said to me:

First off he was loud and obnoxious.  Upon seeing it, he said oh well it’s only about ½ inch big and nothing compared to the wear and tear that would happen.  No cars at any dealership including BMW, Mercedes or wherever have a perfect vehicle.  He started yelling at me and said he is not going to do anything about it.  If I wanted to have it painted he would do so or I should just leave the dealership.  The deal is done so goodbye.  He had work to do.  He didn’t know what I did for a living that I had so much time on my hands to research incentives available and know about dealer cash available.  No he did not give out free key rings or brochures and too bad about the scratch.  I already drove the car off the lot and it lost about $6,000 in value already.  He proceeded to walk away and said if I wanted his card, I could go ahead and complain to whoever the hell I wanted to.

47147,25-Aug-11,"Considering I had been to numerous dealerships over the last few months trying to decide what car I wanted next and when I finally settled on the 2012 Ford Mustang at first I went to Dana Ford since I live in Staten Island. In my opinion, what a mistake that was, they're sales reps that I dealt with were very cold, used poor sales tactics and were not willing to work with me at all in helping locate the car I wanted. They tried to tell me that they did a search and that there were no Mustang Base V6 models in black or kona blue in the entire Northeast Region and that I would have to special order it and it would take 6-8 weeks to get it in(Later found out from another Ford Dealer that there were actually 14 car they met what I was looking for within about 100miles). They then proceeded to push me towards a higher end mustang because they had it on the lot and it was a model that cost more and was a color I didnt even like, not to mention they gave me an inaccurate price quotes. They started with a price of $414/month with $2000 total due at signing. I asked if he could work with the price and then all of a sudden comes back with a price of $327/month for the V6 Premium model with only adding about $350 on top of what he originally said for a down payment and when I asked how go the price drop dramatically by $87/month he said it was due to a competitive leasing because I had a Honda lease that I turned in over 6 months ago. But as it turns out the competitive leasing rebate from Ford is only $1,000 credit which would only really drop the price by about $20/month not to mention according to Ford's website I wouldnt even qualify for that rebate because you have to had just returned or will be returning another lease within 30days. Then before I left they brought over the manager to try and tell me I should make a decision quick because someone else just took it out for a test drive right after me which was B.S. because we only had just returned with the keys. So after a horrible experience there I search the nearest Ford Dealers and came across Tom's Ford Lincoln. What a complete 180 turn from the experience I had at Dana Ford.

47154,15-Jan-15,"I would have given them 0 Stars if possible.
On November 25th I experience my worst car buying experience ever.   After only looking at one vehicle and driving it(took a total of 20 minutes), I told the salesman that I would like to proceed buying that one(2011 Ford F150) ..keep in mind I did zero haggling...I specifically asked NOT to have my credit ran as I was going to go through USAA.  I was seated in his ""office"" area in the Lincoln side.   I do not know the name of my salesman because he quickly told me he had a sickness and the he had to leave.  He turned me over to someone else who was supposed to help me. Before he left I asked him to confirm that they received the loan paperwork from USAA as it was being faxed.  I never heard back from him.   I was asked however to move from the Lincoln office to the Ford side by  a different person.   I was in one of the sales cubicles for FORD for about 10 minutes when yet another salesman asked me to move to the ""bullpen"" area.  I said sure, but...can someone please confirm my USAA paperwork made it through.  They said they would check and escorted me to the bullpen area.   Never heard back from that gentleman about USAA.   About 30 minutes later a finance guy comes up to me and says that he can beat my USAA rate...I found this odd since he surely never ran my credit report since I specifically asked them not to...but bottom line I said ""no"", I would feel better just using USAA.  (Later I found out that they ran my credit report 10 times completely hurting that part of my score).   
10 minutes later the finance person comes back and says that if I go with the USAA method, I won't be able to buy the car today.   I found this really absurd and told him ""fine, I guess your dealership is the only dealership that has this dilemma"" and I prepared my stuff to depart.  A Finance Manager quickly found me and said that ""yes"" they can do the USAA method.   I then stayed in the bullpen area for another 2 hours straight with no one even checking on me.  NO TV in that area...just tables and chairs where I got to hear salesman talk to other customers about their private stuff, a DANA SALESMAN complain to another salesman for about 20 minutes on the fact that he wasn't doing anything that day because he heard he was going to get fired anyway....At this point I decided to go get something to eat since it didn't look like they were going to get to me any time soon, so I packed up my things to go eat...in which a salesman came running after me when I made it outside and told me ""they had been looking for me because I was next""...yeah right.   I could then go on to add they stupidity that followed based off the insurance that I had already switched over....but why bother.
SO HERE IS THE REST OF THE STORY.   THEY NEVER PROPERLY SUBMITTED MY PAPERWORK, SENT ME THE TITLE.  I NOW HAVE THE TRUCK, THE TITLE, BUT NOOOOO LOAN.   I FOUND THIS OUT WHEN I TRIED TO PAY THE LOAN THAT DOESN'T EXIST.  SO ON THE 26TH OF DECEMBER I CALLED TO HAVE THIS RECTIFIED.   I CALLED THE FIRST TIME, NO ONE CALLED ME BACK.  I CALLED THE SECOND TIME, GOT AHOLD OF A SALES MANAGER WHO WAS SUPRISED BY THE SITUATION, AND WAS GOING TO GET BACK TO ME QUICKLY.  TWO HOURS LATER, I CALLED BACK BECAUSE I HADN'T HEARD ANYTHING.  THE RECEPTIONIST TOLD ME THAT THE SAME SALES MANAGER SAID HE KNOWS ABOUT THE PROBLEM AND WILL CALL ME BACK.  IT IS NOW THE 15TH OF JANUARY...AND I HAVE STILL NOT RECIEVED A PHONE CALL.

I did not hear from this dealership for two full weeks, and I had to call many times and ask what was taking so long to only find out Ronny had resigned and no one decided to let me know that my car was ready for delivery. Let me say i was tossed around like crazy before a sales manager decided to finally give me an update. When i did receive my car there were scratches on the door and all the windows were manual. It is 2013 why do you have to roll down your windows? It is my fault for not doing the right research and giving this place too much trust.

It took more than 45 days and multiple calls before I received my license plates. Even after they had promised that they would send me the license plates via fedex, they tried to make me pay for shipping. I am actually still angry thinking about the experience I had even after many months. The only reason I am editing this rating is because I felt bad that Ronny had to be part of this rating when it was not actually his fault, it was the lack of communications between all departments that really makes me not want to come back to this dealership.

We came to an agreement, and in order to confirm it with the manager he asked for a credit card to show that we were ""serious about making this deal"". The manager okay'ed the deal and came over to shake our hand, everything was done. I paid the money down and was set to come back two days later to pick up the car. I asked for a copy of the agreement, but was told that I would receive it when I came for the car. I found this shady. An hour before the time that I was supposed to pick up the car I called to confirm and was told that everything was set. I came back to get the car and was suddenly told that they had made a ""mistake"".i was absolutely outraged that they were going back on the deal that we had made and they refused to give us what we agreed on. They tried to sell us a different car,  wasn't what we came for so we left with no deal. This was a huge inconvenience as we really needed a car at the time that we made the deal and instead it took us another week before we could get to another dealer. We went to a great dealership in Manhattan and in three hours we left driving a new car with just about the same deal that we had originally made at DANA. I will never be going back to DANA again.

47157,03-May-11,"Let me start off by saying I never complain about service anywhere and quite opposite, I will call owners, managers, etc of businesses I deal with just to tell them I was happy with whatever I received. But with that said, NEVER in my life of purchasing 6+ cars has there ever, ever been such a horrendous experience. Without going into the full experience, I was purchasing their highest end truck when I confirmed SEVERAL times that it was a 'limited edition' they were bringing in from another dealership, but something didnt add up since the sales girl (no longer there) told me she researched the car and it was not. All my internet searches supported the same. I wanted confirmation via the window sticker that the senior manager initially told me he couldn't provide since it was a truck they were bringing in. Once I told him I would not purchase it there if I couldnt see a sticker, miraculously he faxed one over to me in about 10 minutes but forgot to remove the other dealerships name from the bottom!! Of course, I called that dealership and they said 'NO' it was not the limited. Once I politely confronted him, he got indignant and HUNG UP on me. Would you want this person helping you or representing  your business?
 
I then went to Flemington Ford in NJ (had the best experience of any dealership I have ever dealt with) as SEVERAL people on the Island recommended them and after exhaustive research they were able to find me one. After a few months, my car needed a SIMPLE update to the map/direction system so my Flemington sales person said it was really standard so to bring it here. It took 3 days AND CAME BACK WITH SCRATCHES ON THE FRONT BUMPER. Couple that with it covered in mud outside and in the drivers seat and my tire pressure light on I was outraged, yet remained calm. Bottom line is I brought it back AGAIN for body shop work, cleaning and to reset the tire light I told was just a computer adjustment. 3RD time there, scratches were fixed, car FILTHY and light still on. Once again, I was apologized to for the dirt and they would send somebody out to pick it up and bring it back which didnt happen for two weeks. Following this I brought my car to a gas station only to find that a VISIBLE nail was in my tire, hence the reason for the light. 4 WEEKS LATER they have FINALLY fixed the tire and have cleaned it!!

The entire time she was rude and had an attitude with me and being flirtatious with my husband. And to make matters worse before we left, my husband was walking in front of me and she decides to cut me off and  inappropriately touched him and interlocked her arm unto his as if they were a couple.  I told her never touch my husband again. But what I should have done was tell her manager since he was right there, so he could know just what she had done. All this would show if you check the cameras for Friday April 28,2017.   I was baffled by how this woman could be hired to work at the dealership when she was acting In such a grotesque manner. I was appalled and not to mention disrespected and my husband was sexually harassed for which made him uncomfortable. I hope that no one else has to deal with her unprofessionalism and that her management will deal with her accordingly like they would if a man would have done this. Warning to all couples getting there car serviced avoid Besa at all costs. And men don't let her get away with sexually harassing you, no one should have to endure that type of behavior.  ",6,63,-1

47167,02-Oct-12,"I have waited almost 7 weeks to write this review because of issues that I had and still have it with my 2012 f150 3.5 Platinum. My hell started during the purchase process, Dana Ford in Staten Island did a great job to make my life miserable during this whole process. I purchased my truck on Friday and I made my decision based on reviews found on the Internet about the F150, I tried a couple dealers before the purchase and finally made a decision to get it at this dealer because I found the one I wanted there. During the purchase process we reached an agreement and the truck was delivered to me with out the proper delivery process, the salesman and managers kept telling me several times about filling out this survey Ok or excellent for them. I received very little information about the truck; they didn’t explain all the truck features or worse the specifics about it. When I got home the first thing I found out was the truck was larger than the one I traded in (Toyota Tundra Limited) and I couldn’t close my garage and got very upset because I found out that night that this one was longer than my previous truck, I felt it during the ride from the Dealer in New York to my house in New Jersey. Very unhappy about it I made my own Internet research and found out the truck comes in different sizes like 145” and 157” long and comparing to my old one I needed the 145”. When you spend a lot of money on a car, you want to get what you paid for and you want to get what you want and the truck that makes you happy, this wasn’t the case for me with this truck because It felt longer and It wasn’t the one I wanted. I made the wrong decision to go back to the dealer and get the truck I wanted, the 145” that’s the truck size I been driving the last 5 years for almost every day. Back at the Dealer with 54 miles on the truck odometer, the salesman and the sales manager, first thing they did is to look for a way to take advantage of the situation and tried to get more money from me. After I checked others F150s with different specifics and one with a lower price of about $ 1,200.00, they proposed to me to sell me the new one and trade the one I got the day before with 54 miles on the Odometer and pay them on top 2,800.00 to get the 145” size truck. I got very upset because in the way they wanted to do business with the newer truck they were clearly taking advantage and telling me in my face that I was stupid, that’s how I felt and that’s how I still feel.
After all discussions making the deal, which in the first place I thought they would just exchange the truck for me and any money difference will be paid either by me or by them depending on lower or higher price of the new one. They sold me the $ 1,200.00 lower price truck at the same price for my first purchase, so I knew I was loosing that money, having me in a place that I didn’t know what to do with a truck I didn’t want, I accepted to buy the 2nd. Truck, very, very unhappy I signed the papers and drove home with the other one. They did the same thing with the second truck, gave me a pre-filled delivery truck sheet with all the options crossed out saying the truck is Ok, repeatedly saying to me “to make sure when I get the Survey I should fill it with all excellent for them because depending on that survey will be the salesman’s payment “. When receiving the truck I found the leather of the console top in the truck was scratched and asked the salesman to be addressed at what he immediately responded they will order a new cover and replace it, the salesman brought his Customer Relations Manager to take a look at it, then he affirmed that they will put a new piece on and they will call me to schedule it.
Waiting for almost a week I made a decision to call the dealer and ask for the console cover and also talk to them about what I found on the truck tailgate. The Platinum F150 tailgate cover was coming off on one corner, I spoke to the salesman and the first thing he answered to me after listening to my complain about the tailgate is saying “ that is your responsibility because the truck has been with you for almost 1 week”, unfortunately not the best professional answer for a customer. Anyway I made an appointment to bring the truck to the dealer to check it, but before my appointment the truck steering wheel column started to make a grinding noise, a clear sign that something is wrong with it. I came to the dealer and spoke to the salesman about it, they were not happy that I was complaining and bringing something new to the table. A technician checked the truck and agreed that something is wrong with the steering wheel column but proceeded to tell me that I should wait a little longer and see if the noise goes away and that they will check it again on the day my truck will be on service for the console top and tailgate cover. Made an appointment for the following week to change the top of the console, fix the tailgate cover and check the steering wheel column again. Basically they gave a very hard time to fix my truck, they never called back when they said they would, they wanted to do touch up work on everything since day one, wanted to buff up my console cover, they patched tape the tailgate cover and they didn’t want to fix the steering wheel column they told me that I should have some tolerance on this issues because every truck and car always will have some imperfections. After many calls to Ford Customer Relations Team I had the luck to talk to some people who helped me one way or the other, Cynthia McGregor helped a lot and I thanked her, but sometimes even for her this problem got very difficult. After all this complaining, they finally changed the console cover, they replaced the steering wheel column but during this work in the shop they scratched the 2 covers of the steering wheel base, scratched my truck left mirror and front bumper. Lastly this last week I had to insist and try to get my registration and plates ready because I been asking all these passed 5 weeks but they didn’t have my name on file either, that’s what the ladies at that department said to me when they were asked for my papers and plates from me. It took almost 6 weeks and my calls to Cynthia (Manager from Customer Relations Team), for them to get it ready but I have argued many times before with Kendra and the other authorities at the dealer to get my truck registration and plates ready. She even hung up on me on the phone once because they couldn’t keep their promises to have the registration and plates ready at the day they said it would be ready.
Last week I brought my truck to have the steering wheel cups replaced because they scratched it when replacing the steering wheel column, they also replaced the tailgate cover and sucked at it, they installed the new one incorrectly because now I have the same issue on the opposite side of the tailgate cover (Left side). Lastly one of the Sales Manager had the audacity to come to me and confront me asking “Why I have given them a bad survey, because the only thing he had done for me was Help ” That shocked me because I wouldn’t expect that from a Manager (I found out his name is Juan and he speaks Spanish, I don’t know his last name) because he would be the right person to know what their errors and mistakes were with me when purchasing the truck and with the dealer Customer Service.
My truck tailgate still looks awful with factory quality control issues, but one thing I’m sure is that never, never in my life will I go back to this dealer and buy a car from them. Because for me to go through this hell, it has been a huge nightmare and I don’t want anybody to pass it, I have been aggravated more than too many times during all this process, they disrespected me not doing/fixing things on time and in a professional manner what they had to do in the first place. They didn’t try to do what they promised to do, of course they did something but they did it because Cynthia and myself had to be there to push them to do it.
Just to let you know how un-professional they are I’m going to let you know that this weekend when having my truck washed at the carwash when the truck was getting dried, the Tailgate rear Ford emblem fell off, at this point I didn’t know if I should scream, cry or just pray to god for better days for me with this truck. For your information Rich at the Dealer Shop showed me that they will need to take a part the tailgate to replace that cover and that’s what they did, I saw it with my own eyes because I was brought to see part of the process, I saw they took the emblem off and other parts too to install the new tailgate cover but when they did this, they broke the emblem tabs and to put it back they just pushed the emblem in but the emblem never was going to hold on to its base because the tabs were broken, It held it a little but not enough to support the wind coming from the carwash blower. Now the emblem is all scratched off because it fell on the carwash track chain.
I will place reviews of this dealer on all the places I can like Google and other search engines, because I do not wish for other customers to get what I got in this dealer. The last thing I would like to say is that I hope Ford comes to me and calls me to get all these issues resolved but It will have to be at a different Ford dealer, I’m not coming back to this dealer again in my life.


Good Bye

47168,18-Aug-12,"I am a former customer of Dana Ford. I have been called in the past three months about turning in my leased Edge. When I ask questions about new payments or are my remaining payments going to be rolled nto the new ones, I get no answer. Last week I received another call and again my questions were not answered and I was told my salesman still worked there. Well much to my pleasure I am now a customer of BAYRIDGE FORD. I have my new 2013 Edge fully loaded and with less of a payment. By the way I don't like being lied to since I found out my salesman now works at Manhatten Ford. Too bad we lost Island Ford but I am glad I found Bayridge Ford. Too bad the personnel at DANA aren't schooled in how to treat customers. All they want is the sale at any cost regardless of what the customer wants. They are ""helpful"" whan they make the deal and then when you go back for your registration, they don't even look at you. A generated letter is sent out, but it's the same for all customers to see if you like your new car. Too bad we lost ISLAND FORD but I am glad we now have BAYRIDGE FORD. It's worth the toll!",6,63,3839
47169,02-Nov-11,"We bought our brand new 2011 Ford Explorer ($40k) from Dana in July.  The dealership since has been uncooperative in issuing a military incentive promised by Ford at the time of purchase. The incentive was for $500 and both the dealership and Ford Motor Co. customer service have given us a run around for months. Both have ignored our requests and when reaching out to Dana Ford we get the ""eye rolling why are you bothering us"" response.

Additionally, at the time of the sale we were promised the all weather mats and were once again given the run around for weeks before a sales manager realized how stupid it is for them to make a big deal out of $60 mats. 

To add insult to injury, we have already serviced the Explorer twice.  Once
for a ""loose wire""  that caused the rear A/C to go in and out sporadically
and just recently another issue with the cooling fan needing replacement.

I would never go back to Dana ford to purchase a vehicle or to service the current one.

Should have went with the Honda Pilot. Dealing with Ford is like dealing with a call center in another country ... useless.

47170,14-Nov-09,Waited for two hours for an oil change when I had an apt set.  Not only did I have to wait a long time but they were not so nice about making me wait so long.  They told me they thought 2 hours was a compltely accpetable amount of time to wait and I would have waited even longer if I had a Honda.  To top it off they were going to charge me $100 for an oil change.  I should have gone to jiffy lube and got an oil change for $30 and waited 20 minutes.  I love my MKX but don't think I would buy another one becasue the service is just so bad,6,63,-1

They said bring it in on the 18th of April (I called on the 10th) so they could make sure they had the part ready to go. Not only  didn't they have the part, but there were some other warning lights on that they were supposed to look into, which they could have looked at while they waited for the recall part and didn't. Long story short, they had the car 4 days for 1 1/2 days worth of repairs.Then they try to make lame excuses. unfortunately I know cars and computers and I called them on their lies.",6,64,-1
47174,18-Feb-16,"After bringing my car in to dana ford service on Thursday February 11th I received the car back on Wednesday February 17th. All that needed to be done was tire pressure sensor reset, horn to be fixed, and noise when turning the steering wheel. I called several times for updates and was promised a call back on more than 5 occasions, finally on the 6th attempt I received a phone call back, this was over the course of 4 days.

After finally getting my car back and getting home, I noticed that the bumper wasnt fully on. They forgot to put retaining screws into the wheel well liner and under the bumper causing the liner to drag and scrape my tire. After calling about this I was told to come in within 30 minutes and it will be taken care of right away. I came in and was told it will be an hour or two to put in the 6 screws missing. I said thats ridiculous and asked them for the screws and that I would do it myself. They happily provided me with the screws and I laid on the floor in the service center screwing in these screws by hand.

Oh and they promised that the techs checked the fluid level but the anti freeze was never refilled so I had them do that when I came back as well. 

In summary this experience was on the level of some shady mechanic and not something one would expect from a dealership.",6,64,145
47175,27-Feb-15,"As soon as you sign the papers you are immediately forgotten.  If you have a problem, there is no way to contact Dana.  Phone calls are never returned.   When you go in person, the manager's are NEVER available.  We will never buy another Ford from Dana Staten Island.",6,64,699
47176,27-Dec-11,"The day I purchased the vehicle was a great experience. It was what happened after I got the car that made this an awful experience.  I purchased the car in mid-November and it is now late December and I still have not received my permanent license plate and registration.  About once every week since purchasing my car, I was contacted by a customer rep to make sure I completed the dealership surveys with great reviews (which I did) and each time I asked about the status of my plate.  I was consistently told that it wasn't in yet, but could take up to 45 days.  When I was contacted last week, I asked about the plate and registration and I was told to call back at the end of the week, which I did.  It was on this phone call (2 days before Christmas) that I was finally told my paperwork was still in the dealership and that they needed 2 copies of papers from me.  Not ONCE was I informed of this during previous calls.  The paperwork had been sitting in the dealership for 5 weeks and had not yet been sent to the DMV.  My temporary license plate was issued on Nov 16th, so it is due to expire in a couple of days.  After speaking with the Pennsylvania Parking Authority, I was told that if stopped or ticketed, my car would be taken if the plate was expired.  I also could not renew the temporary parking permit I have been getting to park in the city while I wait for the permanent plate to get a yearly pass.  I am now stuck with no parking permit and risk being ticketed or losing my car while I wait for the dealership to finally put the paperwork through.  I was told there is nothing they can do until they get the plates in and that there was just a lot of paperwork that needed to be done for an out of state registration.  I can understand that it takes a little, but that time is on top of the 5 weeks they did nothing about my paperwork.  I also wonder where the representative was looking when I asked about the status of my plate every time she called.",6,64,44
47177,23-Nov-10,"Absolute worst service department ever.  You make an appointment bring in your car and then don't bother to look at it all day. They then have the nerve to ask you to reschedule or leave your car there until whenever they decide to get around to looking at it. They do not provide loaner cars (unless car is kept over a day but at that point you are already out of a car all day and you can't even get a comparable car).  I never had these issues at Bay Ridge Lincoln and I am so sorry to see them closed; always had a loaner as soon as I dropped off my vehicle and vehicle was always looked at during appointment.  Car was never returned to me with dirt and oil marks inside and out either.

This dealer rating is complete crap as well because they actually tell you to rate them 5* when you purchase or lease your vehicle.  So I can see many people have obliged.",6,64,33
47178,08-Dec-18,"My experience here was not good. Recently I was trading in 2016 Explorer Limited and knew I wanted the new Sport Edition. Knew going in what the price per month I would be dealing with since I have leased many times before (not my first car guys). Well anyway, the price that the guy behind the glass came up with was totally outrageous and when I called him
Out on it he just made me feel uncomfortable. Kept telling me what a great deal I was getting and what a huge favor they were doing for me. I didn’t like the vibe. It was very pushy. Even more than your typical dealership. The manager definitely lost me when he was telling me I had to purchase the car that day or else it wasn’t going to help them. (It was was last day of the month.) Um news flash guys- customers do not care about your sales. They care about what they can afford and what is going to benefit their budget. Could not care any less about how many sales Dana makes. Just want to walk away in a nice car- without getting ripped off.
Rich Harley (sales) is nice- very patient and will drive through the entire lot of cars for you. He should get out of that dealership!
Price was outrageous! Went to All American and got the same exact car nearly $90 per month cheaper! Great experience there-would recommend! ",6,64,-1
47180,28-Dec-14,"I am sorry that I ever wrote a positive review of this place.  While my salesman was excellent, the staff at this dealership are severely lacking in clerical and customer support skills.  I phoned two weeks after my purchase to ensure that my registration documentation was properly filed (I do not live in NY), and they told me that there were missing items.  That's right, I had to call them to find out that some documentation was missing.  What was missing?  A copy of the back of my driver's license, which they could have easily obtained at any point.  That, and they mentioned that the effective date of my insurance was wrong.  To recap, they made the phone call to organize the insurance change.  This is all after an e-mail the day after my purchase to double check that they didn't need anything additional from me.  I needed the registration process to be expedited, as my neighborhood is resident permit parking only.  Now my registration is delayed another two weeks, during which time I cannot park in my neighborhood.  To make everything more frustrating, everyone I spoke to on the phone was pretty rude, and didn't really care about taking care of me.  I mean, what do they have in it?  They already sold me a car.

As a side note, Rich was a great salesman.",6,64,-1
47181,04-Feb-14,"I had a 2011 ford escape limited in 4x4 which I leased from dana. My lease was up so I went to get another one.I told the salesman I wanted a 4x4 like my last one he asked if I would consider a fwd I said no we made a deal I asked the salesman if it was fwd or 4wd  I wanted to be sure I was told I was told 4wd, as a matter of fact the salesman told me over and over how I was getting so much more truck for the same price. Well as it turns out less than a week later we get some snow, I jump into my truck and proceed to get stuck, now that never happened with my old truck so I dig out the window sticker that the dealer had removed and put in the glove box before we picked up the car and I find that it dosen't have 4wd at all. I called the dealer to ask about why I was told it was a 4x4  when its not. I was told I could not have been told that as no way I could have gotten a 4x4 for that price. I was lied to and missled just to make a deal nothing matters but to make a sale. 

",6,64,248
47182,28-Sep-11,"I walked into this dealership and was greeted by a salesman who seemed pleasant in the beginning.  We discussed two trucks that I was interested in test driving.  I was very happy with the enthusiasm he had even after I explained that I may not be able to give a large down payment today. I unfortunately was not sure that today would be the day to make a deal but I was rather inquiring so that I could be prepared in the next month or two to sign a lease if they were not able to work with little money down. As we sat down after test driving the ford escape things seemed okay and still felt positive by telling me that ""miracles are going to happen today"".  As he starting negotiating he explained that my trade financed car would be worth 6,000.  I respect the fact that he wanted to make a sale, but my advice to this dealership is to worry about selling cars and making miracles rather than lying to the customer.  I carefully explained that I could not have a payment higher than 400 per month, so how does 573 a month and 2400 down today even close to what I was telling him I could afford.  I really thought that this dealership would be better than where I bought the current car I have but I guess enthusiastic sales people who give false hope is really what you promote. In about a month I will be on my search again and with money to put down going to a dealership in New jersey!",6,64,59
47183,05-Jan-11,"I went to Dana after receiving calls from them to terminate a previous lease that I had with them and on a 2008 Linoln MKX and to upgrade to a 2011 Lincoln MKX. I was told that there were great end of year programs available and that I would get a great deal on a new lease. I met with a salesman, Steve Nilsen, who showed me vehicles that I was interested in with available option packages. He was great and sincere throughout the whole process and truly did try to work out a deal. He quoted a fair price for a new lease that was agreed upon by his manager Dave. I did not complete the contract at that time because I was unsure of the color that my wife wanted but I told Steve that I would return later in the day with my wife to purchase a vehicle. He assured me, after talking with Dave, that the price that we had negotiated would be honored when I return. I returned later that day with my wife. Dana did not have the color that she wanted (merlot) but she settled on her 2nd choice which was black. When I sat with Steve to draw up the contract things began to unravel. He got some paperwork from Dave and all of a sudden, the down payment did not include the first lease payment but earlier in the day it had. The next thing I knew was that I was no longer talking to Steve but was talking to Lou. He agreed that the first lease payment would be included but suddenly the monthly payment went up $43. We began to haggle back and forth. Finally he came down close to the original price but was still $14 over the earler price Steve had guaranteed through Dave. He cited that the difference was due to some accessories that I had wanted and that Steve had promised to include at no cost because I had waited around he showroom for 2 1/2 hours past my appointment time to meet with Steve and I was not getting my first choice of color. Finally, I agreed to pay the higher amount but was really not happy about it. I gave Steve my credit card for a down payment. While he was processing the payment Dave came by to talk to me. I told him that I really felt that he should have given me the car at the earlier agreed price. After a brief discussion he told me rather nastily that if I wasn't happy with the deal, I should leave. Unfortunately, I did not. I returned 2 days later to pick up my new MKX. When I met with Steve he said the car was detailed and went to check on the vehicle. He came back and then informed me that there was damage to the front bumper
(it had been scuffed and chipped). He was very apologetic and said that they would give me a loaner car and have the bumper repaired and repainted. He assured me that it would be as good as new.  I told him I was not comfortable with paying for a new car and receiving a repaired one. He then offered to give me another MKX exactly the same as the one that I was purchasing. I agreed but Steve returned 10 minutes later and informed me that it was sold and there were no other black MKX's available on the lot. He asked if I would take a different color but there were no other colors on the lot that I was interested in. Steve went to the office and Lou came over. He was rather nasty and could not understand why I didn't want to take the car after was repaired. I explained that I was paying for a new car not a repaired car and that if he wanted me to take a repaired car he would have to drop the price. He refusd to do so. I told him to terminated the deal and for my credit card account to credited. He said fine and walked away. Then Dave came over to me. Our interaction was the same as the one I had with Lou. He too was rather nasty and independent. There was no negotiation. It was going to be be his way or no way. I would not give in so he agreed to credit my account and cancel the deal. I left, went to Tom's Ford Lincoln Mercury, and had a great experience. I got the color I wanted (Merlot) at a better price with no hassle and was treated professionally and with respect.  ",6,64,129

So we are all waiting, 10mins later, someone comes and asked if we have been helped. The guy takes my keys and tells me to wait inside. By this time I'm already dreading the rest of the wait. Service advisor comes back and says it will be around 3pm more or less when the car will be ready. He took my cell phone number down and said he would call when it is ready 
 He let's me know there is a complimentary shuttle to take me where I need to go, but I got a ride from a family member. By 3pm I still haven't received a call, so I had my family member drop me off. As I was walking in, the advisor calls my name and says that he was just about to call😏. The whole time I was waiting, the recalls did not get resolved because a part needs to be ordered. Why was I not notified sooner?! The advisor said ""he was just told right now an order has to be put in"" so 4 hrs to ""find out"" a part needs to be ordered. This customer service is below acceptable. I had to request this day off, the whole day to give the service team ample time to fix the recalls. Its 415pm I am waiting for a rental because I have to leave my car. As of now, the date my car will be ready is unknown. I will have to explain to my manager that I would have to leave work early on whatever day my car will be ready. Too much of an inconvenience for me and my managers, I am so upset and not satisfied.",6,64,278
49890,19-Feb-19,They say they will call when your vehicle is ready and they don’t.  They told me I needed brakes in the rear of my vehicle so I had my dad change them and they were fine. Still had half of the pad left. They are very rude there. I will never go back. I will drive to Visalia to Groppetti where they are much more friendlier and have more reasonable prices. I will not be returning here. ,6,64,83
49895,16-Feb-19,"I took my car in for an oil change and PSI correction to my back right tire, as it was showing low air. Oil was changed, tires were rotated, and the service advisor assured me they found no nails and it holes in my tire. A few sars later I had to take my car back in due to that same tire being completely flat. I spoke to the manager Alex and informed him of the previous work. Alex had my tire dipped to further check for any holes in my tire. None were discovered. I explained to Alex, why wasn’t this performed the initial service? I also noticed the tire that was flat before I took it back the second time did not match my other tires as far as the wear and tear. As well as the tire brand names. After the second visit I noticed my original tire was put back on. In conclusion, Nissan Altima of Bakersfield service department either accidentally put the wrong tire on my car or purposely did it in hopes I would spend more money by purchasing a tire with them. I am not going to take my nisssn here for anymore services, as I now doubt the honesty and integrity of the work the service department performs. ",6,64,6

Fast forward to today, a year later, fluid is leaking and requires ""immediate attention per the report. Great we have a warranty and this should be covered. They have no idea there's a warranty, it's not in their system. My husband mist contact the FINANCE dept to check, but we still have the paperwork stating we paid for the warranty... oh, but now they aren't even sure if this is covered under the warranty they sold us. They have to have a certified technician sent out to inspect it, re-diagnose the issue and either confirm or deny if its covered.. i will never purchase another Nissan, they have no idea what they're doing. I have never had issues with my Toyota when something went wrong. Toyota is able to see exactly what my warranty is, and tell me right away if my issue is covered or not, they have never told me to come back another day or call another dept to see if I have a warranty, it shows up when they type in my vin number. These circles were going around in with Nissan is absolutely ridiculous, like nobody has ever purchased the extended warranty in their lives.

Also I was not notified over the phone that I had a complimentary oil change, I went to another establishment before going to Nissan for an oil change the same morning. I told the service representative about that and he said sorry the oil change expires at the end of December. I asked him if I could get a voucher for my next oil change since the person who contacted me over thw phone had not mentioned to me that I had a complimentary oil change, and he said no there is nothing I can do about that.

So he asked another employee and this man looked at me and was like “you used the last one last time it will be 100 dollars today” and walked away.  I told the gentleman who was helping me ok, I asked how long it would take, for I had my whole family in the car and we would be waiting on it, and he specified approximately one hour.  I said great and we went into the waiting room to wait.  At about an hour and half I went outside to look and see the progress of our car and it was parked out front done.  All employees were in the Bay Area charting with no customers.  I went to one of them and asked if I could get the papers for my car since it was finished so I could pay.  He told me I would have to ask the employee who was helping me.  Once I found him, he looked confused went to another employee and it took them another 30 minutes to get my paperwork, he said they couldn’t find it.

I left my car in the workshop for almost a week. To replace transmission

To do alignment

The break was not been attended to. Same problem. 
Important Note:
After one week, we discovered the same tyre had the same problem, low pressure.  We took the car back to Nissan workshop and we were told by the mechanic they replaced the punctured tyre instead of the good tyre from the front. (new tyre was rotate to the front)

We lost our confident completely on this one.  I hope the management take note of this serious mistakes.  We know mistakes happened. But it can be serious and endanger the user's.

When asked  I was told in a rude demeaning fashion that ""everyone has their own taste in music"".  This is not music but NOISE and very unnerving to not only me but others who were waiting (as we talked about it).

50126,26-Oct-18,"Multiple times I received invitation cards to come to Bakersfield Nissan, bring in my car, and drive out in a new car. The cards were sent to me by Mr. Rene Campos, General Manager, Nissan of Bakersfield with a hand written note stating, ""See me personally...)-something I was disallowed to do upon my arrivals. It was my Versa Mr. Campos's invitation card indicated would be traded for the new car. Twice, I left in the same car I drove into Nissan of Bakersfield looking forward to discuss business with Mr. Campos. It never happened. Instead, I was confronted by floor sales persons who lead me to an cubical office. I explained reasons why I was there and presented invitation cards and yellow notes with instructions over the signature, ""Rene."" I was pressured into discussing business with the sales person who apparently was without discretion to close a deal and back and forth to the General Manager's office numerous times and returned to me for more discussion. I left empty. On the third occasion, I returned to Bakersfield Nissan for the same reason above stated at the invitation of Mr. Campos and ran into the same obstacle. After four plus hours and no food, only water, I was worn down by the pressure. I was presented a 2016 Nissan Sentra I agreed to purchase with an understanding my Versa would be taken in trade. I was escorted to the finance office where I was presented with a pile of documents. I was not allowed opportunity to read the documents before signing. Select pages were push in front of me and the financier stated the title of each document, put her finger on a signature line and said, ""initial here, sign your name here."" In compliance, worn down, and her not knowing, do to military service connected disability, I have low frustration tolerance, I signed document indicating I had sign a lease while I thought I was there to purchase and trade-in my Versa for which I later discovered I's been overcharged for a used
vehicle-the Versa.   The sales person stated Bakersfield Nissan did not want to take the Versa in trade to lower my cost for the Sentra. Because I signed papers for the Sentra, I was told I had to keep the Sentra because I signed the papers. So I left the Versa, drove home in the Sentra and had a neighbor drive me back to Bakersfield Nissan to get the Versa and drive back home. Three days later I drove back to Bakersfield Nissan and as I entered, I was confronted by the salespersons. I told him I did not want a leased vehicle because I discovered I would be charged for mileage if I exceeded a certain number. I explained long distances I needed to travel from my Delano residence to West Los Angeles VA Medical Facility (a little more than 300 miles round-trip,) sometimes several times during the same month and for that reason clock-up lots of mileages, and that I drive from Delano to Bakersfield (approximately 100 miles round-trip) sometimes four to five times a month to the Bakersfield VA Outpatient Clinic for medical reasons. He went to the General Manger's Office. Shot time later General Manager approached me saying he was sorry; however, because I signed the contract, it is binding. 

This year, on or about October 9, 2018, I received a telephone call from a Mr. Sergio stating he was a Bakersfield Nissan Representative and that I had be preapproved to bring in my 2016 Nissan Sentra and drive out in a new car. He asked if I could come in today and I answered, no. How about tomorrow. I answered, no. He asked, when can you come in and emphasized saying, ""If you don't come-in soon, the offer may disappear."" I indicated I could come in Thursday. He replied, ""Okay, I'll put you down for 12:30, October 11th,"" and I agreed.

At 12 p.m. on October 11, 2018, I arrived at Bakersfield Nissan. I was greed by a salesperson introducing himself as ""Jorge."" I told him I was there to discuss with Sergio who called me Tuesday, the 9th-that I wanted consistency. Jorge asked, ""Are you Frank."" I answered yes. He said,  ""Sergio is off today, but he told me about you and stated you wanted to trade the Sentra and purchase a new car."" I replied, ""That's right. That's why I'm here. We talked extensively and back and forth he went to and fro the General Manager's office. He eventually presented me with a document to sign and took it back to the General manager's office. I assume it was an authorization for the General manager to run a credit report. I am awaiting for a copy of my credit reports to see if there were any requires from Bakersfield Nissan on October 11, 2018.

At any rate, I was later escorted to the financier's office where, again, after approximately four hours, I was presented with a pile of documents. Again, I was not afforded opportunity to read the documents before signing. The financier simply told me the title of the documents and putting her finger on  lines instructed me to ""put your initial here and sign your name here."" This instruction and procedure followed as to each document I signed. The only question I asked was why so much when she told me the total sum I would have to pay. She said I had to pay finance and interest and that those provisions applied to every credit contract.

Thereafter, I learned or discovered I was not driving out in a new car as promised by Mr. Sergio who was not there and did not tell me on October 91th, 2018, that he would not be working on Thursday, October 11, 2018. He did not tell me I would be discussing business with George. He told me the lease I signed initially would be converted into a purchase and then traded for a new vehicle. I've discussed this matter numerous time with the Bakersfield Nissan General Manager, Nissan Bakersfield Financier, Nissan Consumer Affairs-distance and regional. Several times I've attempted to meet with Mr. Sergio but could never caught up to him.

For all the above reasons and existing mechanical reasons are reasons for why I state I have been victim of unfair business dealing under pressure and try to manage because I wish not to disturb my credit rating.

I pray Bakersfield Nissan will mean what its employees promise when sending me invitation card and telephone calling me to come in, exchange or trade-in my cars and drive out in a new car. I am one person, the only driver having but one shaded parking space (one car parked out on the street, and Bakersfield Nissan failed to honor terms expressed under warranty, have me driving back and forth where there were recall campaigns on both vehicles, have me make appointments to bring in the vehicles for service which Nissan failed to remedy and charge me for mileage for bringing in the vehicle, then tell me nothing can be done because warranty on the Versa has expired, but failed to perform duties to make or attempt to make necessary transmission repairs while the vehicle was under warranty while the Versa was in Bakersfield Nissan's possession. 

All the above reasons expresses my dissatisfaction and yet, I love Nissan Automobiles and would recommend others to go Nissan. When a customer walks in, he/she is apparently motivated to make a purchase. The dealer does not need to result to trickery or scheme to convince him/her to do anything. Another element I experience, I purchased vehicles Bakersfield Nissan salespersons wanted to sell me, not what I wanted to buy. As stated above, I have low frustration tolerance and easily worn down.

Let the customer take home papers needed to be sign so he/she can read them over and know what the document does and does not contain. In that way, problems pressing me would be eliminated. Trained your financiers to ensure they don't present the customer with document overcharging interest and other costs.

I hope I suffer no adverse consequence simply for having expressed reasons for dissatisfaction for how I was treated. Dallas Nissan Corp. did make some appropriate adjustment in the amount of interest Bakersfield Financier charged on the document she placed before me for my signature. We all make mistakes during sometime in other lives.   ",6,64,26

When I showed up I still had to wait for quite some time to get someone to help me. Once the gentleman helped me I proceeded to go inside and sign up for the shuttle. I waited for a very long time over an hour and then finally saw someone come inside and get these two ladies, I asked around to see if he was the shuttle driver and he was. There was no announcement made that he was there, he just grabbed people and left. I had my nine month old with me so I rushed to the driver and one of the ladies (guest) had an issue with me going without a base for the car seat. She was livid and kept going on about it being illegal (which it’s not). I decided to wait for the next shuttle. Again, I waited for another hour. I went outside to check on the status of my car and they told me it would be another 1:30. I see the same shuttle driver and ask if I can get a ride this time. Finally I get to go home. They call be later that my car is ready and I have my husband drop me off. I wait in the waiting area for a good 40 minutes before I get any kind of answer about my car. The receptionist is useless. When I see the gentleman that helped me I ask him about my car and he says he was at lunch and why didn’t the other guy just grab the paperwork for me? Apparently the other guy was just in the back chit chatting. I was so mad that Nissan would waste people’s valuable time. I have a family and things to do, my time is not free. ",6,64,577

I was told that at the time of their inspection before sales all was good. Ya right , of course they will say that . I mean how many people we know who chicken out of situations and would never man up to a mistake and take accountability and corrective action, a lot right. 

Called the sales guy Salvador and texted him. This guy is all promises and no follow through. Then will not have the basic decency to reply to a text or return calls. Typical slimy sales rep.

I didn’t buy the Nissan but a few weeks later I purchased a car from a different car company. When the ran my credit, they noticed that Nissan ran my credit though SIX banks. Never did Jerry inform me of this every time he came back from talking with his manager about deals and prices. I am so frustrated with the lack of putting the customer first. I also found out the Jerry lied to me regarding his claim that after 4 months of making payments, I could go to a bank and they would refinance my “new car” and I would be likely to get 0% interest.

I returned the car back to them right the day after of the purchase. One day later they gave me the vehicle back and I was told that they fixed the alignment on it.

I look over contract and everything looks legit so I sign and give the Guy some more info he says he needed.  I ask him if he needs anything else he saysno we're done and enjoy the car. 

Maybe a week later he asks me for a copy of my check stub which I'd already given them that info when I bought the car. And offered new ones when he came to my work.  So I FAX him check stubs.   He calls again a few days later.  I'm at work and can't be spending my day resending info to people who are losing it obviously.

So a week or so later...still asking for check stubs. So I send again AND mail em to be sure. 

Next day my boss calls n says the finance company was wanting her to FAX employment verification including pay info.  So she sent it.  I also got a note from my insurance that the finance Co had been added as lien holder. All is good. 

I get a call from dealership saying my approval is going to expire because I did not get them check stubs and add lien holder and give them references. I had given them 6 already. 

The next day I get a statement finally from the finance company
  Payment is due right away. So I call finance Co and ask best way to make payment. They advise western union so I go on my lunch and make payment. Called them back n gave confirmation number. He confirmed they recd pmt.  All done.   I figures dealership is behind on work. Finance Co says all is good.

50961,03-Mar-08,"My husband and I both like Nissan cars, however if you want to buy a Nissan I would suggest you travel to another Nissan dealer.  Nissan of Bakersfield is managed by a foriegner who is unethical, and has no idea of American values.

We purchased a brand new 2007 Nissan Quest in 7/2007.  Despite being a new vehicle, it was mistreated while sitting on the dealer lot.  There were numerous scratches in the paint, the headlight was very scuffed, and the interior had several large grease stains in the carpet.

After making the decision to buy the Nissan Quest, it took a total of 3 days and more than 8 hours to complete the transaction.  Despite being ""pre-approved"" by our ban prior to our arrival at Nissan, we were still made to wait for hours.  We encountered deceptive business practices.

Upon driving our new car home we did not have all the accessories that came STANDARD with our car such as: 2 keys, 2 keyless entry remotes, the
cordless headphones for the DVD, DVD remote.  We waited weeks for these items.

The ""new car detail"" was a failure!  We left our car with Nissan for 5 days to have the scratches in the paint fixed, interior stains removed.
After 5 days I returned to pick-up my car to find only 1 scratch had been fixed.  While fixing only 1 scratch on the driver door (ignoring the rest) paint thinner was splattered on the window. 

I had to return another time to have the interior stains removed.  

Another trip was required to fix the driver window, and replace the scuffed haedlight.

There was another attempt to fix the scratches in the paint, but it only resulted in more damage.  While some scratches were fixed, other scratches were made.  We took our car to the dealer with 1/4 tank of gas, and it was returned to us on empty with the gas light on.  I had to drive to the gas station to buy fuel, but the fuel release button was not working, so I had to have it towed back to Nissan.


According to Nissan the fuel tank release button fuse was not plugged in after fixing the window. 

Unfortunately, while plugging the fuel release button back in, the mirror on the driver door came loose and it was impossible to use the norror due to the intense shimmying.

Returning to Nissan was required to have the mirror fixed.

I came in and talked to a finance officer and she told me it can’t be changed and I should have read my contract and it stated Feb 1st. 

I’ve now had this car for almost a month and still haven’t gotten a call for when I can get the tint put on. I could have saved money and went to a tint shop and gotten it done on the same day.

A simple part replacement would solve the issue, and I would be happy, but they refuse to order the part, citing ""compatibility issues"" which, is still not a problem for the customer.  Also, if there are compatibility issues with certain phones and how they interact with their vehicles, then they are at the very least guilty of false advertisement as no where in the vehicle manuals, dealer documentation or advertisements that only some devices may work with their internal systems.
Again, they looked at my under warranty vehicle, ran some tests that had already been done before AND was documented (which they had access to) and the end result was still that they weren't going to fix the issue.

51133,02-Oct-18,"My review is not so much against Crown Dodge, but rather the Dodge vehicle I purchased. 
On August 25th, I purchased a 2017 Dodge Charger. After only 2 days in the car, I got a ""service shifter"" alarm. Also, the service department at Crown called me and said there was a recall on the computer software system, so I brought the car in. After they performed the upgrade, the computer system crashed. That led to them having the vehicle for 2 weeks while they tried to fix it. It required them calling the corporate mechanics because they didn't know how to fix the computer. They ended up having to replace one of the computer components. After I picked up the vehicle, I drove it for 2 days, then began having multiple problems. The check engine light came on. I also had erroneous readings that all of the tires had low tire pressure, and some sort of brown fluid was leaking from under the car. Back to the dealership. They have now had the vehicle for the past 2 1/2 weeks. At this point, I don't even want the car back. As far as I am concerned, this car isn't safe. I just want Dodge to buy the car back and allow me to purchase a vehicle that actually runs. The whole reason I spent so much money on a new vehicle is for the reliability. I am afraid that if they make me take this car back,  the computer system will fail while I'm on the freeway and I could seriously hurt or kill someone if I can's stop. Computers seem to have influence over just about everything in cars these days.  I have an open case on file requesting a buy back option. The case manager is in Texas, I believe, and she is very difficult to contact. This car is not safe, but I feel like my concerns are being ignored or at least allowed to drag on. I bought this car 5 weeks ago and have only actually driven it for a total of 4 days. The car is still in the service department as I write this review. 
The dealership itself has tried to be helpful throughout all of this. Alex, my sales manager has been helpful and is doing what he can, but the buy back option is out of his hands. The service manager has been helpful as well. Also, JP my service advisor has been an advocate. Crown Dodge has provided either a rental car or a free loaner vehicle for me while my car has been out of commission. ",6,65,-1
51146,12-Jun-18,"I was excited to finally find a car, I get a Jeep Compass which I was sold from first glance and test drive. Once the ink was signed and I drove it off the lot, the back up camera kept sticking, even in drive. The gas mph is supposed to be 22 in the city and 32 on the freeway. I have pictures now of my gas gauge is malfunctioning and not reading accurately. The radio switches back and forth from Media on it's on. I brought the car back in for other servicing to let them know. I reported both of these problems when I brought my vehicle in on May 7th. The customer service rep told me that I indeed needed a new radio and that they couldn't find anything wrong with the gas gauge. She would order the radio and it could possibly take a day or a month. What kind of timeline is this?! Especially on a brand new vehicle. It is not June 11th and I have yet to hear back from the service department on my radio. I am still having problem with the gas gauge and can show you pictures of the issue. I am very dissatisfied with this service. A new car should now have these issues and before leaving the lot should have a full inspection. A timeline for a part should never be a day to a month. The communication on this is ridiculous. I want my radio and gas gauge fixed! No more excuses. This is disappointing to pay so much for a vehicle to not get what you paid for. I will do a courtesy to call the service department today to see if my radio is in. I have already contacted the manufacturer. If this is not handled I will seek legal counsel. I don't have a problem with the customer service rep, I have a problem with the service. ",6,65,600
51153,02-Apr-18,"We had a terrible experience at the Crown Dodge Service Department. I spoke with Kristin on Friday. I made an appointment for Monday morning for repairs to our new 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee. I called at 8 am on Monday to confirm. Kristen confirmed the morning appointment time as between 9 and 10 am. She instructed us to ask for her upon arrival. 

My wife arrived at 9:05 am. She parked the car and went to one of the offices in the service department. She spoke with Monte about the scheduled repairs. He asked who she had been assigned to. She said that we had only been advised to ask for Kristin. He reacted as if there was no Kristin. He took her to a window where there were three sheets of paper taped up listing the appointments for the day. We were not on the list. 
My wife insisted that we were instructed to ask for Kristin. He then conceded that he did know Kristin and advised where she could be found.

My wife entered the main office area where she found Kristin. Kristin asked where the car was. My wife said it was parked outside. Kristin scolded her for not getting in line. We were not instructed to get in line before. 
My wife moved the car behind the 20 - 30 cars that were in line. Why were we given an appointment, then placed in line behind 30 cars? What is the purpose of an appointment?

When she got to the front of the line, a young man tried to help her. He had to find someone who would work her in, since she was not on the list and had no one assigned to her. The young man was going from one person to another, but they were all saying they were busy.

Finally, Monte came to the car and asked what she needed. She told him about the trouble we are having with the car. 
He said he saw on his tablet that we needed “a loaner”, but there were none available. She said that was fine, she just needed a ride back. He told her she would have to take a shuttle, and there was not one until 11:00. She said okay and waited in the cold waiting room.
Luckily a nice shuttle driver came in at 10:25 and offered a ride.

At 3:48 pm Monte called to ask what was the purpose of the car being brought in. My wife had to explain the trouble again. The car had been there all day, and they hadn’t looked at it yet.

I called at 4:45 and asked when we could pick up the car. Monte said they wouldn’t be able to look at it until tomorrow. I was furious. We had an appointment at 9 am! We had been without the car for an entire day, and now they were going to keep it another day. I told him we would come and get the car.

My wife went to pick the car up. She went to Monte who waved her off and told her to go in the office for the paperwork work in order to pick up the car.

The car remains in a state of disrepair.

51205,27-Oct-17,Went to this dealership. I found 2 chargers with 20% off sticker on windshield. Just what I was looking for.. The sales person was jonny.. Which was great at first but then when it came down to price I noticed he wasn't adding the 20% off when I asked he said both cars were a mistake and they should have never had that sticker. He should have owned this from the beginning... How is this my fault? He then came back and said they granted me the 20% off which was still a lie.. he tried explaining how much money 20% off was. It never added up. I pulled out my calculator so I could show him how much 20% really was.. Which he was off by 1k. I went to car and by that time they took off stickers of 20% off.. But they really think we buyers are stupid.. I went to the other car took a picture of the 20% off.. And i took a picture of the car I was trying to buy. This is not the first time they mix up window stickers like this.. I came a month ago and had this same issue.. Also the car was labeled as a 2017 it was a 2016.. WOW.. I still was willing to give them a chance because of the car itself.. Didn't happen though. Jimmy decided to pawn me off to one of his managers.. I saw jonny outside when I was leaving.. Its my fault if you look at the reviews it would let you know about this stuff.. The manager I must say was nice.. Gerardo I believe his name was..

I'm pretty sure it was the second reason.. their service department is atrocious they continue with their lying long after you have bought the car the service people are rude unknowledgeable about what they are speaking about and overall horribly unpleasant to deal with.. basically their thought process is if we make this as an unenjoyable as possible for a customer they will not come back as often thus we will probably save money on warranties... my wife's car is only a year old and has been shutting off as she drives the vehicle when she called service today they told her nothing we can do for you you'll have to come by next week sometime and maybe we can take a look at it... that is absolutely unacceptable.. when I called back they just talk over you don't allow you to speak and then hang up the phone multiple times.. Crown Dodge is a disgrace the owner should be ashamed that his dealership is ran by such dishonest unworthy people..

51235,14-Jun-17,"Before I begin, let me say that I take no joy in writing such reviews. As a reasonable, patient and fair person to a fault, I take such reviews seriously. I would much rather submit a positive review (and I have done so for many organizations I have done business with), however, when really bad situations arise, I think it is important to share with those that could otherwise avoid having to go through a similar experience. This dealership is hands down the worst Jeep dealership I have ever encountered. I tried to purchase/lease a vehicle from them several weeks ago. I started off by speaking with Scott Walters, then was passed along to Darren Stewart and finally to Paul Mills. I have been a long time loyal Jeep owner with excellent credit and had many models of Jeeps both purchased and leased from various dealerships where I have lived/worked around the country. I generally always asked the same set of questions to make sure all the figures/terms are clear, so not my first rodeo as the saying goes. Crown Jeep refused to answer very basic questions that I asked verbally and in writing and then gave me attitude for actually asking the questions. Furthermore, I have tried on (3) separate occasions to make the G.M., i.e. Mr. Crown via his assistant Terry Vasquez aware of my experience so they could use as a learning tool to improve customer service for future customers, hence the reason I have resisted writing this review until now. I have never had the courtesy of a reply from her or anyone else at the dealership. Needless to say, I took my business to another dealership and was treated fairly, professionally, courteously while valuing my time. I even contacted the GM of that dealership recently to let him know how positive my experience was with the Internet Sales Manager. Do yourself a favor and avoid Crown Jeep. They are dishonest (deliberately did not apply rebates/incentives I was eligible for, probably to pocket for themselves), unprofessional and just outright rude. The place is dysfunctional and clearly it all starts from the top right on down. If I could give them zero stars I would. These people need to wake up and realize in the year 2017 that many people want to avoid the haggle and complete as much of the transaction by telephone as possible and then go in, sign the docs and be on their way. If you don't want your valuable time wasted, not to mention being unnecessarily frustrated/ripped off, then don't give this dealership your business. Go somewhere that they actually value the customer relationship and appreciate your business.",6,65,-1

Other two calls the receptionist came back on and tells me there is nobody available to help me. How hard can this be?Noticed they asked what type of service right up front.

In every aspect I had a horrible experience here, I'm not saying I wouldn't buy a Dodge or RAM, but I will never go to this dealership again and am very displeased that I'm stuck with a  car from them.",6,65,-1

Says sorry, he'll get right on it, fix it, call back. We don't hear from him. We call back the next day. He's not in for a couple days. We drive down there. Boss says they'll make it right, will call us the next morning to let us know. Nope. By the next afternoon we decided to call the bank and explain what the dealership has done to us.

51359,27-Nov-15,"I am a medical student and my husband is an active duty service member stationed at the Port Hueneme Naval Base. I unfortunately didnt do my research before we decided to buy our first car together as a young married couple. I posted a review of my first experience with them about a month ago, but after I posted my horrific experience on 4 different review sites they decided to finally do something about our situation. Long story short- they sold us the wrong car to drive off of the lot. We asked for a V6 4x4 and we drove a 2016 Jeep Cherokee 4cyl off the lot. It wasn't until the next morning that our financial adviser pointed out that we were driving a 4cyl, which was NOT the vehicle I specifically asked for. I returned the vehicle less than 24 hours later and after being harassed by multiple salesmen as my husband and I walked across the lot due to the fact that we were already returning the vehicle, they told us I lost $10,000 in equity and there was nothing they could do for us. Not to mention they lied to us about the cost of window tinting, the rental car agreement for servicing, and the details of the car we drove off the lot. I had the financial manager give false information to us and thankfully my financial adviser educated me before I went in. I had to call Navy Federal representatives twice during the closing of our deal in order to prove that our financial 'manager' was dishing us negligent information. They called me back 4 days later after my detailed and explicit reviews were seen by the entire dealership and bought my car back at full price and I finally was able to drive my 2015 Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk off of the lot. I thought that I finally put my miserable experience to rest, but that was a joke of a thought within itself. I scheduled a detailing appointment with Cassie on Friday, November 21st.I told her in front of my husband that we are leaving for Tahoe next week so we need our car. She acknowledged the information I provided her and proceeded to schedule my detail wash appointment on Tuesday, November 24th. Well, it is November 24th without my car. I called Crown Dodge 4 times today asking about the status of my car. I dropped my car off at 8:45am this morning. At 3pm, they said they didnt even get to my car yet. I called back again and my service manager didnt answer the phone. I called again at 4:30 and my car still wasnt finished. I called again at 5:30pm and my service manager didnt answer again. My husband dropped me off for my friends funeral this even WHICH I LEFT EARLY FOR TO PICK UP MY CAR after service hours. I called them as I was walking away from the funeral to head to the dealership and they said my keys were not available for me to pick my car up that i dropped off to get a DETAILED WASH ONLY OVER A PERIOD OF10 HOURS. I am scheduled to leave for Tahoe at 6am tomorrow with my husband. I am supposed to pick my family up along the way and get there in time for a scheduled event while my husband is taking leave before deployment. They once again said their famous words, ""I'm sorry Mrs. Cann, but there is nothing I can do for you."" I gave them the benefit of the doubt for fixing my car situation and took down my reviews on all of the sites, but this is the final straw. I am now being punished for the fact that not one person called my husband or me to tell us that the car would not be ready by the end of the day WHICH WAS IN FACT GUARANTEED TO US TWICE. I am now xxxx BENT on making sure I can continue to make sure I can pass our experience onto others so prevent them from buying and servicing at your dealership. I already called the Better Business Bureau once and I will be doing it once again tomorrow morning along with contacting Crystler. You have wasted enough of our time. I will be seeing you guys first thing tomorrow morning.

called the GM to tell him about my oil.....He said that type of service does not 
include an oil change. You have to request it? $1500.00 for a major tune-up and
an oil change is not included? Okay?  So where is my A/C part I paid for? Its only 
been 6 months? We will call you when it comes in,  He hung up on me before I 
could respond.

I told the sales guy what I was looking for and he showed me what trucks where the 25k ones and took it for a test drive and came back and he asked if we could run some numbers. We went inside and he took down some information and told him that I did't want my credit ran and told him what it was since I was just at Toyota a month before(just wanted a rough estimate).....He came back and handed me off to his manager because he had another client that was interested in a car. The manager sat down and said that the truck was 35K. I told him that the paper and online said there were rebates that brought it down to 25k not 35k. He said that the only rebate he could give me was a $1500 credit....I explained to him that's not what the paper said and he said ""well if I could give it to you for 25K I still cant get it where you want the payments ""(acting like he was doing me a favor for giving it to me for what its advertised for). I told him that I understand that but wanted to run some numbers and see where we end up but he wanted to run my credit and he said ""if you don't help me why should I help you(being very rude at this point). I told him that I just wanted to run numbers but if it didn't work out that's fine and I just wanted my keys back so I could leave. He couldn't care that he lost this dealership money.  I have bought 7 cars from Toyota and have always been treated right. Toyota has always given me estimated number without looking at my credit(I even gave them my credit score so they could work with numbers). I should have listened to the yelp reviews and stayed away.

The salesman Evan told me that the Jeep I was looking at came with a warranty and free service for 4 years and it was included in the price. Well now 3 weeks later when I am fixing a mess THEY created in financing, I realized they charged me over 3 thousand dollars for that service.

51445,02-Mar-13,"I have given this rating due to the way I was treated in the service department. I took my jeep into this place for warranty work. I was informed they would check out my jeep and call the warranty company and give ma a call by the end of the day. Two days later I had to call and was given some run around and was told there was a Chrysler bulleton out stating the jeeps were installed with faulty trans filters and that this would fix the problem. They made it sound like it was going to be covered it was not. 3 day later I had to call again and find out the status of my jeep now and again was given some run around saying they could not duplicate the problem and would I mind coming down to show them. Took off work early and took jim for a ride and duplicated the problem. 4 days later I had to call and find out the status and I was told they couldn't duplicate the problem that I had shown him 4 days earlier. I informed jim to stop all work and I want my jeep back and that I need it by Wednesday night at the latest he said fine and that he would do it and call me. Wednesday night no call Thursday no call until Thursday afternoon jim calls and says the jeep is done. The total is way to much for something that was played off as warranty. 
So I spent 13 days without a car due to jim not calling warranty right away so they could issue me a rental. This is why I purchased the extended warranty. Now after paying the high bill I get my jeep home and look under it to find the transmission pan is leaking transmission fluid as well as the front shock, control arms (upper and lower) as well as the half shaft and inner fender have a bunck of grease and oil all over them.

51447,26-Jan-13,"I'm Lucky that I did not get killed driving the unsafe 2009 Jeep Rubicon they sold me for an over inflated price.

The Sales Manager said this is a Chrysler Certified Per-Owned Vehicle that they spent $2,000 getting it Certified. After numerous break downs and phone calls, I found out it was not a Chrysler Certified Per-Owned Vehicle.

Some of the problems:
Broken rear track bar bracket, axle could fall off and roll over vehicle.
Wheel lug nut where undersized and wheels could have fallen off.
Dislocated rear axle spring.
Rear Sway Bar rubbing through break lines.
Transfer case shifting cable broke first time tried to use it.
Transfer Case is bad and needs to be replaced.
Oil press sending unit was bad.
Bad oil leak.
and a few other items.

The sales manager agreed to give me $3,000 off, then changed it to $2,000 on the contract without telling me. When I found out it was too late.

I got this 2009 Jeep Rubicon about 6 weeks ago, I have not been able to drive it for the past 3 weeks because it's unsafe to drive.

A few weeks after buying this Jeep I found Crown Dodge where running ads $1,000 less than what I had paid for it, I believe this is unlawful along with some other unlawful things they may have done.

I've been back to Crown Dodge over 20 times trying to straighten this out and just get the run around. This jeep has been it their shop 3 times and I have talked to half a dozen people there.

Also tried taking it to another Dealership, They did not want to touch it with all of the problems it has.

51451,10-Oct-12,"I was looking to get a 2012-2013 Charger SRT8. I contacted about 10 different dealerships, all with the same details: Give me your best price possible and I will buy a car from you today. Also, see what deal I can get on my 2010 Challenger RT. I was contacted by Richard Schwartz since I posted on the internet. We went back and forth. At once, I thought he was rude through email but its hard to tell if he meant it like the way I took it or not, so I brushed it off. I told him, here is a quote on the best price I have been able to find. Also what the best offer on my car as a trade in. He said, I can beat it, just come down to test drive the car and drive home in it. He said, come as soon as possible since I like to leave early since I have the day off. I said I will be there before 5. I even left early so Richard wouldnt be held back too much longer.

I get there and I notice the car isnt where it has been for the past few months. He said, oh, its been moved. We walked around for 10mins. He said, let me see if its somewhere else. I waited in his office for about 10 more mins and he came in to tell me it had be sold. OK, that happens, not happy, but I understand, you can always get another car. Then I am told the price I showed them wasnt going to happen. That it was a low-ball offer and no dealer could ever do that price. I didnt tell him it was a friends dealership that I have done business with in the past, I just told him and some other manager that I have gotten 10k off previous yr SRT8s. I wasnt even looking for that type of deal. Was told I dont know what Im talking about and Im pretty much smoking crack. 

Then as I am trying to leave and get my keys since they tested out my car to see what shape it was in, another manager told me pretty much teh same thing Richard did. Im a liar, dont know what Im talking about, blah blah blah. Well, Im never doing business there again.

I have been bringing my car there for a yr for service and had very good experiences with them, but after this, I will be driving 30miles somewhere else each time I need an oil changed or any warranty work done on my Challenger.

Another manager did call me to check up and see what the status was and from what she told me, this isnt the first time Richard has done this. If this is true, then why keep someone like that? If you know he is bad, why risk having a customer, like myself, be handled this way?",6,66,35

51468,21-May-11,"I took my vehicle to Crown Dodge starting in January/2011 after Chrysler instructed me to take it to a Dodge service center if I wanted potential assistance with unresolved issues with the car. The initial problem was in regards to an air injection code that had been in the vehicle since a little over a month after purchasing the used 2005 Dodge Stratus. After a little over a week, I was told that my car needed a new O2 sensor and then after opening it up they found that it also needed a cadillic convertor (spelling?). I agreed to replace these parts and the problem was still not resolved and I was up to about $3,000 in repairs. About a week later my service rep told me that there was a special emissions warranty on the car and that I would have to pay for any of those repairs. My car was at Crown Dodge service center for 6 weeks. During that time I got very few updates on what was going on and I finally let them know I needed to go out of town and needed to know if I would have my car. I was told to pick it up and I drove to Nevada. When I got there, my car had an oil leak and the air pump was still staying on. I had to disconnect my battery every day to keep it from being drained by the pump. I called Sandy (my service rep) the day I arrived and she told me to bring it back when I returned. I remained there for 3 weeks and on my way home the dash was glitching (back defrost turning on and off, radio/clock turning on and off) and about half way home the odometer readings started flickering all over the place. I returned home on Saturday and took the car in Monday. I was told there were 2 oil leaks (cost almost $800) and I got those fixed. They told me the dash was flickering initially but they couldn't repeat it so come get the car and bring it back if it continues. I paid for the oil leaks (3 weeks later) and didn't even sit in my car before noticing the dash was flickering. I left the car and then was told that there was a ground issue and they were having trouble finding where it was coming from. Eventually I was told they found it and that cost me $225.00. After I picked up my car there was a loud noise coming from my engine (it was heard over my radio) and the car was still puttering at slow speeds and stops. I took my car back and Sandy advised me to take it to my mechanic to make sure it wasn't the transmission and to let her know what they say. I did that and then took it to a transmission shop, per my mechanic. They confirmed it was not the transmission and that you could clearly hear the noise form the engine. I called Sandy back and didn't get a return call so called again a few days later. I was instructed to bring my car back in to Crown Dodge, so I did and after a few days they called and told me it was a loud alternator (Sandy was not there and I got a new service advisor, Jeff). I told Jeff that I wanted to follow up with Chrysler because I didn't understand how there was a new issue with the car that wasn't there before. I also asked him about the puttering and her told me it may be a core issue inside the alternator, but they wouldn't know until they replaced it and also asked me to follow up with the service manager, David Weber, about my concerns. I left a message for David and never got a call back. I also called Chrysler and after them speaking to David, they agreed to pay for the alternator. After the repair was done, I picked up the car and to my surprise it was still puttering. I left and immediately called back to Chrysler. I also found that a rodent of some sort had been in my trunk (how I don't know) and chewed up some papers and a piece of the weather strip in my trunk. I called and spoke to Jeff on a Saturday and he asked me to leave a message for David on Monday, which I did and he again didn't call me back. Chrysler got a hold of David regarding the puttering of my car and I was asked to once again bring back my car. I did and now they are telling me it needs 4 new motor mounts and the car isn't puttering. I told Jeff not to touch the car because I wanted to follow up with Chrysler because it didn't make sense to me how it now has another repair that wasn't needed before and how the issue it has had all along that was never fixed, suddenly isn't there. He asked me to call David and I said he doesn't call me back so who else can I call. He said Stewart, a new service manager. I left a message for Stewart that Friday and surprisingly David called me back Monday. I explained to David my concerns about the recommended repairs because each time I bring it back there is something else wrong with it that wasn't there before. All he kept saying was ""you need 4 motor mounts"", over and over again. I told him not to touch my car and I was following up with Chrysler, which I did. My rep from Chrysler called me back after finally getting a hold of David and told me that David said they are recommending I replace the motor mounts, but based on the mileage and year of the car they didn't really have to be replaced and they weren't really worn down that bad. For this reason Chrysler said they couldn't authorize a repair that was ""needed"", which is why I questioned it in the first place. Chrysler has offered to send me to another dealership service center for another look. I picked up my car from Crown Dodge on Monday May 16th and attempted to file a complaint against David Weber and the woman I spoke to attempted to address my concerns by bringing David in to speak to me. This was a big waste of time, David told me good I was going to another dealership and I also let him know I had filed a complaint with the Bureau of Automotive Repairs and he said ""ok, good"". I told him I didn't understand how my car continues to have new problems every time I bring it in and how he didn't return 1 phone call I made to him, except that morning after I left a message for someone else. He just kept shaking his head at me. Then I asked him about the weather strip in the car and he told me to have the new service center access it and call Chrysler. I said ""so Chrysler is responsible for damages that happened to my car while at your service station?"" and he said ""yes"". I said that doesn't make sense, how are they responsible for damages that happened at your service station and David said because a rat couldn't get in my trunk. I said I don't know how it happened, but the damage happened while it was at his service station and he told me to call my insurance company and file a claim. I said, ok, so now my insurance is responsible for the damages and he said yes. I said that doesn't make any sense, the damage happened at your service center and he said ""I don't know what to tell you, it's an insurance issues. I told him he didn't make any sense and I needed my key. I was told it was in my car and he walked away. I continued to express my concerns with the 2 women at the counter and 1 informed me that David and another guy looked at my trunk and said it was normal wear and tear and a rodent didn't do it. I showed her the pictures I took before I cleaned the trunk (to make sure a rodent wasn't still in there) and a pillow case with the stuff that was chewed on was in my trunk for them to see (I don't know if David ever looked at it). In total I was without my car for about 13 weeks and was never offered a rental car, except for 1 weekend when I was dropped off to get my ""fixed"" car and had to leave it there for continued issues. I am insulted by David's lack of returning any of my calls to him and his response to any of the concerns I presented to him and my service reps. My car is still not fixed and I have to take it to another service center this upcoming week.   ",6,66,52

And I am in the market to purchase a Dodge Challenger scatpack not from Orange coast now. It took 4 hours to do simple maintenance oil change and tire rotation. 3 hours into my waiting. I approached German Moreno service jerk. He didn’t care, I took a picture of his name tag and he said I couldn’t do that and then he challenged me in front of your service staff including Ferdie your service manager. I said are you challenging me a paying customer who bought his car here. Freddie had to tell this jerk three times to leave the service area. I was just checking 3 hours into my service what was happening with my basic service? Freddie told me that German was having a bad day.  Wow really!! Threatening customers. Lonna Love was terrible & uncaring about Me the customer also. This poor service starts at the top!! Orange coast management and service department. You have lost a valued customer. But I am sure that no one there cares about the customer. Wait until this happens to more customers and you go out of business. Maybe then Orange Coast Dodge will care. I expect at least a phone call from Jeff Peters or management. You have lost another customer I can go elsewhere for my new purchase and service.

It seemed like they were not prepared and had no communication with each other because the guy that asked what service I needed stated they didn’t have any service cards and to just go in to request my service. When I spoke to the advisor she asked for me to go outside to get the service card And I had to explain what the previous person advised me.  She didn’t even have her name on the paperwork it was another guy who didn’t even help me.  For a simple oil change and tire rotation I took 4 hours to complete.  I didn’t get any updates while I was waiting in the lobby.  I had to ask 3 times the status and each time I asked they would say it was almost done and they needed 10 more minutes. Well those 10 minutes turned in 4 hours cuz They completed the service at 11:30 am.  I even had to ask if there was any recommended service still needed. Another service agent had to look it up and stated oh yes filters can be replaced.  I was frustrated because it was 4 hours of waiting and they didn’t bother to tell me the recommended filter change.  5 people that came in after me were able to get their service done with in 1 hour of their arrival and I saw they were getting updates. Were I had to ask several times if my car was almost finished,  Very bad customer service experience. I have visited this dealership a few other times and had a great experience, but this is my first time experiencing this bad of a service, I’m not sure if it’s a new group of service agents but they were the worst I’ve dealt with.

He said about every 15 k miles and they probably didn't replace it for me at the other place . I asked him how does he know I need one now? (Since I just walked in the door and no one has looked at my car ) He said, oh the mileage tells me. After that I said, take it off my order. I made an appointment at 9 am and after that he said it would take an hour and half . It's been 2 hours , I asked how much longer and he said Another 30 min.

Over 3 days I had to call 7 times to get 1 update on my truck. Out of the 7 times 1 I actually got a hold of Tony. The Service advisor didn’t know one of the techs went home sick until the end of the day, which made my truck stay another day, no work was done to it on the second day. It took 3 days to do oil change, 3 recalls, program the infotainment system, and squeaking breaks. I got my truck back dirty with smudges and dust all over the interior, and to top it off I got the usual ""we can't duplicate the problem"", (breaks squeaking) that started happening 10 min after I left the dealer. When I asked how long they drive my truck for this issue I was told we can’t spend all day driving to hear squeaking breaks. Absolutely unacceptable. I sent an email to dodge corporate with the details of how bad of an experience I had but I have yet to hear back. If your car or truck is brand new and you want even the slightest bit of communication avoid, avoid, avoid this place. I won't be taking my truck back. But hey, I got a free loaner... ",6,66,280
51616,19-Jun-19,"After extensive correspondence back and forth with their Online Sales representative, I thought the final price was settled and agreed upon. Originally the sales person quoted me at $923 for DMV fees, which meant they were calculating this 60k truck as if it cost over 150k. I thought this was insane so I used the DMV calculator from the official DMV website to double check and they were indeed up-charging like crazy.  I let him know that as a non-resident, active duty military I would be waved from some fees. Salesman came back with $110 for DMV fees. Sounded good.  When I visited the dealership and it was time to sign all the documents with their finance guy, they changed the sales tax because it was ""miscalculated"". Even though the salesman acknowledged my zip code multiple times in our emails. This I could accept because I didn’t expect them to pay it for me. I signed all the documents and called it a day. About 3 weeks later I get a text from the same finance guy demanding an additional $338 for DMV fees, after going back and forth trying to understand why I would absorb their mistakes, he threatens me with his office manager calling my commanding officer to collect the money. This is incredibly illegal and plain unethical and unprofessional. I then resulted to having the Base Legal Office get involved and rectify. Ultimately, after Legal got involved they accepted their own mistakes. 
Hypothetically speaking, these people could quote you $1 for certain fees and then threaten and demand different amounts. That’s pretty vile.

After checking status on my vehicle for the third time ""two hours"" later with my advisor I finally stood there until I got an update also my vehicle was never washed as I was told it would be. I was called back & credited with a FREE oil change on my next visit. The caller said I would not have to convince my service advisor on my next visit that this all happened because his name would be on my FREE oil change credit & I'm okay with that.

I waited 3 hours and then called him. I left him a voice mail. I waited another hour then called back and was sent to his voice mail. I hung up and called again and was given another service advisor. He told me that a rental was just turned in. What a coincidence! I left my car and took the rental. I explained that I bought an extra package from finance to cover any scratches on my Jeep. Of course he had never heard of it but would look into it. I returned to get my Jeep. They had detailed my Jeep but the scratches were still there. I was told to go out to the waiting room and they would bring my Jeep up in a couple of minutes. I waited over 30 minutes  for them to bring my car to me. They told me there were cars in front of it that they would have to move. In reality, my car was next door in an overflow lot and they didn’t know it. I had one of the service personnel come up to me in the waiting room to inform me of this and that he needed to  see my paperwork to retrieve a service number. Finally my Jeep was delivered.

Finally told I could pick up, 5 days later. Arrived at dealer and was surprised by the cost of the repair and the claim on their document that I verbally approved them via a phone call that never occurred.

It ended up being a 3 hour wait to service a vehicle with under 5,000 miles. This cost me to miss significant time at work as I had to now drive back to the city of Carson in rush hour traffic. 

This is not the first bad experience I've had with this place. I had a similar experience when purchasing the vehicle. After getting the ""Deal"" done I was cast to the waiting area where I was told my vehicle would be out shortly.

51701,15-Nov-18,"I had been looking around for the new 2019 Ram Rebel and on a RAM truck message forum (5thgenrams.com), I was referred to Max B as another local forum member just picked up a Laramie trim from Max.

This dealership had tons of Rebels compared to other dealers who had little to none. So I figured they have the most inventory means they know how to get one for me??

So I call Max B. and introduce myself and tell him that I was referred by a forum member.

1st red flag - Max did not care about the referral or his deal - he just wanted to sell me a truck. Max was offended when I told him that of the 35 Ram Rebels in stock that I could not pick one.

So he asks some questions and I give him answers.
I offered to send a build sheet from the Ram website so that he can look for an incoming Rebel that met my needs. 
I email him my build sheet and he calls back and starts to ask questions on package options and such.

2nd red flag - Max arrogantly states that a 3.6L engine (base) can not be had on a Rebel and never will be. That was a lie - there were a couple of 3.6L Rebels popping up in San Diego and Lake Elsinore using the Ram truck locator.  I could tell Max wanted me to just take a truck off their lot and forgo looking for a 3.6L engine.  I felt that Max was lazy and didn't want to pick up his fingers to locate an incoming or find a factory order D1 or KZ status.

3rd red flag - Max says why get a V6 engine when a REAL MAN drives a V8 Hemi. I try to explain that I am not going to haul, not going to tow, and need the truck as a daily driver. 

Max making that sexist remark is unheard of these days unless he came from a trailer trash area of Georgia.

4th red flag - Max would not tell me which is more affordable to lease on a Rebel when we started to talk about numbers.  He just said he has no idea about residuals and money factors.  Huge mistake - all salespeople are taught to give out base numbers when a customers asks - how do they close a customer ???

5th red flag - Max laughs at me when I try to change over to a Big Horn trim with a 3.6L engine and says that a special order will take 6-8 weeks. That was a lie - there were tons of dealers receiving Big Horns with base 3.6L engines. As a matter of fact I just test drove the Big Horn at an Anaheim dealer 2 weeks prior.

6th red flag - When asked about special ordering, Max immediately changed his superior attitude to that of condescending.  Max did not want to do a special order because it means he would have to work.  I could tell Max wanted to sell a truck to me now - not in 6-8 weeks for a special order.  How a car dealership survives without having some of their sales on a custom order is beyond me.

Do NOT do business with this person or dealer - he will lie thru his teeth to get you into any car they have.  
Max lacks basic customer service skills, no knowledge of financial numbers, will berate you if you want a special order, and make sexist remarks.  
Beware females who are independent - Max will rub you the wrong way as he did to me.",6,66,-1

I was having issues with my fan blower and when I picked my truck up I was told only the power control module was updated and flashed.  When I asked why wasn’t everything flashed as I asked and was written in the order I was told that was all I needed.  

The flash did not solve my problem and when I returned I was told they could flash everything but it wasn’t necessary because only the pcm controller the blower.  I told the service writer to again update and flash everything and was told “That’s a lot more work” and that I would be charged again.  When I asked if that was why they didn’t do it in the first place I felt like I was treated dismissively and I was not given an answer.  I asked for some consideration because the service was not done as I asked and the service writer was kind enough to only charge me 2/3 the price of the original price.

After reading all of these great reviews of this dealership I was hoping to have a good day.  I dealt with Max, seems very friendly at first and was quick to write you up for the advertised price to make you happy, but after a while he makes you feel as if your wasting his time and was very condescending. 

After going back to the finance guy, they sneak a lot of things to add up the cost which I did not want, was not negotiated and he was not willing to take off. Also he was not aware of the price that was negotiated upfront. Somehow they were trying to sell me the vehicle at two different prices and clearly not on the same page in the upfront price with Max. I saw the red flag in their fishy process and all they were doing is playing games to con me. The nice discounted price disappeared. All he did was lower my monthly to make me happy since they did not budge on the net cost, but up their interest rate to 8.9%!!  I have excellent credit and should not pay their outrageous rates!

BUYER BEWARE...Wow. Just wow. Worst experience ever. they did a bait and switch on the APR. Told me I should qualify for 3% interest on the loan. I agreed to come drive the car. I agrree to buy it and work out my trade in. Everythings great so far. Then after he runs my credit he LIES and says I don't qualify for ANY purchase loan and cannot buy the car. BUT he can offer me a lease a 8%... bait and switch. BUT it gets worse. I decline and leave... and sure enough the next day a DIFFERENT salesman contacts me and states he CAN get me the 3%. I respond anything over is unacceptable, but if you can really get me under 4%, I'll still buy the car. He comes back and offers 5.5%... They had my credit history PRIOR to running my credit. Then told me 3%. Then no deal but a horrible lease deal. Then magically the next day he can't swing 3% but can get me a loan for 5.5%. How does it go the night before from NO DEAL you are screwed... to 5.5 % the next day? How? Because they commit lender fraud and try and make you love the car, commit to buy, then state the only deal they can give you is HORRIBLE. IF you won't take the bad lease, they will send you home. Then they finally make a REAL effort for the loan, you grab the 5.5% and they get a kick back from the lender. I'm contacting Chrysler, the state of CA, the BBB and speaking with an attorney.

51910,15-Oct-14,"Stay away from these guys, COMPLETE DIRT BAGS!!!! My problem started over a month ago when I contacted these guys about a new Jeep Rubicon X. I was emailed back by a sales person named Garrett. He informed me he could give me 1k off sticker. I politley thanked him and said, I could get at least 3k off sticker at several other dealerships, at which point he became beligerant and typed back in all CAPS. I have purchased 4 different vehciles from this dealership in the past and forwarded his emails to the owner of Orange Coast, Jon Gray. I had his email from him thaking me for my prior purchases. Mr. Gray responded back saying that Garret's conduct was unprofessional and said that it was not indicative of his employees attitudes. I accepted his apology and he got me in touch with a new ""Salesperson"" named Ken. Ken assured me that I would be getting 4k off the sticker of the vehicle to make up for the service, which I thought was great.

It started out just fine. I was going to use OC Motorsports to build the jeep and we were going to wrap some of the cost of the lift into the financing. It took almost 2 weeks for the lift and pricing to be finalized through OC motorsports (Partly my fault since we priced out several different suspension packages). During that time they sold the vehicle they had quoted me on. When I inquired when they could get me another, Ken said yes, but now my discount would only be 2k as it was a new model year (Had I known that I would have been down at the dealership day one). The classic 1990's used car salesman bait and switch!!!! At this point I wasn't happy,  but I wanted to see where the numbers landed. Ken had all of a sudden dissapeared and wouldnt return my emails. After my third email he ""Apologized"" that he had been busy with end of the month (Like he couldnt shoot me a 2 line email letting me know that"" and said he would have my numbers shortly. 

Two days later I get an email, not from Ken, but from the original rude and inept sales person ""Garrett"". There was nothing written in the body of the email, just a screen shot of their computer screen showing a montlhy payment that was $140 higher a month with an additional $1500 down payment. Ken didnt even have the decency to send the email himself to explain why the down payment and monthly payment was substantially higher. This is one of the most unprofessional, classless transactions I have ever been a part of!

I have purchased over 23 new vehicles since 1994. I have never been treated with such contempt or indifference. I have purchased 4 different vehicles from this dealership, so to say I have been loyal to them is an understatement. I bought my 2014 Grand Cherokee SRT8 from Poway Jeep because Orange Coast wouldnt return my emails in a timley manner (Never contacted the owner on this issue). This dealerships service and employees are sub par and define why the general public cant stand the buying process. Buyer beware, absolutley an untrustworthy dealership!!!!!!!!!!",6,67,-1
51912,29-Apr-14,"This review is for sales services only. 

Ok experience. I came 3 times total. End up buy the jeep wrangler Sahara 4 doors here, because I like the car a lot. 
First time I came, no one outside great and show me car. 

Second time I went inside the office, then Cole Jezowski said hi and showed me the car. Test drive with him. I like him. He is not too pushy. It's his job to sale anyway. I asked him all kind of questions about the car and finance. Then I walked away. I told him ""can we do this tomorrow?"" He answered ""sure, I'll keep your file here. So you come back I have all info ready. "" at least he was not rude. 

Next day I came back at 7 pm. Talked to Cole again for price and financing. I got the car for Around $37000 total. Waiting for finance was really long, two hours waiting. Cole is experience seller. He gave me an impression that I had some good discount. This is my first time, so I was trick. 

Although my experience was ok. I would not come back. I would not recommend for first time buyer to come here, unless you have good negotiating skill.  ",6,67,-1
51913,07-Apr-14,"After several test drives of 09 Mazda5 at 4 other dealers, I went to Orange Coast Chrysler Jeep Dodge dealer to test drive one that they had advertised.  I spoke with the Sales Manager-Howard.  I explained to him that the price was fair but that I had seen another for approximately $400.00 less.  I told him that if he was willing to match it and address a ""check tire"" light and a grinding sound that I believed to be a suspension issue, then I would buy the car.  Howard explained to me that all their used cars have been inspected and are approved to be sold.  Nonetheless, he agreed to have the car looked at by the local Mazda dealer.  He specifically told me that a Mazda Mechanic would drive the car and make the repairs needed to correct the problem.  The following day I called Howard to confirm that the car had been repaired.  Howard told me that the car was still at the Mazda dealer but that it should be ready by the time I arrived.  Eventually I picked up the car.  About 15 minutes into my drive home the check engine light went on.  I immediately called Howard to inform him about the light (upon getting of the freeway I started to notice the sound in the suspension).  Howard told me that the car had been checked out and driven by the Mazda mechanic and that ""Leonard"" from the Mazda dealer told him that they had rectified the problem.  Howard told me that he would call me later to give me instructions as to what to do to have the problem addressed.  The next day I called Howard at the Mazda dealer following Howard's instructions.  Leonard told me that he was never told to test drive the car.  Furthermore, he told me that he was simply told to reset the computer in the car.  I relayed this information to Howard.  All he could say was that there must have been some sort of miscommunication.  Initially Howard agreed to correct the problems but then told me that he had given me such a great price that he didn't know if they had room to pay for the repairs.  I told Howard that I was willing to have the car inspected by my regular mechanic because I felt his prices would be more reasonable than that of the Mazda dealer.  After talking to his used car Manager Howard agreed.  My Mechanic inspected the car and wrote and estimate of the repairs.  Howard agreed that the repair cost was fair and would get back to me to arrange repairs.  The next day Howard told me they were only obligated to make repairs to the light issue because it was a safety issue.  Repairs to the suspension would be my problem.  I explained to Howard that quite frankly that was mildly interesting to me.  He had told me that the repairs had been done prior to picking up the car; Howard clearly lied.  Howard told me that they were willing to pay $200 to repair the problem with the light or to spend it any way I wished to.  He also gave me the option of returning the car back.  I told him I would call him back the next day with my decision.  The next day I told him I was returning the car.  Howard then told me that was not an option.  I told Howard we would be resolving the cost in court.  Howard told me that they have their attorneys ready for court.  A day or so later Howard called me willing to pay me $600 (total cost was $643.27) for the repairs. I paid for the repairs up front just as they asked me to and faxed them a copy of the bill.  I asked him to call me to confirm that he received the fax.  He did not.  I asked Howard assured me that the check would be sent that same day first class mail.  Thirteen days later and after several calls and voice mails, no check.  I eventually called Orange Coast (accounts payable) to inquire about the check.  They were quick to address my concerns and I informed me that the check had been sent out to my mechanic.  Clearly the miscommunication  and deception from the ""Sales Manager"" need to be addressed.  Howard at Orange Coast Chrysler Jeep Dodge is the epitome of a car salesman.  ",6,67,-1

51928,22-Jul-12,"My experience with this dealership was one of the more unpleasant experiences in recent memory.  The sales people were flat out dishonest.  One quoted me a price more then $2000 higher than the price they listed on their website for that same vehicle.  When I pointed it out they claimed it was an error so I gave them another shot.  When I went back in, however, the vehicle online had been ""sold"" and they claimed there was only vehicle in the entire region that would fit my needs.  5 minutes, a google search, and phone call later I found a similar vehicle (grand cherokee overland, black, 4x4) down the street for $3000 less than this place quoted me.  Also, at least one product specialist couldn't even answer simple questions about the vehicle.  In sum, I was very disappointed with their business practices and would not recommend them to anyone.

51941,27-Mar-12,"I purchased a 2011 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon in November of 2011. After two months had passed I still had not recieved registration, tags, or a license plate.  When I called in February to find out what was happening I was told that November was a busy month and not to worry, my license and tags would be coming. When March arrived I called again and  was told to talk to Alicia the DMV girl but every phone call to her resulted in a message on her machine and not one time in a weeks period did I receive a return call. In complete frustration I went to the DMV and was informed that the car was owned by a woman and they would not give me her name. The next day I called to the dealership and  was unable to get David Reed, Alicia or Brian Cole to answer there phones. When I asked to be transferred to the General Manager Pete Shaver the operator patched me in on his cell phone and I told him my worries and that I needed to find out who owned my car, that I had already paid over 35,000 dollars for. When he called me back the following day he said the DMV girl had accidently sent the pink slip to the woman who they had repossesed the car from.  He assured me that going to the DMV in two weeks he would straighten out the problem. After two more weeks I attempted to find out the situation and was told it might be easier for me to just go the DMV myself and take care of it. But then Pete Shaver said if I wanted he would at least get me the license plates. Well now it is March 27 and I finally recieved my pink slip,registration, tags but still no license plate even tho my pink and registration have a plate number on them. When I attempted to contact them again the exact same thing, message machine and no return calls, when I called the Jeep factory complaint line I was told to go to the DMV  myself and report the plates stolen and just get new plates myself, of course at my own cost. The amazing thing is that Jeep themselves don't care and told me there was nothing they could do and they did not want to talk to Orange Coast Jeep about this. I am wondering if there is some sort of legal issues involving this dealership and the rules of business involving the DMV. I am sure this letter will just be removed and discarded, because not one person I have talked to at this dealership or at the Jeep factory has ever wanted to actually do the job they are paid to do. I can promise you I will never buy another Jeep from any dealer, I am 55 years old and have bought many cars, Toyota, Ford, Chevrolet, and others and I have never experienced anything as horrible as the experience at this dealer.

51965,04-Feb-11,"Brought our 2001 Dodge Intrepid here for service several days ago because the check engine light was on.  They found several pressure leaks and repaired same for 1,000.00.  
The day we picked up the car, I got a call from their service manager asking me to return the car because they may have forgotten to check something. So, they let us drive the car away without verifying that it had been completely repaired.  In the meantime, my wife called me to tell me that the car was running very badly now.  We did not have this problem before taking it in for the engine light; the car has always run beautifully.
We left the car all day again.  They called me and told me that they had fixed the problem, apologized profusely, and told me that there would be no charge.  I picked up the car and everything seemed fine.  The next day, the check engine light was back on, and the car stalled in an intersection and kept stalling every time I started it.  I had it towed back to the dealer and left it there for the 3rd time.

51986,30-Dec-10,"I bought my car at this location -- horrible experience -- my recommendation is to never, ever do business with this dealer.  I received the worst service at this company.  This firm refused to secure my car after it flooded and I was waiting for Jeep to determine if they would cover the defect in the windshield that caused 3 inches of rain to puddle in my car. (This event follows several other instances of  of replacing the same parts repeatedly due to other defects -- which were very costly).  I had to demand that the Customer Service Manager secure the car so that no further damage would occur -- and only after I told him his firm would be legally liable did he take action to secure the car from further damage.  When I asked to speak to the General Manager, the Customer Service Manager refused to transfer the call, stating that the GM was was out of town (I had already confirmed that the GM was onsite that day with the front desk staff). 

When I finally spoke with the GM, he was very condescending when I requested answers as to why I had been given poor service and poor treatment -- he stated that the firm had been in business 30 years and I keep coming back so they must be doing something right.  Are you kidding me???!  I'm not here paying for rental cars (repeatedly) and paying for repairs of obvious defects because I want to -- I expected a higher level of customer service since they sold me the car.  The GM told me to go somewhere else!  Unbelievable!!!  In my opinion this firm should not be in business.  ",6,67,-1
51987,16-Sep-10,"Summary: This dealer employs rude, arrogant service managers who blatantly attempt to take advantage of female customers and their perceived naivete.  This is also the most expensive C/D/J dealer I've ever visited, and I've used at least five throughout California.

The first time I visited this dealer, I was shopping for a Jeep.  The saleswoman thought that the best way to sell me on a Jeep was to take me for a test drive and then turn donuts in a local parking lot.  I left, convinced she was insane.  

The second time I visited, several years later, I had had my Jeep towed in because of a dead battery (jumping wouldn't start it).  The dealer sold me a battery for close to $300.  I had no choice but to purchase, as my truck wouldn't start.  The whole time, the service manager was conversing with his cronies and barely looking at me as he shoved paperwork at me to sign.  I was asking questions about my car's behavior and getting vague, ""you're a woman and wouldn't understand"" answers.  

The third time and fourth times I visited (failed LED lamp and transmission flush), the quoted prices were OBSCENELY high compared to either Pep Boys or other dealers.  I also got the same jerk as my service manager.  Although I no longer live in LA, tomorrow I'm driving 50 miles back to Buerge Jeep who will do the transmission flush for $100 less than Orange Coast. Unbelievable and unfortunate that Orange County lacks a respectable or even remotely competitive C/D/J dealer (Tuttle Click isn't any better).",6,67,2292

51993,27-Jan-20,"I was in the market for a commuter vehicle and came across South County Dodge. I put in a request for a quote on a specific vehicle and ADAM WARDAK contacted me. I reiterated that I was interested in the red vehicle specified in my online inquiry and asked Adam to send me the exact out the door price, as I intended to purchase the vehicle using cash. Adam texted me the cost breakdown and I called him to confirm, as I would need to drive approximately three hours to get to Gilroy, CA.

When I arrived, Adam did not make any attempt to come out and introduce himself. Shortly after driving the vehicle, I was told that my vehicle is more expensive than what I’d been quoted, and that the quote I was given was for a grey vehicle. I had fallen victim to a bait-and-switch and ended up driving over three hours for no reason.

I would also like to add that I have never purchased a vehicle at this low of a price point. I’ve negotiated deals with BMW, Porsche, Lamborghini, Rolls Royce and have never been treated this way. I don’t have much experience working with the lower end dealers and find it disgusting that they treat their customers the way I have been treated.

52003,20-Nov-19,"When coming to a deal on the price for a vehicle I was going to lease from this dealership, one of the things that was instrumental in my agreeing to the price they quoted me, was that i was told the vehicle and the lease terms would qualify me to be able to claim the CA Clean Vehicle Rebate (CVRP).

However after they had told me multiple times during the negotiations, including answering affirmatively when i directly asked them before signing, I found out later that in fact the lease did not qualify. 

Attempting to contact the dealership about this resulted in long strings of being ignored, given a run around, and  being told they would get back to us soon then they never did, over and over. 

At this point they have not in any way attempted to reconcile after their sales team lied to us. If they would at least work with us to reconcile the situation I would assume it was a misunderstanding and be glad to work with them.

52027,28-Jan-19,"Giving one star because the price was good but that's it. Here are all the reasons why I would not recommend this dealership:

- brand new Jeep Compass was not ready when we had agreed I would be there, despite me sending all of my insurance, driver's license info, credit card number, and copy of a $13,909 cashier's check two days ahead of time
- when I arrived I was told I had the wrong day, despite showing emails and text message correspondence that had confirmed December 26 at 10 am
- when my father inquired about the delay (because I needed a ride there), he was told, ""if she doesn't like waiting, she can just leave""
- when I was signing paperwork, the DMV document noted a ""lienholder"" as Chrysler Financing, when I was paying cash for the vehicle. When I pointed this out to Willie Pettaway, he said it was okay to sign it. I crossed it out and initialed the lienholder and he said he needed to redo the entire form because it was a legally binding document."" So it was okay for me to sign an inaccurate legally binding document that claimed Chrysler Financing was the lienholder but not okay for me to cross that out (because it was wrong) and initial it...??????
- purchased a brand new vehicle and it was not clean, and they only gave me a half tank of gasoline (see photos of 63 miles on a new car and only 1/8 of a tank left on Yelp site)
- sent me a text message with a link to the video to explain my new purchase - the link didn't work; emailed three more times and got no response - it finally took another general manager to intervene (see pictures added on Yelp site)
- one of the ""general managers,"" Bob Mann, called me personally and said that, based on what I reported to him, he was going to fire his finance guy for incompetence, then called back to tell me I'd be getting an email apology (that never happened)
- I emailed Scott DePeralta three times to ask for the regional manager and his/her contact info - he never responded
- at one point, Scott emailed me and said I could just bring the car back, but the sad thing was that I couldn't because I had already used a $500 rebate that could not be transferred to another dealership
- I finally found a regional manager named Piyom Ghavimi who said he would assist - forwarded all emails to him and never heard back

52035,02-Dec-18,"I had an absolutely terrible experience with this dealership. I called Browning Grimmett the day before I planned to come in to see a used Hyundai Accent and we agreed upon a 1pm appointment. He asked me to call him again once I was on my way, which I did. Only then did he mention that the dealership would be closing early that day. He told me it was closing at 3pm, when I arrived I discovered it was actually closing at 2pm. After an hour drive, he was completely unprepared to show the vehicle I indicated. In fact I had to remind him which car it was. It was in their sister dealership in Morgan Hill. After wasting 45 minutes to go retrieve the vehicle, we got through paperwork only to be told that we would need to come back the following day to finish financing. Though upset that at this, we agreed, and he said he would meet with us at 11:30am the next day. When we arrived at the agreed upon time, Browning was nowhere to be found. Only after waiting for 15 minutes did we discover he had not come in at all. Tony Truong abruptly came up to me, asking for my insurance documents without any greeting, and did not introduce himself to me until prompted by the fact I was clearly confused. I was then called ""distraught"" when I expressed my uneasiness at not being informed of what was happening. At this point a gentleman who did not give me his name began to intervene. He told me he didn't know what I wanted him to do. I asked if there was any price negotiation that could happen because of how much we had been inconvenienced and said that it does not instill a lot of confidence in me to make such a big purchase when I am being told so many different things. I was responded to in a very defensive, blame shifting manner, trying to make it seem as if it was my fault communication had not been clear. I was told if I did not have confidence in their dealership I shouldn't buy the car. And I didn't. I found the entire experience slimy and disrespectful.

These people had no problem taking our money when we leased a Jeep from them three years ago, but when it came time to turn in our Jeep when the lease was up they wouldn’t help us. We left messages for three weeks and they would not return our calls. When we decided to wait on hold instead, we were left on hold for over an hour. We went down in person and they were very rude and said they would help us if we were going to buy out the lease or buy or lease another vehicle, but if not we needed to go to another dealership to turn it in. Finally talked to the general manager and made an appointment to drop it off, but when we came in we waited over an hour for them to tell us that they couldn’t do it today and that we would have to come back tomorrow. We finally got frustrated and took it to another dealership to turn in. We are never going to buy another FCA product due to our experience with this dealership.

The day we were told it would be ready WE had to call to find out when we could pick it up and they told us the part was on back order and it would be a few more days. Once again, after a few more days WE called to check the status and were told it was going to be even longer. Finally after TWO weeks and little communication on their end we picked up the vehicle. My husbands truck is an essential part of his business so we had to spend money out of pocket to rent another vehicle while they held his hostage and he even had to postpone a very important business trip because of it. After being a really pissed off about the whole situation I thought to myself ""Well they will surely make up for this with at least a small gesture (like a complimentary oil change)"". Not the case what-so-ever. They even had my husband pre-pay for his next oil change. Might I add my husband is the easiest going guy around.

52409,30-Aug-15,"My experience with this dealership is that it is non-responsive and their rating is untrustworthy. After the purchase of Jeep Cherokee Limited last weekend I received the Thank You email from the GM of this dealership. The email states ""You may be receiving a questionnaire from Jeep soon. If you cannot give us a completely satisfied rating for any reason, please call me so we can better serve you as our valued customer"". I responded to the GM’s email and tried directly contacting him to discuss issues and to offer suggestions, instead he directed the sales person to contact me though I wanted to talk to the GM per his email. I find it absurd that despite the GM’s original email he was not accessible and he did not even respond to my several email requests which shows his lack of commitment. Apparently he might come up with the excuse that he had no time and was too busy.

Both the Sales person and Finance Manager were courteous. But I observed during the purchase that the sales person pleads to the customers to give the dealer 10 out of 10 rating when the survey is received so that the he and others can receive bonus. This practice appears to be unethical leading to misleading rating for this dealership. I believe the rating should be transparent without any influence. Apparently his focus was to get him bonus from my purchase that also seems evident from his text message.

I went to the dealer after the Sales person sent me an email with out-the-door price for the Cherokee Limited that I wanted, but during the paperwork in his office for the same SUV he said that I will have to pay $1000 more if I refinance with 0% which shocked me because he did not state so in his email and my preference was to get this refinance but I could not. Also, during the price agreement paperwork with the Sales person in his office he did not go over the option of the cooling-off period which I find misleading. Also he provided illusive response when I asked him why I can’t get the other vehicle from the front lot that was the same make/model with the same year, features and the sticker price.",6,68,-1

It saves everyone time and saliva from speaking and negotiating so much.  They won't deal with you via email because of ""high demands"".  More very old sales car tactics to bring you in.  Lets go back to that, high demands.  In this pandemic where many dealers are closed, lots are overfilled with unsold merchandise, and cars still on cargo ships where they are not unloaded because there's no room on any lots.  Sure looks like there is more inventory than demand.

Then they do the most irresponsible thing and maintain their old car sales tactics by bringing you in when we're in a pandemic and are in a shelter in place.  That is irresponsible on their behalf and comes to show they are more interested in profits than people's health.  I will not bring my wife and I to simply negotiate and possibly get sick.  We can do negotiations via email or telephone, then when we come to a price we both agree to, then we can come in and sign papers with minimal exposure.  Even my last two car purchases way before the pandemic allowed this (Lexus and Tesla).

I would avoid this dealer and if this is tactic is across the board, go to a different manufacturer that actually cares about people and willing to adapt and negotiate online or over the phone.

I hate to do this, but they (HB Chrysler Dodge Jeep RAM) got me. If it sounds too good to be true, with this dealership it probably is... I thought I wasn't getting scammed, but they just waited a week to start twisting everything around. 

First, was the chip in the windshield that they told me would get taken care of and replaced.  A month later, it still hasnt been taken care of.
Then I was given a copy of a clean Carfax, but I got home that night and noticed a basketball size dent in my bumper. I did not hit anything, and after telling the dealer about it, they reviewed their security footage and I was told they are ""not required to disclose damages unless they are a safety concern."" And that's not all...

A few weeks later, I was called back in for a better deal with a better bank and I need to come in to sign the papers or I'd lose my loan. I thought my current loan was decent, but better? Ok, I didn't think I was lied to yet, of course I'll come sign for a better deal. I get into financing and this time it's a paper contract (the first time it was all electronic and I was given a USB with all the files.) The finance manager has every paper stacked on top of one another covering the tops of the pages and only exposing the signature lines because ""the documents are all the same as before, only the finance company changed and we got you a better APR and monthly payment."" 

My original contract: 17.63% APR $368 monthly
My ""better deal"" contract: 22.89% APR $428.67 monthly

I purchased the truck for $11,500 and brought enough to pay off the truck that day. The finance manager told me if I want to build my credit get financing and just put money down. So I put $6,000 down in cash and was led to believe (all the way through driving off the lot) my financing was only for $5,500 +tax and license.  
 
I bought my first new truck from this place 20 years ago and I remember how comfortable and confident I was with all the decisions being made. It was the best vehicle purchase I ever made. When I went back to buy another truck last month, they gave me that feeling all over again. However, Huntington Beach Chrysler Dodge Jeep RAM aka Surf City Auto is not a dealership to be trusted.

When I got there at 11AM the place had already been open for an hour and someone else had already purchased the car I wanted.  This is a very questionable dealership, I knew it was too good to be true!!!

This was THE worst experience I HAVE EVER had with a Dealership.  Prices are discounted but they force you to purchase a protection package that includes panel identification that was mandated back in 1984 by NHTSA (all vehicles sold in the States must have Vins or identifying marks on all panels to deter theift).  What ever the price of the vevicle is they will add $3999.18 to it.  Even if ther vehicle is not on the lot.  They will try to get you to finance through their bank at 7.4% APR, they will tell you that's the  going rate on vehicle loans.  I was specifically looking for a certain packag/model and had communicated with other Dealerships and the told me I was crazy if I bought a car from them.

They sold me a brand new Wrangler that had the auto/start stop warning light on. I asked them to fix it before leaving with the vehicle, but I was told ""it goes away after driving a bit"". 250 miles and 5 days later, my Jeep has now had to be towed TWICE to a dealership near me because the secondary battery, the one responsible for the auto start/stop, is faulty and keeps dying - so the car won't start. I live in an area where personal vehicles are required and they knew this, yet have shown 0 empathy or even a molecule of concern. 

Their response? ""Call roadside assistance"". On a 5 day old vehicle?? This is normal?? They have done NOTHING to remedy the situation except have the salesperson send me a half-a$$ed apology email.

I would have left if I had the option.
Basically they have this great text option that Henry would keep me updated on my car and respond quickly to my inquiries. It is great when they use it.
This experience had absolutely NO responses to my text messages. Attempts to call all went unanswered once transferred to my service tech. Messages both with operator and voicemail went unreturned. I did have a loaner (since it was believed to be a covered issue) so I wasn't too worried about when I got it back but I just wanted to know the status.
After 8 days of trying, I basically BEG to speak to ANYONE about the status of my car and magically my tech picks up in 2 rings.
I am then told I need two things done which will cost almost $800. (Almost $500 for new spark plugs alone). I ask if it is driveable and go to pick it up the next day. Total days...10!
After paying $150 for a diagnostic fee.I received it running (the two women I dealt with this time were amazing.) and immediately drove it to the family mechanic who works on the other cars. He is only about a mile away so I pull up and park. When we get to the car to have them bring it in the shop, the battery is COMPLETELY DEAD! 
I ended up with MORE issues than when I dropped it. The next day I got a shifter warning when I went to pick it up. It was the battery. It rated ZERO even though they charged it before they were done and moved it out for pickup.
That is the LAST TIME I will bring it there.

52555,09-Oct-19,"Get ready for a fight, or they will take you to the cleaners!

Found a 2018 Ram 2500 4x4 for a great price here while searching on the internet. I live about 6 hours away from Huntington Beach but this price was about $4k cheaper than everywhere else I could find this particular truck. I called the dealer, spoke with a Bryan and confirmed the price. I asked if there would be any surprise add-ons and he promised me that was the price I would get. I told him I was already approved for the loan and he said that was great!

My wife and I took the next day off, drove 6 hours, and got a hotel room so we could be at the dealer in the morning. This seemed like a good idea to save $4k. 

We went inside, asked for Bryan, he wasn't there but there was another nice kid who would be happy to help us. I told them I didn't want to cut Bryan out of his commission, they said no worries, he would still get it. 

We sat down with new kid. First thing he tells us is there will be an additional $4,000 for Theft Protection GPS, Surface Coating, and Service Contract. (All Optional in final contract, but I was told this is the only way I was getting that internet price.) Additionally, they insisted I used their financing even though I came in with a pre-approved loan. Their loan had an APR that was 3.4% higher than mine. They said I could refinance after 3 months. I said that would cost me three payments of nearly pure interest and they looked at me like I was crazy.

I said no way, I didn't ask for or want any of that crap. All I wanted was the price I was promised before I drove 6 hours and rented a hotel room. 

We fought all day. We left no less than three times. First time I left was because they didn't even have the truck there, I told them I didn't even want to talk to them anymore until they produced the truck so I could test drive it. We went to the beach and walked around with our feet in the ocean until they called us back and said they had the truck. 

After the test drive the fighting continued. All I wanted was the price I was promised and they told me I was being unreasonable. The manager said ""Okay, I can't earn everyone's business"", and walked away. We left, they ran us down in the parking lot and said they would come down by $1,750, but I still had to use their financing. I said no, they walked away. We drove off. 

We got about 5 minutes away and they called. This guy said he was the GM and he didn't want to loose my business because of financing. He said I could use my financing and take off a total of $2,300. We decided this is close enough and we took the deal. I know we could have nickle dimed them down some more, but it was getting late and we still had to drive 6 hours to get home. 

Now, this may be knit picking, but these guys got me on Yelp for the first time, so here we go...

After the the papers were signed, we waited a long time for the truck to be back from detailing. We were walking around the truck and my wife noticed a 2"" gash in the paint right on the edge of the front wheel well. I can't believe we didn't notice this before, and we had already signed. (Not really a deal breaker anyway.) I went inside and had the GM come out and look at the gash to see if there was anything they could do. ""Sorry man, AS-IS..."" and basically walked away. I thought, ""Really? Brand new car and I get AS-IS treatment?"" Still not a deal breaker, I can fix this anyways.

We were waiting some more, they couldn't find the rubber floor mats that were included or the spare key. They never found the mats, said they would be ordered and shipped. While waiting the same GM asked me to leave them a good review on Yelp and I said I would. I hope he didn't mean favorable, cause I would have said no.

This was an awful experience. This isn't my first time buying a vehicle, but I have never felt like I was dealing with such a crooked dealership. I left two stars because after a day of fighting and headache, we still got the truck cheaper than I could find it listed anywhere else in a 500 mile web search.

If you're up for a fight, got a day to burn, and don't mind walking out a few times to get what you were promised, then you might not mind buying a car here. Just don't travel a long distance and expect them to be upfront about pricing before you get there. All promises are out the window once you sit down with sales person.

I doubt I'll ever see those floor mats...

Steer clear! These guys are con artists. I have purchased many cars over the years. I called ahead of time about a specific car asked them for their bottom line OTD price, told them exactly when we'd be there, yet the car had to be chased down for 30 minutes. Test drive finished, we were ready to buy the car at the already agreed upon OTD price. xxxxxxx finance guy comes in and suddenly the price is up by over $4000, I told them, as I said before, we weren't interested in financing and wanted to get the paperwork signed for the previously agreed upon price. Finance guy says they can't do that, so we walk. Get a call a few minutes later, again promised if we come back we could have the car for the mutually agreed price. Now a new guy enters the picture and tells me he can sell it for the price listed on the internet, which is about $350 more than the agreed price even before they add all of the additional thousands of dollars of junk they try to force on you. we walked again, right into a reputable sellers store, and bought a the same exact car for less in a nicer color, including the extended warranty. We wasted way too much time at Huntington, getting passed on to several different ""managers"", I think three in all, not including the finance bloodsucker.

I told him if he can put it in writing that he can give me the advertised price on their website plus tax and license I would do the 2 hour drive from northern los angeles to Huntington beach. He keeps telling me I have to come down. I was not going to waste 2 hours of my life driving just to get there for them to bait and switch me.

52560,10-Sep-19,"Too bad I had not read the reviews on this dealership well before wasting my time, gas & effort. Just reading the past 30 days of 1 star negative reviews sum up allot of how this illegitimate place works. Nothing but lies after lies well before you get into this dealership and then they continue when you arrive with the “Bait & Switch” tactics along with more lies. My opinion is that they need to be investigated & shut down for good.

I initially made contact with supposed salesman Androw Mansour on a RAM truck & was told the truck was available. I informed Androw that I lived in Hawaii & that I would be paying cash. He told me that they do not take cash or deposits on vehicles. He also said he worked in finance. I had been conversing with Androw for four days ensuring the truck was available & he confirmed it was. I called Androw on a Sunday & I asked him to please text me by the end of Monday night on the availability of the vehicle. I indicated to him that I would be flying all day & arriving late Monday night & would not be able to receive messages during my flight. I also made sure that he understood that I was driving to the dealership early Tuesday morning from San Diego to Huntington Beach.
   
Androw never contacted me on status and availability on Monday night as he said he would so I called him early morning Tuesday & he enthusiastically said “yes, the truck was still there”. So we started our 77 mile trip all the way to Huntington Beach. We were about 12 miles from the dealership when Androw called & said you’re not going to believe this and that the truck was just sold 10 minutes ago. He said however that there were 2 other trucks available, a Black & White one with the exact same features.

Not believing Androw, when I arrived at the dealership I immediately asked for the desk manager whose name is Jock. I inquired about the vehicle status that I came out to see & was told that it had been actually sold the day before. One of the other sales man Andy did a tracker on the truck and located it in Los Angeles. So I told Jock the desk manager that I had driven all the way from San Diego for this truck. Jock replied that they are the #1 sales dealership in the country & vehicles are continuously being sold. So I told him that this is what every dealership says which is a bunch of B.S. I also told him what he didn’t know and that was if the truck indeed had been sold the day before then why would your salesman Androw lie to me just over an hour ago & tell me that the truck was there. Jock’s reply was that he was going to have a talk with Androw.
 
When I asked Jock about the supposed Black & White trucks that Androw said were available, he then directed salesman Andy to look them up. Sure enough there were no trucks that Androw could produce however there were trucks at a higher price. So I asked Andy to get a hold of Androw & ask him where are these supposed trucks that he indicated on the phone that were available. Andy left & later came back & said he cannot find Androw. So I said to call him on his mobile & he said he didn’t have his number. I asked why is it that I have his number & the dealership doesn’t. He couldn’t provide me with an answer only to say that there are no trucks as Androw described however he again had higher priced trucks. I believe the kicker to this whole scheme is that Androw & Andy are one in the same person who is trying to cover up his own lies & mistakes.

So now it seems obvious that I too are another victim of being lured into this dealership by their false advertised pricing, con artist lies and illicit salesmen tactics all while at my own expense.
 
The good news however is that I did purchase a truck at Dave Smith Motors in Idaho. They literally are one of the highest volume dealerships in the nation with thousands of vehicles and availability to choose from. They don’t lie, are honest and pricing is unbeatable.

If there was an option for negative stars i'd put -5 and beyond.

For 2 days i was trying to purchase a vehicle without even haggling the price of the vehicle. They would not send me a written quote, they insisted i come in. Once they found out i was going to purchase cash nobody wanted to talk to me i called every hour to try to talk to management, they were always ""busy"" and for 2 days i never received a call. I was told they do not take personal checks or cashiers checks by a sale rep and that i would have to finance through their bank and payoff loan after first month! I finally got through to another sales rep that said to just come down and within an hour and a half i was there. I walked in and they were slow i mean nobody there and it literally took 5 mins for someone to ask me if I've been helped! So much for the ""busy managers"" that couldn't return  my phone call! Anyhow, i told them the car i wanted to see and they said ""they sold it 40 minutes ago to a sister dealership""! Then i asked what dealership and that i'll go there to buy it. They replied ""they sold it to some family"". This place is a joke! If you have any experience buying cars and they cant sway you, you will be ignored and god forbid you want to buy cash and move a car that has been sitting on their lot for 100 days!

They sold off the vehicle which we test drove and agreed to purchase right under our nose to another customer!! How could you be so unprofessional in your dealings?
Finally- when the financing phase came, they didnt' realize that we had pre-approved ourselves on Chrysler financing and said that we will have to pay some high interest rate at something greater than 7% even though our credit scores were Tier A.

52572,01-Jun-19,"6 HOURS to buy a car?   I called on Thursday the 23rd and made an appointment for the 24th at 9:30.   I told Ricardo which car I was interested in and he told me it was upfront. Victor was our salesman and he greeted us with kindness and enthusiasm and told me the car was in the back lot.  I was surprised to learn that the car I wanted was $2000 more than listed online. So George came in to explain it to us but instead we were met with arrogance and rudeness.  After a short but disturbing conversation/argument  he told us "" he's been doing this for 30 years and maybe we should leave and go think about it"".  At this point, my boyfriend left the desk to go ask for another manager and I told George I was no longer speaking to him. I have never been treated so badly.  George needs to realize that without me and every other customer.....he doesn't have a job.  Frankly I would of fired him if it were my company.

Now we're waiting for another manager, and Joe comes in and we have to start the process all over again after telling him how completely disgusted I am with the treatment I received from George. 3 hours after my appointment time, I finally get to see the car .....it is filthy.... dirt and debris everywhere.   It's so bad I don't even want to sit in it and there's no gas in it to take it for a test drive.   Also the rear passenger matching tire is not on and that needs to be replaced.   I'm told it will take an hour to change the tire and to clean and detail the car.   This is how they present a car to someone who wants to buy it??

An hour goes by... just 30 more minutes, 15 more minutes.... lie after lie. 2 1/2 hours later my car is ""ready"".   But I look in the car, it's still not completely clean and there's no gas in it.   Joe explained to me that the cleaning is subcontracted out, and they have no control over how long it takes for them to do their job. Really? This is the standard that is acceptable and you make excuses for them??

I arrived at 9:30 ready to buy a car..... that car and it is now 3:30.   The level of BS that was handed to me that day was ridiculous and insulting?   I love a jeep but I will never step foot back into that dealership again other than the required yearly visit through my warranty... and believe me I'm telling everyone and anyone.   And here's a suggestion stop eating at the front desk. Nobody wants to come in to buy a car and see you with a mouthful of food.  

Finally driving home I notice he Stop/Start is not working so I called and talked to Dan.  Who told me that it really doesn't save gas and is really hard on the engine, so I shouldn't worry about fixing it.  REALLY??  I buy a car that has 360 miles on it....EVERYTHING should work on it.  But after all his daughter has a Compass and hers is turned off and I should do the same.....  

The above is a sugar coated version..... it was a miserable day and experience.......it pains me to the know that I am part of their salary earned that day.  Buying a car should not be that miserable .....it shouldn't be miserable at all.......  and yes I could of walked away but I've had two Jeeps before and believe in the car.   I just I wish I had read the reviews before and gone somewhere else.......  the low price was not worth being treated like crap for he most of 6 hours.

It wasn't until his manager stepped in with my ""deal"" when things went south. First off, they are telling me the price of the wrangler I want to purchase is $32.5K then this dingo walks in and tells me my monthly payment is going to be $797 over 72 terms, they clearly werent looking to sell a car. They add in their $4k dealer accessories kit which is smoke and mirrors, and tell you that you must finance the vehicle through the dealership for atleast 3 months at 7% APR, then you can refinance with any lender. As someone with very good credit, I've never seen modern cars selling with 7% APR. I managed to shave $2K off their dealer accessories and took out the other xxxxxxxx warranties they tried baiting in as well, so for those that say its non negotiable, it is but they wont take it all off. The final straw for me was the insult of an offer for my trade in, they were a good 30% under its fair trade in value, I have other offers from dealerships and carmax to back up my ""fair value"" assesment. I walked, too much smoke and mirrors, hidden fees, etc. I will be buying a wrangler but certainly not from them. They'll also reply to this and likely say something along the lines of we sell 10,000 cars a year all at our advertised prices 100% of the time, but if you read all the reviews here you'll quickly understand that is total poppycock.

But they hit my car into separate areas took 45 minutes to find my car and when I got in my car it’s smelt like a cigar. Which means it was being driven around while I was waiting for it I’m assuming. My gearshift is not as smooth as it used to be it is sticking and they never call you back! Also my alignment seems off and  wondering if it’s from the guy that was joy riding in my car while smoking his cigars! I find this place very unprofessional.

We specifically asked if they could have the car ready for us to drive. They agreed. We called 15 minutes before we arrived only to find out they didn’t actually know where the vehicle was. They have multiple different lots and in the 2 1/2 hours we gave them to find the vehicle, they did no such thing. We got there and the vehicle was not there, however they tried to pressure us into starting paperwork to buy a vehicle we have not even seen?? We waited an hour and nobody even knew what lot the vehicle was even on. We talked to 5 different people and nobody was actually knowledgeable enough to help us. Everybody promised they would find out right away, only to never see them again. We then got a call 2 hours after we left the dealership incredibly upset, only for them to ask where we were because they had our WRANGLER ready for us to look at.

ALL PRICES YOU SEE ADVERTISED ONLINE ARE """"""NEVER"""""" THE PRICE YOU WILL PAY, according to Mario the salesman who told me this dirty secret that this dealer recently changed their policy. EVERY THOUSAND OF VEHICLES IN-STOCK (NEW AND USED) NOW REQUIRE A MINIMIUM OF $4,000 MARKUP PRICE ($1,500 more for RAM trucks) FOR THE JUNK DEALER AFTERMARKET ACCESSORIES INSTALLED before they will sell the cars to you, AND IT IS """"""NON-NEGOTIABLE...""""""""

Their markup price may be possible to negotiate on very-rare case basis, but only good for few hundred dollars off max. If you are a guy, FORGET IT, you are required to pay the full $4,000 markup price. Only ladies can negotiate the $4,000 markup aftermarket price for few hundred dollars less. They are very-PREJUDICED and BIASED on who will get the discount or not, and I saw all these events on my face personally overhearing from other customers nearby. Not every people will get the same price, opportunity, and discount.

PLEASE SAVE YOUR TROUBLE AND LOOK ELSEWHERE...Run, RuN, RUN AWAY...

(PS: This 1-star review wouldn't be posted if dealer didn't screw up with the wrong stock number of vehicle we originally worked on for 24 hours straight, but sold it to different customer instead despite my bill of sale contract was already created and signed. I lost my patience and anger, their stupidity, and stormed out. I would be happy to keep this bait-and-switch dealer a secret and give them 5 stars today (and not post this review) if they didn't screw up on me.

52585,24-Jan-19,"When you go to a dealership and buy a car new from the lot, you're not just buying a car but you're buying a piece of mine that anything that breaks on it is covered for the next 36,000 miles. You're not expecting them to all of a sudden after a year-and-a-half turn on you and try to rip you off looking for any reason they can. My radio broke a year ago and I took it out oh, this does not void the warranty, even though he's trying to convince me it does and trying to convince me that my air conditioner knob won't turn because I took my radio out of year ago. Not only that, I've been bringing my vehicle to this place for the past year since I got it and the last two times I brought it it didn't have the radio in it and because I didn't get this bearded self proclaimed mechanic as a service provider... it was never a problem and all the issues that were covered under warranty we're fixed. I wasn't asking for the radio to be fixed. This time it was my door latches and my air conditioner knob would not physically turn and he's going to try to tell me that that's because I took my radio out a year ago and it's so ridiculously underhanded and is blatantly transparent they are not out for customer service or do you good because you bought a vehicle from them...they are out to suck as much money out from you as they possibly can even as a loyal customer. I don't understand it because these guys, at the front desk, if they're not getting the money you've figured they would understand and it would try that help you get your car fixed...not try to say $150 to bring it in when it's under warranty. Yes you heard me $150 to bring it in and it still under warranty it's only a year-and-a-half old. I did not install any more systems I did not alter anything electrical inside I simply took the radio out of the dash. They wouldn't even compromised to fix my back door latches on my patch on the back because you know that's directly related to the radio(sarcastic) and makes a whole bunch of sense there. I really wish he wouldn't have been so stubborn with this, it's just not right, taking the radio off does not effect the door latches nor the A/C components and DOES NOT void your warranty... and he kept thinking if he explained it enough  to me that I was going to believe what he said. So basically they are trying to rip me off and weasel their way out of a signed contract warranty...when there's been multiple repairs on this thing...in the same condition as it's in now...so there's nothing really more I can say to get the point across. The Dodge I had bought had broken multiple times within the first year and they had it for upwards of two weeks at a time, 2 weeks and I didn't say nothing I didn't complain at all because they had me covered and they fixed everything that was wrong with it... everything that was DESERVED to be fixed. Now for a couple little things it would have taken maybe an hour and a half to do all of them, they're going to cause me and themselves this much trouble trying to squeeze a hundred something bucks out of me which...I got...but it's not the point. The fact that they serviced before in the same condition and now they're not lets you know that the inconsistency automatically leads to the conclusion that they're ripping us off every chance they can get...any time they can think of. I know this is common knowledge, that dealers rip you off....but I'm not having it this time....you should have just fixed my doors and A/C....I talked to my lawyer friend...my warranty is still valid....stop jerking people around. I'm about too move forward with being a real pain in the xxx for you HB dodge...you maybe enough of of people in HB...stop greed before I start a campaign. ;)",6,68,396
52587,05-Jan-19,"Went to the dealer after they would not negotiate an out the door price over the internet or phone.  Turns out the Ram truck that was advertised was just a ploy to get customers into their door.  The truck is a Ram 2019 Longhorn with a stock number 50505 was advertised as an MSRP of 58K when the actual vehicle was 62K, they then proceeded to tell me that I had to buy 4500 dollars in additional dealer services to get the vehicle at the advertised price.  Makes sense since the garbage they sell as ""extra coverage"" is 100% pure profit and the sale of the truck is a just s small fraction into their pocket. 

The sad part of this story is my wife is 8 months pregnant and we spent 4 hours there just to be taken advantage of.  I even bought a vehicle here in 2014 and got the vehicle and at the advertised price.  Not sure if what they are doing is legal but its sad to see places like this are still in business.  Even contacted Ram which didn't have much to say.  

Really love the looks of these new trucks but I cant see a reason why I would want to give my business to people like this.  Would rather pay more for something less to an honest dealership that cares about customer service.

I called yesterday, 10/23, and made a 7:00 appt. for today 10/24. When I spoke to Henry Jimenez (service advisor) we discussed (and confirmed) fixing 4 issues; replace 2 front tires, fix the recall, door paneling falling off, and I needed a new key fob. Henry then told me that they would only need my car for a day because these were all very ""simple"". 
    My car was dropped off at the dealership at 7:05 am. Henry called me at 3:00pm (8 hours later) with a nasty attitude, and said ""I don't know why you had your car towed up here, we started it just fine"". I then reiterated the issues that needed fixing, and Henry said ""oh yeah"", and hung up. I then called back at 5:49 and asked Henry when my car would be ready, and he said I couldn't pick it up until tomorrow. I told him that it was crucial I get my car back, because I was taking my godmother to chemo in the morning & I had school. Henry very nastily replied ""yeah, well"". Then Henry lied and said ""We didn't have the tires in stock"". When I told him that wasn't true because I confirmed that there were 5 tires in stock before I made the appt. he again nastily replied ""yeah, well"". I then said ""If you had any issues you should have just called me"". Henry again ""yeah, well"". I asked him why he didn't call me; he gave no response. I then said ""New tires are simple and quick, you still have time to do it today."" Again Henry nastily replied, ""yeah, well - no I don't"". He then text messaged me at 6:02, and said I could get my car (with no new tires of course) which was the sole reason for dropping it off.

Don’t bother getting a pre approved loan from a major lender they will not accept. Ie. USAA pre approved loans
Felt as if I was inconvenience to them for wanting to purchase a car. Plan on spending hours waiting on finance even if you are 1 of 2 people waiting.  While you are waiting you would think they would be prepping your car for delivery to you , however that is not the case. So after waiting hours on finance, plan to spend at least another hour waiting on them to take another hour to wash your car.

They pulled the old ""four square"" sales trick where they only show you down payment and monthly payments without telling you the actual price.  I went home and plugged the numbers into a car payment calculator to learn that the total amount financed was several thousand dollars more than we talked about.  I had to call back the next day to learn that they tried to hide a FOUR THOUSAND DOLLAR extended warranty in those numbers, hoping that I wouldn't do the math.  We never once discussed an extended warranty, I never asked for it, and they never disclosed that they were adding it to the total amount financed.

If you absolutely must buy a car from this place, make 100% sure you know what the price of the car is...and what else you're paying for.  If your salesman keeps going to the finance guy and returning with only down payment and monthly payments, talk to the finance guy directly and see what the total amount financed is and an itemized list of things that contribute to that number.

If your intimidation stems from the thought of a savvy used car salesman and feeling dumb for not knowing basic information about how the whole car buying or financing process works dont worry none of these sales rep do either. Their salesman have absolutely zero and i mean zero knowledge about what it is that their doing there. Literally hire guys with zero experience, and does it show. Simplest questions such as ""What kind of insurance must i have to drive off the lot?"" is met with a face of confusion and followed with ""ummm... Im not.... let me find that out for you"". By the way that is how most inquiries are responded to. its either that or ""we'll go over that once we process it and find out ummmm.... im not quite sure"". Every question is answered though. ""Do you need proof of address?"" ...umm..im not quite sure.... let me find out.  ""Does the cosigner need to be here for me to apply?"".....we'll go over that once we process it and find out.....

I would be a bit more understanding about the sales rep they hire there but they are just as much at fault as HB Jeep is. I would not go apply in a field that i know absolutely nothing about. Nor would i hire someone who knows nothing about the product im selling. You dont see landscapers applying to be brain surgeons.  And the people they hire there to sell us cars are just that know-nothing guys. But I guess that is how much respect HB Jeep has for its consumers. I really wish these guys got more training other than how to log into their dealer website and more Customer Service training but from what i saw the lady conducting part of the training was more concerned with letting the new herd of dumb flesh know how much more dedicated she is to the company than anything else. Maybe instead of continuing to hire herd after herd they should spend the money and commission theyre giving to these guy on some real training for how to treat a customer and most of all on a legal team or someone with some understanding of how advertising works. I guess nobody really cares of or has heard that false advertising is a crime. And maybe theyre just that disconnected and dont think that a knowledgeable and apologetic rep would mean the difference between a frustrated understanding customer and a pissed off misled consumer filing a claim for false advertising.

52625,11-Apr-18,"Horrendous customer service in the Body Shop!!! When I picked up my Jeep after 6 weeks of repairs; I assumed to meet the body shop manager and go over my repairs. However, I soon find out that the old body shop manager I had been in Correspondence with left the company. So I assume the new body shop manager will probably come and talk to me instead. Nope, my new guy they had hired Steve, just blows me off when I try to introduce myself and shake his hand. Yet, the guy is too busy to even acknowledge my existence.  Then I look at my car and one side is darker in color than the other. They suggest to just ""buff it out"" and once it's in the sun the new paint will fade down to the old. So they're asking me to buff out the paint job they just did? I'm wondering why they're asking me to do their job after $8000 in repairs. In addition, I get in my car and drive home with a better indignation only to find out that my pants are soaked in oil from the seat. Apparently one of the mechanics leaked oil in my front driver seat, resulting in a new pair of pants ruined. I contact Steve the body shop manager, only to find out that they will not do anything about the issue. Very disappointed in Huntington Beach Jeep!  Steve call me back and we will resolve this issue. You have my number I'm waiting on your call.",6,68,-1

52627,05-Jan-18,"I purchased my vehicle here back in 2013 with extended warranty. I've had all mechanical work performed at this location. I took my vehicle over the holidays due to engine light going on, was told it was due to open thermostat which was not covered by warranty or extended warranty. When I asked why It was not covered under Federal Emissions warranty, the service provider simply stated it was not listed on computer and therefor not covered. Furthermore, he could not see how this would be an emission issue.  Their initial price for replacement and thermostat and flush was over $500.00. When I complained about their lack of adequate response for not being covered, no effort was made to provide me with proper response.  Furthermore, if I didn't have work done there, I would still be charged 150.00 dollars just for read the code.  They also suggested I get work done which had already been performed, i.e. tires.  When I informed them that I had recently purchased new tires, the response was ""well this is just stuff the computer prints outs as suggestions because of the miles""",6,68,-1
52628,03-Jan-18,"First of all I had a bad experience with this dealership!! When I purchased my vehicle back in May 26,2017 I told them that the car didn't have gas and that they needed to put gas in it. When I told them too they said that they didn't do that there. I was furious because I drove all the way from Riverside to Huntington to get a Jeep. Therefore I had to put my own gas. My first purchased vehicle at a different dealership made sure to put a full tank. Even at the dealership where my boyfriend bought his RAM truck at BMW of Murrieta put a full tank of gas and it was a used vehicle too. I was so disappointed after that. Back in November 2017 when I had my first car service I went in for a regular oil change and maintenance check. When I get there to check in the representative tells me that my car had a recall and I'm thinking like 'DID THEY SELL ME A CAR THAT HAS A RECALL AND THEY ALREADY KNEW ABOUT IT!?' I kept asking the representative what kind of recall and he said it was a sticker from the VIN number that I was going to receive a letter in the mail. Till this day I have not received any letter! The recall is supposedly called a T12? I tried using google to see what a T12 recall meant and nothing came up. I even went on the website where you search up vehicles with recalls and my car did not show up at all. I was so confused at that point. I don't know what kind of dealership this is and what kind of service they hold but my car service was not completed. All the checkups that they supposedly did they obviously did not complete the job. I got a description of all the services they made and they checked off that they checked all the fluids in the vehicle. Lies! I dropped off the car with low washer fluid and I never refilled it because I knew I was getting the service and they were going to refill it. I get the car back and it still had low washer fluid. I know what to expect when it comes down to car services because Valvoline would walk me through it, even Valvoline has better service then this dealer! I tried to complain about it and they said that they forgot to reset it. I had my boyfriend check and they didn't refill anything! I contacted the dealership and gave them a review on their website but they obviously did not care to reach out. I am an unhappy customer. And I don't recommend anyone purchasing from this dealership!",6,68,-1

I was told by the sales person that they could not do that right now because the ""managers"" were in a meeting -I would have to wait. I hung out for a while, then as I was walking out they ran out the door and said wait, just give us a few minutes......half hour later, they gave me an outrageous price so I finally gave up and left 2+ hours later.....I have been treated like dirt at dealerships before, but that was back when I was young and a broke dreamer.......this time I had $50Kof financing in my pocket and I wanted to buy a car from them...........must be great to be so prosperous that you can afford to let a customer that was sold on a vehicle walk out the door......

On a Friday, I got an "" out the door"" price on
A new Jeep. I called back around 6pm.to confirm my appt. for Saturday morning. 
I arrived on time. They shuffled me through a couple of different sales people. First they told me the car was gone. Sold last night. No one called to let me know!. The sales mgr, acted like it was my job to call them in the morning,  to make sure it was there. Then they found a more expensive model , with options I did not want or need. I have them the sales price I was quoted , then came back about 90 minutes later. After 2 more hrs.,they finally appraised my trade in . The LOW BALL GAME!
I had researched the trade in value on numerous credible sites. They OFFERED ME NEXT TO NOTHING! OVER $5,000 LESS THAN IT WAS WORTH. This included a litany of stories. They also came back with a price on their vehicle much higher.. The real difference between what I was quoted and my experience, including trying to steal my trade in was some $9,000+.

They advertise low prices, but you have to get one of their HORRIFIC loans where they make tons of money off you on the back end. The managers are very unprofessional and the sales team has no idea about anything they are doing. Usually when you go to a car dealership they try to be nice to you, and try to earn your business, they pretty much told me to get out when I called them out on their shady tactics. I offered to pay cash for the vehicle and they were not interested in that either. I would have been totally fine getting a loan through the dealer if it was a credit union, Ford financial, or any reputable loan company. I drove all the way there on a week night in rush hour traffic to buy a used car, and they pulled this crap. I called several times the next day to try to speak to a manager who had some idea what they were doing, but after 6 calls with promised call backs, never heard from them.

52643,29-Aug-17,"I went to HB Dodge to buy a Ram 1500. I was down to one vehicle in my family and needed to buy soon. After doing my research online, I walked in knowing exactly which stock numbers I was interested in. After meeting a salesman and relaying the trucks I wanted to see, it took 90 minutes just to get the vehicle from their offsite warehouse to the dealership. When it arrived I looked at it, then went back in to get the keys from my salesman, only to be told that it was already sold. Huge bummer, but I'm determined. My salesman recommended I go grab lunch and he would call me when my next choice was ready to view. After TWO HOURS and no phone call, I call him and he tells me it's ready but he forgot to call me. I return to the dealership and sit down to make a deal. My salesman was doing at least three other things and got up several times. He also was less than informed and had to ask his manager for the answer to every question I asked. I didn't appreciate being charged an additional $900 than the advertised price because I had already secured my own financing. They also refused to honor a Ram $500 military discount for which I qualified. The manager had an opportunity to smooth things over and step in to save his struggling salesman, but instead was rude and unapologetic. After several mistruths and an overwhelming feeling that I was not valued I stood up and left. Second best decision I made that weekend. The first was going to Orange Coast Dodge after I left HB to get my vehicle. ",6,68,1191

It obviously took this site awhile to post.  To the readers researching this dealership, you can see by the owner's reply that he is rude and not concerned about his lack of customer service skills. I implore you to check out responses by other dealers.  Most don't use profanity, inflated egos and turn the blame on his disgruntled customers.  Again, I stand by my comment, that if I  can warn even 1 potential customer, it is worth the effort.  I believe customer service is extremely important.  This guy can't help but throw a tantrum every time someone complains.  Buyer beware and best of luck if you choose to go forward with a sale here.

They did not inform of the added $750.00 if financing is done by another company or credit union.  We were wondering why keys were given even before the signing of the transaction.

I have spoken with the sales manager, Mario, on the phone and he refuses to send an OTD quote on a vehicle that is posted on their website. I am just trying to understand any fees that i will be charged, which is a simple request.  The dealership states I need to physically visit the dealership.The only conclusion i can make is they want to charge extra dealer fees and the dealership does not want to expose any information that would risk killing the deal. They want me to come into dealership hoping you will just agree to the fees and buy the vehicle.  I am located 2+ hours from the dealership, so driving 2 hours to receive an OTD number is not a reasonable request. In buying 10+ cars over the last 20 years i have never dealt with such an unprofessional sales team. Why would you not provide a simple OTD itemized quote. As an example of their customer service I was talking to Mario on the phone and he abruptly said he needed to help other customers and would call me back later that evening, which he never did.  I was trying to buy a $50K dodge durango, and I cannot believe this type of customer service  I would not recommend this dealership for anyone considering a new Jeep, Dodge, or Chrysler product.

I spoke with Ken and told him I could buy the part cheaper and do it myself we had three discussions about me picking up the car for me to install the new thermostat when I did so I drove my 2012 Grand Jeep Cherokee directly around the corner because the second I drove off the lot my gauge pinned overheating mind you I did not have a overheating problem when I drove it in.

I am now put in the position that makes me very uncomfortable and in other amazement that a dealership would go to these lengths to make a dollar and when I brought it back to the dealership with a new thermostat installed . Ken the service manager says now your warranty is voided because I put in an aftermarket thermostat after we discussed it many times . I asked Ken  why wouldn't you say something about my warranty  being voided if I was to do the work.  He said ""Do you want me to color you pictures to"" and his next comment was ""Now the heads blown"". I said I do not have the money for these expenses I brought in for a transmission issue, I honestly was in shock and in my disbelief of the chain of events that I was pondering I seriously had a tear come to my eye eyes and as I was getting a hold of myself mind you in this men and a half I had time to think. I look up to hear Ken saying ""We're not a storage yard you need to get your vehicle out of my yard"". I'm 51 years old now and if I was a younger man things would have turned out much different but I was in astonishment and just had to leave.

52681,14-Mar-17,"So let me start this review by suggesting that I have purchased a multitude of cars from various dealerships and manufacturers ranging from inexpensive to very expensive! Never have I ever encountered a more unprofessional, disorganized and wasteful entity in my entire life! I essentially spoon fed them a sale! I called early in the morning and spoke to Oscar (this gentlemen is the internet manager and judging by my experience with him, it's really no surprise that the organization is as horrendous as it is). I told Oscar what car I wanted to test drive, when I would be there and reiterated the importance of timeliness as I made a 2 hour commute to get to the facility. I had also prequalified for a loan and secured financing prior to my arrival. In addition I got my trade appraised, through their website, and had my pink slip in hand ready to make my purchase! When I arrived, on time might I add, I had to wait nearly 30 minutes for my sales rep to acknowledge my presence. Afterwards he took me to the vehicle I was going to purchase. It was unkept and filthy! All of this was of little consequence as the vehicle was being sold at a great price and the inherent value was present. As I went to test drive the vehicle Oscar realized that the dealership had lost the key to the vehicle. They initially thought they locked it inside and I had to help them POP THE LOCK! (As far fetched as this sounds I'm not making it up.) we spent nearly an hour popping the lock to find the key wasn't in the car! It took nearly two hours to get a locksmith to make a new key! Again I waited through this process kindly and patiently! Durning which time I waited in a dilapidated showroom that was clearly not being maintained from an aesthetic or functional perspective with one of the most unprofessional managers I've ever experienced. Yet still I waited trying to give the dealership the benefit of the doubt! As my visit approached the three hour mark I finally test drove the vehicle and came to agreeable financial terms. One would think that after the courtesy and patience I demonstrated the duration of my experience would be seamless...however you would be wrong! Another two hours past as I sat aimlessly waiting for this inefficient, disorganized, and unprofessional people to get together the paperwork for my purchase. They could not manage to do so. I arrived at the dealership at 6 pm and at 11:15 pm I decided that I would take my business elsewhere! When I told them to cancel the transaction I did not receive so much as an apology!

After I went home, I read the contract and the Purchase price was 34,000$, not 24K. I went back and tried to resolve the issue and cancel the contract, they said they are ""Sorry"" about this mistake, but they can't cancel it because the car have already been sold. The next problem happened last monday. I received a call from the dealership. The person told me that I owed them money. I made all of my payments on time and have paper proof. They said that If I am not going to pay, I have to come over to the dealership to talk. Today, I drove 2 hours to get to the dealership, spent 4 hours there and drove another 3 hours back due to traffic. And the problem was not resolved. They had me drive all the way to give them a couple of papers where I could have just emailed them back. I then tried to trade in the car I bought for another one, but the new manager told me that I cannot do that, because I agreed to pay so much on the first car that I will have to lose so much money If I want to trade it in.

I saw them add for 2 vehicles I was looking for, contacted their sales person and made arrangements to purchase before the 1 ½ drive each way and verified the pricing!
Within 10 minutes of arrival, I noticed that the MSRP on the vehicle’s window sticker was significantly LOWER than what they said in them adds; making their discount less than advertised.  I pointed this out to the salesman, who said – “I’ve never seen this happen before.  My apologies.  I’m sure my manager will honor the error.”  I mentioned that maybe the other vehicle was correct; sad to say, it too had the same deceptive error.  What are the odds!  If you’ve ever bought from them, you were probably quietly screwed too.
1 ½ hours later, after having most all the work completed to purchase the vehicle; the manager admitted the error; but, said that “in small print, it says if a mistake is made, we don’t honor them”.
I’m an employer, if my employee makes an error – I will do my best to honor it and serve the client.  They admitted the error but was unwilling to make even a ONE-dollar adjustment towards the $1,000 error.
Thus, they went from being a vendor I would recommend to a deceptive, dishonorable dealer.  I would suggest that you avoid them.  HONOR DOESN’T MATTER IN POLITICS; but, it should matter in business!

52735,16-Oct-16,"EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED in how this dealership handled customer service.
After TWO WEEKS, our brand new Jeep that we bought at this dealership would not start. This was disappointing in itself, but my review is based on how inadequate the situation was handled. 

When the car did not start on a Saturday night, I tried to contact the dealership but found that not many people were there, which was understandable. I left a message with Tom Cruz, the sales manager, and I left two messages with Jacob Jacobo, the man that helped us buy the car. I also left a general voicemail with the receptionist that night for ANYONE to get back to me. 

I received no calls back the next day, so I left a separate message with each of the men above another message with a different sales manager, and another message with the receptionist again for anyone to get back to me. I had to have the car towed TWICE from one dealership that was the closest to me, then to Huntington Beach. This was covered under warranty, but essentially our day was gone while we waited four hours to get the car to the dealer. 

My husband and I work in San Diego, and we needed to get into a rental or something to get back and thankfully, the service department helped us with that, which is why this review is in my opinion worth one star (even if there is no option for zero stars). Although our car was not in the dealership's possession, they put us into a rental, but this would bite us in the butt later since we didn't get paperwork for the mileage coming in.

We still did not receive any correspondence back, after FOUR days, and after leaving voicemails every day with the receptionist, it was finally ridiculous and I sent an email to Tom and Jacob. Then Tom emailed me back right then and there and told me that him, and his whole team were out, and this was why no one had contacted us. I find that extremely hard to believe because the day before the receptionist let me know that Jacob had been in, but left early. After telling Tom this via email, I hadn't heard back from him, and still haven't. 

My Jeep was ready after almost two weeks of being in the service department, and while I appreciated that our car was worked on, when we got our car back there was almost 200 extra miles on the car. Now we did not have the paperwork as I mentioned with our situation of the car not being in when we received the rental. But the service department gave us the invoice letting us know the car came in at 1420 miles, which it did not, had been driven 5 miles to check if it worked, and it says that we received the car back with 1426 miles on it. However, we have pictures that our car came out at 1423 miles. Something wasn't right, and this whole situation was just wrong in the first place. 

I would caution everyone about coming here. It was not only disappointing, but just upsetting and a huge hassle that no one should have to deal with when buying a new car.",6,68,-1
52757,21-Sep-16,"This is regarding my experience with Dodge Huntington Beach... I was sold a certified pre-owned Dodge Challenger RT. The sales process was smooth, I don't really have any complaints about that. However, being a first time buyer, I was unaware that the dealership is required to give you a copy of the supposed 125 point inspection. Within 3 months of purchasing the vehicle, while driving down the freeway with my wife, we heard a loud 'clunk"" sound. That was the left radius arm coming out (think of it as a ball and socket joint) I got the vehicle home and had it towed to the dealership. While at the dealership, the service tech told me they would not likely get to my car that day and offered a loaner car, I accepted his offer. I get a call from the service tech the following day, demanding I return the loaner car. He proceeded to tell me over the phone that the type of damage was not covered and therfore, I was not approved to have it. Then he explained that the radius arm was damaged and/or broken and all 4 tires were bald. Also, there were missing nuts and bolts. I asked what could ha e caused this type of damage? He could not give me a definitive cause, he resorted to mere speculation. That it must be due to negligent driving. I have a 6 year old daughter that wants to go with me everywhere. To the fathers out there, you know what I'm talking about. There is no way in xxxx, that I would risk my daughters life, driving in such a manner. I reviewed the Carfax that was given to me, the previous owner was in a minor accident to the front, no further details. This was not disclosed to me at the time of purchase, which is my fault, I'm told the dealer is not required to reveal that to me. However, for the sales rep. to tell me that is has not been in any accidents, that's a different story. The Carfax report also shows the previous owner had all 4 tires replaced, then oddly enough, he had all 4 replaced only after putting less than 4,000 miles on the new pair. This is a 5 year old car, but it only had 16,xxx miles on it. Why would he replace the tires only after 4,000 miles on the new pair? Why did my tires go bald only after putting 9,000 miles on them before I had it towed to the dealership? I researched it and a suspension issue would cause early wear on the tires. What was affecting the vehicle when the original owner had it,  is clearly affecting my vehicle still. I pointed out all of this to the service tech. I purchased an extended warranty contract from them at the time of purchase. I contacted them, they told me to have the dealership call, to start the process. I asked the service tech to call, I waited 3 days, still nothing from the extended warranty company. I called the service tech to see if he had called. He said he hadn't, cuz he said he knew they wouldn't cover it. Well, I didn't know he had the right to make that decision. He agreed to call but it sounded like it bothered him to do so. They were no help at all. Finally, I get a car from Patrick, the rep. who the extended warranty company sent out. The dealership did not even make me aware that he came out to inspect the vehicle. Patrick told me that they could not cover the repairs due to they don't cover missing parts. He further explained to me, the missing nuts and bolts mentioned earlier, did not appear to be sheared off. Indicating, that someone forgot to put them on or did not put them on correctly. Patrick told me to ask the dealer how did this get missed on the certified pre-owned inspection? I pointed this out to the service tech and to the manager. I did not hear one response from them. While Patrick and I reviewed the Carfax so I could point out the original owner replacing the tires after only putting 4,000 miles on his new pair. His copy of the Carfax did not show this on the history. His copy just showed they were balanced. How does this type of pertinent information, that would be favorable for the dealership be taken out of the Carfax history? Now, the service tech changed it from we don't cover the type of damage, to my vehicle was out of the warranty period. My argument is that the problem existed before the time of purchase. All the things I pointed out clearly show that. The dealership has given me speculation with no definitive cause. They still would not cover the repairs. They still haven't. Mind you, what I mentioned wasn't a fast process. This is about 4 months after I brought in my vehicle. I'm paying for a car, I haven't been able to use. It was only out of the warranty period,  less than a month. You would think they would cover the repairs for a disabled Iraq veteran, after I pointed all of this out. I explained to them that I was a disabled veteran and I deserved better treatment from them, instead of being ignored for months. They didn't acknowledge this at all.",6,68,-1
52771,01-Sep-16,"DERRICK IN SERVICE TRIED TO SCAM ME FOR $800

I brought my vehicle into HB for Transmission service 5 days ago . 
the day after the service I noticed my vehicle was leaking fluid. (it has never leaked before) 
I called made and appointment with derrick yesterday . today he acted like I never called or spoke with him . 
  Derrick diagnosed my leak  as "" the gasket around the oil pan is leaking."" he said there was dirt caked around the oil pan on the edges holding in the oil . some of the dirt shook loose and now its leaking . he quoted me $ 800 . I told him that diagnosis does not sound accurate. I drive on the freeway . I don't drive through dirt for it to get caked up . I took my keys and went inside to talk to the General manager.   I waited for 10 minutes. Derrick came to me and said he wanted to put my car in the air and show me the dirt .. I said ok .. he took my car back and I am waiting for 20 minutes while its in the air.. finally I go back to see what is going on .. I then see derrick and the mechanic looking all under my car with flashlights and talking about where the leak could be coming from.. 

derrick comes back to me and says. 
"" well maybe the leak is coming from the top"" let me lower it and look. they lower it and look. 

then derrick says well maybe the leak is this.... we need to take some stuff apart to find out what is going on .. 

then derrick has the nerve to say I am looking at him like he does not know what he is talking about  . and he has been in the business 25 years and this is what he needs to do to diagnose my vehicle. 

I told him he is right I am looking at him like he does not know what he is talking about 

45 minutes ago he diagnosed my vehicle and quoted me 800 for repairs.. 

when I wanted to talk to management HE came back to ME and said he would SHOW ME the dirt caked up ect.... but once the car was in the air . he COULD NOT SHOW ME THE AFFORE MENTIONED DIRT WHICH HAD CAKED UP AND WHICH WOULD COST 800$ TO REPAIR . HE needed to look into it further when im under the car saying WHERE IS THE DIRT ?? 


this man Derrick totally tried to scam me.. I was at the dealership for 3 hours and I still do not know what or why my car is leaking . I purchased a jeep Laredo and a jeep patriot fromt his dealership and they  tried to scam me.


DERRICK TRIED TO SCAM ME WITH A 800$ DIAGNOSIS. TOLD ME HE WOULD SHOW ME THE DIRT UNDER THE CAR AND WHEN I WAS UNDER THE CAR WITH HIM LOOKING THE ENTIRE STORY CHANGED AND IT NEEDS FURTHER DIAGNOSIS..

52844,18-Apr-16,"Found my dream car and drove up from San Diego, had preapproved loan in hand just needed to verify it was the car I wanted.   After waiting an hour to get appraisal, finally got into finance, I was assured final dealer prep would be done before I got and finance wouldn't take that long, wrong on both.  Even though my bank had instructions for EFT finance insisted I needed a cashiers check, I told the finance guy this was the 4th car I had purchased with this bank and never had they given me a check.  He also didn't know how to use their touch screen system, which is supposed to speed things up, it didn't, had to bring in another finance guy to show him.  Spent well over an hour in finance and was now in my 4th hour overall.  Well at least my car would be done...it wasn't, also prior to going into finance I had requested the my personalized tags and tire valve stems be put in my new car...finally the salesman brought the car out after another hour of waiting, now well into my 5th hour at dealership.  The salesman said he had to do the prep, even though the car is gorgeous still had stickers and some marks on window, but now I was just ready to leave.   The tags and valve stems weren't in the new car either, even though I asked...got on the road with less then 1/4 tank of gas, my wife said just go, we were starving so went across street to grab some dinner before starting back to San Diego.  Got call from salesman, he still had tags, still trying to be cheerful went back and grabbed them, asked him about a tank of gas and he said they had to cut back....so it wasn't an oversight, I just spent $60k on a car and they don't even give you a full tank of gas!  I was now in my 7th hour at dealer, figured I should just be happy and get on road...

2 weeks later I notice that HBD still hadn't paid off my bank for trade, even though they had already sold the car.  My wife called to sort out the problem and almost immediately the finance guy started yelling at her...she asks for his supervisor and he wouldn't let her talk either...I get on the phone and he tells me they have 13days by law to mail the check and they mailed a check on the 13th day, I asked why this wasn't brought up in finance and they basically accused me of lying, when I told him we had been assured they process it in'a couple of days'...could hardly get a word in and by now the conversation was becoming more heated...

52929,06-Aug-15,"I went to the dealership to buy a vehicle yesterday. I called before making the 3 hour drive to confirm the vehicle was still available. I also told them I was buying it and asked if they would hold it for me if I made the drive. Tom told me they don't normally do that but would ask his manager. He put me on hold a minute and came back saying that his manager approved it. They would hold the vehicle for me to purchase if I drove down that day. I take off work early and head that way immediately. I arrive there and we immediately sit down to go through the numbers to make the purchase. Keep in mind, I agreed to the purchase price of the vehicle before making the trip. I did not haggle with pricing at all. It was the price on the front window which was a decent price for this vehicle. They run my credit which is approx 800 credit score and I'm approved for the loan amount. I'm also putting 7500 cash down. I decline their extended warranty that they continued to push on me. After declining that, there is still 2k in hidden fees according to the length of the loan, monthly payment, and the interest rate they are giving me. I could of used my own financing but wanted it to go smoothly as it was late in the day and my bank was closed. I agreed to the 5% which I knew I could refinance in a few months with Chase @ 1-2%. They wouldn't show me the total and were playing the normal sales hidden numbers game. I ask one question - the break down of the fees. I never get this. After sitting around waiting, Tom comes back and tells me he cannot make the deal because the vehicle just sold! We are in the middle of a contract and they sale it? They failed to tell me they were doing two contracts at the same time for the same vehicle! They wasted 7.5 hours of my time and did not keep their word. If you cannot hold a vehicle, say so. If you tell someone you will hold it; keep your word. Why waste my time, get a bad review, and run my credit if you are going to sale it to someone else after promising to hold it?

52962,02-Apr-15,"I must tell you, In the collection of automobiles that I've purchased - this  car buying experience was the worst that I've ever had. 

 

I initially inquired about a Ram truck online, and was contacted by Robert Bauer. I spoke to him on the phone and by email a couple of times and made an appointment to see him. I arrived at our scheduled meeting time, and he wasn't in yet. I waited about a half hour and he finally arrived, I introduced myself and he had no clue what I was interested in or seemingly who I was. He finally pulled up my info and proceeded to find my truck - I waited another half hour. He took me for a test drive, and when I inquired about the air suspension option and standard warranties he said that I really didn't need those options. After the test drive, we went inside to discuss price and an already lackluster experience spiraled out of control. I told him what I thought the truck was worth, he was offended and said that the dealership was already discounting it. So I tried to get an out the door price from him and he said that he couldn't do that till I was in finance. I explained that part of my decision making process was knowing the finance options , and he retorted by pressuring me to make a decision. I said that I wouldn't make a decision without the numbers in front of me and I didn't like his sales tactic. I said that we were done and he told me to take his card - and that ""you'll be back""

Fast forward two days -  I was still very dissatisfied with the experience at the dealership, but I decided that I would give it another go. I asked to speak to a manager and got Nick Farber. I explained the situation and he said that he would take care of me personally and try to make the situation better. I asked for an out the door price and he said that was against company policy.  I made an appointment with him for 9:30 AM on Friday March 27th. He called me later that day and said that he would be tied up in a meeting and wouldn't be available till 10:30, I agreed and appeared at the dealership as agreed. When I spoke tot he receptionist, she told me that Nick wasn't there, finally another manager told me that he wasn't in yet that morning and wouldn't be in till noon. At that point I was pretty irritated because he had blown my appointment off - I was told that Dan would be helping me in Nick's absence. Dan had no clue about the situation, so I had to explain everything all over again. I had secured financing with my credit union and had decided to go that way, I asked Dan to get me an out the door price so that I could make a decision. He told me that I would need to fill out a credit application so that he could take it to his manager before he could get me an out the door price. I went round and round with him, and explained that since I already had approved financing I just needed to know what the final price was going to be! He came back by telling me that I was being difficult, and that he thought that we were done. I was furious, and raised my voice. Another manager came over, and I asked to speak to the sales manager - after about 5 minutes Danny came over and spoke to me. He agreed that I didn't need to do a complete credit application since I was using my own financing. He got me an out the door price with all the incentives that were available, and I hesitantly agreed to make the purchase. 

He then sent me to Tom Cruz' office to complete the paper work. Tom had no idea who I was or what was going on, again I had to explain the situation and waited for them to get things together. Soon after that Nick Farber arrived, and took over the process- I was not happy at all by then. 

Finally, I went into the finance manager's office and explained that I was very frustrated and would like to make this as quick as possible. I explained that I wanted NO extras, however he proceeded to try to hard sell me an extended warranty, paint / interior protection, a maintenance plan, alarm, etc. I explained that I wasn't interested, and he persisted, and I lost it. I ended up signing the papers and getting out of your dealership as quickly as possible. 

In good conscience I could not suggest this dealership to anyone nor would I be likely to purchase from them again. It seems that customer service is the last priority at this dealership, and that hard selling / sleazyness is the corporate culture. If I'm contacted by Ram, I will let them know what my experience was like and how dissatisfied I still am with it. ",6,68,-1

John said the Cherokee was at their offsite storage area and drove me to that lot and proceeded to frantically look for the Jeep finally giving up in what seemed to be forever as I was standing among all of these dirty dusty vehicles in an unpaved parking area.  John was kind enough to allow me to drive another Cherokee back to the dealership so I could at least access whether I wanted a 4 cylinder Cherokee.  Back at the dealership he again began trying to locate the vehicle and somehow determined that is was at another lot and someone had disabled the GPS system the dealership uses to keep track of the vehicles.  Well, he finally got the vehicle to show me which was caked with dust and the wheels looked like it had been doing some off-roading.  This all took over an hour and a half and I had to leave for another appointment.  I called John when I got home and arranged for an appointment at 10 am the next day to perhaps close the deal on the car, he assured me the Cherokee was still available and someone would be there to appraise my trade-in.  Arrived at 10 am, John was there but no Cherokee, so he ran off to find it again.  I sat cooling my heels for 30 minutes and finally sent him a text to find out what in the world was going on.  He informed me he could not get in the gate at the offsite lot and was waiting for someone to open it - he said "" we just opened and I should understand that with over 2000 new cars, it is hard to keep track of them etc, etc"". I sent him another text to see if the trade-in could be looked at while I was waiting and was informed by John that he could not locate the used car guy.  I waited another 20 minutes and then left.  What I do not understand is why he did not arrange to have the vehicle ready and detailed for me to look at seeing that I showed a genuine interest in buying it and had made an appointment.

So when we were working the numbers out it just didn't make sense.  We asked to see the workout sheet and when it arrived the taxes, doc fees, registration all added up correctly but we couldn't figure out why the price was about $1000 over what we were adding up.  Then in a little line item directly under the price that is advertised for this vehicle online, was a weird term ""aftermarket"" and $774 added to the price of the vehicle.

All of a sudden the car that I drove was NOT the one in the ad. The one I drove was more expensive of course and had AWD. The dealer in attempt to ""make things right"" insisted on working to match the deal as close as possible on the car that I drove. It suddenly became a numbers game on the monthly payment amount in attempt to meet close to the payment amount and terms that was originally pitched on the car with less features. Consequently, I ended up with a car that was out of scope of what we originally planned for the purchase. We were handed of to 3 different salesmen during this process, which made it even more of a unnerving experience.

In many ways atleast 5.They basically treated me like trash because I was not there to pick up the vehicle TODAY.  They stated we have customers here now and your not. I ended up purchasing from Van Nuys Dodge along with another new vehicle that my son happen to see Van Nuys was a good dealer and took the very little time required to complete the deal. 

Do yourself a favor if you want to be treated like a human being and be heard do not buy a vehicle from Huntington Beach Dodge. The whole experience was a nightmare.How can you screw up a easy cash deal. I wire you the money and pick up the vehicle in 5 days. Why is that so difficult? 

Why did the sales manager Sean pass me off to a new sales person that had no clue about anything? Because they don't care.If you want more information on this horrible dealer email me @kenronni@yahoo.com. if you want first class service and a great experience call Dennis Dillon Dodge and have your vehicle delivered they have the best prices in the country and will make any transaction easy and take the time to LISTEN to your needs. I purchased a 2012 Charger R/T and a 2014 2500 Ram and had them delivered from Dennis Dillon both flawless transactions.",6,68,18

Left dealer went to gas station to gas up and a loud whistle was now very present that you can hear from 12 feet away or more. Talked to dealer the next morning...""No problem-we will take care of you"" well a few days later I did take our jeep in with about 126 miles and the service manager did hear it very clearly and of course our salesman said ""I dont hear anything""and walked away. WOW is that how they that take care of you? We have purchased 3 new jeeps from this sales guy in 2 years!   A 2011 Rubi Unlimited, A 2013 Rubi Unlimited and this 2013 Rubi 2 door. CRAP!!! that is over $100,000. dollars in 2 years. Well anyways, 2 days after dropping off the jeep then the service manager calls and said "" THAT IS NORMAL"".. are you serious! If the jeep was making that sound when we test drove it NO WAY we would have bought it. So the dealer has turned their backs on us!  WOW!  over  $100,000. we spent there and this is how they """"NO Problem- We will take care of you"""" Please buy from another dealer - no car is made perfect, but this is how they treat a GOOD returning customer. Salesmen- Rob Trachman. and Service Manager is Rick B. I mean these guys really looked me in the eye and said that they would take care of me..........right.

I had such high hopes for this dealership. Nice website, responded to my e-mail inquiry, etc, etc.  Not so!

Came on the lot with a 2002 Range Rover ready to trade.  My buddy and I got onto the lot where two saleman actually saw us and turned the other way.  We were to meet a salesman who does their internet sales who I can only describe as a scrawney pale Martin Short look-a-like with too much mouse in his hair making him look like ""The Heat Miser"" from that old Christmas show.  But I digress.

We came in our casual t-shirt and jeans and they treated us like dirt which is funny because we both work in the film industry (Director and Photographer respectively) and I plan on telling everyone I know to stay away from this dealership.  Simply rude and they assumed we were dumb enough to fall for their ""very slick"" sales techniques.  

Tried to sell us a car with a damaged front and rear and all they said was ""so do you want to buy it?""  Yeah buddy, I want to by your damaged goods and pay WAY over Blue Book.  They forget they're selling a Jeep, not a Lexus.

The Internet sales guy didn't even take the time to show us the car.  He pawned us off to what I can only describe as ""Cousin It's"" moronic brother who kept calling us ""bro' and drilled me with so many questions that I finally had to tell him to be quiet so I could listen to the ""clicking sound"" the car made as I drove it.

When i wanted to see any other inventory, they took us ""out back"" and showed us a Grand Cherokee that was not only filthy but looked like it had been caught in a flood.  I laughed until my buddy pointed to the License Plate on the car and it was from ""Louisiana"".  Katrina Salvage anyone?

I have to say, once we were going to walk off the lot, the ""original"" sales guy ran out and tried to wheel and deal, but by then I was so disgusted we politely excused ourselves and left.  Later we looked at each other and thought, here was a great example of why car dealers get such a bad rap.  The type of place that makes you want to take a shower afterwards.

I understand people have to make a living and people need to sell, but you don't have to be a jerk about it.  There are too many other dealerships that you don't have to subject yourself to the indignity of one like Huntington Beach Jeep.  Yeah guys, your ""Monkey in the Trunk"" logo fits you perfectly!

I made it clear that I was NOT applying for one yet, but gave them my information, so they could do the credit check in order to get interest rates.

well, I get this call that said, ""Congratulations, we found you a loan, you can pick up your car!"" I said ""what? You were just supposed to be getting me figures!"" Of course, the figure was too high, and by then I was most unhappy that they had secured a loan without my permission.

Paul, one of the salesman overcharged me 3 times, then had to go back once I explained the details. I brought it in for an initial problem with the engine. I bought the extended warranty, everything should have been covered. He tried to charge me for that. Once the major work had been completed I got my car back, but the navigation didn't work and there was a rattling under my dashboard. I had to bring the car back into the shop a week later to get those fixed. He tried to charge me $140 to diagnose the issue. When I explained to him there shouldn't be a charge because it was their fault, he looked through his notes and took off the charge. (No apology). They did not give me a loaner car even though both issues were their fault. I paid $40 for UBER to get me back to the dealership. They said the navigation still couldn't be fixed because their main guy was out. I brought it in a few weeks later (7am appointment). Paul once again tried to charge me to diagnose the issue. The guy called in sick, so I had to reschedule again! I had to make another appointment, which Paul said he would call me. A month later I had to call because Paul never called. I spoke to another person and made an immediate appointment. I spoke with another salesman who said they would look into the issue. After waiting 30 minutes, Paul came over and said they don't know what's wrong and they need to call Mazda. He wanted to charge me another $145 for diagnostics and said it would take at least 4-5 hours to figure out the issue. I told him to go xxxx off and give me my car back. I wouldn't give them a dime because he tried to charge me 4 different times and never got back to me about anything. This entire process lasted over 6 months. FIRE Paul!

When I said something the service writer said sorry it was under a tree when your drive the dirt will blow off and ran back inside. When I got into my car it was filthy, there was no respect for my vehicle. I couldn’t stay and deal with the issue because of time constraint, however I called them on my way home only to be on hold by service department. I called back and just told the receptionist to have them call me when they are free. Once at home I went over to passenger side opened my door and my seat was never put back together the plastic pieces were just left on the side of it between the door. I also hate a chip of paint on the door handle. Even more furious I called back again and they were still too busy to discuss the issue.

53438,30-Nov-18,"I brought in my Mazda 3 for a check engine light on a Saturday, and was told that they were closed Sunday so they would start work on Monday. “Fine”, I thought, thanking them and taking the complimentary lyft back to my apartment. “Couple days without the car, I’ll just bike places.”

From this, though, we spiral downward. Monday slides by without a single call, voicemail, email, or text message. I call after getting off work. “Oh didn’t you get my phone calls?” Nope, I didn’t. “Oh we’re having an IT issue.” 

This, I can only assume, means that the issue is they didn’t do IT (pun very much intended). But we press forward. “We did the diagnostic and it’s a recording issue, the technician said the test drive was fine so we’ll finish it tomorrow.” Oh, fantastic, price doesn’t seem out of hand, great I can pick it up tomorrow at 2.

Tuesday rolls around. No phone calls, no nothing. 2 comes and I call them. Again. A new rep picks up the phone. “Your rep isn’t in today, so we’re going to do the diagnostic today and it should be ready for pickup tomorrow.”

Excuse me what? I could’ve sworn we just did this. Now, slightly worrying I’m trapped in a Groundhog Day situation, I ask what he means. “Oh I don’t know, it’s not my file so I’m not sure what is being done on it.” I mean, sure, but how about we don’t tell the customer that we have no idea what’s going on.

“We’ll give you a courtesy car though.” Fine, whatever, I just want my car back. I go to pick up the car after I get off work, and meet rep 2. He begins sassing me for not having my insurance on me, since like a normal person I keep it in my car, especially when I don’t have a thought that I’m going to need to get a courtesy car. Huffing and puffing he helps me get the courtesy car.

Now we hit Thursday through Monday, where we have nothing but silence. So I call. Again. Rep 1 is back. “Didn’t you get my calls?”
Yeah, you didn’t call me. At all. “So the issue wasn’t the issue, and the technician says that he didn’t actually do the test drive. But he isn’t comfortable doing it until you replace your wheel bearings, so $900 and then we can try to fix the problem. But don’t worry, we took the price of fixing the not issue off the bill.”

What. The. Absolute. H.E.L.L (edit: I guess the swear filter decided to pick this up. Funny, I thought I was self censoring this.)

Now we get to me being angry. “You’re telling me that not only do you not know what’s wrong with my car after having it for a week, but now to find out I have to spend almost a thousand dollars before you’ll even do it? And on top of that, the technician who is working on my car and telling you things is lying about the work he’s doing on my car?”

“Oh, yeah, that sounds bad...”

Now I have to speak to the manager. I used to work customer service, I hate being the “let me speak to the manager” guy. And these idiots are making me do this.

“What’s the problem sir?” Insert almost verbatim repetition of above comment. “I’m just as angry as you are sir.” No you aren’t, but I’ve been there you’re saying the same things you’re supposed to. “I’ll have my foreman look at it. But he isn’t in today.” Of-flipping-course he isn’t. “But I’ll call you with information tomorrow morning.”

Uh huh.

Tuesday morning, no phone call. No nothing. 11:30, I get a text. “We’re working on the diagnostic now.” Isn’t it funny how now the wheel bearings aren’t a problem? “I’ll give you a call in a couple hours with the results.”

Uh huh.

That night I get another text message (see: things that aren’t phone calls). “Issue resolved, we are going to make sure it’s fixed but the car will be ready tomorrow.” I ask when I can expect his phone call. “10 am.”

Uh huh.

Wednesday morning comes and goes, and now it’s later in the day. My phone rings. It’s Rep 1! “Your car is ready for pickup, total bill is $240.” Isn’t that just fan-freaking-tactic?

I get off work, I get to the dealership. It’s close to closing, and Rep 1 says “didn’t think you’d be coming in!” 

The last of my brain cells slowly seep out my skull as I struggle to say “yeah I had work, and your call was later than I expected.”

Rep 1 doesn’t notice any of my popped blood vessels, and keeps going. “As I was getting the paperwork together I noticed how bad it all looks. So we knocked it down to $140. But hey, we gave you the same estimate to fix the wheel bearings if you want to come back!

I pay. I get my car. I leave. The words “as I looking at the paperwork I noticed how bad it all looks” ring in my head. They haunt my dreams.

I give this dealership a 1 out of 100, as in “Give me 1 good reason to ever come back to this terrible excuse for a Mazda dealership.”",6,69,-1
53490,16-Oct-18,"I normally work with Christian @ the Mazda Maita, but he was out the day I needed my car serviced. Two odd alerts continued popping up in my dash, two of which the manual said were emergent issues and to be serviced immediately. After the 3rd time this occurred in my vehicle, I decided to bring it into the dealership. Paul, whom I have never worked with, vaguely explained the situation and did not guarantee a fix as this wasn't a consistent occurrence. He said if it takes longer than 10 minutes to isolate the issue, that he would indeed need to charge me $145 for the labor. (10 minutes of ""looking"" = $145). I then asked him then what would I need to do to make sure that these lights didn't pop up again? Paul said I would need to just bring the car back in. I told him I would take a loaner car as his next availabe appointment was @ 715am the following day. I get into the loaner car; there is less than a quarter tank left and the car is dirty with past passenger trash in the vehicle. I figured the less than quarter tank would at least get me to and fro the dealership to home to work back to the dealership. No, not enough so I fill the tank with $15. I get off work expecting my car to be done as my appointment was at 715am. It is 2pm and I am approaching the dealership. Paul answers the phone and says the car has not even been worked on as my battery died the night before? The night before? If the battery died the night before (unbeliavable as my full car check up said my battery life was good), why didn't he call me the NIGHT before? Why did he wait until i called him to PICK UP MY CAR? I had explained to him the night before that i would not have any service as work as I work in a hospital, so that anything that needed to be discussed needed to be doneso the night of or early morning before. Paul said he called 4 times and left 1 message. I did not have service. Calling did nothing. So because my battery died he had to wait to isolate the issue and look into my car. I was frustrated and explained to him that because of this, I now needed to fill up the tank with an additional $10 to just get back home and back and that with this I needed to purchase a $150 battery. My total spent on this car BECAUSE the lack of communication and lack of professionalism cost me over $300. THe issue? The battery was ""dead"". So now apparently all the emergency lights are fixed and they still charged me the ""service charge of $145"" because it probably took barely over that 10 minute mark where if it took longer than 10 minutes, they still charge. Paul wasn't there the day i picked up my car, so i explained to christian my frustration. he apologized, yet still did nothing about reimbursing me for the gas that i had to pay for. Paul explained that some passengers don't filll up the tank so that is why the gas was so low. ...So I have to pay for other drivers gas?? A $35 worth of gas? Unbelievable. I really enjoyed coming to Maita Mazda for my car services, but I am positive I was overcharged hundreds of dollars and also positive that they have no regard for the customers as they did not apologize or reimburse me for the gas of other car loaners.

The manager would not honor the quote either, even though when we were texting, she mentioned the sales manager was right there with her. They tried to brush it off as a misunderstanding or a mistake, even though they confirmed multiple times that they could do that price with 0% financing. Either salesperson A was lying to me, or she was grossly negligent in reading her potential customer's requests. I wasted my afternoon driving to the dealer and talking with them. Horrible experience, and would never do business with Maita Mazda again.",6,69,221
53797,11-Jul-17,"I was given a pleasant and easy sales experience at Maita Subaru, my salesperson was Taylor Klisiewicz. Unfortunately a few days after taking this lightly used vehicle home I noticed that the stereo control panel was unresponsive, none of the buttons responded to being pushed and I was unable to change the radio or select a different audio source. I immediately called the dealership and was told to call back to schedule an appointment (I live in SF, the dealer is in Sac). A few hours later I got back in the vehicle but this time the control panel worked, being optimistic and not wanting to spend a whole day driving out to Sacramento I called the dealer back and said that I thought it was working again. The issue persisted into the next few days and I decided to just bite the bullet and go back to have it fixed. I called Taylor directly and explained the situation, after going back and forth with mechanics and various others at the dealership it was decided that because i didn't buy the $1,200 extended warranty they would not be able to help me. Essentially the dealer had sold me a poor product and was refusing to stand behind it and fix the situation. I expressed my dissatisfaction to Taylor and he said he would get me in contact with someone else at the dealership. After not hearing from anyone for a few days I sent him a text message with no response and wrote an email to the dealership (also no response). I highly recommend that anyone considering Maita save themselves the trouble and buy from someone else. The feeling of forking over 16k to a business and then having them refuse to even fix your radio a few days later is not one i'd wish upon anyone. Happy car hunting!",6,69,-1
53881,15-May-16,"I was referred to Maita Mazda via the Costco Auto Buying portal.  Although I was contacted shortly upon submitting my inquiry, the people who reached out to me were none of the folks listed in the email confirmation from Costco.  One identified themself as the ""Costco Director"" while the other, although claiming to be a Costco sales rep for the dealership, seemed to be part of the regular sales consultants.

Later that morning, I decided to go by Maita Mazda since I could get an oil change while I was there, and check in with their Costco director.  I did check-in with my contact.  We weren't interested in a test drive that day since we knew what we wanted, and unfortunately, there was nothing on the lot that interested us.  I told my contact what I wanted to see if I can get a Costco dealsheet.  I was told since they didn't have anything in stock, they couldn't produce one, but basically the Costco deal is $500 off invoice.  Unless you are getting a car in high demand, you can get $500 off invoice if you sneeze at a car lot, so I was surprised at how underwhelming the Costco deal seems as portrayed by the staff.  I had previously purchased a Mazda 2 year ago through Costco at a dealership in Roseville and knew from the deal, the Costco price was so good I bought the car on the spot.

While I was there waiting for my car to finish its service, another roving sales person approached me.  I told him I was just there for a service, and he flippantly said something like ""fine, I'll buy it back for a trade-in.""  I am perfectly happy with the current Mazda and didn't appreciate the hardsell.  I told him I was already working with the internet department to make him go away.

Before I left the dealership, I let my contact in the internet department know that I am interested in obtaining one if they can get it or get more in their inventory.  The next day, the other sales person who originally emailed me called again to see if I was coming in and I told him I was already there yesterday.  He tried to get me back in the dealership again, but I made it clear that because of work and family obligations, I didn't plan to drive out their from Davis just to chitchat.  If they had my car, then fine, otherwise, it would not be a good use of my time.

But over the next few days, this guy kept calling and emailing me, which eventually led to him texting me.  I contacted my internet rep to let them know that I'm fine working with either them or this other sales guy, but they need to figure it out who's to be my point of contact.  Again, I emphasized what I was looking for and asked to be notified if they get that or more stock for me to consider.

In case the Costco deal was truly underwhelming and not just a misrepresentation or poor representation of the savings by the dealership, I decided to try another online car buying portal called TrueCar.

Through TrueCar, I was networked to the Mazda dealership in Elk Grove.  I reached out to them by email on a Monday morning, and casually exchanged emails with their General Sales Manager throughout the day.  It was low key and no pressure whatsoever to get me out to their dealership.  Using the Mazda USA website, I thought they had a similar vehicle to what I was looking for, but when I asked, they told me it was their error and that vehicle was unavailable.  I told the sales manager what I wanted, and within the hour he responded to tell me it was available in the region, and he can get it transferred to Elk Grove by the next day.  Without even committing to the transfer, the sales manager was willing to explain to me the TrueCar deal and break down the costs for me.  I confirmed that the deal being offered would be for the vehicle that wasn't even on their lot yet, and was told yes.  When I agreed to the fair price (which I was able to confirm beforehand through other sources), Mazda of Elk Grove was able to transfer the car the same day and arrange for a pickup for me the next day to finish the deal.

This was a deal that could have potentially been done through Maita, but because they seemed wishy washy and was more focused on getting me back on the lot rather than working with me online to make the deal happen at a fair price, they turned me off with their overbearing nature and hardsell practices and drove me into the waiting arms of Mazda of Elk Grove.

I had been researching on new compact and midsize cars for a couple of months and decided to get a mazda. I test drove a few cars at a couple of dealerships and decided to go with Maita Mazda, Sacramento. The salesperson, one Mr. John Reid, was not at all responsive and seemed so uninterested in selling the car. 

I finally got an appointment from this person to complete the purchase process and he said he would be there. On the day of the appointment, after I left for the dealership, he ""texts"" me saying that he may not be able to make it. I couldn't believe that a salesperson can be so irresponsible failing to provide the customer sufficient notice before trying to cancel the appointment. However, he was able to make it and was late to his own appointment. By this time I was a little doubtful about his interest in selling me the car. He was callous in taking my details for the credit application and after an additional wait for about half an hour, came upto me and said the car was gone and that somebody else bought it. This can happen to anyone so I tried to ask if there was a chance for a dealer trade. 
At this point, he started making passive aggressive comments while he was talking to me and my friends saying that I lost a perfectly good deal by being late in making a decision. I ignored it and waited for the dealer trade option.  I felt so unaccommodated at the counter that I wanted to leave . After an hour long wait, he came to me and said mazda doesn't finance people with an immigrant visa. I confirmed this over phone before I made an appointment and he said everything is absolutely fine. It seemed like he was trying to find reasons to send me away..lol! 
He told me it would take him a day to get back to me regarding the financing option. 
I never heard from him again after that. It almost felt like he knew the car was gone but just didn't care to inform me about it. Maybe he thought he could sell another car to me on the spot..I don't know. I DO NOT RECOMMEND this dealership to anyone or at least I advise caution while choosing the salesperson you deal with.

54039,27-Mar-16,"BEWARE. Extremely hostile and confrontational management!

The story:

Set up an appointment with a young female sales associate.
Drove 2 hours in traffic from Studio City to Riverside.
She assured me over the phone that the price of $28,990 could be lowered and negotiated. Told me to come in and talk about it.

When we arrived, sales associate was friendly and courteous.
However, car was not in perfect condition.
It only had 8,000 miles, but had visible scratches, small dents, and scrapes.
Sales associate told us we could easily work on the price with the manager.

As we went on the test drive, sale associate sat in the back seat because she was ""scared"" of the WRX. I'm not sure why she's working in a dealership if she's not able to handle something as simple as this.
Regardless, it wasn't a big deal.

Here comes the good part.
As we come back into the dealer, sales associate went to get the manager to work on the price.
She is seen visibly arguing with the manager. Manager asks why he's needed at all, doesn't seem happy to be pulled over.

The next 10 minutes is the worst I've ever experienced at any dealership.
Manager was rude, dismissive, confrontational, and acted like he was trying to embarrass us. He got up in my face with raised voice, and then proceeded to insinuate that their dealership doesn't negotiate on the sticker price. 

I told him I've never heard of that before, and I've purchased many used vehicles before. Of course, he replied: ""I've bought over 20 cars before."" Demonstrating his utter belief that that somehow matter. 

As the argument got worse, customers walked off disgruntled and absolutely disgusted with the way the staff was handling business.
When I asked him if I could speak to his supervisor, he said that he was the highest boss available. Quite strange with such abysmal customer service.
The manager then yelled at us: ""Get the xxxx out of the dealership"". He later retracted his statement, and stomped off.

Finally, the actual sales manager of the dealership came over and pulled us into the office. We tried to work out a deal, but they refused to honor any price discounts.

TLDR; Sales associate says they can do better than $38,990.
Gets me to come in and make a 4 hour round-trip to Riverside.
Used cars manager is an absolute jerk. 

All three staff members gave me conflicting information regarding the price on the vehicle.

I met with David and he took the deal to the manager and got everything settled and told him I'd be back in a few hours. We came back a few hours later and David was helping another customer on the lot but met with us, walked us to the showroom and handed us off to another salesman, Ahmed, and explained to him to get the paperwork going and that everything was settled. Poor Ahmed must have been having a bad day or maybe it was vengeance against David, but he was seriously not interested in helping us, took forever to ""find the car"" on the computer, then complained to us that the deal wasn't correct because the deal to beat on a competing car was less than the one that was on their lot.

54746,07-Jan-19,"Update of my review:

Although everything that I have written in the below review is correct, the matter has been resolved with the intervention of Larry Puryear, General Manager of DCH Toyota of Simi Valley.

About a week after the review I complained to Mr. Puryear via email about the damage to the moonroof of my car caused by DCH Toyota Service, Simi Valley. The email received no response. But when I sent the same email with pictures of the damaged moonroof to Mr. Puryear via certified mail, I received a call from him. At his suggestion I took the car over directly to him at the Service Center at DCH Toyota.. GM Larry Puryear was very courteous and pleasant. He assured me that the moonroof of my car would be fixed within 2 hours. In fact, it was fixed in half an hour, and now closes perfectly at both ends. 

Why couldn't the service manager, Michael Sheets, have done the same  on January 3 when I brought the issue to his attention? The matter would have stopped right there and there would have been no reason for me to publicly report my dissatisfaction?
*****************

I am very dissatisfied and upset with the Service and Repair section of DCH Toyota of Simi Valley - both with representative who attended to my car and the service manager, Michael Sheets, whom I met later. I've been getting my Camrys serviced at this place for almost 20 years because it is conveniently located. But it appears that the mechanics here cannot repairs. They only do expensive replacements. And, the management encourages this.

On Dec. 28, 2018 I brought in my 2005 Toyota Camry XLE car DCH Service to have only one issue looked at: A few days ago the automatic closing mechanism of the sunroof (moonroof?) of the car had suddenly stopped functioning properly: first it would close smoothly (a perfect fit),  then it bounced back a few inches. To close the moonroof entirely I had to press the button  a little a time  till the roof closed fully. But it did close fully - at both ends - and was a level and complete fit. I thought that the local Toyota place would know how to correct the automatic closing mechanism. The rep who took charge of the car was Juan Carlos. 

When the car was returned to me a five  hours later Juan informed me that they had taken the roof off and had tried to fix the problem but they could not fix it. I was charged $135 for this ""looking"" at the problem. He told me that the only option was to replace the roof for $2000. Since the car is old, and I didn't want to put that much money into a cosmetic feature, I asked Juan Carlos to have the roof put back as before - fully closed - and do no work on the car. I asked that the moonroof be fully closed as before, but otherwise did not need a new moonroof. (I had already test driven 2018 Camry XLEs at the dealership section of DCH Toyota of Simi Valley, but had decided to wait for the 2019 models, or an Avalon or even a Lexus.)

Although the DCH mechanics couldn't fix the problem that I asked them to help me with,  Juan Carlos cheerfully provided me with an unsolicited  list of suggested repairs and replacements, and another inspection for another $135. I was disappointed that they couldn't fix the automatic closing mechanism, but did not any further work done on that visit.
. 
Later, as I drove back I could hear the wind from the moonroof, but from inside the car I could see that the front of the sunroof was closed. It was later that I realized the wind was coming from the rear of the roof. The sunroof was now warped and while the front of the moonroof was in place, the rear end was lifted an inch higher than the roof of the car.. 

I got an appointment with the service manager, Michael Sheets, on the morning of 1/3. I explained to Sheets what had happened. All I wanted was to have the moonroof of the car closed back to a fully closed position - as it had been when I brought the car to DCH to have them to see why the moonroof would not close on its own. Sheets had a mechanic look at the moonroof for 5 minutes, and then gave me back my car keys saying that they couldn't put the moonroof back in its original position. He said that if they tried to fix the problem I would have to take the glass of the moonroof back in the trunk of my car - and no roof on the top of the car. My only option, according to Mr. Sheets, was to get a new moonroof for $2000.

I love the ride and reliability of Toyota Camrys. My current car is my third Camry - and I've been happy with all my Camrys. I'm not dissatisfied with the car. I am just dissatisfied with the quality of workmanship and customer service of the Simi DCH Toyota. This place has a legal responsibility to straighten the moonroof of my car - and seal it  to the clsosed position, if necessary. So far, I have received very poor customer service and poor workmanship, and it is my opinion that the reason for this lies in poor management policies.",6,71,-1

54879,19-Nov-16,"In September, my husband and I went to Simi Valley Toyota to look at a 2015 GMC Sierra, black that we saw in the internet. The truck looked nice, and that's what caught our eyes. It was $32,000, with 27,000 miles. We get there after a 1.5 hour drive, see the truck from the outside, get out to look at it. We had to stay there looking st it, going inside it, and my husband pops open the hood to look at it. No one comes out to see if we needed help to look at it. We go inside, I ask for the internet team and my husband gives his name, and this guy acts like he didn't know he emailed us about the truck. Then he took us out to look at it, and he acted like he didn't know nothing about it. Then we asked if we could talk to the manager about lowering the price. Then this heavy set Hispanic guy comes out, with a bad attitude tells my husband to close the hood, then he says if we want to test drive it. So my husband test drove the truck. The handle to the drivers side had black duct tape on it, and he said that's the way it looks, it was already like that. Then he drove the truck, we liked it, went inside to try to negotiate a deal. We said we have excellent credit. We have 820 credit rating, and 6,000 cash to put down. We wanted a comfortable payment of 400 a month, and this guy told us we had to put $10,000 down for a payment of 400 a month;). We told him with a credit of 820, he didn't even want to hear about the credit, he was acting like we didn't have credit, and that we had to put that huge down payment on a used 2015 GMC.  lol, that is for some one who don't have credit, we looked at him and said that was ridiculous. This company is a joke, A person with 820 credit should not have to put $10000 for a down payment on a used 2015 truck. We didn't even put that huge amount on our house. Toyota of Simivalley has bad service, a bad manager, lazy car salesmen that don't want to help you, and act like they don't remember your name when you ask for the internet department. We would definitely not recommend this place to buy a truck, used or new. BAD SERVICE ALL THE WAY!!!!!!",6,71,-1
54904,08-Jun-16,"Brought my Camry in for some ""recall"" work, and asked them to check out an intermittent power window on front passenger side.  It would get stuck in the down position, but eventually go up after several pulls on the window switch. They said it would cost $125 to troubleshoot and do the estimate, that $125 can be used towards the repair cost. The estimate to replace the window motor was $706 ($392 for part and $315 for labor). I thought this was high, but agreed. After that work was done, I then received a call saying that the technician thinks that the motor failed because of a fault of the ""Master Switch"" . He also stated that if the Master switch is not replaced they would not warranty the original work, and I would be back at square one. The cost for the Master Switch was quoted at $430. So now they had me in a precarious position. I felt as if I was being extorted.   I was in too deep to take a chance and walk away with no guarantee on the work already paid for, so I reluctantly agreed. Total cost to fix an intermittent window was about $1,100. Does that sound reasonable? Sorry, not to me. I did some research on the same OEM parts they used, same part number, build to same spec, same part. Turns out the Motor assembly they charged me $391 for, I could get (online/Rockauto.com) for $75, and the $430 master switch I could get for $155.  So, they charged me over $800 for $230 worth of parts. I understand a ""dealer mark-up"", but a 350% markup cannot possibly be justified in my book. Or, is this just a case of the Service Personnel pushing unnecessary labor and overly inflated part prices to reap in greater commissions?  I own 2 Camry's, one was purchased at this dealership. Needless to say, I will not be returning for a new car, nor will I let them perform any repairs or maintenance of my vehicles.  I am even considering not going back for warranty service.  Shame on me for not doing my homework earlier and listening to my instincts. Shame on them for threatening no warranty unless additional repairs were done (whether they were needed or not), and marking up part prices to ridiculous levels. $1,100 to fix an intermittent window, really? This is a Toyota not a Ferrari!!!!  Bottom line, beware of their service department and verify/validate what they are trying to sell you. Question everything!",6,71,403
54912,19-Mar-16,"Never take your car here for servicing. At a recent oil change, they gave me a laundry list of things wrong with my vehicle. It was the exact same list they gave me at my previous oil change three months ago and I got everything fixed from my local mechanic! Upon receiving the same list again, I took my mechanic to toyota and asked them to show me and the mechanic all those issues they had listed. Turns out they made a mistake; everything had been fixed.

54915,29-Jan-16,"By far the worst car buying experience I have ever had. My wife and I have been looking for a used Prius for some time and found a great deal on one with very low miles. Che, our sales rep was very responsive and even texted me in the morning to let me know the car was still there since we were driving almost 200 miles up from San Diego. Che was the only trustworthy person we spoke with and the reason for the one star, otherwise they don't deserve any stars. After a test drive we sat down to go over the numbers. Everything was fine up to this point. Omar the manager came out. He came off as the typical used car salesman and my wife and I both didn't trust him. After agreeing on a price we met with Ron. Ron was extremely unprofessional. I understand that trying to sell the gap coverage and extended warranty is his job but the blatant lies and scare tactics were ridiculous . First he tried to convince my wife that our banks financing would have a cap on the gap coverage and we would be screwed, complete lie. Then he went into how expensive repairs would be and that since these cars are so new no mechanics would touch them and parts were extremely expensive. We kindly declined but he would not let up. He went on to explain if the key was $550 just imagine how much the parts are going to cost. It was amazing how unreliable he was making the car sound. If I hadn't done my due diligence  on researching the reliability of the Prius plus the extensive track record my wife and I have had with previous Toyotas, I would have walked out. I would expect this kind of sleazy car sales tactics from a used car lot on the corner but not a reputable Toyota dealership. If it was not for the car being exactly what my wife wanted at a reasonable price, with such low miles, I would have never done business  with this establishment.",6,71,136

54921,14-Oct-15,"I purchased a truck there and took it for service because it's free for so many months. My son needed an oil change so I suggested he go there and he also asked them to check the A/C and a check engine light. They gave him a $3000 estimate on a 1997 car that might be worth $1500. So he declined and just wanted the oil change so they hit him up with a bill over $300 . I called and asked what was up with this and she said that's what the inspection cost. They also said the car had "" major "" oil leak. The car parks on my driveway and I see no oil leakage. I told her that this was outrageous and she never flinched , that's  what it is and she wouldn't consider giving a potential future customer a break. Well I nor my family will Ever spend another penny at DHC Toyota Simi Valley.  And I will tell everyone I know how they treat customers and not to go there. My son is a young college student that works part time and is saving for a new car , well he won't be getting it there. They scam a young kid and when you call them on it they couldn't care less. Well they made $300  today but in the long run they lost money. I still have free service but I will pay for it elsewhere before I would go there again. ",6,71,6
54925,04-Jul-15,"Purchased a vehicle on 6/15/15 that included a trade-in; dealer sold the trade without paying me and continues to withhold funds citing an internal policy.

Dealer paid the loan balance on the trade but has yet to deliver the additional $7,212 equity payment to me personally. After repeated demands for payment, dealer cites internal policy preventing them from releasing the equity payment until a paper title is received from my bank.  Yet DCH is fully aware that the bank electronically released the lien and title through California DMV's Electronic Lien and Title Program on 6/23/15. No paper title is then necessary for the vehicle to be transferred to a new owner by the dealer, nor will a paper title be issued by the bank, as it can only come from the DMV by specific request from the dealer, if dealer so requires.  DCH is aware of this, as well.

So aware that the dealer has in-fact sold the trade vehicle already and is STILL withholding my equity funds.

This is in direct violation of CVC 11709.4(4), prohibiting the dealer to sell, consign for sale, or transfer any ownership interest in the vehicle until all balances are paid. They are in further violation of CVC 11709.4(1) by not agreeing to pay my equity funds within 21 days (7/5/15).

If this claimed internal policy is correct, this appears to be a deliberate business practice for unjust enrichment by withholding of funds that should have otherwise been released, thus saving the dealer interest expense from drawing down their credit lines to actually pay funds their customers are owed.

DCH Auto Group is a finely tuned machine for maximizing profits, and so be it, in a capitalist world.  But they should at least be held to the minimum standards of the law.

If you are going to trade, I recommend demanding a payment time-frame be included in the contract for the pay-off.  Any claim of risk about not receiving title is void as they will have not only possession but they are also only giving you wholesale value for the vehicle. (zero risk to DCH).  Negotiate accordingly or simply trade elsewhere",6,71,0

We just sell cars....""...Every ones attitude was terrible like you were in their way and had no time for you. No general customer service abilities at all. Even the General manager made me wait like 10 minutes before deciding to talk to me and then he just said ""I heard your conversation already so you know how to take care of this..."" and he walked away.

54927,15-May-15,"I have purchased 3 cars from this dealership in past 15+ years and have always had a good experience.  I also have brought all my Toyotas (4) in for service in the same timeframe.  For many years, I had always felt that the Service Department had integrity.  While Mike Powell was a Service Advisor and then Manager, he always made me feel that whatever service being recommended was actually needed and the service was completed accurately and professionally.  Ever since he left, I never felt the same.  Now when I bring my car in for service, I feel as though I am being recommended service that isn't needed and have to question everything.  My last service on April 22-23, 2015 proved my fears.  I brought my car in for an oil change.  After waiting approx. 2 hours, the Service Advisor, Amanda Robinson, greets me with a list of ""require immediate attention"" service items totaling $912 plus a warranty issue that needed to be fixed.  These services included: Brake Flush, Manual Transmission Fluid Change, Battery Replacement, Fuel Injection Cleaning Service, Water Pump, and  the usual cabin and engine air filters. After the shock wore off, I made the appointment the next day for the warranted water pump service and told her I would let her know about the other items.  I went home and reviewed my previous service records and to my dismay, I determined that I just had my brakes flushed at the last service and it had only been 10,000 miles since that service was performed.  The cabin and air filters had also been replaced previously.   When I brought the brake flush service to Amanda's attention she was surprised and admitted that she did not review my service history.  As a result of that admission, I questioned the validity of the other recommended services such as the transmission fluid change.  I asked her what should the oil look like to determine if it is dirty.  She didn't know.  She called up the mechanic that had worked on my car and he said purple but couldn't show it to me because it had to be raised in a stall.  Since my car required warranty service, it had to be sent to the main service area for Pat Schulps, Master Technician to oversee.  Amanda had me brought over to that location to speak with Pat about the service issues.  They had the car up in the stall and the technician showed me the transmission oil and yes, it did appear dirty since the color of transmission oil is actually like a clear gold not the purple that the original mechanic stated.  So that service appeared to be needed, even though the original mechanic and the service advisor had no idea what the oil was suppose to look like.  I then proceeded to ask Pat about the other items.  Looking at the air filters they were only slightly dirty and could easily be cleaned by an air compressor. On the battery, there was a little bit of acid corrosion.  The technician cleaned it and retested the battery.  The result was:  Good & Pass; state of health 94% & state of charge 100%.  The test printout from the previous day showed Bad & Replace with a 62% & 71%. Finding that to be odd, I reviewed and compared both printouts and noticed that the ""bad"" test had a test date on 4/7/2002 on it with different volts and ratings on it.  So either the first test was performed on an outdated machine or they have some old printouts that they use to ""trick"" the customer???  Needless to say, I don't need a new battery.  Pat did mentioned to keep an eye on the battery if the corrosion occurs again.  The fuel injection service was not necessary as well.

This service was the worst.  I waited 2 weeks to write this review hoping to calm down from the experience.  I am amazed that DCH Toyota, Simi Valley would hire and retain service advisors that have no mechanical knowledge and mechanics that just want to check the box.  I have spoken to other people who have had similar issues with the service department.  While I give the service department an ""F"", I do want to thank Pat Schulps for his willingness to go over my service issues and handle them personally.  He may be the only ""good one"" left. Just by reviewing previous reviews on this site you can see that when Mike Powell left the 5 star review diminished.  That should be a red flag for top management!!!!",6,71,138

I was ""HELPED"" by a couple of DCH Toyota's Simi Valley finest today! AMANDA and PATTY. By far the worst experience I have has at any service center. I made an appointment for 12pm and told Patty over the phone that I had a competitors couple. She said that they would allow it. So, I arrived at the appointment time and AMANDA told me the stopped  taking coupons. When I informed Amanda that I called and got approval for the coupon by PATTY she said that there is nothing she can do. I was there and in order to salvage the rest of the day I reluctantly agreed to their higher price. After three hours to do simple oil change I got my car and drove off. Then I noticed my car was leaking oil. I took it back and waited another 2 hours for the problem. They said the oil pan nut was not put on correctly and they wanted $300 to change it out!

55123,08-Sep-12,"Took car in for oil change and tire rotation on my van.  Was called and told there was a recall on the rear gate lift system that needed to be performed.  This rear gate has never malfunctioned in the 7 years I've owned the van.  Now rear hatch won't close at all and I was left stranded at VONS with groceries in the van and the rear hatch unable to close.  I requested to have the car fixed at another Toyota dealership due to previous issues by this dealership, such as them selling me and installing the wrong sized tires on my car that wore out in a year and they admitted they sold me the wrong tires.  Not enough room here to list all the issues we've had with this dealership over the past 7 years. The Service Manager has informed me that he can not help me accomplish getting repairs done at Thousand Oaks Toyota and I have to make all the phone calls myself.  I never wanted to be an employee of Toyota, but I am sure having to put in hours of my own time getting my van repaired after they installed struts that are not supported by the motor. I was informed by Simi Valley Toyota Customer Service person named Crystal that this has happened to at least 9 of the vans on this recall at the Simi Valley Dealership. Why I had to hear that from her and not the service manager is because the service manager said he was unaware of this.  It is his job to be aware of this information.  He also would not guarantee the work on my van if I brought it back to them, stating, ""Anything can happen"" when I asked him what if I bring my van back to you and more things go wrong?  Not what a customer needs to hear. A customer needs to hear, ""I am so sorry that this has happened to your van.  It has happened before with this recall and we know how to fix it.  We will have your van back to you in a timely manner and have full confidence that we can fix the problem that was created when we did the recall.""  Greg did not have his facts straight when he said to me that I had called to have the recall performed.  All he had to do was check what I wrote on my night drop box envelope for type of service to be performed. It stated, ""Oil Change and Tire Rotation.""  We were never notified of a recall prior to bringing the van in for the aforementioned service and certainly did not request it.  When I tried explaining this to the service manager, he started harrassing me, and telling me that I must be a very unhappy person who always needs to be right to keep going on like this.  Well Greg, when you don't have your facts straight, and keep talking over me, I am going to keep telling you what the facts are and if you can't handle the truth then I need to speak to your boss. When I asked for the name of Greg's boss, he told me that it is a corporation and I'd have to look it up!  He then started rambling some very unpleasant, harrassing statements that I do not wish to post here and I told him I was done with him and would be hanging up. Stay away from this dealership.

55782,11-Mar-11,"I was interested in a Toyota Prius that was priced at $17991 at a DCH Honda dealership in Lemon Grove, CA. Christian, the salesperson, had originally  brought this vehicle to my attention and showed me the stats on the vehicle and said he could get it to the dealership in Simi Valley easily because they were sister dealerships through DCH. I noticed that it was coming from a Honda dealership, not Toyota, so I specifically asked if this car was certified and had the certified warranty. He replied ""yes absolutely they all are."" I went home that night to sleep on it and decided to look at the car on the Lemon Grove website, the price at that time was $17991 on the website. The next morning I decided to look at the website again and the price had been reduced to $14995. I immediately called Christian and told him that the price had been dropped and that I was interested in buying it. He was very surprised that the other dealer had lowered the price and expressed that he thought it was a mistake. He called the Lemon Grove dealership and confirmed that the price was indeed CORRECT, he then told me that he would not be able to offer me the vehicle at $14995 because it still needed to be certified. When I asked why he had told me the vehicle was certified when it was NOT he claimed he didn't know that it was coming from a Honda dealer. I don't believe that was true because he was the one that explained that it was a sister dealership the day before. So I asked him what price they could offer and he told me that the total certification and ""shipping costs"" (he had not mentioned shipping costs before this) would bring the price back up to $17995. (Hmmm convenient). I obviously was not happy with being lied to and made that clear to him. I was seriously contemplating making the drive to Lemon Grove to purchase the car there and just buy an extended warranty through them. He told me he would have his manager call me to see what they could do. A few hours later I got a call from Nick the general manager at Simi Toyota. He told me that they would be willing to offer me the car at the price the Lemon Grove dealership was offering, which he said was $15995. When I told him the website advertised it at $14995 he told me to check the website again, because what he was seeing was $15995. I happened to have the webpage already up on my computer and refreshed the screen, they had changed the price from $14995 to $15995. I felt a bit like I was being duped, but still thought that $15995 was a fair price for the car with the certified warranty, so I asked him to have it shipped to Simi. I went down the next day to test drive and really liked the car. I worked with Nick that day and felt he was more honest and straight forward than Christian was. I went home feeling good about the car and told him that I would be back with my fiance the next day, to have him test drive it. Nick had told me that I would be working with Christian the next day because he would not be in. I was a bit worried about this. We came in the next day and my fiance inspected the car. He immediately brought to my attention that there was significant wear on the front tires and they would need to be replaced very soon. When I mentioned this to Christian he said he wasn't sure if they would be able to put new front tires on because the ""deal"" that we had worked out was with Nick and not him and he would not be able to change it. (I was thinking, didn't this car go through a certified warranty inspection, shouldn't this have been caught??) Nick had told me the day prior if we had any problems to give him a call. So I asked Christian to call him to see what could be done. He called Nick then handed me the phone telling Nick I needed to talk to him about something. (we were still in the middle of the test drive, I was in the passenger seat). I explained to Nick the problem with the tires and he told me to tell Christian to have their mechanic look at it. I relayed this message to Christian. It turns out that the service department was closed that day and I would have to come back another day to have them measure the wear on the tires to make sure that it was above the certified standards of 5/32"". A little frustrating when the car should have gone through an inspection and they should have already measured this. Also at the beginning of the test drive I had noticed that the low tire pressure warning light was on and asked Christian about this. (Again, this car supposedly went through a certified inspection, shouldn't this have been caught??) He assured me that it was just the weather that caused this and it was normal. Suffice it to say, I had my doubts. The light ended up staying on all day, and it was a nice sunny day, not freezing cold. Another thing that happened at the beginning of the test drive the day before--when Christian went to demonstrate the smart key door sensor, it did not work. He told me that the keys just needed to be reset, and this was an easy fix. (Again, shouldn't this have been caught??) When I came in the next day with my fiance he told me that the keys actually didn't work and I would be getting a ""brand new set."" (exact words) What I was actually given was one used key (that started the car and locked/unlocked it but did not work with the door sensor) and one new key (that didn't work at all). He then told me to get them reprogrammed I would need to go to a dealership in Oxnard because they do not charge the dealership for the reset fee. I asked him why I was getting one new key and one used key when I was told I was going to get ""a brand new set"", I felt I should be getting 2 brand new keys to make a ""set"". He replied that Nick was already giving me a good deal and I should be happy. (Ummmm ok.) I explained that the way he worded the expression of ""a set of brand new keys"" was misleading. Ultimately in the end I bought the car with the promise that 1.)They would check the tires to see if they needed replacing, 2.)They would check the tire pressure when service was open on Monday 3.)I would be driving to Oxnard to get my keys reprogrammed. When I came in on Monday to get the tires checked, the mechanic measured them and indeed said they were below the certified standards. (Did this car go through an inspection at all?) They needed to order the tires and I would have to come back when they came in, also at that time they would check the tire pressure warning light. Nick said they would be calling me when they found out when the tires would be in and also to give me the information about who to see at the Oxnard dealership to get my keys reprogrammed. When it reached Friday and I still had not received a call I called Nick to find out if the tires had come in. He apologized for not calling me, and told me the tires would be in the next day and I should come in the next Monday to drop my car off to get the tires put on. He also said that they would be reprogramming the keys at their dealership after all. (I guess whatever deal that Oxnard was giving them was not available anymore?) I was happy to not have to drive out to Oxnard and thought that it should have been planned this way all along. I dropped my car off that Monday and they gave me a ride to work and picked me up at the end of the day. I was happy to see that the tires were on, the pressure warning light was off and both keys worked. When working with Nick I felt that he listened to me and did his best to accommodate my requests. When working with Christian I felt he would say anything to get me to buy a car, regardless of whether it was the truth or not. I don't feel like Christian listens to his customers questions or thinks before he answers, he just says whatever he thinks you want to hear. Also he touches you on the arm frequently like you are best friends, which can be a bit off-putting. I prefer a bit more professional approach. I also got a call from him today AT MY PLACE OF WORK following up and asking when I was going to write this review. How he got this number I do not know, because I am actually at a different office today than I am normally at and I did not put this office number on my application. The number that I gave him to contact me was my cell phone. He did not call my cell phone, he somehow called here, interrupted my exam with a patient that I had at that time on an extremely busy morning, just to ask if I was planning to fill out this review. I found this very inappropriate. Ultimately I am happy I bought my car, I do love it. I also feel I received a generally fair price in the end. I felt like I had to fight tooth and nail to get that price in the end, and it was a bigger ordeal than it should have been. I felt like I had to watch over every little detail of the purchase to make sure I was not getting screwed out of money because I could never really trust what I was being told. I am also concerned with the certified ""inspection"" process that the cars go through at this dealership.",6,72,61

56181,22-Sep-09,"DCH Toyota of Simi Valley, is such a nice dealership and also very customer friendly.  They really worked with me and got me the car I wanted (2010 Prius) without any hassle or deception.  I prefer this dealership over every other one I've been to beacause their customer service is amazing.  They really don't want or even need to scam you, they just want you to be happy and thats something you can't say about other dealerships such as First Honda of Simi Valley who wants to just make themselves happy (I know from experience).  Best of all, even after you get your car they are always there to answer any questions and they even sat down with me and helped me get accustomed to where things were and how to work my vehicleS. So thank you to Jeff Q., Dan, and Jason you made my experience wonderful and I love my new car.

He made us feel comfortable without the guilt. He was suggestive with sound rationales and insight into considerations we hadn't thought of. In the end we came out with the deal we needed to fit the budget in addition to the car for the family we needed. The Sales Manager Danny was excellent in showing us how we could get what we need with the different finance packages without pushing us into a spot we didn't feel comfortable in.

These gentleman were willing to give me time to think and decide while showing me options I had. Do your homework and come in willing to work with the folks here. The days ahead are tough and they know it too. Know what your needs are in terms of length you hang on to cars and the service considerations you may or may not have the capabilities of dealing with inconvenient breakdowns.

Think these thing through and communicate them to the folk here and trust that you can get to a reasonable bottom line.

56213,24-Jun-08,"I wanted to find a prius, and right now with gas prices the way they are who isn't.  I called into Toyota of Simi Valley after checking with other dealerships.  What I had gathered from all the other dealerships was because the prius was so popular they were all marking the car over the sticker price.  The thing was that I called all these other dealerships and asked them if they were marking the car up they all said no.  Then I came into the dealership and they sprung the markup on me.  To say the least I got up and walked out on all of them.  I still wanted a prius so I called Toyota of Simi Valley.  I  asked for sales and got transfered to a man named Russ.  Russ was very friendly and answered all of my questions.  He actally got me excited to come in and see the car.  Before I came in I asked him if they were asking for over the sticker price on the prius.  This is when Russ, not knowing it, earned my buisness.  He told me the truth, something no other dealership had done.  Imagine that.  He told me they were, but also said he wanted to make sure I got the right car for me, and he would be more than happy to present any offer I was willing to make to his sales manager.  After that I knew I had to come in and meet with Russ.  Upon meeting Russ I realized he was a young man..about mid twenties and he told me he had been in the car buisness for about a year.  I went on a test drive and came into talk numbers.  Russ and another salesman by the name of Oleg walked me through the sale, and I actually got the Prius for the price I wanted to Pay.  It was seriously the best experience I have ever had with a car dealership, and I wanted to let erveryone know about it.  So on behalf of my family thank you Russ you were amazing. Also thank you Toyota of Simi Valley.  As long as Russ is there you have a customer for life.",6,72,1107
56214,11-Oct-19,"The worst experience at One Toyota. Brought my 2017 Sequoia in for service and warranty concerns. The vehicle has less than 25000 miles. The drivers leather seat has started to peel apart, shifter knob fake wood grain has rubbed off and the rear seatbelt stopped working. I also had them do an alignment since the vehicle was pulling to the right a little. Service inspection and alignment was down. Inspection came back clear. Everything in good condition especially braking system. The alignment was done and correction was made as well as rotated tires.
They refused to cover some warranty concerns. Said normal wear and tear on the leather seat. I had to contact Toyota warranty myself. As I was on the phone with them they advised me that this is the dealerships responsibility not mine. As I asked to speak with the manager with the Toyota representative on the phone still, I was advised to hang up on the Toyota rep. The foreman was called to the vehicle and was asked by the manager what his opinion was and he said spilled coffee cause the wear on the shift knob. Also the way I sit when I drive is what broke down the leather. Then the foreman changed his mind and said it was the sunscreen I wear that broke down the knob. Excuse after excuse. After getting the run around for a week. The regional Toyota representative contacted me and said they made a decision. The seat will not be warrantied but the knob will. She said it is normal wear and tear on the leather. So I confirmed that it is normal for the quality of leather Toyota uses breaks down quickly. A vehicle that has less than 25000 miles and is 2 years old. She said yes it s not defective but normal. Unbelievable! Luckily they said the knob is covered. The dealership gave me the run around made it difficult to get anything done. The only person that tried and did not lie was my service advisor. The sad part is when I did their survey and was honest about the foreman, overall manage, work done, etc. Which has nothing to do with person to meet first and discuss your car gets dinged because if based on a score of questions and not the comments. This dealership treats its customers poorly. Following the first visit driving the vehicle home when I pressed the brakes the steering wheel began to vibrate back and forth. Never has done that before. So I called one Toyota. They asked me to bring it in to be looked at. They also looked at the rear seatbelt that stopped working. Saying that my kids probably jammed something inside it and that's why it was working. Unreal!!! They cannot force a lie and when they looked at the seatbelt nothing was in it or jammed inside it. So thankfully they are replacing that! I took a video of the steering wheel and asked them what happen. We reviewed the inspection from the week before. Everything was fine and checked out including the road test. On inspection the brakes, rotors, undercarriage was all in good shape. Well today they said I suddenly have hot spots on the rotors and will need them resurfaced and buy new brake pads. 
They would take 50 dollars off though. So a bill around 450. I asked how is this possible. Last week everything was fine. Inspection which I was told is the same one they did again said everything was fine and now today there are hot spots. The vehicle was not doing this prior to them touching my car. One week good inspection, good road test, I am good to go. Now same inspection rotors are bad and need new rotors and brake pads. I placed a phone call into Toyota regional for help. I took the Toyota to Berkeley Toyota and tire pros and asked their opinions. They said the hot spots would and should have been noticed on the first inspection. The vehicle was not driving like this prior to their work and now is. They both agreed I should take it back to one Toyota and have them fix their mistake. I recommend to stay away from one Toyota. Here is the leather and a video of the steering wheel after service at one Toyota",6,72,4
56236,30-Aug-19,"Here is my problem: how is it possible that for a scheduled appointment and a $44 service, one has to wait 4 hours? And this happens repeatedly. How? Everybody on the floor ""seem"" busy, I mean people are really nice there, haven't seen the service shop but judging with how many cars shows up they are busy too. And then when I was leaving, the garage seemed almost empty. So, unless someone explains this to me I'll guess that management is maximizing profits by overbooking in the morning, and certainly over-promising to customers, then pressuring the workers.  This is simply wrong management. What is the point of appointment then?

Btw, I still waited probably 15 minutes once the car was claimed done (10 min since the associate was busy with the other customer, he is working hard, no problem with that), then I had to pay (why not in advance? I agreed to the price already), then I had to wait 5 more minutes for a car to show up. Can't this be streamlined better? Can the car just wait outside? 

And since we are here, bathroom is in a very bad shape (faucets are both leaky to be precise), probably because with so many customers, and 4 hours waiting times for simplest check ups, no wonder it's being used a lot.

I would give 1 star but extra star for employees there. I hope waiting time improves.",6,72,-1

56516,15-Jun-19,"I just bought a used 2015 Prius here 3 days ago. I am a rideshare driver, planning to use this car for that purpose. The car I was originally intending to buy was not as advertised on their website. So I turned to a different option that met the criteria of price, mileage, type (hybrid), and condition.

Like most people, I am not a mechanic. I took the car for the round-the-block test drive, and it seemed okay to my untrained assessor's eye. Or rather, I waited for them to gas up the car first, because there was ZERO GAS IN THE CAR. As in, the range indicator said '0 miles.' THEN, I took it for a test drive and it seemed okay. 

I figured that it would be a fairly good condition, relatively late model car.

So I bought it. Then I took it to Uber for inspection and approval so I could start driving with it.

As you likely already guessed, it failed inspection. The license plate lights were both burned out. They sold me a car that wasn't even street legal.

So I drove right back and talked with Anthony, the guy who sold it to me. I had assumed that they would be mortified at the situation and move me right up to the front of the line in the service department and replace those 2 bulbs immediately so that the car I JUST BOUGHT would be legal to drive.

No such luck. The service advisor told me they were all booked up for the day and that I would have to come back the next day.

Fortunately for me, somebody else came along as I was grumpily walking back to me car to drive away, missing out on a day's worth of driving income because this dealership failed in such a simple task as making sure all the lights work on a car they're selling. He asked me how everything was going, and after I told him, he got me bumped to the front and got the lights fixed.  So that worked out okay in the end. 

The very next day, a headlight went out.  Here it is, day three, and now I am hearing squeaking. Also, the 'Needs Service Soon' light just came on.

These people sold me a car that wasn't street legal when I bought it, had at least one headlight on its last legs, has worn out brake pads, and needs an oil change.

These are not big things for a dealership with an in-house service department to make sure of before they sell a car. Add it into the price and save me the headache of finding these things out afterward and having to deal with them on my own valuable time.

Does any of this seem unreasonable?",6,72,-1

I had an appointment at 9:15 and was early. 2 Cars that were behind were taken before me. and then still had to wait another 20 mins before a tech assisted me. I went in for an oil change and was asked when I wanted my car back. I said 1pm. My tech, James said ok. Although my requested time was not noted on my paperwork. I called around 1:40 since I haven't heard from my tech and James was not available. I spoke to receptionist and was told my car wasnt ready and wouldn't be ready for another hour or so. James called about a little after that to say my car was ready but my brakes needed maintenance. I called him back and asked why I'm just now being told when they have had my car for 4 hours and could have completed the work. In the past this would have happened. I would have gotten a call from my tech within an hour of dropping off saying they found some items that needed maintenance and would I like that taken care of. 
James mentioned that he was in meetings and was able to give me a call about this. Quite honestly, this establishment has gone down hill. The maintenance tech service is horrible and I will not be returning to service my car here anymore nor will I recommend this place.

I’ve had my car for 10 years and he’s by far the worst in customer service Ive experiences. I had to find someone else to check me in & was bounced back & forth to each side of the service areas in the process.

They expect customers to know how to navigate their internal processes without explanation. All the staff thought it was funny, except Denny- he was respectful. Another customer was complaining of similar treatment while I was standing at the desk. I offered the manager feedback & little was done to resolve other than giving me her business card.

After receiving a notice months ago from Toyota that my airbags had been recalled, and ""not to use the front passenger seat."" Then in June I received a notice that I could finally get this replaced.  I called to Dealership to make the appointment, reviewed my VIN and contact information with them to get the airbags changed.  Being that they are so busy it takes a month to get an appointment. One day prior to the appointment, I received 2 phone calls verifying the appointment and what the appointment was for and to confirm I would be there.  To get there on time, I get up at 4:30am and was told they could not be fixed the airbags because they have to order the parts and that takes a few days to receive.  If you know I was coming in for the appointment to fix the airbags that were recalled, why would you not have ordered the parts so they are ready? There was a month of time between when I made the appointment and the actual day of the appointment. Why would you call 2 times in one day to confirm the appointment when you did not order the parts for the appointment in the first place?  How completely incompetent can this Dealership be?  When I asked why the Customer Service was so bad, I was told that his customer service was good and it was everyone else that had problems.  I had to remind the man that when you work for Toyota and you wear the logo on your Shirt and jacket, you represent Toyota as a whole.  Toyota is a team and when there is a failure in falls on everyone, you do not get to be the star while all other employees are incompetent, you are a team and the failure on the team is a direct reflection on all Toyota employees.

58943,11-May-20,"Hello,
I unfortunately didn't have the best experience. I was treated unfairly (racial profiling) with the staff who check you out for your car from service/parts. I am a black woman and there were two clients ahead of me who weren't black. I also was not acknowledged by the lady working the kiosk for checking out. I also received my car last when I was ahead of another customer. When my car arrived I was asked to show my paper confirming the number (in order to receive my car). If the young lady was following protocol by confirming that is totally fine but the issue is, the other two clients were not asked e same questions. They were confronted with the words ""is this your car, is the camry for you"" . I then asked that same lady (who didn't help me) ""is that protocal for you guys to confirm the numbers/paperwork etc.?"" She replied "" oh yes we have to ask everyone because there were incidents where other people (relatives) drove off with their uncles car etc. (she was referencing an incident). I then replied "" how come the other to clients who got their car prior to me were not asked those questions?"" She then replied "" oh uhh I its because I thought he looked familiar I seen his face"", but she did this with both customers. She then goes on apologizing and said they are supposed to.  

I felt uncomfortable and felt I was being racially profiled by your staff. I was a bit bothered that I ended up having to give my  money away to an establishment who treats minorities this way. I won't be returning unfortunately due to this experience as well. I know it may not seem like ""a big deal"" but this it is something that us minorities have to sadly face on a daily basis throughout this nation. They should be told they need to follow protocol and follow that accordingly to all races and treating everyone fair, otherwise it is going to hurt the business/loss of customers.

It went smooth and I thought wow this place changes perceptions of dealerships. 14 days later, received a letter...a letter not a call...that the lease deal that we worked out fell through and that I needed to return the car. We called several times, spoke with several different finance managers who said they’d like to renegotiate...then another told us a different thing, then another told us a different thing. Left work early on a weekday to try and work something out - something a finance manager said would work if we headed that way (mind you were are 1.5 hours away). So we go that way, we wait for about an hour for anyone to even acknowledge us and then another hour or so to find out their solution actually wasn’t going to work.

I noticed she appeared irritated, as her tone was short and snappy. I could see the location was busy.

When Rebekah was done typing, I was not greeted as I have been accustomed to in all my dealings with the service center. She made our interaction very tense, unwelcoming, and uncomfortable. I don't consider myself sensitive to noticing these things, but this was blatantly obvious. 

Rebekah proceeded to ask me if I had an appointment today.

I said, ""no"".  

She responded, ""well then it's gonna be a couple hours. Is your maintenance light even on?""

I said, ""Yes, the light is on"". I remained calm and polite.

I never asked her what the duration of my service would be since I don't wait on site for my vehicle to be finished. 

She informed me an oil change was due at 10,000 miles. 

""Do you want to call us, or should I  preschedule it for you?"", she asked. 

I agreed to preschedule the oil change and she found a date 3 months away. 

""Are Sunday's good?""

I said, ""yes, the earlier the better"". 

She said, ""what?"". Her tone was definitely rude. I repeated myself. 

She replied, ""well we open at 7:00 AM"". 

I informed her that 7:00 AM was fine. 

""Is this a good number to call you?"" 

She was looking down at the invoice. I had to search for the number she was referring to. 

I updated my contact information with a pen.

I received my invoice and thanked her. She never responded or even looked at me.

It's too bad someone like Sarah could ruin my perception of the dealership's service level in a single interaction. I certainly hope that I won't have to stop referring friends, family, and co-workers to Roseville Toyota. But how can I be sure they won't be subjected to the same experience I just went through?  I feel this was race related, as other white customers were greeted with smiles. 

Please review the video surveillance to observe the unprofessional behavior of Bekah.  In addition, the woman in the adjacent service station was eating food at her computer.  What I experienced is a blemish on the standards of the leadership team. 

At 6:30 PM I called to check the status of my vehicle since I had not heard back from Rebekah. I spoke with Victoria who said the service department was closed. She indicated Rebekah tried calling me at 3:45. I did not receive that call, and Rebekah never followed up before going home. I had to rush over to pick up my car after hours. I was offered a free tank of gas for the inconvenience. This place sucks. ",6,73,91

59290,19-Dec-18,"Salesman Dan green pulled on door with all his weight to demonstrate, I don't know what, which pulled the door out of alignment, had poor knowledge of vehicle. His supervisor was obnoxious, demonstrating outdated, very aggressive, sleazy, sales tactics to the point of me wanting to walk out several times. My credit report was not accurately stated (another sleazy  tactic) I waited for an hour just see a manager who never came. Returned the next day with several issues with the vehicle. After having to wait another half hour to see manager I finally went into Managers office on my own. Repair department was very responsive and helpful. I have many issues with this truck that remain unresolved. I think I am losing my hearing due to a sound in cab on highway. Whenever I get out of vehicle my ears are ringing very badly. I don't know what has happened to Toyota as I've only owned Toyotas but you have just lost a loyal customer. Never again will I buy a car from. A dealersbip.

Claimed he was going to talk to her and figure something out however never heard back from him, go figure. Then I go to pick up my car when it’s done and they had a hard time finding my car, left the seats in an upright position for them to slam back, there’s a bubble in the tinting of the window, plus they ran out my gas and left me with literally under an eighth of a tank",6,73,-1

I waited around the waiting area, assuming it would be done by 2:30 at the latest... by 4:00pm I called my service advisor who said it wasn’t done yet but he would call me as soon as it was. I saw my car get parked and still no call. I was picked up by my wife and went to the store and still hadn’t been called. Finally the service advisor called after we called the lot asking if it was done. When I went to pick it up there was no recognition that I had waited an extra 4 hours. Just didn’t seem to care.

Received a second call saying the positive cable was corroded and needed replace. Said ok. Received a third call saying the cable corrosion had gone far. Might have reached  the wiring harness. If it had then the engine would need to be pulled but they were 80% sure they could fix it without doing that. If engine had to be pulled that would be a $5k repair. Stopped the repair. Took it home and replaced battery and clamp. Cable was fine. They had revisited the estimate three times Without doing any further inspection of the car.

I realize mistakes happen and the salesman was very apologetic about it, I actually felt bad for him. But, it was the sales manager who made the experience worse. He was arrogant, condescending, and did not accommodate for this mistake. Then my car could not be found on the lot for over an hour. It took hours to go through the process of negotiating twice, finding the car on the lot and waiting for financing since the wrong car was written up. Not acceptable!

One of which being them trying to raise my payment and I'm sure they were just hoping I wouldn't notice as I am a young girl who did a lot of this process by myself. Then I was given another form to sign over email but was not told what its purpose was and was not told it was time sensitive. This resulted in money being taken out of my bank account for the car that I had traded in 3 weeks prior, to them. When I called them to get this issue resolved I was belittled, talked over, cut off, and hung up on. When I asked for written confirmation of things pertaining to this form I got no response. I still haven't received a response to this day. Another issue I had with this company is the fact that I was passed around to about 4 different men in finance. Each time something happened I had to deal with a new person which was extremely frustrating because I was met with a lot of ""I dont know"" answers to my questions.

I stated ""Yes we did but I have a question.""

As I followed him, I stated ""I've had the car for two months and I've only been in here twice.""  My thought was, what does it matter, I have questions and you shouldn't have an attitude towards me.  As we were walking, he said ""you didn't get suckered into anything"" referring to a comment I had made about the lojack (I'm sorry but when you say no to lojack at least 6 times and it still ends up on your contract, you tell me what you call it).  I didn't appreciate his comment, since he was't part of the original process so I said ""Bite me!"".  He turned around with an attitude and said ""What did you just say to me?""  I said ""Bite me"".  Then he started ranting and getting upset, so I walked away.  I'm sorry, but as a customer, he started with an attitude.  Instead of ""how can I assist you"", I was greeted with ""dude, what now!""

60065,20-Sep-18," I'll first start by saying upon trading in my 2013 Mazda 3 I was given an honest trade in value. That alongside a $5,000 down payment should've been enough to land me a decent enough deal, or so I thought. After agreeing to a fair trade value and fair market price for the newer car my girlfriend alongside myself were then passed along to the finance department. So far yes we were a little weary on such a high monthly payment at $500 a month for a used car but hey I was only at a 602 credit score so i figured hey I'll just refinance in a year. I mean heck i love the car it's worth it to me. However our smiles soon faded as our financial manager proceeded to assure us that if he couldnt find us an interest rate that we didn't approve then hey simply dont purchase the vehicle was his words. You see since we needed to put my girlfriend on the loan and she did not have her license on her at the time we were told to come back in a week at which time we would decide if we actually wanted to purchase the car depending on what the interest rate was. I signed blindly with the reassurance nothing was set in stone except, that when I went back, everything was set in stone and my ignorant xxx went and signed blindly to a 22% interest rate with no ability to return the vehicle dispute being told otherwise. For god's sakes Tommy ( our fiance manger) even went as far as to not record our conversation as it wasn't set in stone it was only preliminary so we could legally drive their vehicle while we were waiting for him to get us a ""great deal"". 16 days later we were unable to get financed and so with my previous cars bank blowing my phone up for payment I finally had to call it quits and get my vehicle back. I'm just glad they didn't sell it in the 2 weeks time because wow would I have really been screwed. This was honestly the opposite of how I saw this transaction happening. I mean you go to these bigger dealers for a reason, so that you dont get screwed...right? I just honestly thank the lord for not allowing us to be financed because shady is all I can say upon reflection of the faulty misleading financial deal I blindly signed. I will say though very stern faced, the sales manager Ray-Rangchi as well as Alejandro angelos Cruz did a good job of really trying for the customer. Outside of that finance treated me like a money figure to hang out to dry to make a quick buck. Only person in your department that helped me truly was melissa the lead finance manager; only took me 2 weeks of bugging about my vehicle to actually reach her desk. This experience has ruined any future car buying or trading for me, at least as far as you bigger dealerships go...should be ashamed of how you did your customer. 100% do not go here!!!! And Laury in finance you should really work on how you hush your discrunteled customers because attacking them for trying to explain the situation simply because we were in ear shot of other potential customers is no way to earn anyone's business. Oh and unfortunately one more comment to help your company out, please make sure your vehicles have gas in them before customers drive off the lot as I had to immediately fill up an empty gas tank after just filling up my Mazda 3 prior to the trade.

60066,20-Sep-18,"All I went in for was an old recall repair. Didn't want anything else touched because i just had the car serviced at my regular shop. They ignored what I said and gave me a list, and xxxx near lecture, about things that need done or are wrong. I had a very slow leak in one tire, which I only had to fill about every two weeks. One day after leaving the dealer it's now really low and I have to replace it. They also put way too much air in all the tires. I hate Roseville dealers! ",6,73,-1
60067,20-Sep-18,"As soon as we sat down inside, our experience went downhill. The sales managers who negotiate your deal are a joke. Why not come out with your best deal out of the gate instead of making a customer spend five hours to get the price to where it could have been from the first 15 minutes? Not only that, but to get the payment lower they removed features and didn’t tell us. Funny how in the initial conversation those were not removable but when it came down to making a sale, they were. Then when we finally got into finance, we gave information on a lower rate and were told we would need to do the footwork and come back within 7 days. Come to find out (after hours of research and footwork) the dealership has a deal with the credit union and should have offered the rate on the spot. Multiple calls back into finance provided no concrete responses. I have yet to receive any paperwork showing who my loan is funded with and if I got the lower rate. When we were called to inquire about our visit, all of this was shared and we were reassured a call back, which weeks later we have still yet to receive. I will never purchase another vehicle from this dealership and I have and will continue to tell all of my friends and family to do the same. ",6,73,34

And, apparently the customer service manager, Jessica, thinks she can talk to me however she wants and be completely rude because she is married to a man high up in the company.  I do not know how they keep customers if this is how they are treated by management.  I can take my service and buy my next car somewhere else.",6,73,41

I told him my budget is $19000 maximum I can afford. He left and put someone else name Chad in the deal. I told him I want talk with Rizwan in my language. I went ask Rizwan why the price changed. He said go to Finance office and do not sign and price will be give whatever you want. I spoke with Thu Lee in finance person he said I have to go back and there can be long wait. I had to go home take care my 4 year old daughter and it was already too late for me. I feel like I was robbed by Chad and Muhammad Rizwan. Plus I was forced take car with scratches and broken visor.

and arriving on time, I was told that my oil change would be about 1.5 hrs! Why? because they said there were other cars ahead of mine that had to be serviced first. If that's the case then this Toyota dealership is saying that an appointment is of no value other than to give a Toyota owner a spot to get a simple job done sometime during the day at Their convenience. Other than that, the service center did do their job correctly and the vehicle checks as part of the oil change, Best of all they did not fake an oil change and they even threw in a courtesy car wash.",6,73,-1

I have a 2015 Tundra still under warranty with a mere 11,000 miles on it , and recently noticed it has a torn CV boot that's throwing grease. Upon inspection at Roseville Toyota, I was told it would not be covered due to the fact that its lifted, regardless that the lift was done at the same place that Toyota has their lifts done, using the same Pro Comp lift used by Toyota. This truck has never been offroad, and is sitting in the driveway most of the time. The dealer directed me to the shop that installed the lift, who of course directed me back to the dealer as it has nothing to do with the lift. Roseville Toyota knows they should be taking care of this, but has elected not to. This isn't the first Toyota bought from them, but it will certainly be the end of our business together.",6,73,36

60222,30-Aug-18,"As a long time, multi-Tpyota customer, I am very disappointed with Roseville Toyota Service. The vehicle (2014 Rav4) was brought in for routine maintenance and front brake noise. The service was completed with a new front brake job. As soon as my wife left the parking lot, she noticed a cyclical rubbing sound.  It was late in the day, so she called the following day regarding the sound (which was not present when we dropped the vehicle off).  My wife was told ""the front brake sound is a known issue with Toyota"" and that we basically had to live with it.  I am not a mechanic (that why I used to trust Roseville Toyota to treat us with honesty and integrity) but I knew the rubbing sound just wasn't right.  I called two other area Toyota dealers and spoke to respective service advisors, I described my scenario and they both independently stated there was no such issue.  We took the vehicle back and was initially told there was no rubbing sound.  I reiterated the fact the noise was there. Only after a second test drive and break down of the front brakes did it reveal the front driver's side rotor was not machined correctly causing the noise.  The repair was made at no charge. The problem is; there was no ownership of the faulty initial repair and no apology for the inconvenience of our time and  loss of the use of the vehicle. Very disappointed with Roseville Toyota Service and currently looking at other options for our service needs on the Rav4. Bottom line: Be your own best advocate and make sure the repair is done correctly.   ",6,73,84

I was told it’d been done for awhile.  He owned up to the mistake, though it wasn’t terribly busy at the time, which I appreciated.  He said truck was washed and ready and that Valet would have it right out to me. After waiting another 20 minutes outside, while watching nearly the entire Toyota staff chit chat and hang out since it was nearing close of business, I finally see my truck driving out the backlot expecting it to be ready.  Low and behold, it took a quick turn and disappeared into the car wash, which they said was already complete.  After another 10 minutes standing there, my truck finally arrived.  2 1/2 hours is not what I would call an “Express Service”.  This was the ‘18 Tacoma’s very first 5k service too and I am sadly disappointed. Will be taking my business to Folsom Toyota from here on out.  ",6,73,23

Instead, he looked around the car dashboard and stated ""I'll show you once we get back.""  With this answer it was implied that the car had blindspot detectors but I did not find out until after purchase that the car did not have them.   Purchase also took over five hours and the assistant manager who we were negotiating with (Colin J.

We won’t be driving there anymore for service for our Camry since I should not have to pay out of pocket to get home if they have a shuttle service.

I just spent a lot of money after saving for a long time on this car for it to have a check engine light on already and they made me feel like I was some sort of burden for coming to them for help.

I explained my issues, starting with hard shifts, and a noise coming from my front end suspension. The car is left with you for a long amount of time. I did have an appointment. At 5:45 pm I get a call from my service advisor, my car is ready. The transmission was updated, awesome! The front end noise is coming from your trailer hitch. I asked him how my front end noise is coming from the rear. He explained to me that him and his techs are only human. He also said I have 12 mins now to get my car. Awesome. Let me get to Roseville in Citrus Heights in 12 mins. He was “human” enough to stay for a few extra mins. Thanks. Getting into my truck, I noticed there were fingure prints all over my touch screen stero. The car must of been kept running for no reason because there was big difference of gas levels from when I dropped it off to when I got it back. Or maybe it had something to do with the nearly 30 miles that were driven in my truck. 

So the next day I went to Maita Toyota without an appointment. Explained the problem to the service advisor who was friendly. He put a tech in my car with me immediately to identify the noise. Once the tech heard enough. I went and filled out paperwork with my friendly advisor. He ordered and paid for my Uber ride home. About 2 hours later I get the call. This call was explaining the front end noise. He didn’t say it was a trailer hitch. He didn’t say they were only human. He told me my skid plate was missing a bolt.

I then went to Finance and and Richard didn’t go over any prices with me except for the extended warranties and packages that they supply.  He didn’t say this is the price of your truck with the items that I added on (leather).  When I got home after being at the dealership for over 5 hours I went over my contract and saw that they did in fact  add items (LoJack, Tracker and Dent Pro) to my contract and the sale price of my vehicle was almost $4K more than we discussed.  I then called Chad to get clarification on everything and he explained it again to us but my husband and I were misinformed and raised our voices.  We never yelled at them but trying to understand and get our point across.  Chad said he would take off the items they added ok but he didn’t.  We had to go through the finance to get them removed and credited back to us through Toyota Financial.

He didn't try to talk me into or out of anything, and let the test drive do the talking.  I would shop with miles any day of the week, just not for Toyota.
Yes we bought a RAV4, but only because Miles was such a standup guy.  Then we had to deal with Howard.  His only concern was selling the car.  We explained we wanted to wait to refinance our home, and he kept pushing.  On top of that he quoted a price with extras I told him  i didn't want, which included LoJack.  Every time he came back with a ""deal"" I said I didn't want Lojack and the other options he was peddling.  We finally agreed on a monthly payment and an interest rate I was happy with.  Then when we got in with Joe, come to find out Joe kept stating ""That's the price and options you agreed to.""  I walked out the FIRST time to go get Howard to explain what he had told Joe I agreed to, and then straightened them out.
At which time Joe started peddling extras.  I told him I was in his office to sign a sales agreement and that it wasn't his place to continue to sell me option.  He kept pushing, I walked out again, very upset.
I left for some time, but considering the actual price of the car was good, ad our current vehicle had 300,000+ miles on it, we needed a reliable car.  We finally agreed on the paperwork, and I tried to read everything while I signed.  But when I got home I noticed a discrepancy and returned the next day.

I have been to Roseville Toyota for many services over the last 20 years and, with a few exceptions, I have always been pleased.  This last visit,however, was one of the worst.  ",6,73,-1

It looked it was keyed with a greasy tool. When I tried contacting the service rep I only got her voicemail and after leaving a message the only contact I received on the matter was the survey department. I was able to buff out the scratch, but I shouldn't have had too. I will not return for anymore service there.",6,73,-1
60634,13-Jul-18," I have been coming here for years and usually the tire rotation is included in the service. They wanted to charge extra for every little service that was rendered. I felt like I was being nickeled and dimed to death and things were added on that weren't even necessary. They said I needed brakes because there was a little bit of rumbling in the steering wheel,  and when I asked what percentage the brake pads were out they said they never removed the tires to check the brakes. So why would I need new brakes if you never even checked the rotors or the brake pads ?
 This is just for openers I will never returned your service center again ",6,73,206
60663,10-Jul-18,"Terrible experience.  Just like I feared they swarm you and Howard one of the sales managers lied to me at least 3 times in order to get me to buy thentruck and then tried to tack on all kinds of extras I didn't want to the tune of like $8,000. I was moving in 2 weeks and could only buy the truck if the camper shell was ready and Howard told me they had a special account and could literally have it ready in a week.  The next day he told me it would be 5 weeks. Cost me thousands to change all my plans and move from where I was living to a temporary location. He also told me he would give me $8,000 for my trade in then after making me wait forever offered only $4,000. I had to then haggle to get him to $6,000. Also they used very high pressure tactics. Then I took truck back for spray in bed liner and they oversprayed it all over the paint and tried to give it back to me like that and it's still not fixed.   ",6,73,185
60667,09-Jul-18,"Made an appointment for a routine service. After 2 hours of waiting with no call or update I finally inquired regarding my vehicle.

Turns out it had been done for 90+ minutes but was placed in the ""do not wash"" line. However, the system was waiting for it to be washed (as requested).

2 hours for a tire rotation, no wash, rude service person.

I had a huge repair to do, and was offered to use their financing service to do the repair sooner rather than later. The sales rep did not fully explain the process. They kept my car longer than they advised. On a sunday when I came in, they forgot to charge me. I had to ask then to set up my payments. I had my credit card and they did not know that the payments HAD to be on a debit card. It was July first and i had just paid rent. I offered any of my cc cards or even cash bc the banks would take a business day for my transfer from another account to use my debit card. They did not offer me a courtesy for this miscommunication, nor did they give me my car or rent me a car for free until the next business day. When I came back they tried to get me out if there asap.

However, my 50k$ car came home with a scrape on the right front bumper that I did not put there. When I discovered it the next morning, they refused to acknowledge it was even a possibility that it happened there. I know it did because I drove it from their lot to my garage without stopping. Unfortunately, I did not do a second walk around when it came back from detail. The best they could do was offer some touch up paint and a tank of gas. I don’t want their gas. I want my car fixed.

60737,02-Jul-18,"I purchased a platinum tire warranty when i bought my Tacoma here. It is nationally advertised as a replacement only tire warranty, no repairs. It is also a very expensive add-on.

I brought my truck in for service because one tire wasn?t holding air and had a visible screw in it. When i arrived and was taken to Paul Koontz, he immediately tried to talk me into a tire repair. He said he had never heard of a warranty that offered replacement.
Why on earth would I pay $600 for a tire warranty that covers $10 repairs that can be purchased at any tire shop? How has your service advisor never heard of your tire warranty?

Further, he told me a warranty replacement would take 4 hours because I did not have an appointment. A repair could be done right away.

Common sense tells me that the main tasks involved in repair and replacement are the same. 1) you take off a tire. 2) you put on a tire.

I insisted on replacement and asked that he look up my warranty. The replacement ended up taking 2 hours.
Was this a punishment for insisting on  the service that I had pre-paid for?
Paul had said repair could be done right away.

I do not appreciate being lied to!

If your shop is too busy that day, tell me. I know I am there without an appointment. Don?t lie!

If a service member can repair right away, he can replace right away. Don?t lie!

If tire replacements are too expensive, stop selling the warranty. Don?t lie!

If by some small chance your service advisors dont have training on vehicle warranties, train them. If they dont know a product, get help from an advisor that does. If all else fails, the finance manager that sells the warranties is just a few offices away.",6,73,-1

I went to the Lexus dealer down the street and was approached in a much nicer way.  They just laughed when I related my experience and said they heard it all the time.  Guess I'll be buying a Lexus.

60860,19-Jun-18,"I am highly disappoint with Roseville Toyota, first while in the purchasing process of my 2015 Prius, another individual “reserved” the car I was signing the paperwork to buy, resulting in a search for the car, followed by the search for single key to the vehicle which the internet salesmen had brought home to ensure the car remained until the next day. After the key was retrieved, my new-to-me Prius was finally brought in be washed, the whole ordeal last five hours, ending with the salesman (Klaus Labuttis) unable to fill the vehicle up at the dealerships gas station and having to retrieve another dealership credit car, another half hour of my time washed. I didn’t leave the dealership until 9:50 PM. 

The following day while showing my wife the car I had just purchased, she noticed a large metal box in the glove box, I called Klaus at Roseville Toyota and left a message explaining to him that I had what I believed to be a lock-box belonging to the dealership as well as expressing concern that I hadn’t received a spare key to my vehicle and I would be interested in acquiring one. 

A day passed with no returned phone call from Klaus Labuttis, so I tried him again, he explained to me that the vehicle was used and only came with one key. He quickly changed the subject and directed questions towards my spare key for the vehicle I had traded in for my new Prius, to which I replied that I would be willing to come back in to return my old spare key, and the lockbox in return for a spare key as a sign of good will. He said that my truck I had traded in would sell regardless of the spare key being turned in and that he had no authority to give me a spare key for my new vehicle. He explained to me that “if I was of good character” I would just give them the spare key and “that was all he had to say about that” the phone call was ended with no resolution. 

Approx. one hour later I received a phone called from Klaus Labuttis expressing that he felt badly and that if I had time the following day 6/19 that I could bring my old spare key in, with the lock-box and he would “take care of me” and get me a new spare for my Prius. 

Today, I visited the dealership at the set time 3:45 PM for our agreed upon time of 4:00 PM, the receptionist at the desk said she would page Klaus and after 3 failed attempts a sales manager came out. I explained to the manager (I believe his name was Collin) about the arrangement Klaus and I had discussed the day prior and he informed me he “had no idea” what Klaus and I talked about and “that was between me and Klaus” he took the key for my old Tundra from me and the lock-box and told me to have a seat. 

At 4:20 when Klaus finally showed up, he let me know that there was a misunderstanding and that he never had the pull to get me that spare key. He let me know that he had never said anything about my spare key for my Prius and that If I would like he could take to his sales manager about getting one on a discount. After explaining to the sales manager the two separate conversations Klaus and I had the day prior Klaus proceeded to raise his voice and demanded I not “put him in this position” the sales manager told Klaus “everything was just fine” and Klaus exited the room. The Sales manager let me know that he was sorry about Klaus’s behavior but there was nothing he could do to get me a key. 

All in total I wasted an absolutely rediculious amount of time at this dealership dealing with issues that I’ve never dealt with before while purchasing my other two Toyota vehicles. 

Roseville Toyota is the reason why there is a negative connotation associated with car buying especially when it comes to dealership. Their professionalism and customer service is severely lacking and I will be taking my business elsewhere. I’m still a huge fan of Toyota’s and this amazing value but this experience has put a sour taste in my mouth. I hope me sharing this experience will help other buyers in the future. ",6,73,251

I bought new caliper bracket bolts (dealership stated these were the bolts grinding on rotors) from auto parts store for about $6.  Took apart front brakes and rotors to find it was grinding on front left only, not both front rotors.  Once I replaced the caliper bracket bolts with new ones the grinding and noise went away.  Not sure why the original bolts were longer on the front left.  Fixed the issue for $6 and about 30 minutes of my time.  Dealership wanted $1,200.

They kept me sitting in the lobby for several hours while they went back and forth with their managers on the pricing and taking their time. In the meantime, I called a few other dealerships and they told me over the phone they would offer me the pricing I wanted which told me that it was easily doable. I am a loyal person though and decided to stick it out with them (although i wish I didn't). The sales rep that helped me was great but the management was VERY dishonest and lied to me several times to get me to not walk out. They offered me a price as I was walking out and then back and then retracted it several times. I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS DEALERSHIP TO ANYBODY. POOR MANAGEMENT!
On a side note, while I was getting my first service, I started to look at vans for my wife because she wanted Toyota. Once again, it took me SEVERAL hours to get to the pricing we wanted and at that time, I was so mad that I left. I continued to text the sales guy (who was great to work with) and he said that his management was ok with the pricing and to come back.

When the service manager showed up, I heard a barrage of excuses including that management just sprung new software/procedure and everything was down. The amount of time it took to complete my first service was acceptable however when I picked up the truck it wasn’t cleaned, considering I said yes multiple times to the car wash it seemed like someone just sprayed my new truck down with a hose. It was not, to say the least what I expected after just financing $37,000 with Toyota. I didn’t expect a detail on my vehicle but there were bugs still everywhere on the front of the truck and my interior driver side floor had water all over it.

Every time they take over an hour to do an oil change or other minor maintenance and then the service writers that are supposed to call you up, are too busy playing games on their phones or texting their friends to care about their jobs. And this was the same kind of “service” we received in numerous visits.

This is forcing me to pick an employee, however they are not the ones responsible for this atrocious service but rather the survey won’t let me complete it without selecting it.

I told him no, because I checked while I was in the car wash.  He told me that it must have been a high pressure car wash.  I told him that it was a normal gas station carwash and that the water seemed to be coming from the molding on top of the window as the glass is inside a top and bottom rail and the water could not go up and over the glass.  He stopped talking to me and just wrote up my 15k mile service request and told me that they will call when it was ready.  Nothing was checked and no notes were made on my request.

61609,02-Apr-18,"So I go to the dealership cause I saw there commercials and figure “hey let’s give it a try”. I fill out online application, get a call back by a dealer named Junior and he tells me he can get me in pretty much whatever they have and possibly with no down payment, lie. So I get there and drive a hour to get there to find out I need to put a down payment. Of course I figured this but it’s the fact of he lied to get me there. 2nd visit he tells me put 2k down and he can get me in pretty much anything I want, lie again. So I fill out the application that they need there and they come back saying they can’t do it that I’d need more down. Around $2400. So I say ok then they come back and say they can only get me into a basic Hyundai and it’d be like $400+ a month. I tell him I’m not interested but he’s super persistent trying to sell me on this car I’m not going to be ok with. Especially for that amount. This is when I meet Barry from the financial department. We talk and I tell him I won’t buy that car and to make a list of cars he can finance. So he does and I tell him the car I would be willing to get. So I go home and wait for his call to see if he’d be able to do it. He calls me a day or two later and says he can and I just need to come in and finish up paperwork. I ask him how long is it going to take and he says “we’ll get you in and out in about a hour or 2 max, you just need to test drive and choose, and do paperwork”. I say “are you sure cuz I need to be at work(at a certain time and tell him the time) and I can’t be late,you going to have the cars ready right? ” , he says “ yeah I’ll have you in and out don’t worry”. So I go in and bring my kids mother so she can drive my car back to my place or the new car back to my place. We get there and they don’t have anything ready at all. We are forced to search for the two cars I said ok to for 2 and a half hours. Driving around all the lots. And they still can’t find either of the cars!! After more than two hours I tell him “look I have to go to work and you should have had this ready like you said, so let’s just go back so I can leave”, Junior says let me try this last area. We go to the last area and he finds the year and model I’m looking for but it’s not the one they said, so junior calls Barry to see if they can do this one instead. Barry says yes, so we go back.Then we get back and all the paperwork I already filled out was lost so I had to do it again, then they ask for extra info that made no sense in them needing. At this point I’m getting irritated, cuz this is lack of professionalism, and being prepared. Then my kids mother speaks up on something she finds funny and not needed, and Junior gets a attitude with her and just basically tried to blow her off. She’s pissed so she walks out. I have to check him and make sure he understands that he doesn’t get a attitude and talk to her in this manner. Now I’m pissed and irritated and I tell him get Barry I’ll deal with him. Barry gives a half xxx apology and moves on to the sale. At this point I really have to go so I’m rushing. Sign paperwork and run out of there to get to work. My kids mom was forced to wait for them to detail the car for a hour and then she leaves. At this point I might have gave them 3 stars but that’s not the end of my story. About a week later I get a call after 12 hour shift from Barry saying that they need to cancel sale cuz the bank, but if I give them a extra $500 on top of the $2400 we can continue the sale. At this point I lose it and tell him he better figure something out cuz I’m not doing that. He calls back and says if I give him $300 more he could drop apr a point and lower payments about $80 a month. So I say fine and I go there and pay. Then a week after that they call and say they need even more info and paperwork. At this point I’m just really pissed, speak to there manager Franklin. Franklin apologizes and says that I’d deal with him from now on. I send Franklin info requested. 3 days later Junior calls again asking for info I just sent Franklin. I tell Junior to get info from Franklin and stop calling me cuz I’m feeling harassed and at this point this should have been done, so if they need to contact me tell Franklin to contact me. 3 days later I get a letter from them stating another cancellation of sale!!! And I’m like xxx???!!!! So I call Franklin and he’s like idk what this is about. He calls back and asks for a bank statement and this would be done and apologizes again. So I send him info and now almost a month later is finally looking like it’s done. The only reason I gave them one star would be cuz of Franklin. But this process has been nothing but headaches and stress. I would not advise anyone to deal with these people but if you do deal with Franklin. ",6,73,279

1. Salesman took an hour to find  a car listed for sale. (went thru 5 parking lots trying to find it.
2. Financial person was gruff after it was clear we were not buying any extras.
3. Manuals were promised upon the sale, but after 5 weeks of my multiple calls and promises, a tech emailed me that the manuals were no longer available (and no one cared). ",6,73,69
61663,13-Mar-18,"This is clearly a mega dealership with many employees.  It was great to have a coffee at their built in cafe; the popcorn machine was nice too.  My salesman also bought lunch for me while we were waiting for the final paperwork.

Having said that, my experience was that it took too long to go through the sales cycle at this dealership; it made me long for the Carmax model.  When you begin by test driving the cars/models you are interested in, it takes a long time for the sales personnel to locate the car that fits your requirements.  Then when you have decided on a model, it takes even longer for the sales person to locate their ""best fit.""  It appears that the problem is that they do not have a computerized inventory that could be used to locate cars faster for their customers and this wastes a lot of time.  

On the actual ""sales"" side, I was not impressed when it turned out to be the old used car sales gimmick of ""I'll have to talk to my manager and get back to you"" routine.  Well, my wait between each cycle (when we were negotiating the price/terms) was at least an hour.  In my case, I had 3 or 4 cycles; it was so excruciating I can't remember.

The bottom line is that it took me more than 8 hours to finalize this transaction (in my case, a lease) and I was exhausted when it finally came time to sign all the paperwork.  And the paperwork is very confusing and hard to understand.  In my case, we finally negotiated a monthly price for the lease but there is no way to easily correlate the final price with the resulting paperwork and the sales manager is nowhere to be found when you are signing.  And by the time I was signing the paperwork I was mostly ""brain dead"" anyhow. 

When I do this next time, at another dealership, I will give myself a time frame and walk away if I am not finished by then.  I admire this dealership for having such friendly people and a beautiful facility but I will choose some other dealership that I feel can expedite and close much faster than I experienced at Roseville Toyota.  Also I would caution anyone who is contemplating a lease, watch out for all the ""insurance"" items they want to tack on (such as tire/wheel, dent fixing, GAP, etc.).  Check with your car insurance carrier and you will likely already have some coverage for these items.

After 4 hours of waiting I was told it had a bad tire and they did not have it in stock. This is suppose to be “a certified pre-owned Toyota “. Ha ha !!!  I’m disdusted!

62010,25-Jan-18,"We really liked our salesman, Mayjohn.  He was kind, and helped us find the right car. I have bought MANY cars in my life, and I have never felt so taken advantage of when negotiating a deal.  I feel like because we had two children there that were starting to lose patience, they were rushing us through. The first gentleman spoke SO quickly and added things into the deal that I did not want (that ended up being there in the end when I was sitting there with finance. The finance gentleman made me feel stupid for saying that I didn’t want that in the deal, stating that I had “already agreed to it.”) I’m sure that is his sales “tactic”.  When I informed him that we did not want the LoJack on the car, he told me that we would receive an insurance discount, and that it was worth it.  I felt like I wasn’t able to negotiate a better deal— I feel like we paid too much for the car than we should’ve. When I called back and asked for the dent protection and LoJack removed, I was told that I could come in to sign a paper to remove the dent  protection, but that the LoJack was already in my name and that they couldn’t remove it. I’ve felt misled because I was told that we would receive a discount with our insurance company… My insurance company told me that many salesmen use this tactic to make a sale. I’ve just never felt so out of control during a car deal. I generally feel like I have made a good decision when I leave, but I didn’t feel this way at all this time. It was a real disappointment when it should’ve been exciting.",6,73,9

This time they signed off on the three things I asked to be done and didn’t do 1 of them. Chris was very apologetic and helped me out and got it all done the next week. They do fix all their mistakes it would just be nice not to always have them make one though. I go here because 1) It is the closest Toyota dealer to me so I can be dropped off by there shuttle at home and 2) Because I have the 75k mile service plan and 125k mile platinum warranty.

Upon arrival for an appointment, the team at Roseville Toyota from sales to delivery put themselves first, not the customer. On a 100 plus degree day and with an infant in tow, no water was offered to us. We found a vehicle we wanted at which point the buying process was slower than molasses even after approval and sales parameters were set. We secured the deal within 2 hours of being here, and spent another 5 hours waiting for an available finance employee to write the deal, wash the car, and make delivery. On top of that, I had to fight them to fill the tank (really? I just spent $30k on a car, you can't spend $40 on fuel?), and have since been called back to the dealer 3 subsequent times to fill out paperwork they neglected to fill out correctly; I work nights and to have them call me during the day after knowing I sleep in that timeframe not just once but multiple times (and yes, I told them I would be there later that afternoon after the first and second calls).

They  had no parts in inventory to make repairs and could not provide any definite time on repairs and had many customers trucks already parked and waiting for repairs. They then told me if I didn't leave it that they could not be responsible for damages if something happened. I left with my truck and asked them to call me when they could replace my truck with a truck. There are reasons people buy trucks and not small coups.  I have to call in everyday and see when they can provide me a truck. They will not call me when they have one and they still can not provide me any time frame of making repairs.
What a bunch of stuff!! May be a Toyota problem but it is also a John L. Sullivan Automotive Group problem and  I will remember it. The Service Group  Employees ( Jim Stockman ) are great but the Dealership has lost my respect for handling problems...

62122,28-May-17,"Amazing internet staff set my family and I up for a test drive appointment with Henley Hernandez on May 6,2017. Henley is a friendly person with an exceptional ability to connect with his customers wants and needs without making them feel pressured to purchase immediately. Needless to say, we felt confident in our decision and purchased our 2017 Sienna the same day. Joe Beitzel helped us in the finance department with exceptional patients with our three children while signing on the dotted line. We purchased the 10 year 100,000 mile warranty with Joe. Malon helped us set up and explain our new features upon leaving, again extremely friendly and relatable. We left Roseville Toyota feeling like family on May 6, 2017.  

My husband and I decided we wanted body side molding, got in touch with Henley who once again helped us place that order. Sally called to schedule the Cilajet Sealant application once the molding was delivered to Toyota. Appointment was made for Friday, May 26th and was told I would have a Sienna reserved for the day. 

On May 26th, Julian R. Castellan checked my Sienna in for the scheduled work and pointed me to the rental desk- that is where everything began going downhill with Roseville Toyota. Rental desk ""lost"" my Sienna reservation and tried giving me a Prius, then a Camry. I quickly explained I have three carseats that will not fit. After a few minutes I was given a Sienna. The keyfob I was given had duct tape covering the automatic sliding doors. I was told the 2016's will be recalled due to doors flying open while people are driving! That sounds criminal that your dealership would let a soon to be recalled vehicle off your lot. I was in a rush to get to work and left knowing my children would not be riding in that faulty Sienna. 

At two o'clock, I got a call from Jess letting me know my van was ready. Valet dropped my van and keys and I left for the Roseville Galleria. My husband noticed what looked like dried bird poop below one of our fog lights and oil droplets on the bumper which would not easily wipe off with a dry napkin. Nothing should have dried so fast to where I could not easily wipe off with napkin unless it was already dried before my van was taken in. I wondered if the Cilajet was applied over the poop and oil. Called Julian to explain my concern and was completely shut down right away without any concern. We immediately returned to service department where Jess and Julian met us. Juilan  quickly dismissed anything said and  rubbed  poop and oil off with a rag wet with some kind of liquid. Julian made it clear there was nothing he would say or do to help listen and try to resolve any of our concerns- we needed to take that up with finance to possibly get our money back for the Cilajet Application. I quickly brought up the fact that we would not get money back due to the application was included in our 10 year/100,000 mile warranty. Once again Julian did not care.  Jess on the other hand seemed embarrassed by Julian's behavior.

We then met with Thue Lee who quickly listened then gave us another Cilajet sample pack. Said the paint is smooth (the van is new, of course paint is smooth) therefore the application was successful. My husband and I left feeling like the outcast family member that day. We just wanted what we had scheduled and paid for- Cilajet Application from our 10 year/100,000 mile warranty and body side molding. 

To make make our frustrations with Roseville Toyota worse, Julian called us this morning (May 27) to ask when we are going to pick up our van! Sloppy and unprofessional is how I would describe Roseville Toyota's Service Center. Going forward, Roseville Toyota has lost all of our business. We will have all of our warranty work done at Maita Toyota, much closer to our home. ",6,73,130

62134,05-Dec-16,"Out of all the dealerships I've ever been to (Kia, BMW, Chevrolet, Toyota, Ford, etc) no one has ever been more rude or unprofessional than Andy from Roseville Toyota.  Friday December 2nd 2016 I visit Toyota around 4pm to try and buy a Tundra 2017.  I obviously want a good price, i have great credit and money to put down.  Andy comes back after seeing my offer and says ""We are not a charity, we do not give stuff out for free, we are a business, we need MONEY!""  It was very condisending and rude tone.  He then went on to tell his Sales guy Naick that he is doing everything wrong and yelling at him in front of customers (me).  I just think he was very rude and unprofessional so much that I had to tell him to his face.  He then said ""You know what i don't care"" and walked into the manager office.  A different sales manager came out to comfort me (MUCH more professional) and tried to make a deal with me.  In the end I still bought from John L. but at the Chevrolet branch on Saturday December 3rd 2016.  Although John L Sullivan owns both (from what I have heard), Chevrolet is a 10/10 when it comes to customer service and kindness.  Roseville Toyota is around a 7/10 and people like Andy are what bring it down even more to a 1/10.  I will never recommend Roseville Toyota to any of my friends or family.  And it is all because of how Andy not only treated me, but how he treated his employees.   ",6,73,52
62135,11-Nov-16,"Incredibly corrupt dealership.  After agreeing on a sales price, I noticed that they had tacked on LoJack and dent protection within the optionals section - totaling nearly $2000 for optionals we had not been notified of.  When I indicated to the sales department that we did not want those optionals, they told us that we could not purchase the car without taking those options.  We had already spent 2 1/2 hours at the dealership and I was exhausted (should have walked).  We foolishly just communicated how disgusted we were with the whole situation and then finished up the deal. The weekend was ending and my husband urgently needed a car.  I won't even bother describing what happened in the financial services department.  But, in both departments, we noticed that they had listed our phone numbers incorrectly and that they had not listed our email address (wrote ""did not provide email address"" though I had indeed done so).  Meanwhile, every department is pleading with us to give a good customer service survey when we leave.  However, when it was clear that they were not going to get one because of how poorly they treated us in both departments, they completely falsified our contact information in the Toyota corporate system.  I just got off the phone with Toyota corporate: Roseville Toyota had given them a completely fabricated email address, completely fabricated phone numbers, and completely fabricated mailing address.  Meaning they were purposefully preventing Toyota corporate from being able to survey us on our sales experience. It would have been comical if it had not been so obscenely corrupt.  These people may have succeeded in giving Toyota a bad name in my family, though I have been a loyal Toyota fan and customer since 1989.  The only thing that they did right was that - after I lodged a complaint with Toyota corporate, they rewrote the contract to remove the optionals that we had never wanted.  I would have been happy at that point if they had followed through with updating our contact information as requested to 5 seperate agents at Roseville Toyota.  They absolutely refused. No, it would have been more honest to refuse.  They claimed to have fixed the information, but instead created new fabrications.  Disgusting business practices.",6,73,750
62138,03-Oct-16,"I wanted to trade in my Kia optima for a Toyota Prius. Turned into a 6 1/2 hour headache. I wanted a Prius that they had advertised online, a sales man approached us very quickly (12:00pm) as we pulled up which was nice, but then we walked around the lot trying to guess where the advertised car was at, then the salesman drove us around every lot/dealership/repair area they had for about an hour. Me and my friend asked if we could just wait inside for the sales person to find it, but the salesman said ""maybe you will see another car you like while we drive around."" 

We finally find the Prius advertised and it was at a repair area of one of the dealership's, both the front and rear bumpers had scratch marks from whatever the previous owner drove/backed into. I was OK with the condition the car was in. Then we drove over to the main dealership and waited for the next person to help us.

The next person let me know that I would not be able to make the trade without putting down the 7k difference that I would owe since the Prius was much cheaper than the car I was trading in. Then another person told me that they might be able to help me out if I get a more expensive Prius, so that the difference price wouldn't  be what was holding me back from making the deal.

I decided I would be ok with getting a much more expensive Prius, plus the person I was with had to be somewhere important at 5:00pm. We walk out to the lot and picked out the second newer Prius we looked at, I didn't really care at this point, after all any of the newer Prius's were going to be better than the one we initially came to see. 

The rear bumper on this newer Prius had hit something, I could tell because it didn't line up just right on the passenger side and I was able to jiggle it a little. Don't get me wrong my trade in had scratch marks down the side of the wheel wells, the rear bumper was split open in the middle, the rims were all scratched, and the front driver side Controll arm or something was damaged so the car wanted to pull to the right a lot.... 


I didn't expect for good money on my trade in, I feel what they were offering me for my car was very reasonable, but no one said anything about the bumper on the Prius. It didn't feel right after they bragged about some 121 point inspection, and that the car fax says that the car has never been in an accident. Whatever, I would be ok with it I just needed to keep moving forward with the whole process.

I wasn't very pleasant at this point, at around 6:00pm I get to the finance guy, and this guy started out super nice and really fun, but I told him that I was trying to still get my friend to his appointment even though it was an hour after 5:00. He was totally cool about it... Then he started offering the typical gap insurance, tire warranty, etc. I turned it all down, then he offered some coating for the car to protect it and I would never have to wax my car, he told me that all the finance people were having a little competition of who could sell the most of those, I turned it down and that's when his attitude completely changes. He became short and quiet after that, pretty sure it made him mad. I asked my buddy if he felt the same about that and he said he was thinking the same exaxt thing that the guy went from nice to quiet and bored with us.

They finally hand the keys to the Prius over, but the car wasn't ready, so now I'm really frustrated, and then the original sales man walks up to me and says the finance guy says he needs more paperwork. They guide me over to a computer that is available so I can rummage through my emails/bank statements/etc to get them the info they need. They still say I need more info.

This is the point that my friend looses his cool and starts telling the salesman how ridiculous this has become. A few more people notice us throwing a fit and then they tell the salesman to just follow us home to pick up the necessary paperwork. We tell the salesman that we have to get to a meeting, that might not even be happening amore because it is now 6:30. Another gentleman tells me that we can just email the info.

We leave in the Prius, we drive right back up with the paperwork that they needed, because the meeting was cancelled because the interviewers could not wait any longer for the meeting. I make sure they make copies of everything. They tell me I'm all set. So I leave.

Today I'm on my lunch break I missed 2 calls and have a text message....

62144,26-Jun-16,"Roseville Toyota is, without a doubt, the worst car buying experience you can possibly imagine. I had always been a fan of Toyotas, and was looking to trade in my Tacoma for a larger model. Upon arriving, they immediately took my keys for the trade in. This is not unusual, except for the fact that they never gave them back. When I had finished looking at vehicles and could not come to an agreement on price, I asked for my keys back. Instead, they continued to bring insufficient and overpriced offer after offer instead of bringing me the keys to my own vehicle. Hours later, I finally left. The salesman then called me and said that they were willing to give me the price that I had requested. When I went back to the dealership however, they then took my keys to my vehicle, and proceeded to come back at me with prices that were nowhere near what we had agreed upon. Again, when I asked to get my keys back for my own vehicle, they didn't bring them. Instead, they continued to bring me insufficient and overpriced offer after offer until finally, I had to get up, go to the desk myself, and demand my keys in order to escape the dealership.

62145,03-Jun-16,"Please read this before going to the dealership for service. I really don't want what happened to me to happen to anyone else. 

I've always had my car serviced at the dealership & recently moved to the area so Roseville Toyota was the closest dealership. I had my tires rotated & an inspection done. I got a laundry list of things that were wrong with my car that were not wrong 3,000 miles ago. They told me they did a ""thorough"" inspection on my vehicle. They were so pushy that I get the service done that day or within the week. I wanted to get a second opinion before shelling out $4,500. 

When I got my car back my back sun shield didn't work and my front passenger window didn't work. I called the dealership & asked to schedule an appointment to fix what wasn't working. They had the audacity to tell me that I would have to pay, up front, before the dealership will even look at it when it was a simple fuse fix. They said I would be reimbursed if they found they were the cause of the issue. 

Fast forward 2 days after service. My battery light comes on & then my car died in the middle of the road. I called AAA & they stated my alternator went out. Toyota's ""thorough"" inspection showed the alternator as fine but the battery needing a recharge. THREE different AAA mechanics stated the disbelief & with my car's low mileage that the alternator went out. When I told them I just had it looked at by the Roseville Toyota dealership all THREE (they came out on separate occasions, 1 battery, 1 tow & 1 more battery) all said that the dealership is very crooked, hurting for money & has been known to purposefully sabotage vehicles so customers would have to bring them back in for repair. 

I called 2 different, highly rated & recommended, mechanic shops. They both stated I was not their first customer whose brought in a vehicle from Toyota with the same laundry list of issues. When I brought my vehicle in, behold the inflated issues that Toyota presented to me were FALSE! For example, Toyota stated my rack & pinion had gone out along with my CV boot. Upon close inspection, by my choice mechanic, they stated NOTHING was wrong with my rack & pinion. It was just my CV boot flinging grease & it didn't need to be changed & nothing was wrong with it. Let me tell you that more than 1/2 of Toyota's laundry list was completely exaggerated. 

Instead of spending $4,500 I walked away spending $650.00 in repairs with a new battery.

62167,30-Aug-15,"It was the WORST EXPERIENCE ever! I've never felt so humiliated in my life! Never ever go there! The staff was arrogant, disrespectful!

Here is my story;
I got the best quote for 2015 Camry SE from the Miata Toyota Dealer, everything was perfect over there, they respect you, try to make you satisfied, and leave the dealership happily; but Miata did not have the Silver color.
So, I tried calling the other dealerships and asked them if they had the Silver color. Elk Grove Toyota said they don't have the Silver color and apologized for that.
After this call, I called the Roseville Toyota, talked to the salesperson who must be Shaun Thornhill; I explained everything in detail to him that I visited / talked to 3 different Toyota Dealers in Reno, Sacramento, San Jose; all of them said that they could do the price-match while talking on the phone, but when it comes to visiting the dealership and I get there, they said they cannot do the price-match with the Miata etc.; yeah after explaining previous experiences; HE SAID that Roseville Toyota is the #1 and BIGGEST dealership in North California, and HE GUARANTEED that Roseville Toyota can do the price-match and also give the best price to the customers! I reminded the previous experiences 3 times on the phone to the salesperson, but he again GUARANTEED that they can give me the best price. He said that the only thing I should do is to come to the dealership, and then don't worry about the rest. AND I DID THAT! I trusted them and drove 125 miles which takes 2 hours from RENO, NV to ROSEVILLE, CA. BUT I WISH I DIDN'T...
When I got there, starting from the first person and first minute, before starting to test drive and the paperwork, I asked them again and again and told them that ""I have the quote from Miata which is really good price, let's not waste both your and my time, I want to continue if you can do the price-match"", and every time I said that, each person said ""Don't Worry, we guarantee you that we can do everything; price-matching or giving you the best price"". And believed them.
I did the test drive, started the paperwork, they run the credit and gave me the offer. Here is the SURPRISE! I was really surprised, disappointed... I felt that I should have never trusted them!!! They gave me ridiculous offer! I emailed them the previous quote that I got from Miata Toyota; it seemed that they did NOT even take a look at that quote!!! So irresponsible, amateur, humiliating!!! 
I should NOT have waited there for one more second, but I had a hope that there was misunderstanding and they would fix it. But the case was totally different!!!
The salesperson came and talked to me, gave me the offer, I denied, gave him my offer, he goes back to the office / finance department, comes back, so and so forth... This process took more than 3 hours!!!
I understand the process, but as I explained the salesperson in the dealership, my question was really clear; ""Is Toyota LIABLE for the person that I talked on the phone?!"". I said ""the salesperson on the phone GUARANTEED that they can do the price-match or give me the BEST PRICE only if I show up and be at the dealership?!"".
On the phone, ROSEVILLE TOYOTA IS LYING, DECEIVING the CUSTOMERS!!!
They want you to come to the dealership, and then they play with the numbers / words etc.

I asked the salesperson in the dealership that ""LET'S LISTEN TO THE PHONE CONVERSATION TOGETHER and YOU'RE GOING TO SEE WHAT YOUR GUY GUARANTEED!"" but as you can guess; he said he listened to the conversation, and ""there was no GUARANTEE, but try their best to help me!"" This means that I'M LYING! Can you believe that? The salesperson is claiming the customer as a LIAR!!! WHAT KIND OF CUSTOMER SATISFACTION POLICY IS THIS?!!!

Then, he claimed that the quote that I got from Miata is not REAL, there is something wrong etc. Then, they tried to price-match, but this time gave me other extra fees... Do you get the point?!!!
They don't want to make business, but waste time.
They tried to bring me different issues such as I'm not qualified for 0 downpayment and 0% APR... Next time, the salesperson went and came back and asked for the $2,000 downpayment. I offered $500, he looked like he would accept, but again said NO!
Lastly, he said that I have to wait 48 hours for the approval, and after that I can get the car.

As you can see here, they try to deceive customers; they promise / GUARANTEE that they are the BEST and they can give the BEST PRICE or price-match; but IN REALITY, THIS IS TOTALLY A LIE!!!

I felt really bad and expressed my opinion, but instead of trying to make me relaxed and feel comfortable, he acted like he wanted to kick me out!

They checked the MIATA's quote, after realizing that they cannot do the price-match, they claimed that this quote is NOT REAL :)) so funny, right?
Is this the professionalism? Is this the BEST & BIGGEST Toyota Dealership in North California?!!!

Please, don't tell anyone you are making THE BEST BUSINESS!!!",6,73,-1

Took the van in numerous times to have the leather fixed (Dealer works), the pannel on the drivers seat , trim on driver window coming down when window was rolled down, chair arms tightened, blue tooth system reset and several trips back (including leaving both my phone and van there), arm bolt covers reinstalled numerous times, and much more. Each time they fixed the problem i ended up going back and leaving my car. The last few times the panel on the driver seat came off they started hassling me. One service manager tried to charge me to fix it. Each time i insisted that they fix the problem at their cost. Then I started dealing with a service supervisor. He seemed really helpful in the beginning. ..then after the last time the seat frame came off he ordered parts and had me bring it in. When I came to pick it up to my suprise the paperwork said things like ""one time good will fix"" and seat problem due to outside source or something to that effect. And after market seat heater etc. I refused to sign the paperwork and left. I called and played phone tag with Cole for about 2 weeks then finally got him. I told him I bought the van brand new from the dealership so how could anything be after market? I have owned 3 other siennas and never had these problems. Also what outside influences? ?? I am large but am 80 lbs lighter than I was with the other 2 vans, so if its not my fat butt what could it be? My children are older and totally out of the kicking my chair phase. Other than being irritated I have never yelled or swore at anyone at Toyota! Our last conversation where he basically told me this was my fault ended mid sentence (me speaking) with a dial tone. I called him back and got his voicemail, so did he hang up on me??? I have been planning to go back and purchase a car for my daughter.....not so much now!!! I will be talking to my lawyer in the near future. I have never hated a vehicle I have purchased from this dealership.before now I just wish they would take it back!! Oh and I have also taken it to Maita several times because its closer. ",6,73,-1
62174,21-May-15,"I recently purchased a used 2015 Ford Fiesta from this dealership.  After researching this particular model car I found a car on Roseville Toyota's website.  Talked to a nice salesman who seemed really enthusiastic about working with me on financing (I have poor credit). After several days, the salesman calls back and says that the bank prequalified me and to come in and drive the car. I made an appointment for 5:00pm that day to meet him at the dealership.  I arrived at 5 but the salesman was nowhere to be found! Instead I got passed off to some older salesman who didn't seem to care about me or making a sale.  I told him that I had been prequalified and wanted to drive the car I had seen on the website.  No such car existed!  He said that it had been sold and that the dealership just forgot to take it off the website.  We did find an identical car on the lot with 2 more thousand miles on it but the price was $1K more.  After arguing about the price difference, I decided to drive the car. Some test drive!  He just sat quietly while we drove one time around the auto mall. He didn't even try to sell me the car!  No explanation of the cars features, etc.  Thank goodness I did my research on the car.  We get back to the dealership and start the negotiation process. They did drop the price to match the one that supposedly was sold. 2 hours later and we finally hammered out a deal that worked with my limited budget.  Another hour of signing papers, getting 6 references, going online on their computer to print verification of insurance. Then another round of signing documents with the finance manager who misrepresented the factory warranty on the car so he could push the dealership's pricey extended warranty (which I turned down). They did beat me down on the gap insurance.  Then I was finally shown the door where the salesman gave me the keys and said enjoy the car. I drove home tired and hungry. A few days later, I was told that I had to bring my 78yr old mother in as a cosigner even though I had listed me spouse who is employed full time on the original credit application.  I was not happy and let them know that I was not going to put my mother through the ordeal that I had gone through.  The assured me that it was going to be quick.  We came in and no finance managers were available!  After demanding to see the manager of the dealership, we were finally shown to a desk where we signed all new paperwork.  The one bright spot was that somehow the gap insurance price became lower which lowered my payment slightly. Oh and my mother had to provided 6 additional references which were offered to the finance person but refused.  Another day later ring, ring and low and behold it's the dealership asking for the 6 references!  I sent an email back with them.  I still haven't received anything about the finance company that actually approved me for the loan.  GRRRRRRRR",6,73,-1

62192,29-Dec-14,"BUYERS BEWARE, even if you have a signed contract, made a $2,000 down payment, and made your payment on-time, Roseville Toyota may still try to take your vehicle back from you after 37-47 days.

Since I had a previous bankruptcy and a newer job, I sought out special financing at various dealerships. After speaking and working with the special finance staff at Roseville Toyota, I purchased this vehicle from them on 10/25/14 and gave them $1,000 as the down payment.

Within 10 calendar days, Roseville Toyota found a lender to finance the vehicle for me with my credit and work history but based on terms different than what was agreed to on 10/25/14. Roseville Toyota requested I come in to re-sign another contract with an additional $1,000 down payment; which I did on 11/04/14.

On 11/15/14, “Armando” called requesting proof of residency for the other two individuals residing at the home. He said acceptable examples of this proof were paystubs, utilities bills, bank statements, etc. I sent via mobile text photos the documents to “Armando”.

On 11/18/14, “Cara” called stating they still needed the information requested by “Armando”. This time, I sent two emails with attachments to “Armando” and “Sean”. After sending these emails, I received no further communication from Roseville Toyota until 12/11/14.

On 11/20/14, the DMV titled the vehicle with me as the registered owner and mailed the proof of registration.

On 12/11/14 (47 calendar days after Contract #1 and 37 calendar days after Contract #2), individuals from Roseville Toyota called me to tell me I have to return the vehicle. They said the lender kicked the loan out and they weren't going to finance the vehicle for me.

On 12/12/14, I spoke with individuals at Roseville Toyota and they threatened me with vehicle repossession, application fraud and legal costs plus fees associated with reclaiming ""their"" vehicle.

On 12/15/14, I spoke with the special finance manager who said due to lack of lender financing they need the vehicle and there's no in-house financing available with Roseville Toyota; a member of the Sullivan Auto Group. I explained to each of the callers the situation as I saw it on both Contract #1 and Contract #2: ""Seller's Right to Cancel"". They had me come in within 10 calendar days to re-sign. Either way, it was already past the 10 calendar days for the Seller's Right to Cancel. Roseville Toyota and Sullivan Auto Group should be held responsible for their actions of harassing, intimidating, threatening and lying to a buyer/consumer.

On 12/19/14, the 1st monthly payment of $344.40 due on December 19th was delivered to Roseville Toyota via USPS Certified Mail.

As the ""Buyer"", I held my end of the contract on multiple occasions. As the ""Seller-Creditor"", Roseville Toyota should hold their end of the contract by finding a lender on these terms or to in-house finance the vehicle within their dealership or Sullivan Auto Group. I believe they also have a business by the name of ""Sullivan Auto Credit"" so it is difficult to believe that they are unable to ""in-house finance"" as they claimed by phone.",6,73,316
62195,24-Nov-14,"on 11/23/2014, I was lured to Roseville for a vehicle that was posted online. I called Roseville Toyota before travelling several hours to ensure the vehicle was present and available. I was assured by Shaun Thornhill that the vehicle was still available & in stock before driving 3 hours one way.  I made an appointment to view the specific vehicle that was advertised on their website.  When we arrived, their staff escorted us around their lot in (what appeared to be) a staged attempt to locate the vehicle that I traveled to the dealership to view.  It appears that they calculated this deception so I would walk around their lot & give them the opportunity to interest me in a different vehicle. During my visit to Roseville Toyota, several staff members attempted to interest me in a different vehicle.  I was later informed confidentially by an uninvolved salesman that the vehicle that I drove to Roseville for had been sold several days prior.  The staff attempted a bait & switch. The vehicle is still listed on their website as available.  This deceptive, unethical, practice took business away from other dealers in other areas. Shaun Thornhill is now dodging calls from me.

Eventually, we get in a car to drive around looking for them. None to be found except for one with 175000 miles and ridiculously overpriced. We express interest in the meantime in a new Avalon, and no one bites. We ask them to give us a call (for some bizarre reason) about the real price on the high mileage V8.

62222,14-Dec-13,"My husband and I purchased a used 1999 Camry from Roseville Toyota in 2002.  Our experience then was fine.  We love this car but after 227,000k miles, it was time for another car.  We went it in early November and we were greeted by a friendly, younger male (don't know his name).  After asking a few basic questions (horsepower, gas mileage) about the newer Camrys, he said she was going to get someone else with more experience and who was more knowledgeable about the cars.  Not good that he didn't know himself but he was smart enough to get someone who could help us.

We drove a Camry Hybrid with Chan.  We liked him but I did not like the way the hybrid drove.  After doing more internet research I decided that I would look at the Camry V6 and the Acura TL.  I went back in early Dec.  I asked for Chan but I was told he left to start his own business.  I worked with Hamid who was a nice, friendly young man with 6 months experience at this dealership.  He also told me he owned a 1997 CamryV6 and a 2012 CamryV6 so he had experience with the car I own and the car I wanted to test drive.

We took a red Camry SE V6 out for a spin.  I really did like the car but I was not ready to buy because I did not have my husband with me and I still wanted to test drive an Acura TL.  He said we could just run the numbers so I could go back and let my husband know what our cost would be.  He also said he would get some payment for bringing me inside so that would help him. I agreed.  He had me fill out some paperwork but without my SS# so my credit would not be checked at this point.

After waiting for about 20 minutes, Andy, a finance person came out.  He verified the car I was looking at  and asked me how my credit was.  I told him it was ""not that great"".  He spun away and disappeared for another 20 minutes or longer.  He came back and set a paper down in front of me that showed me payments of $575/month over 60 months with $5000 down.  This is on a car that was listed at $21,000.  I am sure my eyes popped out of my head.  I asked him what interest rate this was based on.  He told me 15.99%.  I told him we were approved at our credit union for 100% financing, $25,000 at 5.99% for a max of 72 months.  He said, ""well, it would have helped if I knew this before.""  I thought to myself, ""you never asked"".  I told him the credit score I got from Equifax and he said he was sure he could beat or match our credit unions financing.  I found him to be arrogant and rude. 

I went straight to Niello Acura where the experience there was wonderful.  I ended up very happy with a certified 2010 Acura TL with 18,000 miles with a payment of $372/month over 72 months and $3000 down.  I don't know what kind of math they are doing at Roseville Toyota but I can't imagine paying more than $200/month for a Camry!  

Also, I don't understand why the sales staff does not know the answers to simple questions about their cars.  I understand not knowing all of specs on all of the used cars on their lot but they should at least know about the Toyotas.  In fact, I asked Hamid what the gas mileage was on the V6 Camry. He told me it was 25/35.  In reality it is more like 19/28.  He should have known this if he owns the car!

I would still consider buying another Toyota but not from Roseville Toyota.",6,73,-1
62223,28-Aug-13,"Came here a few months ago to get a car and they tried for hours to get me to buy a car I did not even want. I told the sales man several times the color I wanted and the options I wanted and every time he said he had one they would bring it up for me to see it was a different color or did have the options. I told him I would wait until he found the right car and then get it from him and he said there were none in California. I went home, got online, and found one at Modesto Toyota, bought it online for 3,500$ less and picked it up the next day. The car is perfect. I took it to Roseville Toyota for its first service and to have a button replaced that never worked and they kept the car the whole day and never fixed the button. The service guy said he would call when the car was done and I had to call him at 430 in the afternoon just to find out he did not even get it fixed, CRAP. So here it is a week later I have yet to get a call about the button being in. This is a Toyota there a millions out there how hard is it to get the button. This place sucks you will get a better deal on your car in Modesto and the people there were great. I am now trying to figure out if it is better to get my service done in Auburn instead of Roseville, If they are trying to get people to come here it not working!!!

62224,27-Aug-13,"Went to this dealership after i got pre-approval letter qualification offers in the mail.  Called them ( spoke to Andy Acevedo of special financing ) and inquired and was told that they acknowledge that letter and asked about my job and credit score. I informed them ahead of time about my challenged credit 640 not once , not twice , more than 3x and made it clear i didn't want my credit run so many times.  Andy said ""Ok, you're fine, you should be ok."" After about an hour, he came out of the office and said, let's go ahead  and find your car.  I said, "" what?   Am I approved, he nodded with a big smile and said yes.  I asked ""but what's the % rate"",  He clearly stated, "" you got approved for a 0%"".   I said, "" That's great but I wasn't really expecting 0 %"" and he went on and explained about how special financial department works and that since he's selling a lot to customers, finance dept would grant it so he can bring more cust. in.  ???  So we went around the lot, had my test drive that turned out to be the worst nightmare in my history of car purchase.   You all know what happened next.  I signed all the papers and brought the car home , as they took my otehr car as trade in.  We had the chance to enjoy the vehicle for 11 days until finance dept. (Zack) called and gave me unacceptable options which we didn't take and so was told we had to return the car.   I was so upset but was never rude.. He apologized ( sincerely I would assume ) but he wanted the car back like that same night which I didn't agree and explained it's unacceptable, I didn't have any clue at all??? All along i thought the deal has been finanlized now he's telling me no bank would finance it unless blah blah blah.  I told him again how frustrating and upsetting it is and he said he understands, I hanged up the phone.... Thought about it overnight... researched and learned that it's not the first time it's happened to customers of this dealership.... learned about what they call "" spot delivery"".  I just thought, ok, we'll just return the car, don't want anymore headache,   we shouldn't have trusted them in the frisrt place but then again it hurts to think that they've taken advantage of you.  So, I planned of returning the car the next day and just get myself a used car.  Woke up with missed calls and VM's from tyhis dealership , one of which I returned and spoke to a guy from finance named "" John "" ( director./ head  of fiannce I heard )- I wrote his name on my notebook  just in case.  We went over it again .  My initial question was ""  what happened there?"", I didn't have a clue that financing was still pending??""  I was given the impression that it's been approved, and since i was signing papers w/ Toyota finance on it, I thought they finaced it.  He explained and asked  me "" why there are 3 cars in the credit report?? "" My reply :  Well , they asked me that prior to purchase and I told them , one is being paid by a cousin and they didn't say it would be a problem. Then he asked ,  ""you have a missed payment with Toyota"", what was that all about, Again I said,  they asked me that too prior to purchase and even asked me to write down the reason.  He's starting to sound sarcastic and so I said.  """" Well isn't that the reason why you ran the credit?? to check and see , if a deal is even possible??? I mean if you're doing it for a while, you could have already known???  ( at that time i had 9 notifications of credit check ).  He replied "" Well, what do you think?? Do you really think it is possisble to get financed w/ 3 cars??? .  This made me more so upset that  I was crying out of rage and  said "" Why do you sound like you're blaming me for even purchasing the car??? I should have read all the reviews about your dealership before I even went there.  They are all true and I cannot believe it's happening to me. And you know what? you're are being rude.  All I wanted to hear from you at least is that you sincerely apologize for what happened ""  He raised his voice and said "" and now you are giving us accussations!!.  I hanged up the phone, feeling so terrible. I asked my husband to go ahead and return the car.  then I got a call from Robert , from sales dept. I believe, who offered to be our contact.  He at least sincerely apologized for what happened and offered to be the POC. I asked if they will still buy the car that is in their possesion  for 2 wks and they agreed.  They faxed papers for us to sign , faxed it back.  Gave them time to process, followed up after a week... pending... after another week... was told check has  been ,mailed... after another week ( this week ) , I was told "" Sorry , they'll have to wait until the title transfer is completed. Who wouldn't be angry at this time??? I checked TOyotafinancial website for that car we're selling about 2 wks ago, it showed that it's been paid.  I e-mailed finance dept. , no reponse. Got hold of Robert , who again apologized and offered to help w/ the process and all.

My attempt to purchase a vehicle from Roseville Toyota was the WORST experience I have ever had buying a vehicle.  I could go into detail of how the interaction transpired; but I will try to keep it brief.  I hate leaving bad reviews of any kind (if you can’t say anything nice…), BUT the person I dealt with at this dealership was all kinds of bad.  I didn’t ask him how long he has been in auto finance, but I will in the future.  The “Special Finance” department’s physical location and decoration (or lack thereof) is a great indicator of what the company thinks of those particular types of customers. It basically a warehouse that is made up of three primary colors: grey, grey and greyer. 

The décor was a small thing compared to the shady, unethical and unprofessional manner I was treated.  I completed the initial process online and submitting my personal information. I then sent electronically my documents ahead of time to ensure that if there were any issues, that would make the purchase not happen, I’d save myself the hassle of someone driving me 60 miles on a Sunday afternoon. The process started on a Thursday and my appointment was on a Sunday, plenty of time for anyone with a clue to know if something was a “go” or not.  Suffices to say, I went to the appointment as planned on time with a family member. Went over the process, was shown a car not they type I wanted for $3,000 more than I wanted to spend, and then ended the appointment with the finance guy telling me a bold-face lie and no vehicle.  That would have been bad enough, but two days later and 13 (yes - THIRTEEN) hard credit inquiries later, this guy would not return a phone call. I ultimately had to send him a sternly written email to get him to reply.

Dear Roseville Toyota,

As a matter of saving the universe from your less than above-board practices, might I suggest you divert some of those advertising funds, for publications that obviously are not your target audience, and invest in ethics and customer service training for your employees.  On your website you promote your dealership as honest and straightforward, unfortunately I experienced neither.  In the future I will return to companies that treat their customers with respect. Such as Folsom Lake Toyota and Kuni in Sacramento, where my household has purchased three vehicles collectively over the past 10 years. I will also encourage everyone else that I know who wants to buy a vehicle to do as well.

62228,29-May-13,"I visited the Roseville Toyota dealership on 5-28-2013 to look at Prius models for purchase. I purchased a new 2008 Prius from Roseville Toyota previously. 

Prior to arrival, I had multiple email exchanges with seller Brittania Petersen, since I live 125 miles away. I wanted to make sure advertised models were still available. I communicated with Ms. Petersen about the availability of the two Prius Two and one Prius Three on special, and she confirmed that the dealership still had the sale vehicles as late as Sunday evening. I was unable to travel to the dealership on Monday, but communicated again with Ms. Petersen late that day and said I would be at the dealership on Tuesday. I recognize it was my mistake to not confirm again availability of vehicles, but I incorrectly assumed Ms. Petersen would let me know if they were not available, especially since my communication with Ms. Petersen (both email and phone conversations) involved inquiries about availability of the advertised vehicles. The email string to which she last responded on Tuesday afternoon (1:19 pm) had made this clear. 

Upon arrival at the dealership I waited 10 minutes for Ms. Petersen to come out to tell me she was with another client and introduced me to another sales representative who would serve me. The salesman immediately started discussing other vehicles as he walked me into the lot, because he said it had been a very busy weekend. He repeated that he'd help get me in a vehicle as close to the sale price ""as possible."" I affirmed I wanted to start with the vehicles on special. The salesman appeared to have no idea of the sale price, because after I insisted I wanted to see the vehicles on special, we headed back inside the dealership so he could look up the vehicles and their price. I don’t understand why he didn’t start with this. But supposedly one remained, which by the way was NOT the color of either of the two models Ms. Petersen said were on sale in the Prius Two category.

We walked the sales lot to the likely places the vehicle might be and then walked entirely around the sales lot. The salesman then said it must be in their other lot ""across the street."" After walking some more to find a key to a vehicle to drive across the street, we secured a key and vehicle and drove to this other lot--which was actually 3/4 mile away. The salesman then proceeded to drive around trying to get a car to respond to the alarm button of the supposed sale vehicle. 

Ridiculous. 

After the unsuccessful search and return to the dealership headquarters, I said I was leaving and asked the salesman to call me when the car was found. I said I was off to another dealership to look at another model. 

I never heard back from Roseville Toyota. No apology, nothing. I guess they were busy trying find their lost car. I now wonder if it ever existed.

The irony: I wanted to view the specials against other vehicles with more options. But if we couldn't even find the specials, or, perhaps more to the point, I couldn't get a straight answer, they weren't going to get my business.

62229,13-May-13,"TOTALLY UNPROFESSIONAL -  RUN AWAY AS FAST AS YOU CAN

We went in to purchase a land cruiser.   They said they could match the written quote we had from another dealer which was $200 dollars over dealer invoice.  Quote ""it is not worth losing a customer to sourthern california over the price.""  Before arriving we had already sent them the exact quote from the other dealership.  Three dealers in LA were already bidding for our business.  This dealership was condescending.  One would think when both buyers have credit rating over 800 with income in the top 2% of all Americans the car dealership would act in some professional manner.  Instead they wasted 2 hours of my time.  You can rest assured that I am now sending them a bill for my time at my normal billable rate per hour.

Roseville Toyota uses sleezy used car lot salesman tactics.  Makes me really wonder if they did this just because we are female or if they act so badly to all of their customers.  They wasted my time showing me how to get monthly payments down by extending the months to pay it over when all I wanted was the cost of the car out the door.   I did not need their help with the financing.  I guess that the sales staff must have flunked math class because no matter how you divide it out the final cost of the car is still based on the initial cost of the car out the door.  They never moved from MSRP.  

They also advertise a military discount.  This promotion is running on a sign on their showroom floor .  I had submitted my request in advance to USAA and knew exactly what the Toyota dealers in Northern and Southern california were supposed to quote for this military discount as well as for the few extra options for this car.  It seems their support at this dealership for our military is all lipservice.    

If you want a new car call David Sanchez at 714-522-6144. He is the Internet sales manager at Power Toyota in Buean Park and he will give you the best deal available.  Buena Park was no hassle, no haggle policy.  They even threw in the accessories I wanted at no extra cost and matched the USAA financing rate.  Basically for the 6 hour drive I saved $7000",6,73,-1

62231,08-Mar-13,"We visited this dealership to buy a new Sienna. With lots of discussions we agreed on a price with 0% APR as advertised by Toyota. When we signed the sale deed, FI guy spent all time in selling the warranties and insurance and no explanation for the sale deed figures. Already exhausted, we assumed all was as per the discussion and signed all. After returning home, we reviewed everything and were shocked and horrified to find that we were charged 5+% APR which escalated price by $5000 over 5 years payment duration. We went back the next day to get this fixed, waited for 2 hours and then were sent back as FI guys were busy. We came the next day and with their GMs intervention, things were sorted out. After a couple of days we realized the warranties were not needed for us and went for another visit to cancel that. Waited for 1 hour and then again we were told to come after some time even though it was mere 5 minutes job to sign on a paper for cancellation.

62238,09-Apr-12,"We found a truck we were interested in online and requested a price quote.  The quote was emailed to us and was followed by an email from Richard.  We decided to go look at the truck since the price was right and it looked like a nice truck.  After meeting with Richard and looking at the truck, we decided to take it for a test drive.  The truck was listed at $11,998, but was in excellent condition with low miles.  I asked why it was so cheap and if something was wrong with it and Richard just responded that since they're a Toyota dealer, they try to move the Dodge trucks off the lot quickly.

About 2 hours into the process and after paperwork was being filled out, we were informed that the online price and the price they had emailed to us was incorrect and the best they could do was $14,988!  Richard talked to several people and they weren't willing to budge on the price because of what they paid for it. Richard was pleasant to work with and I'm not sure he had any say in the pricing.  An interesting note on this: I had brought the email with us and had showed it to him before we even test drove the vehicle. 

We decided against the truck and after leaving the dealership, I decided to call back and talk to the sales manager, Charles, to see if he could offer any help.  After calling twice, I was able to talk to him.  When I explained the situation, his response was, ""well, people make mistakes and it happens in every industry.""  He didn't offer a solution, to help or even look into it.  When I told him what truck it was, he actually laughed at me, saying I should've known that a 2008 truck with that low of miles wouldn't be priced at $11,988!

I've been a sales manager for years and would never treat any of my customers that way.  Offering a solution or at least saying you'll look into it is part of being a manager and being in customer service.  I completely understand that mistakes can be made, but it's how you correct them that matters.  I have other friends who have gone to this dealership as well and have had problems and complaints.  I would strongly suggest people to think twice before going to this dealership.

The funny thing is, we found the exact same truck (same year and features), with less miles for the incorrect price it was listed for online!",6,73,-1

62244,16-Nov-11,"We visited Roseville Toyota to look at used Tundras, and to entertain the possibility of trading in our current Toyota Tacoma. We knew we could sell our truck as private party, and could get the current Kelly Blue Book value for it ($12,000). When we saw a used Tundra on the used lot, the salesman had asked about Tacoma for a possible trade-in, and had even mentioned that Tacoma's hold their value, and that it will sell quick. We really liked the Tundra we saw, so we went into the showroom to see what they would offer us for our Tacoma. We expected to be low balled, especially when trading in a vehicle, so we were expecting them to offer us 6-$7000. The salesman asked us for our keys so he could look at the mileage, vin #, and overall interior condition of our truck. Once he came back and offered us $3900 for our truck (YES $3900!) we were a bit insulted, and were no longer interested in a trade-in option. Before we knew it, we looked outside and the used car sales manager was in our truck, and driving it off the lot! We had never been introduced to the used car sales manager (Lance Duarte), let alone did he or the salesman ask if it was okay that they ""test drive"" our vehicle, or see if we needed anything from our vehicle (my purse, and work computers were inside the car). We understood that if we were seriously considering trading in our truck, then of course the dealership needs to test drive our vehicle. That wasn't the problem. The problem was that after they insulted us by offering $3900 for our Tacoma, they then took the liberty to take the keys, and drive it off the lot without our permission. We were very upset and immediately wanted to leave. The sales manager brought our car back. When we explained that it wasn't appropriate for him to take our truck off the lot without asking us first, his response was ""You gave me the keys."" 

We had never been introduced to the sales manager, nor did he introduce himself. After we left the lot, we received a phone call from the sales manager. When we told him why we were frustrated, not only did he NOT apologize, he continued to defend his actions and blame us for giving them the keys. With that being said, we will not be returning to this dealership, nor will we recommend this dealership to anyone. Too bad, because the initial salesman was great (Chris, I believe, is a recent hire), and we were not only considering trading in for a new vehicle, but looking at the possibility of purchasing another Toyota vehicle as well.

On sunday at 1pm I went to roseville toyota. looking to buy a new tuck but not rushing into it.when we sat down to talk about the the price and financing first thing I asked was how long it will take to see If I am approved for the 0%. the salesman told me about a couple of minutes. I said are you sure because I will need to take my diabetic medication soon.which I left at home.he told me it would be quick.I told him all I wanted to know was if I would qualify for the 0% and how much they would give me on my truck for a trade in.he keep pushing to take a test drive in a truck that I did not even want to buy. I kept telling him I dont want to drive it cause I know how it drives cause I already own one but he would not let up.It has now been over an hour and still no answer on the financing which he told me it would be a couple of minutes.then comes out the sale manager who added more pressure on me by getting me to buy a truck I did not want. it has been over 3 hours now and still no word on the financing and I had already told the salesman and the manager that I would need to go home and take my diabetic medication because I was feeling week and getting a headache and feeling sick.I did have my coworker there with me who witnessed all of this.they had asked for my truck keys within the first hour I was there.I had asked for my keys so I can have my coworker take me home and take my medication.they ignore my request and kept my keys.and moved my truck some were else and locked it with out me knowing about it.we have not even made an agreement on my truck for a trade in. It has been over 4 hours and I feel that my blood sugar is getting low and I don't feel like I have the capacity to make a sound decision.I believe they took advantage of my condition.I ended up signing the documents under distress because I was feeling very week and had a big headache and I told them several times I was not feeling good and that I had a headache. they keep saying we are almost done after many hours later.If I would have had my truck keys I would have had my co-worker take me home so I can take my medications but I could not do that since the salesman had my keys and did not want to give them to me just so he can make a sale.with regards to how I am feeling.they took total advantage of my sickness and something needs to be done about it. these sales people are very calloused.Like i said before I had asked for my truck keys so I can go home and take my medications and they did not seem to be concerned about me taking my medications. because they kept telling me we are almost done but we were not. I did not get out of the dealership until after 10:30pm.looking back at what happened at the dealership I believe they knew what they were doing. trying to wear me down knowing I needed my medication and they have my truck keys so I could not go anywhere. If they really cared about my well being and my health they would have giving me my keys so I can get my medications. but I guess it's more important to sell a car than a person's health. this all happened on 7-17-11",6,74,30

62288,13-Dec-18,"About 6 months ago, I found a Subaru I wanted at this place so I went in to make the purchase. The sales rep we had was actually nice and relaxed (Jose Leon, super nice guy) but once we went inside the sales team leader (Richard Abboudd) was absolutely terrible. He talked really fast and was acting very manipulative, completely overwhelming me, my mom and even Jose. When he brought out the numbers, there were multiple high dollar charges he tried to sneak under my nose (engravings on the window, maintenance agreement, key scratch guard, xxxx I didn’t need), AND HE KEPT TRYING. He would come back with the charges gone, but would add a super high increase on the interest percentage and vise versa. (I should have just left right then...) 
I purchased the vehicle and left the lot semi happy with the price I got it for. Not even a mile down the road, the check engine light comes on. Awesome..
I took it back immediately and they said “oh it’s nothing”, and literally just reset the light. I had to take it back 6 TIMES over the course of 2 and a half months or more, and they were never able to fix it. The car was even sent to Subaru twice and they also said they couldn’t fix it. (It was an electrical problem, multiple sensors kept going out). I met the sales manager (Drew Holbrook) and he said “If we can’t fix it one more time, we will take the car back from you.” He was super nice and understanding at first. He wanted to “help me out and make it right”. 
Of course the light came on 2 days later. So I took it back, and guess what, the manager Drew proceeded to ignore me for about 2 weeks no matter how hard I tried to see him. Finally I went in and spotted him hanging by the coffee. (Got you now!)
Drew literally said, “I know we sold you this car which seems to have faulty sensors and electrical problems, but you drove off the lot with it, it’s yours. So the best we can do is a trade-in”... ARE YOU JOKING??? I’m about to loose a ton of money. I would have completely lost the $5000 down payment I made, as well as have to now owe $6000 on my financial loan. I was blown away by his response. Ya, I drove it off the lot, but the xxxx check engine light IMMEDIATELY came on, AND this was a certified vehicle!! He didn’t care. He was not budging.
We left in a rage, trying to look at legal aspects, but decided that wasn’t the route we wanted to take if we could avoid it. We went back to try to spark a better deal and I ended up getting a used Camry with a good warranty thrown in without loosing too much on the TRADE-IN I had to make.. xxxxxxxx.. If I would have just come in and purchased the Camry with the $5000 down payment I had, my payments on the car would be lower. So I still lost a lot of money after all said and done. The only reason I decided to take the Camry was because of the good warranty they decided to throw in. (Could have still been a better warranty but I was so tired of fighting) 
Oh and it also took them 3 months to finally take the Subaru off my name at the dmv so that was also a hassle. Luckily, the Camry has been running good with little to no problems. And I’m very happy with it. 
Just when I thought the hurt was over, the other day I wanted to use the coupon I got for “first maintenance visit 50% off”, so after my first 7,500 miles or whatever I go to schedule my maintenance. But guess what? They put a 60 day expiration on it. 
Oh, so you just do that so no one can ever really take advantage of this offer because no one is driving that much in 60 days..(They wanted to charge me $160 for oil and tire rotation). 
I hope I never have to go back to that place ever again...",6,74,-1
62304,03-Dec-17,"COMMENTS BASED ON MOST RECENT VISIT ONLY.  
Although I didn't purchase my 4 Runner at Toyota of Oxnard I have always taken it there for scheduled maintenance because it is closer than the dealer I purchased it from. I have always had a satisfactory experience and Bob Cobos has always been great. However, this last scheduled service on 12/2/217 was unsatisfactorily. Mr. Cobos was not there that day so David Pat handled my service. The appointment was schedule for 9:00 AM. I checked in at 8:52 AM. Mr Pat told me that it take 1 1/2 to 2 hours to complete the service. I told him I would wait at the dealership. Needless to say 2 hours passed and Mr. Pat came through the waiting area several times and not once did he acknowledge that I was there waiting or offer a status update on my vehicle.    

2 more hours passed without a word when I finally went to the front desk to ask about my vehicle. To make a long story short, according to the invoice my vehicle was ready at 10:36 AM. I spent 4 hours waiting for my vehicle unnecessarily. Mr. Pat offered no apologies before sending me on my way. 

2 hours of my time wasted. If I return for service in the future I will certainly keep in mind that if the service adviser is David Pat I will request someone else or go when I know for sure that Bob Cobos will be there.

62317,07-Feb-17,"I walked in to Oxnard Toyota to get some updates on the 2017 86 I was interested in leasing, only to be pulled into the office of Mr. Lee Jaitt and was being treated in a completely disrespectful way. Here are some key points of my experience:

1) Acquisition fee with Toyota is $650. It's the same with about 12 other dealers I called. Mr. Lee Jaitt insisted that the fee was $900 even after I told him I have a quote from another rep in his own dealer showing $650. 
2) I was looking for a basic 86 with no addons, halo color with the 6 speed manual transmission, and the MSRP is around $27k anywhere I called in the last 2 weeks. Instead of assisting me in finding exactly what I was looking for, Mr. Jaitt tried to shove a fully loaded 86 over $30k MSRP with all the optional TRD parts installed down my throat. 
3) He then tried to school me on MSRP vs dealer invoice price. 

I wouldn't say that I am a seasoned car buyer but I have leased 3 vehicles in the last 2 years, all with Toyota/Lexus, and have no plan to get any other brand. It's very unfortunate that Oxnard Toyota is only 1 block away from my company but they will not have my future business.

I was told the truck wasn't even for sale. My wife and I then turned around and drove back home.  When we arrived to our house, 2 hours away, the salesman called us to tell us he had another truck available. He gave us information that sounded like a great deal so we proceeded to make the trip again. When we arrived to the dealership we were told something different from what the salesman had told us. He didn't clarify certain things over the phone since he was trying to get us to the dealership again. To make this long story short, the salesman had to get his supervisor and then he disappeared. We spoke to his manager and when we were leaving, the salesman magically appeared as we were walking out. They didn't seem genuinely apologetic over us driving down there twice!",6,74,785

In fact all the people working that day were nice and helpful. The next day we brought a check to your dealer ship from our bank to pay the Chevy off.

Two months after buying the Chevy we got a notice in the mail saying we needed to bring the Chev back to the dealer because they forgot to verify the VIN in person before we purchased the Chevy and that is the reason we had not gotten our California registration or License plates yet. After another month of no registration I called the DMV department at Toyota of Oxnard and was informed they did not have the title of the Chevy and were in the process of trying to get it from another state.

Now 6 months later we still have no California registration and no license plates.",6,74,-1

The car that was sold to me though had a glued mirror, which went unnoticed until we got a car wash a month later. We immediately went in to get it fixed and they stated it would cost over $500 dollars because the damage was not covered. We then talked to Jim and he said his hands were tied and all he could do is direct us to the manager.
The manager refused to help us in any way stating it was the car wash's fault that a glued mirror that TOYOTA OF ESCONDIDO sold to me on a  PRE OWNED CERTIFIED car that passed your certified 160 point inspection broke off.

I had previously done this same thing at BobBaker Subaru in 2017 with good results. The Costco analysis printout for viewing was to have MSRP and comparison Costco saving and any dealer additions shown. Instead a piece of scratch paper had the Costco price written on it offered up by sales manager. First they tried to sell me a model with 1500 miles as a new vehicle which we had them change out to a new vehicle.  At signing a mandatory security system was added to original penciled cost and a service contract was also added that they claimed I agreed to. I noticed the discrepancies as contract scrolled by on a computer screen (someone else controlled speed of scrolling). My wife and I agreed we had not been approached about a service contract and had them modify service contract to a better term but the very overpriced mandatory security system was a bait and switch item we ended up with. We should have walked once things got fishy with demo vehicle trying to be sold as new. I received a E-mail from customer service manage Jessica Swanger as to my experience and to thank me for my business and I responded as to particulars mentioned above with no RSVP back even after a follow up reminder.

First, when you buy a car here, they will not honor a sales price that was advertised and even verified by a call to a salesman before going there.   I wish that I had read all of their horrible reviews first before buying a car from them.   Unfortunately I  ended up buying a ""certified"" used car that was less than a year old.  The first day I had it I noticed wires hanging down under the dash.  At the first oil change, I asked that it be fixed.  They also promised a wash. 
Got the car back unwashed and wires still hanging down.  Still didn't fix it.  I was then told that I needed to buy new tires since the rear tires are worn out.  The car is less than 2 years old now and I had only driven 8K miles. Only 24K on the car total and now I have to buy new tires???  I asked them to help me with tires and they of course said no ""what do you expect from a used car""  I told them I expected a dealership ""certified"" used car to be able to go more than 8K miles without replacing tires.  They told me the car had the minimum amount of tire life for safety when it was sold.  Nothing they can do.  So much for customer service.  So for all of you out there worrying about if this is a shady dealership, the answer is yes.

When we then asked to speak to either a sales manager or general manager we were told that there was five of each? That seemed extremely odd however we asked one more time to speak to somebody who could actually answer the questions that we had with confidence that they were right and truthful answers to what we were asking for this became more than they could handle Only person that seem to have any knowledge was one salesman however he couldn’t get the management people to give us just straight answers about what we could get on a Toyota Tacoma we’re not even talking price we’re talking about what features are available.  We thought we would try our luck at another store we went to another dealership and the eggs were extremely helpful however the vehicle that we were looking for was at Toyota of Escondido  so we then tried to call them and asked for sales manager of the general manager this provoked new bad behavior    They then decided that we just simply were not people they wanted to do business with even though we had spoken to them in a professional manner never using any profanity or anything other than asking direct questions and thank you and please day from that point on would send this to a system that said that they weren’t open every single time we called we finally gave up and after we gave up they then repeatedly called us and told us not to call them when I explain to them that we had certainly moved on and would be purchasing a vehicle someplace else and that we were not calling them then they proceeded to use profanity and scream at us we have many of these phone calls recorded The suppose it sales manager who was calling to scream at us told me to write his name down as I don’t care he wouldn’t give me his name so I can’t select the name on the system as to who it was that was calling and screaming at us although I believe it was two different people I hate to point out the name of the sales person who actually was kind considerate and knowledgeable I don’t want to get him into trouble this dealership obviously has some extremely bad work practices and employees,6,75,76

One of these cars was the exact same model with the same exact options and I went from 2.9 percent financing to over double digits.   I have perfect credit and have never missed payments on anything, they stated that that is the best that Toyota has to offer. What a bunch of sheisters. I made an appointment coming from San Diego to ensure that I would not be waiting around any longer than necessay    Not only was the appraiser not available at the time schedule as I was early, but they could not find a car and turned into a 2.5 hour event   The salesman were absolutely terrible and not reviewing the options on the car or warranty.  They were in a hurry to get home and only hook up my Bluetooth. Also when delivered to me there was a dent on the front of the hood. Dealing with the GM  of 33 years was no picnic, they will just smile at you and BS you that there are I other options.  I took a huge bath on a car that I purchased two months ago and his statement was that the dealership has to make money also. And to even  further my claims, please take a look at the 574 comments on yelp with the majority of them having terrible customer service, sales,etc. This is no way to treat a customer that was in there six months ago purchasing the same exact car.   I have been a professional and business for over 30 years and have never seen anything as bad as this, if I would've read the reviews before I absolutely would not have given them my business   They stay in business by taking advantage of the consumer, please do not be one of them !!!!!!!!

63082,16-May-17,"I want to make it very clear that I am not reacting irrationally and I have given Escondido Toyota every opportunity to make my experience right over several weeks. I think it's important to let other consumers know what is going on at this dealership. At best, they are dishonest. And at worst, they are trained and directed to steal from their customers. To make a very long story short, I was tasked with helping one of my employees purchase a new 2017 4runner. She has excellent income, good credit and had up to 15k cash down payment. This should have been the easiest deal this sales team had ever come across.

Instead, they attempted to absolutely rob this girl blind. Lorenzo, who is the assistant sales manager can only be described as a total xxxxxxx. It's guys like him that give care salesmen bad names. He qouted this girl almost a $900 monthly payment on a 35k loan. When I asked him to break down the costs for me, he refused. I asked him for the rate? He refused. I asked him for the amount financed. He refused. In short, he couldn't describe to me why the payment was so high because he simply didn't want to. This dealership is totally predatory. They feed on people who have no knowledge of math or who will not question them on their shady numbers. Eventually, after refusing to actually answer my questions, outside of their scripted 3 lines they are taught to say to defuse a customers questions, he simply walked out of the room and said he was done. 

I was shocked to see such a large dealership for such a large manufacturer act in this manner. In other words, if they couldn't rip me off, they'd rather just not sell me a car. I spoke to the GM, and while he seemed like he was going to be helpful, he didn't really put in the effort to help me or fix the situation. The problem with this dealership is the culture they are breeding there. It runs all the way down from the owner/GM to the sales managers, to the finance managers down to the sales people. 

Lorenzo in particular is a total xxxxxxx, who wouldn't even look me in the eye because he was lying to blatantly. We decided to go to Carlsbad Toyota and she was driving her new 4runner within an hour or two. Carlsbad did not have the car she wanted but they were able to get one from a nearby dealer within about an hour. I'd like to show you the details and differences of the two deals below:

Escondido:
Trade in value: $1500
Payment: $859.00 per month
Amount Financed: Who knows
Rate: never could find out, but my calculator was spitting out about 20%
Time taken: about 7 hours in 3 trips

Carlsbad:
Trade in Value: $2700
Payment: $500.35
Amount Financed:$30,265
Rate: 5.90
Time: about 2 hours

Summary: Anyone who buys a car from this dealership should have their head examined. They are crooks. They are breeding a culture of dishonesty that runs so deep, they would need to clean out their entire sales and management staff and wait a few years before they can clean off the stink that is attached to them. This group of misfits have no business representing a fins company like Toyota, one in which my father in law worked for almost 20 years. It's obvious that management reads these reviews but has absolutely no plans on changing the culture there. Hey Lorenzo, I'm sure I'll see you at some Job Fair soon because with an attitude like yours, not only will you soon be unemployed, but your chances of success in ANY industry are nill. Thank you Carlsbad Toyota for treating my employee with the respect and dignity she deserves. Not only will I never recommend this Escondido dealership to anyone I know, I will go out of my way to make sure nobody I know every buys a car or gets service from this wasteland.

63131,16-Aug-16,"I dropped my 2015 Corolla off for the 20K mile service and asked if they could inspect a rattle coming from the dash. The Service writer told me it would be $120 for the technician to diagnose it. I asked why  should I have to pay for it when the car us still under warranty? I told her that I would take it back to the dealer that I purchased it from and she said okay.
 During my last visit they also inspected a rattle coming from the head liner and also dust inside the fuel filler neck only to be told that they couldn't find anything wrong with either. So here I am with more rattles and dirt in the fuel neck. What good is Toyota's warranty if they aren't willing to fix anything wrong with their cars?",6,75,-1
63157,09-Jun-16,"If I could give Toyota of Escondido a MINUS 5 stars I would.  My wife and I purchased a 2016 4Runner from them.  The 4Runner is awesome, but the sales staff and finance department are dishonest and untrustworthy (or one might say liars and crooks).  The sales man and the assistant sales manager sold us down the river with our trade (the lies started here with the trade), and the finance department packed our contract with additional items that we were led to believe were mandatory (unlawful in California).  We wanted GAP insurance from another source, but the finance troll told us we had to have it in ""their"" contract.  They have a new system where you sit 4 feet away from a computer screen and are expected to read the contract, then sign off on an etch a sketch pad.  He refused to print out the contact so we could read it first.  Next the salesman was a real actor!  He decorated his office with religious artifacts and testimonial notes to make it look as if we were dealing with an honest family man.  Nonsense...he never fully disclosed the ""deal"" details after we put our cash downpayment down.  Everything was hidden, no transparency at this place.  So they packed our contract by an additional $2,600 in items that were not necessary at all.  The sad reality is that this was our 3rd purchase from this dealership!  You think they would treat loyal customers with honesty and respect.  They must be under new management since we never were treated with respect or honesty.  They have lost us as customers, and we will not service our vehicles there either.  Buyer beware...at Toyota of Escondido.  We've also explained most of this on the Toyota survey so I hope TMS gets after them to clean up their act.  Toyota makes great cars and trucks, but this dealer does not deserve to sell the brand, because they do so under a cloud of dishonestly and high pressure sales tactics.",6,75,-1

Read all the terms carefully before signing all documents. ,6,75,-1

So much to say about this dealership, first off my salesperson was great I think the employees that work here are great but the management and whoever runs this place do a horrible job. The quality of the used cars they sale here is horrible and the cars are overpriced and could easily be compare to many dealerships around North County. I recently bought a used corolla, since I am first time buyer I wanted to start off with something not to expensive. They sold it to me 1,000 dollars more than what is worth. 3 days later some paint started falling out and I noticed that it had dings all over the vehicle. I noticed that other dealerships had the same car and about the same miles for a much reasonable price, There service center is horrible they take an eternity to get things done, for a simple change of battery it took them 3 hours! The service center representatives said it would only take an hour, before that I went to get my headlights polish and it took them 5 hours! They desperately need someone to manage that place better.I'm just trying to say is that try as many dealerships as you can around the area before making a decision. There are plenty of vehicles out there, Toyota of Escondido aren't the only ones that sale cars. I made a mistake from buying a car here but I learned my lesson. ",6,75,32

What is really amazing is these additional items they """"note as needing to be taken care of'"""" are usually in the thousands above the normal service costs. It's pretty obvious that this dealership's money maker is service and these recommended items.

Next my Van was delivered to the Service department on a AAA tow truck. I was told the tow truck could not drive in and that it had to go back into traffic, go around the block and bring the car in from some back street. To the left of the service department they added grass instead of letting the tow truck turn left and go to the back from the front of the service department. Poor design! The tow truck took 20 or so minutes going back into traffic, going to all the stop light and finally finding the back of the service department building. They charged me $240 dollars for 2 hours of labor. I'm sure they rounded up. they charged me $131 dollars for a (part #15767-31020) pipe that was about a foot long. And last they charged 10 more dollars for two gaskets. This is all my error for going to the dealer. I just made them think it is ok to over charge the public. As far as the work completed.

I also paid $25 for a tire repair.  They inspected and called to tell me the tire had several nails in it.  I told them to please repair and I would gladly pay the $25.  The next week I brought the same car back for a service recall and was told the same tire had a leak because of a nail.  I informed the rep that they should repair for free as I already paid for it to be repaired the week before.  He said he would have a tech look at it and get back to me right away.  After waiting 2 hours and without looking at the tire, he told me according to the service record I had declined the tire repair.  These are my only experiences with the service department.

When I called the Service manager and explained the situation to him, he responded with ""OK"".  Pretty much nothing to assist with the issue like ""he apologizes for my stolen item"" or anything to that effect.  He told me that he would contact the other service manager and ask his team if they saw the item.  The director of service contacted me and said that none of his technician saw or took the item from my car. Of course your team would deny that they would take anything from anybody!!

We live in Escondido and had previously bought a 4Runner at Toyota of Escondido.  We visited the dealership and went through several salespeople before we found one who was ""certified"" to sell Scions.  Finally we got a salesman we talked about a white base model on the lot.  The salesman said he needed to run a credit check before we could test drive, and he would need to find another salesman because although he was ""certified"" to sell, he was not allowed to test drive a Scion, only a Toyota (don't ask me).

We went in and he proceeded to ask me a lot of questions, as if I was buying the car.  Home addresses, work addresses, monthly salary, SSN.  It was fairly intrusive for a test drive but to humor my son I played along hoping we were nearing the end.  But then he asked for 3 references who did not live at my address.  Are you KIDDING ME?  Skip tracing references for a test drive?  At that moment I politely said we were done at that dealership.  I can't imagine stepping foot in there again.

We immediately went to Heller Ford and test drove a Focus ST with just a Xerox of our drivers licenses and then to Mossy VW where we drove a GTI with, you guessed it, only a Xerox of our license again.  It's off to the Subaru dealer tomorrow to drive a BRZ.",6,75,-1

After a nice test drive with a nice young salesman, we were lured into a typical endurance contest with a couple levels of sales management above the young man who took us on our test drive. We were only there for the test drive, did not have the Matrix with us that we intended to trade, and we had a limited amount of time available. We made this clear to Warren and Robert, and they acknowledged our situation, yet they came on to us with a line about ""if we can make you an incredible deal today will you buy the car?"" So sure, we agreed we probably would, if the deal was unbelievable. From that point forward the tag team of sales reps was obnoxious at best. Offered a coke, brought us a 7-up... what was that about? Made us a commitment for a car that they would have in the showroom the following day, took a $500 deposit from us, then claimed an inability to get the car there, but requested that we bring our Matrix in and they would loan us a Camry for the weekend. Now I know they could have sent somebody to Irvine for the Avalon and brought it down for us. And I know that they could have made a decision about the trade-in value of the Matrix within an hour or two of my handing it over to them. And I know that I would have bought a car from them if they were ""good"" instead of ""bad."" But they were totally manipulative and uncooperative and unwilling to negotiate in a straight-forward manner, so I rate them BAD.

Toyota of Escondido sold  us a used car for the price of a new one. they did not give us a discount.  they even said that our down payment was only going to be 800 dollars when in reality it was 2500 or more, i don't remember because they got money from our trade In's gap and warranty that was not used. we usually get a check when we trade in a car for the gap and warranty that was not used. this time we didn't because Toyota of Escondido took it without letting us know and used it for our down payment in addition to the 800 dollars we gave them. we were clients for 7 years,, we purchased 5 different cars from them and recommended a lot of clients.. we trusted them but they ripped us off. we will not go back to Toyota of Escondido. and will not be recommending anyone.  my family and i talked to the general manager and he did nothing about it.he was rude.

63327,05-Jan-12,"I went into the dealership to have my oil changed the day before Christmas Eve. On New Years Day morning, nine days later, I noticed my heater was not blowing hot air, which I did not know at the time indicated my coolant could be low. Later the same day, I was on my way home from work and my check engine light came on. My car started running badly and my engine started making knocking noises. I pulled over and noticed there was no coolant in my vehicle.  When I pulled the oil dip stick out smoke was emitting from the engine. Needless to say my car was out of commission and I was stuck on the side of the road. I later checked the code causing the check engine light and it stated it was a cooling system failure.
 
The next day I called the service department at Toyota of Escondido and spoke with the service manager. I told him what had happened and explained I was just in for an oil change a week earlier. All the fluids in my car were supposedly checked and filled. They also checked for leaks in my cooling system. I know my car did not have any leaks because I am pretty aware of things like that. The service manager told me to bring the car in so they could do a diagnostic, free of charge. After the service technician looked at my car the service manager called me and told me they were not going to take any responsibility for the problem and told me the problem came from my head gasket blowing and sucking up all the coolant causing the engine to overheat.

How can that happen if my coolant was already low, which was indicated by the heater not blowing hot air earlier in the morning?  When I asked the service manager questions he could not answer he said he would speak with a technician and get back to me. He later informed me my engine head was separated from my block and the coolant was possibly leaking out the back.  Again...I would know if there was a leak from my vehicle but apparently I'm not a technician so my opinion does not matter. I was later told by a friend that a blown head gasket could be the cause the separation.

The million dollar question was where all my coolant went if it was just filled and I had no leaks. Plus, I had no coolant before my head gasket blew. The dealership said they could take apart the engine to find out what exactly happened but I would be charged anywhere from $500-$1000 to do so. They could not say they did not cause the problem but they wanted to charge me to figure it out.  How does that work? As far as I was concerned they should still be investigating the cause of the problem and determine why there was no coolant in my vehicle.  

Needless to say they could not prove their innocence and I could not prove they were at fault but I’m stuck with the $4500 bill to fix my car. Hmm...leaves me to wonder if my coolant actually got filled in the first place. My thoughts...probably not.  

What great service...Thank you Toyota of Escondido you can guarantee you will not receive any further business from me or anyone I know. Happy New Year!!

63328,09-Dec-11,"I am extremely disappointed with the service I received yesterday.  Upon arrival, I asked if they would take a $19.95 oil change coupon from another Toyota dealer in town upon which the fine print was pointed to which states that the coupon was to be used with a punch card for discounts.  I did not have one, however, I'm pretty sure the punch card is something that would be handed to a first time user customer.  (upon paying for my oil change, the punch cards were stacked for the taking next to the cashier's register).  I was then told that they could do my oil change for $24.99.  When I started the ignition so he could register the mileage, the serviceman (finally) noticed I had a Lexus and tried to charge me $35.99 for the oil change.  Oil is oil so I balked and I was given the $24.99 price.  That day, I was scheduled to trade my car in for a 2012 Lexus.  At the Lexus dealership, the service manager inspected my car to verify its trade-in value.  The service manager came to me and informed me that there was a fresh rat's nest on top of my battery and to be aware that rats can potentially cause thousands if not tens of thousands of dollars of damage to the electrical system and hoses, etc. under the hood.  My question is...wouldn't you think that the Toyota mechanic that serviced my car would have at least alerted me of the nest and potential for extensive damage, let alone, remove the nest when he opened the hood to refill my fluid levels and check the oil dipstick?  As I drove away upon completion of service I noticed that my &quot;oil maintenance&quot; indicator light was not even turned off.  Honestly, I am wondering if Toyota of Escondido really performed the oil change, or if they just charged me the money and did not service my car at all.  BUYER BEWARE.",6,75,84
63329,02-Dec-11,"I knew going in that a passenger side visor, even though a simple &quot;cheap&quot; part, would run me close to 100.00. But, seriously, Jennifer first quotes me at over 160.00 - after I question this she says, oh, that includes installation but they can knock off 10% of the price to help me out. Help me out?  Installation? It's 2 screws and a screwdriver.  

I can just imagine the service people laughing their heads off at the expense of a customer as they screw in two screws to install a visor for over 60.00. 

Of course I told her I could probably handle the &quot;installation&quot; myself - and, no, I don't need an oil change on top of that.  

As I go to purchase the 100.00 piece of plastic (a visor that shouldn't have stopped staying in the up position on a 3-year-old truck and apparently just went out of warranty.. riiight..) the parts cashier doesn't give me a 10% discount so I have to remind him. It still totals over 100.00 for this simple plastic part but at least I didn't let them get me for the 60.00 to &quot;install&quot; it..  

I mean, really, how is a customer supposed to walk away feeling good about a transaction where a service manager so obviously tries to rip them off - you can’t tell me she didn’t know the job entailed a screwdriver and two screws and that she couldn’t suggest I “install” this simple part myself.

Escondido Toyota would not replace the visor unless we paid the $150.00. We'd be more impressed if the sub-standard quailty if your driver's side sun visor was rectified on our 2007 Camry.

63332,20-Sep-11,"High pressure sales department is not fair in their negotiations and their customer service is terrible.  Went to purchase a used prius and left after experiencing the worst customer service I have ever received anywhere.  The salesman had the nerve to call me a few days later to ask if I had reconsidered their offer.  The salesman doesn't know how to negotiate and uses the typical sales tactics.  They want to talk about payments instead of the actual price of the car and price of the trade-in.  I specifically asked to negotiate price and not payment three times before he finally got it.  We were about $3k in difference in what i was willing to pay and the salesman wasted 2 hours of my time going back and forth to his manager.  Each time he came back, total of 4 back and forth, he offered $100-200 more on trade-in and $200 less on an overpriced prius.  Once I got up to leave someone came out of the sales office to try to persuade me.  He was nice but at that point it was too late.",6,75,40
63333,31-Aug-11,"Despite the previous negative reviews for this dealership on this site AND a family member who had a bad experience with this dealership, I initiated contact on 8/27/11 with this dealer. I contacted them through the Costco auto buying program for used vehicles because their website listed several certified used vehicles of the make/model I was searching for. 

I received a call within 10 minutes from Barry, and we discussed the specific make/model I was interested in. Barry told me that the Costco program would provide me a discount off the lowest published price. We discussed specifically that this discount would be taken off the ""Internet Special"" prices as listed on the website that day.

When I arrived, Barry welcomed me to the dealer and introduced me as a Costco buyer to Antonio Sanchez to handle my questions and possible purchase. After inspecting the vehicle and taking a test drive, we sat down to discuss the price. I raised a couple concerns about the condition of the vehicle, specifically that there were missing accessories (floor mats, cargo mat and tonneau cover), one of which was specifically listed on the website as being installed on the vehicle, and that the tires seemed excessively worn for a vehicle with only 15,000 miles on it.

Antonio went to ""speak with his manager"" about the price and returned with a write up for the car at the Internet special price, and told me it was a firm price because ""they were only making $100"" at that price. I immediately pointed out that his price did not include the Costco discount I had been told about. I was then told that the Costco discount would not apply to the Internet Price, it would only apply to the original and much higher price.

At that point, we together reviewed the dealer website where I pointed out the tonneau cover that was on the listing for this specific vehicle was missing. I was told that it was merely an option, despite it being listed under ""Installed Options and Accessories."" We also reviewed the CarFax report which showed that the dealer had mounted and installed tires, and I asked him to explain why the current tires were so worn for a vehicle with such low mileage. The response I got was that the price was still firm, and that the dealer was unwilling to negotiate at all, or even honor the previously quoted Costco discount. 

Despite this, I made a counteroffer on the vehicle. Antonio not only refused to consider this offer, but refused to bring it the attention of his manager, so I decided to leave. As I was driving away, Antonio chased me down in the parking lot, suddenly able to offer the Costco discount but unwilling to consider any other negotiations. I declined to pursue further discussions about any vehicle.

Essentially, I felt I couldn't trust the dealership anymore when it took me actually driving out of the lot for them to honor the offer they had made to me on the phone. The dealer seemed to think that giving me the Costco discount was a big concession and doing me a favor, instead of that being the staring point of negotiations because it was the pricing they had already committed to.

Guess it's still ""business as usual"" at Toyota of Escondido, and they've lost another potential customer.",6,75,-1

At this time i heard his salesmen make a remark about my wifes chest, and instead of reprimanding him he laughed wih him and then stared at my wifes boobs in a derogatory way. This was very displeasing to me and very untasteful. This was just the beginning of my bad experience at Toyota Of Escondido. The mager John then drove my car around the lot, and offered me a riducolus price for my trade in. I went to Toyota Of Carlsbad and they offered me $2500 more for my trade in then he did. Not only was his offer ridiculous, I found his behavior with his salesmen towards my wife very rude, and un-professional.

Members of my family and I have come here for years to both buy vehicles and get them serviced, but no more. The quality of people they have working here has dropped off considerably.

63912,20-Mar-09,"I initially purchased a silver 2006 Toyota Tacoma 4x4 (2.7L) truck from Bill Wright Toyota, which got turned in due to the lemon law act for an unfixable front end problem. The replacement truck (a white 2006 Toyota Tacoma 4x4 SR5), had shifting problems and poor suspension issues from the start. Multiple complaints from me yieled no help on either problem. Instead, I got the standard reply of, ""The truck is working normal."" So, out of my own pocket I upgraded the shocks ($800+ dollars), only to find out of a rear spring and shock TSB issued by Toyota. After much lobbying, I finally got approval for this work to be done - which helped my suspension problem. However, I was out the $800+ dollars for the shocks. In the course of installing the rear springs, the tech inproperly installed the differential (wrong geometry), and this took out my driveshaft carrier bearing. I made multiple attempts complaining of driveline noise and vibration with the standard answer of, (you guessed it), "" That's normal driveline noise."" Took the truck to a driveline service center that found the chewed-up carrier bearing, the wrong geometry and a bent left rear axle. I guess, according to Toyota, this is all normal. Another Toyota dealership even gave me the same B.S. about the noise (Sierra Toyota). I'm now out over $1000 in repair of the axle, driveshaft and differential alignment.

As far as the shifting problems, I had the clutch pedal TSB preformed with little help to the crappy shifting of this truck. Funny, the first truck (the silver one) didn't have this problem. Along with the poor shifting, at 50K miles the clutch started slipping when I would go into 4WD. Again, disgusted with the non-service of the dealership (and Toyota corporate), I'm in the process of replacing the clutch with an aftermarket (Clutch Masters Stage 1) clutch using a transmission shop to install it. They suspect (based on experience) that the stock pressure plate is inferior (as seen on other Tacomas), and think that it isn't holding and engaging the clutch disc properly. This effort will cost me a total of $1100.  I'm hoping that the syncros aren't worn now...

64759,24-Sep-17,"I am incredibly upset with Folsom Lake Toyota.  I took my vehicle in to have the right passenger airbag fixed and two other warranty issue.  The vehicle was late being delivered and I insisted to NOT have my car washed as I was in a hurry for another appointment when I picked up my car.  The dealership washed it anyway.  When I got home, my husband and I discovered that someone at the dealership had dropped a tool on my right front door and tried to use touchup paint to hide it.  When I called the dealership, the Service Manager said 1. We don't have touch up paint and 2. they did an inspection of my car prior.  I said fine, send me a copy of it.  Once I got off the phone, I called the parts department - right next door to the service department, and lo and behold - they had my touch up paint.  The pre-inspection report shows that I have a small mark on my right rear quarter panel, which is absolutely correct.  But not the door.   I called Jay again to advise yet again that Folsom Lake should take care of my car, as I did not cause that damage and it was not there when I had dropped my car off. It is ABUNDANTLY CLEAR that a tool hit my car.  He said that there is no way that the vehicle damage was caused by them.  I said you guys had replaced my right passenger airbag and the door would have been opened....and it is possible that the tech damaged my car.  He began to mansplain, in which I decided to bring my car in to show him the damage.  Unfortunately,  I did have to cancel my initial return appointment because of a work conflict.  I have emailed Jay and the original service advisor repeatedly to try to reschedule - and I have not received a response.  I have over 25 years of insurance experience and have appraised cars for prior insurance carriers.  I am not some woman who doesn't know what is going on.....and it is an absolute insult to be treated in such a manner.

64958,11-Feb-17,"!!!!SAVE YOURSELF!!!
DO NOT BUY ANY VEHICLE FROM THIS DEALERSHIP!!!
THEY WILL LIE TO YOUR FACE WHILE SHAKING YOUR HAND!!!
THEY WILL CUT CORNERS TO SAVE A BUCK!!!
This dealership experience has been one of the worst events I have ever gone through. I purchased a 2017 Toyota Tundra Platinum on 01/02/17. During the negotiations, I had a due bill made to have a factory Toyota OEM remote engine state put on along with an OEM center console tray and OEM black tundra lettering on the tailgate.
The Following Wednesday, the service department called me to have the OEM parts installed. Upon dropping off the truck, they did not have the proper due bills and acted as though they were not going to install the tray and lettering until I had to supply them with the proper documents. I had to get upset with them and argue that the three items were supposed to be completed that day. I finally got them to install the three items after awhile. The service department called me later to tell me that my truck was ready to be picked up. Upon receiving the truck, the center console tray and black lettering were not installed and they had installed an AFTERMARKET remote engine start/alarm system that had a completely different key fob and had wiring running from my rear view mirror to the windshield with a blue blinking light. Who installs an aftermarket alarm system in a brand new $50,000+ truck? The people that I had received the truck from had no idea what happened and when I asked them why they would install an aftermarket part the mechanic said, ""I am not sure. Most likely to save some money."" I had to drive all the way back to the dealership to get an explanation and a new due bill to remove and reinstall a Toyota OEM remote engine start system. The manager Chad Lewis said they they would give me a detail and fill the truck up with fuel for the inconvenience.
The second time bringing the truck in, I had the dealership remove the aftermarket alarm and install the OEM system. Once receiving the truck back, the aftermarket wire with the blue blinking light was still hanging from my windshield. This service department was too lazy or ""it costs too much"" to remove the whole system. UNBELIEVABLE!! The truck was filthy dirty and running on empty. I had to call Chad Lewis back and have them rush a person over with a gas card in order for him for fulfill their promise from the previous trip. AND!!! My dash was rattling like crazy because they did not put everything back together correctly! I had to call back and reschedule a time to bring the truck back in for a third time. THIRD TIME IN LESS THAN A MONTH WITH A $50,000 TRUCK!!!!!
The Third time bring the truck back, the dealership ""hopefully"" removed the rest of the aftermarket alarm system, or at least what I could visually see and also ""attempted"" to fix the rattle in my dash after multiple attempts. Unsurprisingly, the service department did not fix the rattle, or only fixed it until I could drive home, but at least they removed the wire and blue light after the second attempt.
The Fourth time bringing the truck back to the service department in less than a month of ownership they were still unsuccessful in fully refurbishing their ""hack job of an install."" My truck still rattles like crazy and makes me not even want to drive the vehicle anymore.
I feel as though this New truck has been torn apart so many times that there is no fixing it. I called the dealership and asked for a manager. I ended up speaking with Vanessa Herrera, who said that they would get back to me the following day on how they would help me out. The next day goes by and no call from any of the mangers. I patiently wait until the third day at 4pm. I called and Vanessa Herrera answers the phone and says, ""I was just meaning to call you."" Typical response from someone who has forgotten to do something. Vanessa then goes on to tell me that she spoke with all of their managers and that ""there is nothing else we can do for you."" Who tells a customer ""There is nothing that we can do"" after the dealership is the one who ruined my brand new truck in an attempt to cut corners and ""save some money.""
But wait!!!! Theres more!!!!!
After getting off the phone with Vanessa, I drove down to Folsom Lake Toyota and asked to speak to a manger who ended up being Chad Lewis again. I informed him on the entire situation. I asked him if it would be reasonable to ask for a new truck. Chad Lewis responded with saying that it was a reasonable request and referred me back to the salesman who I originally worked with who they beginning to look for the exact vehicle that I bought. I do not wish for anything more than to have a vehicle that is new and undamaged. I am not tying to con this dealership of anything. The gentleman who was looking up the trucks printed out a list of other truck from other dealerships and showed me them. I then spoke again with Chad Lewis, who said that they would get back to me on a new truck. Before I left, I asked Chad Lewis to put it all in writing. He then stated that he would not put it in writing. He said ""trust me, we will take care of you."" The next day Chad Lewis called and stated that they would not be able to get me a new truck anymore. What man shakes another man's hand and promises him something and then completely lies about it the next day? This is why we have to have lawyers for everything nowadays.
This is not how any business should treat a customer after they purchase a new vehicle.
After a month of having my vehicle in and out of this facilities shop with little success, I was driving my truck today and my truck shut off on me while I was driving and would not start back up. I believe this is due to the aftermarket alarm system that they installed. I have already spoken to and read up on experts in the auto industry and they have stated that these aftermarket systems do not work well with new vehicles and cause many problems. What would have happened if my vehicle shut off and my steering wheel lock up while I was on the highway or is a large amount of traffic? I honestly could have lost my life!! This dealership need to get their act together regarding this situation or else I will be contacting an attorney and will resolve this in my own ways.",6,78,87

Things turned sour when the negotiations changed to the purchase side.

I agree it was late and everyone wanted to get home but it was partly late because they insisted on the credit application forms prior to the price negotiations. Wasn't my fault that that they took over 90 minutes to get around to talking about the price. There was somewhat of an air of arrogance - after all you are buying a toyota right? what do they have to do to sell the vehicle other than it being a toyota.

Hated the attitude of the senior sales guy. He repeatedly told me that it was late and wanted to get home. Not my problem if you want to sell a car then who cares about your need to get home.

Anyways - turning aside from ad hominem criticisms the price negotiations were weak at best. If one refers to truecar.com I was not even offered a good price let alone a great price. I guess the opinion is one that toyota prius models sell themselves. Not so in my case. I wanted at least a good to great price and it was not forthcoming.

Maybe to give the benefit of the doubt if they are offering a vehicle at a price you want then it might be good.

65167,02-May-09,"We went looking for a Toyota Camry V6 or Hybrid. The person handling our request for information and test drive, Rahman, was very good and very friendly. However, when we expressed interest in actually buying the car Rahman brought us to David for further negotiation. Rahman took the information on our old (2005) Toyota Camry that we had discussed as a trade-in option, and also took the keys for our car so that his manager can inspect our car to fix a price for the trade-in.

David started by indicating that the MSPR was $32,000 for the standard 2009 Toyota Camry HYBRID and the invoice price was $30,000. At this point he asked us if we would buy the car right then. We indicated that we wanted to know the best price they could offer us, and then (before buying) we planned to check online to confirm if we were really getting a good offer. 

When we asked for the best deal that we could get, David was visibly upset and then he indicated that we are not ready to buy a car yet. David also indicated that we should go do all the research we wanted to and then come back to him when we are prepared to buy the car on the very same day. As a final offer he asked if we would buy the car right then if he offered to sell the 2009 Toyota Camry Hybrid for $28,000 and bought our old car (2005 Totoya Camry XLE fully loaded w/o Navigation @ 60k miles). When I indicated that I would still have to go back and check online to determine if I am getting a good deal, David said 'just a minute' and walked out. It was about 10 minutes and we were waiting there in the customer cubicle. 

As there was no sign I started to trot outside the cubicle when Bobby (Rahman's manager) walked by and asked if everything was fine. I indicated that we were discussing with David and that he had stepped out about 10 minutes ago. At this comment, Bobby went to the cubicle (where my wife was seated) and pulled a chair and said 'David walked out probably because he did not like your number' - it was a rude realization for us that the dealership salesperson walked out on us!!! And, Bobby now indicated that to 'Help us' he would now negotiate with us!!!

At this point I indicated that I would like to have the keys to my car and leave. Bobby's response - ""Yes, you can have, I am not interested in your car anyway. You wait outside and I will get that key to you."" All these comments were not in a friendly tone or gesture - he was rude in his manners, gestures, and voice. As my wife I were waiting outside we find another person (name unknown) who walks out from inside, goes to our car with the keys, opens the car and starts taking pictures! We just walked to this person and told that were no longer interested in selling or buying a car, took the keys and left the place.

Once I came home I get online and find that the 2009 Toyota Camry Hybrid has the following prices: Invoice @ $24546 and MSRP @ 26900 (Source: KBB.COM). This to me just indicates that David, while making us believe that he gave the best deal in the world, was actually trying to scam us out of our hard earned money by indicating that he would sell the car to us for $28,000 when the actual Invoiceis listed online is just $24546. At a minimum, even if round off the online price the dealer at Folsom Lake Toyota tried to cheat us of around $3000!!!

In conclusion, at Folsom Lake Toyota, not only did the sales people treat the customers in a bad way, they are also not trust worthy. David had actually indicated that he would produce the original ionvoice to us that indicates the price of $30,000 - I am not sure how he made such a statement.",6,78,-1

     1. Sometimes, they fast-talk so that customers will consent to buy options without being adequately informed.
     2. Sometimes, they ask you to sign stacks of forms and a few of those forms involve buying add-ons that they never discussed with the customer.
     3. Worse, they always add items to the sales contract on the computer screen.  When showing the customer the computer screen, they scroll down so rapidly that the customer doesn't know what options he is purchasing.  Some of these items were never discussed.  Other add-ons the customer had refused repeatedly.  They do not put a paper contract in front of the customer and request it be signed; instead, they ask the customer to sign an almost blank, miniature screen about ten times.

65201,07-Mar-20,"My wife and I stopped in to see what Temecula Valley Toyota had to offer and was met by their salesperson on the lot.  We clearly provided him with what we were interested in (a SUV) and discussed what our limited monthly budget range needed to stay within -- as we are both on Social Security. We then asked him to show us the cars available that would closely fit or needs and budget. He immediately took us straight over to a new 2020 Rav4 Hybrid and invited us to jump in.  We loved the vehicle. He said that it would fit within our budget and then the ""fun and games"" began. After waiting 2 hours and meeting several other random very friendly dealership ""VIP's"" in their sitting area we were told that the car was now NOT available, that someone else had bought it. Disappointed of course,  we were then led out to view other lower priced models of the Rav4 (which we had previously seen but did not care for at all). My wife and I decided to leave and as we were walking out the front door -- all of a sudden, we learned from the salesperson that he had some ""good news"" for us -- that the car we originally asked for was NOW available. We agreed on a price and did a deal ""handshake"". We waited another 2 hours to meet up with the Finance dept. -- and once inside, the monthly rate was far more than we had agreed to -- almost TWO TIMES more .  We, of course, had to refuse the car/deal and then we had to wait another hour for them to actually return our original car to us so that we could place our personal items back inside (they had earlier instructed us to give them our keys and to empty our car out.). As we were outside doing so, the salesperson came running after us with yet another ""higher-up"" Sales Manager by his side (we had spoken to about three other Key individuals along the way...) and we were again instructed to go back inside to meet the Finance person -- as apparently they thought the numbers came in far better that time. They didn't of course.  After sharing our complete frustrations and fussing about their ""sales process"" -- we had basically watched a whole Rams football game that Sunday afternoon we were still dumbfounded with the dealership's process. A terrible buying experience for sure. We eventually did come to an amenable  deal -- and the car was ours.

First, a warning sign, they used FOUR salesmen / manager types to try to get me to buy. All the while, until number four, no price. Number four said he would get me a good discount. I had told one and two, maybe three, cash purchase, no trade. They said it did not matter to them whether cash or finance, trade or not!!  I wish that were true!! .....  Midway through number four I was getting a bit stressed, which is the way these people operate, believe me. I wasn't the first or the last to be given this shoddy treatment. So after we had an agreement, I thought, four said ""to get this price you have to trade in your present car.""   I already had about six interested private party buyers, anybody would give me more than any dealer, so I said I will not be trading mine in (again)!!! They said then no discount. So I left having spent more than an hour and a half there, accomplished nothing, unless you call being jerked around big time accomplishing something. I would NEVER buy from them and I would NEVER recommend them to anyone. NEVER,  ",6,79,125

  If I had the option to give less than 0 stars I would. I visited this dealership on December 12th to fix an oil leak. They diagnosed it as the common Timing seal leak. Had to go on my lunch break and bring my car to the dealership. Had to take 4 Ubers to pick my 1yr old up from daycare, get home, get back to work and then to the dealership the next day. Told me my car was ready and still had to wait an hour being late to pick my kid up from daycare and payed for additional time at the daycare.
 I had to bring my car back for another oil leak 30 days later on Jan 11th
Guess what...The Timing cover was leaking again due to faulty workmanship and/or crappy sealant. They had my car for another day which caused me to have to take 4 more Uber rides. I was not offered a rental for either visit and when i asked about it they said I would be charged even though I was getting warranty work done. They instructed me that they fixed the Timing Leak but they now found a leak coming from the driver side Cam cap and it looks like someone previously resealed it using a black sealant and not Toyota's grey sealant so now its not covered under warranty and I would have to pay 3551.00 dollars to fix it. 
 As you can expect I was furious and extremely disappointed. A month later I brought it back for what looked to be another Timing Seal Leak but after checking it out they said its the Cam cap leak and it has gotten worse and it'll be 3551.00 dollars to repair and it will not be covered over some sealant. The defective first gen throw out bearing also gave out and my car stopped on the highway yesterday 3/14/2019 and is inoperable so there's that problem now but that's another story. 
  I created a case with Toyota and a case manager reached out to me to say it wont be covered under warranty because the sealant is different. The Case manager Hivi also told me the dealership said it looks like someone else worked on the exhaust before as well because a few exhaust bolts were different and any parts that aren't Toyota ie. the 1-2 bolts voids the warranty on those parts; FOR EXHAUST BOLTS!  They cannot help me because a different sealant was used even though their Toyota sealant still leaks so the sealant isn't gods gift to sealant. Basically I'm being denied coverage on a part that would be covered but because of some insignificant detail it wont be. It's just a sealant not an aftermarket part that caused an issue, not because the car is modified, not because of a part was installed incorrectly but because a different sealant was used that leaked overtime like the Toyota sealant did on me twice in 30 days causing me to spend more money trying to get around California with a 1 yr old and no vehicle. Now I'm stuck without a running vehicle with no help from the dealership other than 5000 dollars in repairs for sealant, a KNOWN crappy throw out bearing and no help from Toyota and being told I'm SOL. The fact that they treat warranty so Black & White is extremely disappointing. There is no Grey area so don't ever change any bolts, screws, washers etc on your car because it will void your warranty on those parts apparently because they're not Toyota parts. If you find your radiator leaking DO NOT put a clamp on it to get it to the dealer before your engine overheats and causes damage because it will void your warranty just let it blow your motor so its covered.
Regretting the day I bought this car and should have stuck with Nissan. Everybody from my company brings their car here but that will change. They didn't even offer ANY type of assistance, not 50.00 dollars off, not a car wash and barely any empathy.",6,80,-1

After allowing one test drive we asked to test a second vehicle for comparison  

“Are  you going to be making an offer on one of these vehicles today?” Asked our salesman. 
 He wouldn’t get the keys until I answered. 
I said yes,  and asked if people usually come here and drive cars without wanting to buy one. His answer “all the time, guys bring girls here on dates and pretend they are going to buy them a car.”   As the visit continued it became very clear that no one in the dealership thought we could afford the car we wanted.

$800 Spare, $200 Tools they don't care what happens to the customers ,As long as get rid of the car !WHAT A RISK CONSUMER HAS TO TAKE!
I decide to write  in internet,So other consumer know and suddenly after failing to get any respond
immdiately hear from dealership and they write and disclose my name in internet! How do you like that ,Their consumer gives their private info to them and they expose you ! You are private  and they are public!So upset!
in one point ,We start talking  and consumer connection suggest that I take my car to them and They take it where they can save money to get estimate!!!Instead of what is right to do ! Still let's see where they can save more buck!!!
Their goal is not to do right by you as consumer always is $$$$$ NO CONSCIOUS!
They called me several times to come and to get paid for battery and take care of things their way! 
They have no value for consumer 's safety or time that is one 's salary!
I told them ,I take it to dealership that I trust and get an estimate and bring it over .
 I find out ,When I was in  that dealership for estimate that I could buy my model car $3000 less than I paid for with none of these problems!
I PAID 30% MORE!
I called yesterday to book for my 2 oil change and they told me ,I can't get one ,Since I used all 3 of them!!! IS LIKE A JOKE! I left a message for will yesterday and no respond ,is now next day 7:30 PM after I went in person this morning to find out they are repeating the same nonesense by all different people!

He dragged us along for the whole month of December. We went in several times only to find him and 4 other sales people sitting around a desk on there cell phones.  Lou simple did not care and was so unorganized he has no idea what he was doing or what was going on. He would promise us a call back and he would never follow up. We had to chase him around.  His number and quotes changed and we missed out on Toyota thon and several other deals that were presented to us from the telephone sales department.

65983,10-Sep-17,"Who knows your car better than Toyota?  Not Toyota of Carlsbad!  I want to let everyone in the surrounding area know to BEWARE of Toyota of Carlsbad.  The frontline staff there is great, but It seems upper management is the problem.  Instead of trying to resolve the customer’s issue(s), the first thing they do is see if you always had maintenance done at their center.  I believe management has a very arrogant and cocky attitude due to the high volume of automobiles that come in for service.  That is why management just considers people as numbers instead of loyal customers.  

I am writing this in regards to the bad experiences I had at the Toyota of Carlsbad dealership.  I would be doing myself, Toyota of Carlsbad and other customers a disservice if I do not make a complaint.  Being a loyal customer of Toyota of Carlsbad for many years, I feel that they screwed me over.  Management wants you to be loyal to them, but they are not loyal to their customers.  I have tried to rectify both situations I had with Toyota of Carlsbad’s management, but I got nowhere. 

On 07/02/16, I took my 2009 Toyota Camry XLE in for a 65K mile service and 17 point visual inspection.  They only recommended that the brake and transmission fluid be flushed.  They also were going to charge me $75.00 just to replace my positive battery terminal and clean it.

On 02/11/2017, I took my vehicle in for an oil change.  The service representative recommended that I get the 70k mile service.  She explained to me all the things that were going to be done.  After the service was done is when I started experiencing issues with my vehicle.  My car was pulling more to the right instead of driving straight.  The car was shaking when I would brake and the steering wheel was making weird clicking noises.  I decided to look under the hood to see what the issue was and discovered that my power steering and brake fluids were way below the minimum level.  My windshield wiper fluid was almost empty.  My oil fluid was even low.  I have been paying for these maintenance services, and little to nothing was being done.  The multipoint inspection only noted corrosion on my battery.  

If Toyota of Carlsbad was doing inspection checks like they were supposed to, they would have made me aware of these issues I am currently having.  Toyota of Carlsbad knows not keeping proper routine preventive maintenance on a vehicle causes major problems.  Being a loyal customer, I have always had my vehicles serviced at Toyota of Carlsbad.  I called other dealerships in the surrounding area just to be sure of protocol.  They all refilled the fluids during the mile service checks.  I paid for the services to be done, but I had to do them myself.  Why on earth would Toyota of Carlsbad leave my vehicle unsafe like that?

I contacted the Toyota of Carlsbad dealership a couple of times and did not get a response back. I attempted to resolve my complaint directly with the parties involved, but nothing got fixed.  I went through this before with them over my 4Runner, so I went on their website and filed a complaint.  I then got a message from one of the customer relations manager.  At first the conversation seemed sincere, but then things got sour real fast.  Instead of taking responsibility for the dealership’s negligence, the customer relations manager tried to shift the blame on me.  These problems occurred because the Toyota of Carlsbad dealership failed to do their job properly.  I thought she was very rude, unprofessional and insensitive.  She was not listening, letting me speak and was talking down to me.  At the end of our conversation, she told me “good luck” with an arrogant tone.  After that, I received an email from the general manager of Toyota of Carlsbad.  I told him about my experience with his dealership.  He never replied back. 

I contacted Toyota Corporate and they told me to try and resolve the issues with the dealership.  I told them I did, but did not get anywhere.  One of the Toyota Corporate representatives tried to mediate with Toyota of Carlsbad’s management team.  He was very helpful in trying to rectify the problem and put me in contact with a couple of people in management of Toyota of Carlsbad.  I spoke to a couple of friendly service representatives and the service manager.  Nothing got resolved and I feel that the service manager could have offered me a better deal based on all the issues I had with their dealership.  

On 07/18/2017 I took my car back in to get inspected properly.  They told me it will cost over $8,500 to get my car fixed.  I was in disbelief and feel RIPPED OFF that a 2009 Camry with 70,000 miles could have all these problems. The 2009 Toyota Camry is said to be the worst model made that has many mechanical issues and Toyota knows this. 

A couple of years ago, the issue with my 2002 Toyota 4runner was worse.  The service department did not do the maintenance correctly and my rod went through my engine block.  They had to rebuild my engine and did not even want to cover the cost knowing it was their mistake.  Toyota of Carlsbad did not give me my money back or offered me any deals.  I had to pay for the towing of my vehicle a couple of times because there were issues even though they did repairs on my truck. I even had to pay for most of the cost of the repairs because the general manager at the time thought I should.  The frontline staff all knew it was wrong and thought I was an outstanding customer for not getting upset about the situation.  I was in the military at the time and just kept it professional.  

My door locks is another issue that is unjust.  Not too long after I purchased the car, the door locks started acting up by not locking and opening.  I have contacted Toyota numerous of times about it, but they claim there is no recall on the defective door locks although they are aware of the problem.  There is no coincidence that all the door locks can just go bad almost at the same time just as the premature power steering issues.  I have also searched on the Internet and found out that there are a lot of other people experiencing the same problems I am. Toyota is supposedly known to consistently make the highest-quality cars with the fewest defects of any competing manufacturer, while using less man-hours, fewer on-hand inventory, and half the floor space of its competitors.  Is this really true?   I use to believe this, but now I do not.     
  
Even though I am currently disappointed in Toyota and dissatisfied with their service, I would like for my issue to get resolved. The quality of repairs and service were poor.  There is always supposed to be service after the sale in order to keep customers satisfied.  The first time I did not make a complaint.  I regret it!  After these two events, I do not trust the Toyota of Carlsbad dealership anymore.  This has been one horrible customer experience!  Toyota should strive to provide “World Class Customer Service” and exceed the expectations of their customers.  This is no way to treat military members, veterans or any customers around here in the community!  This is why I want to warn other Toyota of Carlsbad customers to BEWARE!  People need to make sure that the service they are paying for is actually done.  If that means inspecting the car after every maintenance service, then so be it. 

To resolve the problem, I am asked that Toyota of Carlsbad offer a simple apology and cover the cost of the required repairs if any needed (see below).  I did not ask them to pay for everything.  I just ask them to meet me half way based on what they did to my 4Runner, the poor service on my Camry and disrespect I received from their dealership. I think this is fair and reasonable since Toyota of Carlsbad has overlooked basic duties.  I look forward to your reply and settling this matter amicably.  Thank you for taking the time to read this letter.

I ended up with flat tires 3-4 weeks after I bought the car and guess what?  The warranty doesn't cover road hazards.  It appears to only cover defective tires from the factory.  This wasn't the impression I was given when I purchased this.  Molly in the service department is clearly trained to let me pay $800 for new tires, but find a way out of the warranty.  Took her less than 10 minutes to do that I'd say.  Ivan Mendelson the General Manager and I exchanged messages today.  I just want my money back for the fake tire warranty.  I doubt he'll do anything for me at all.  My customer satisfaction level at this point is ZERO.  I still love my Prius but this dealership may not warrant your business.  Think twice.

 The lot attendant crashed my truck into a pole breaking my driver side mirror, denting and scratching the door panel as well. I could hear the guy at the kiosk talking to the attendant over the walkie-talkie saying to just ""bend the mirror back"" but it was beyond a band-aid fix. They pulled my truck down to the Service Writer's office and as I walked over, the lot attendant jumped out of the truck without an apology or eye contact. Service Writer did not apologize either, but he promised to ""make it right."" I understand accidents happen and my truck is a bit older, but an apology would have certainly been appreciated. I waited a week to see my truck again, took time off work and came out to look at the work they performed.

Full disclosure, my Tacoma is 17 years old and the paint is a bit faded, but that's no excuse to not even ATTEMPT to match or blend the paint at all. My driver side mirror now vibrates constantly and the reflection makes it very distracting to drive. Never had that problem, and even the passenger mirror is perfectly still even in gale-force winds. So now, I have a bright red driver door (no paint matching attempt at all), a broken mirror that was half-assed in the replacement and on top of it all, there's small chunks of oil or something on the interior upholstery that spread and stain when I tried to clean them. I spent all weekend re-cleaning my truck and the Service MANAGER, Dave Marchienne (apologize if I spelled your name wrong, Dave) has essentially told me to deal with it. I took it back to have the General Manager, Ivan Mendelson, look over the truck and the completely sub-par effort put forth by his service staff. He agreed the work was poorly done and we would hold on to the truck, and call me on Monday to review a few different options to make me whole. I received a call from Dave Marchienne late Monday to say they had detailed, clay-barred, polished my entire truck. Here's the problem, that doesn't restore the paint back to original condition, and it certainly did not help blend the poor paintwork performed. Now, nearly a month later, my truck looks no better than it did before the detailing they did. I'm pissed because my truck's panels used to match, and now they don't. My mirror never had problems, now it bounces and shakes, making the reflection incredibly distracting. They refuse to fix those problems they created. They didn't even offer to knock a few bucks off my service bill. What a joke. This place sucks, the service is awful and they are poor communicators.

I requested a quote to repaint my entire truck so the panels all matched, Dave never got back to me. Ivan never got back to me.  This place is a joke and I will be taking my truck to TOYOTA EL CAJON from now on, I'm sure I will be treated much better there. 

I take a great deal of pride in have a well-serviced, clean, and all original vehicle. I thought taking it to a Toyota Certified Service Center would be the best way to go, but this whole experience has left an awful taste in my mouth. 

Also, many of the recommended services are just a cash-grab effort. I was told my battery ""failed the test."" That's funny, never had any trouble with it, but I know there's more than meets the eye with vehicle charging systems and electronics so I took my truck over to AutoZone and had the perform a free battery and alternator test. Guess what? Nothing wrong with my battery or alternator! Whew! Glad I saved that $200. That's $200 of my hard-earned money that TC will never get.

My deposit transaction sheet stated that I had 72 hours to respond, which I had, but they had already given the car to the next person in line.  I was out of the Country for work, but still replied within 72 hours.  So the next 8-week waiting period, I CALLED THEM to check on the status and their reply, ""was arrival by April 20th."" So they called me on April 20th and told me it had arrived.  I went in and test drove it on April 20th and was willing to purchase it RIGHT THEN.  However, they informed me they were not willing to give me the Costco price b/c the car is in high demand, even though they PROMISED me the Costco price.  This price was $1,000 cheaper, which  in the big picture of purchasing a car, isn't a big deal, but it's the PRINCIPLE.  I was VERY frustrated with their broken promise, but I told them I would make my decision the following morning by 10AM, which my Sales person agreed.  I called them at 10AM and they told me they had ALREADY removed my name from the list and gave to the next person!!  OMG!!  SOOO UNPROFESSIONAL!!
NOT only did they back out of a PROMISE of offering Costco pricing, they gave my car away in FAR less time than they stated at 72 hours!!!  I talked with the Main salesman, Scott and 2nd main salesman, Brian....BOTH of these men had the attitude of ""who cares b/c there are several people waiting for this car."" Their attitude was SO UNprofessional that they are willing to lose a customer over THEIR broken PROMISE of only $1,000.   I have TWO teenagers in the Market for new cars and will DEFINITELY NOT be going to Toyota of Carlsbad.
I notice my $500 deposit hasn't been returned and it is WAY past time of 72 HOURS!!

My old Toyota truck going some where else.  ",6,80,155
66056,28-Mar-17,"Long story short... I purchased a certified used Camry from Toyota of Carlsbad that had a nail in the tire. I waited for an hour and a half for someone at the service shop to contact someone at the dealership (across the freeway). Richard Wood kept telling me that they left messages and they were waiting for a call back. After an hour and a half of waiting I had FINALLY had enough. I used my cell phone to get the salesman, Alex N. on the phone... he then put me in touch with Dana (the manager). Why was this so difficult? I completed the task in 5 minutes. I would probably still be waiting there if I didn't do the job for them. Richard thanked me for expediting the situation. FINALLY approval was given to replace the tire. Apparently Customer Service is not a priority at this location. Not to mention that the manager at the Service Center told Richard Wood to tell me that I waited too long to report the issue (should have been done before 30 days - I came in at 45 days)... WHATEVER !!! I will say that Richard Wood (Rich) was the only helpful person I encountered. While waiting for my car I saw what I thought was my car drive past and get parking in an adjacent lot (turns out it WAS my car). I asked the concierge if that was my car and he said NO. Really?? How does he know? Well..... Foolishly I accepted his answer. After 45 minutes I again started to really lose patience. I asked the concierge about my car.... in a very unfriendly manner he said.... ""go check with the cashier"" The cashier called and said my car was finished and that they would bring in over. I watched as they drove the car from the adjacent lot.... At this time I was MAD!!! You mean to tell me that I have been waiting almost an hour for car that was ready the whole time. What type of system do you have in place??? The person who I assume should be standing at the Check-in podium was NEVER there. You apparently don't use a paging system??? I guess at this location you just have to keep asking and hope that you are given correct information. You people really need to visit other service locations. You really dropped the ball on this one. I was happy to run over the little red cones when I left. Won't be back and definitely won't recommend Toyota of Carlsbad to ANYONE!!!",6,80,-1
66062,18-Mar-17,I was very disappointed in the condition of my vehicle upon return.  The rear vents had been opened and not closed.  Luckily I noticed before the next rain or my interior would have gotten wet.  There were several items that had been removed from the glove box and were strewn around on the floor of the passenger side.  Also my seat was tilted back and the lumbar was changed.  I have never had so many problems after a simple oil change.  I know they checked the vents and cabin filter but the vehicle should be returned in the same condition as when you receive it.,6,80,42

When service was done, the service advisor never came out to waiting areas tell you what's going on with the car. They just call you on the phone tell you to pay at the cashier and pickup your car. 

   Most other dealer would even give you a free car wash and vacuum with service but not this one.

66514,01-Jan-16,"I happened to visit this place two times (unfortunately).

First I went to their used car section, the guy greeted us with great enthusiasm, started showing corolla, he showed us 16K driven car and told the price 17K, as one of my friend bought the same car new for 16340 $ + 2K (dmv reg etc), I questioned him why are you selling a used car for 17K, he immediately showed his real nature, the first thing he said was ""I have never heard anything more ridiculous in my life"", next ""why have you come here go to where your friend bought the car from"", next was ""Go to KIA"". he was very arrogant and rude and while he was saying all this to us, we realized that we are standing near to the road and people are seeing us and smiling.

Second, after 2 days I went to their new car section with my friend who bought a new car (19340 $ on road) few days back they said they selling the car on 0% interest, 345 $ per month X 60 months with 1K down payment, which amounts to 21700 $, it should be 300 $, when I questioned how it is 0%, and he had no answer, what he said to me was, you are getting 7K per month and you are seeing 45 $ extra.

In short, this place is full of lies, no ethics, no manners, if this is their sales, god knows how will be there service.",6,80,653
66545,16-Feb-14,"I had an interesting experience.  I live in the area so I thought it would make sense to go local and see what Toyota Carlsbad could do reference a new car purchase.  I used to work with a salesman at Carlsbad who always cut out the bull and got down to business and sell a car at the best price out there.  My wife, two children, and I went to Toyota Carlsbad about (3) hours prior to closing to attempt to purchase our vehicle.  When we got there I had an appt. with Alex Ordonez.  He was friendly upon greeting but that was about it.  Has anyone ever got the feeling that they are a thorn in someones side?  Well this is how 98% of the contact went.  We felt like we were a huge burden to Mr. Ordonez and that we were wasting his time.  Rolling eyes and heavy breathing sighs indicated to us that his goal was to get us out of his office and off the lot as quick as possible on his clock (keeping in mind the store closed in 2-3 hours).  In the end, we both felt like we were a waste of his time and efforts.  We felt like we were a burden to him.  We also felt that he did not have any real interest in providing us with answers to our simple questions and that it was a chore to drive around the block in two different vehicles for a test drive.  Making a car purchase is somewhat of a big decision for a family who is about to spend 20-30k on a new vehicle.

My suggestion: show additional respect and care for your customers and show interest / enthusiasm.  What did I do?  Well, I went right back to Kevin Edgett at Toyota of Escondido and purchased a new vehicle in 2 hours the next eve.  He not only offered me and BEAT Toyota Carlsbad, but he cut to the chase and gave me the real price for add-ons such as leather seating, etc.  He doesn't bull, loves his job, and it shows.  In the end, I left with a better deal, supreme service, and appreciation as a returned customer.

My family and I won't be visiting Toyota Carlsbad anymore due to this experience most likely.  Being a fleet manager, I would expect Mr. Ordonez to show more of a representation of the dealership.  I warn those who go there and to avoid the vulture sales atmosphere.  Show some respect ",6,80,1760

66555,24-Jun-13,"    I recently purchased a new 2013 Toyota Tacoma from Toyota Carlsbad. My purchasing experience with the sales staff was very frustrating. I was handed over to 4 different salesmen including the Sales Manager. Each time I was introduced to a new salesmen I would have to start the negotiation process over, eventually all of the extra features I had worked into the previous deals were lost.

Overall I would rate my experience as poor, I will not recommend purchasing a vehicle from Toyota Carlsbad. There are several other Toyota dealers to choose from throughout San Diego County.

I was coming from south of her location through heavy traffic with my family. When we arrived she pulled up a truck that was not what I wanted and then pushed me off to a sales manager who's personality was of a rock. Insead of fixing things he told me to go look someplace else. Great sales technique!! I think it back fired on him. Little did they know I was ready to buy that night if they had been up front and honest. I took my business to Toyota of Poway where I got what I was looking for.

Oh and there was a little bit of body damage on the bottom of the bumper that no one told me about or even mentioned. the sales guy was not very knowledgeable, and treated me and my fiance like crap! and it was an all day affair. please do yourself a favor and go somewhere else, they did Toyota a bad deed on that, cause now i think that most dealers are going to do what they did.

66678,03-Feb-11,"My mother has been searching for a new car for several months now. We have been to at least 10 dealerships, and our worst experience was here. I felt like the salesperson (forgot his name) treated us like we were idiots who knew nothing about cars. When we got there, my mom asked about the Scions. Immediately the first salesperson turned his nose in air and said, ""let me get someone ELSE to help you."" Another guy comes out, shows us the Scions very quickly, then furiously tries to take us over to the Used Lot. My mom tells him he wants a new car only. He still tries to get her to look at an '09 because it is SUCH a good deal (not really, 14K for an '09 Corolla is not that great). Reluctantly, he shows her the '10s. He then proceeds to utterly confuse us by taking us all around the lot. My mom asks if the '11 Corollas are out yet. He says no. Suspiciously, he shows us some Corollas in the back that look oddly different. But then he whisks us away back to the '10s before we got a good look. Later, I look online and find out those were the '11s.  Why the deception? Either he doesn't know his stock or he is outright lying to us. Here is an example of what he told us regarding color: ""Here is the silver color. You don't want a dark color, it will get dirty easily. But if you want black, I have a beautiful black one over here. Let me show you that one!"" Confusing double-speak like this the whole time. We left this dealership more confused than when we arrived. We were completely lost on the different trims and how they are different. If I decide to buy a Toyota in the future, I will definitely not buy from here after this awful experience.

66886,18-Jan-19,"When purchasing a vehicle I was immediately greeted by sales men. “ how are you how may we help let’s make you smile! “ etc. Had to haggle and haggle with price as expected with me being a lower middle class citizen and not being able to afford an 800$ monthly payment. Long story short they gave me what I was hoping for and was a very very satisfied customer. 

A few months down the line, time for 5,000 mile service. 
The guy that greeted me in the service line started by laughing at me, telling me that they don’t give 330pm appointments which I had just confirmed around 100pm that day. He had short of told me to quit wasting his time and to go back out of line and come back another day.
 I assured him firmly that I had an appointment at said time and also asked him this which is what my review boils down to:

How come it is that when Toyota of El Cajon wants my down payment and monthly payments in their pocket the employees in charge of that do everything that can to make sure that they make a sale short of wiping my own behind, but now that I am in for service with the same vehicle, the guys on this side of the building are going to laugh at me and treat me like chopped liver and a lower class customer?

Bottom line is if you need to treat customers the same on day 100 as you did on day 1. Don’t treat me any more poor just because you got and are getting money out of me. Maybe it’s just an issue with that department ; But your business is only as good as your worst employee.",6,81,389

67082,10-Oct-17,"I had my 2009 Venza (Invoice # TOCS249952) in for maintenance as I always have each 5K miles. This time the cabin air filter required replacing. After getting the car from it's check up, I notice the glove box door wasn't closing correctly, after further investigation the glove box door was off it's hinges and was dangling. I then notice the air cable filter cover was on the floor. When I got home I had to remove the glove box and install the cover and snap back the glove box door back on its hinges. I normally have ad pretty good service with Toyota of El Cajon but this time I wasn't impressed. The battery had to be replaced due to low voltage. Now mind you our Venza only has 63K miles and for a 2009 that is pretty good. Anyway I authorized the battery to be replaced. The battery was replaced at 50K miles so the battery only lasted 13K miles (a little over two years). The sales rep did give me a pro rate and it cost me ~$75 bucks.  The batteries at Wal-Mart last much longer than this battery and at a much lesser cost.  In all my visit was a fair rating. One more comment... I keep our Venza in immaculate condition and detailed very nicely including the engine compartment. My goal is to keep the car looking like new for many years to come. I feel I'm one of your best supporters of the Toyota brand  cars if fact all three of our cars are Toyota's, A 2014 Corolla LE ECO and a 91 Pick Up truck that is in fantastic shape.

67206,04-Dec-13,"My wife and I decided to give Toyota of el Cajon a shot at our business. We had taken a couple of test drives with other dealers but the other dealers did not have the color and options we wanted. We made arrangements with Marwan Fakhoury (Sales Manager) to come in and test drive a specific car at a pre arranged price with the intent to purchase that night. We went into the dealership and we are assigned to Simeon Okosun. We started our test drive and once we reached the freeway I asked that we drive for a few miles as we were planning to buy this specific car in the next hour. Simeon told us that we needed to pull off at the next exit and we were only allowed to drive 1 exit before buying a brand new $28,000 car. I explained to Simeon that to feel comfortable spending this much money we wanted to drive at least 3-4 miles to feel comfortable. With my wife driving the vehicle she was already getting nervous with a man sitting behind her being very rude and abrupt with us and telling us to pull over and that the test drive was over. Personally, I understand that we came in at 8pm and the night was almost over but we had pre arranged the drive and purchase price already with the sales manager, it was a slam dunk sale for them as we and had cash in hand. 

Simeon said we were stupid to want to drive more than 1 exit and he had been doing this for 15 years and no one needs to drive more than 1 exit to test out a car. I told Simeon he was being extremely rude and acting like an as&ho&e. He proceeded to start yelling at both my wife and I that we were pieces of shi& and he made more money than us and he would bash our faces into the ground the moment he got out of the car, as well as his son was more obedient than us.... Needless to say he went from 0-crazy in a matter of seconds. After over 20 threats on our life and hitting the back seat and screaming at the top of his lungs at us.....all while I called his manager and had him on speaker phone the entire time for him to hear the exact threats he was making! I decided to call the police, who were dispatched to secure our safety. After the Sales Manager offered us to take the car as loaner, Laura Brewer the PR person from the dealership called to apologize. She was very nice and apologetic. I felt that the sales manager and PR person cared to apologize but I did wonder what the owner Greg Kaminsky thought about the situation. I was told that the owner would call a couple of days later. After 5 business days later and no call or care from the owner combined with the fact that I called the dealership today and found out that Simeon was rewarded with his behavior with only being suspended from work for a day and was able to keep his job, I decided to write this review. 

Simeon Okosun was allowed to threaten customers lives all while being on speaker phone with the sales manager and the only discipline he received was a day suspension. On top of that the owner was requested to contact me regarding the situation and he felt it was not worth his time. The very next day we went to Toyota of Carlsbad and purchased the very same car and were in and out of the dealership in 2 hours. I recommend that Toyota car buyers find any other Toyota dealership in San Diego other than El Cajon. ",6,81,-1
67207,16-Sep-13,"Simeon was very dishonest with me and my husband. We were looking to buy a 4runner and Simeon had assured us he had the vehicle in the color we wanted even though it didn't show up in the online inventory. We decided to drive around the lot to take a look at it. We didn't see it so we drove around to the back and we still couldn't find it. The next day my husband stopped by  to talk with Simeon personally. He was with a customer. When my husband let him know that he was there to look at the 4runner he said "" I am sorry I just sold it to the lady sitting at my desk"" Well that's okay. My husband asked to take a look at the vehicle anyway because he has only seen the ""blizzard white"" in photos. His excuse was that it was in the ""wash bay"" So he wasn't able to see it. My curious husband drove to the back anyway where they wash the cars and there was no 4runner anywhere. Then as my husband was leaving the dealership, he saw the same lady that he supposedly sold the 4runner to, get into her own vehicle and drive away. Simeon lied to us,  wasted our time and gas. He never had the vehicle to begin with. I also found out from an honest dealership that if it is not in the inventory, it is illegal to have for sale on the lot. I did not appreciate Simeon's dishonest sales tactics. I will definitely spend my 35k elsewhere.",6,81,-1

67268,20-Nov-11,"I went to this dealership because I saw highly rated reviews on internet. But I got a big surprise...

Summary: I originally went there to have them estimate my car for a trade-in value, and get a quote for a new corolla because I am planing to buy one within a few weeks. I accidentally left my driver license at home. They had me drive back home(20 min one way), and told me to come back when I'm actually ready to buy. They did not even give me a trade-in value I came in for. Great customer service.

More detail: before I went, I made an appointment with Hiwa, and when I got there, another guy called Michael sand ""hi, I'm Hiwa"". I kept thinking he was Hiwa, until I saw his name tag when he handed his business card. I don't have to talk to Hiwa (since I've never met anyway), but what kind of person would say ""I'm Hiwa"" to my face with his name tag saying ""Michael""? I am not a 3 year old. Michael also tried to have another sales person to deal with me, but he refused to do it as soon as I told him I'm not buying today. Michael also told me the deal I saw on their website isn't there by showing me a different web page showing $15,999 more on the price. I came home and still see the deal $15,199 on your website! Don't lie to me. ""Come back when you are ready to buy""? Do you think I'll come back and buy from someone who lied his name? NEVER! No matter what deal you give me.

When we brought the car back in and my husband explained that the features were not in it as the salesman said they were. The salesman came over and still was trying to say that the car had the features. Luckily the service guy said that the car did not have the features and He said that they would check it out and see what they can do and that they would be sending it to the Chevy dealer to have the oil leak looked at..  They still have the car and we were told that the car we just spent $19664.90 on Sunday evening   doesn’t actually have an oil leak it is just a little seepage so they won’t need to fix it..... I just can’t feel really good about a $19664.90 car without the features that I was told it had and the has a little seepage.....The sad thing is that the features that we were suppose to have gotten were on the sticker of the car, I know because I have the copy of the sticker on the car.

We are very happy with the vehicle, the people and the service which brings me to why I am back. Right after we got my wife a new vehicle my PT Cruiser was hit in front of my house by a DUI Driver while I slept at 3 in the morning. 
Needless to say I was now out a vehicle and did not look forward to looking for a new car or dealing with a dealership to get a replacement car. I tried to reach Fernando at Toyota of El Cajon but he was on vacation so I left a message for Natasha, she was not in till 2:00. I took this waiting time to test drive a couple of cars from the competitors...not a fun experience. I wasn't finding what I wanted at the price I was looking for. I immediately knew where I should be and it was now 2:00. I called Toyota of El Cajon and explained my situation to Natasha Lind, excuse me, Natasha Rowles the Finance Manager and much, much more. She forwarded me to Frank Marquez, as Fernando Aguiniga was on vacation. Frank called me and asked what I was looking for, I told him the 3 models I was interested in and he said, ""I will have them ready for you when you arrive."" To make things short I Leased a 2010 Prius at the price I was asking for and everyone involved reminded me why I called This Toyota dealership first.
The ability to listen to My needs and patiently assist me through the car buying experience speaks volume.

67526,07-Mar-20,"My wife and I purchased a brand new 2020 Toyota Rav4 in late December 2019 -- and both the dealership and Factory (Plano, TX) would NOT cover the replacement of a Sunroof that had unexpectedly exploded for absolutely NO REASON!!! Their ""Fix"", I was instructed by them to put in a claim with my own insurance carrier -- and for me to pay the deductible for a safety issue and reoccurring problem that is known by other drivers / consumers.
Had to rent a Rental Car from this dealership while they assessed the situation and Warranty Repair work -- but would NOT honor the ""Repairs"" nor would they reimburse me for the 3 days rental car charges. The Rav4 had just 5,000 miles on it. Got the complete ""run-around"" and shoulder shrugs...
Needless to say, we are not at all pleased with their Customer Service Dept. In fact, a week later I''m still waiting for a returned call from the Factory's Customer Service dept. as well. ",6,82,746

67602,17-Aug-18,"I have had a bad experience last week. I have been bringing my both cars for service at this dealer ship for last 3 years. this is the second time they were not honest. Rep name Vanessa R. charged me $20 more then the advertised price for an oil change.  I asked her that i sound too much. She said price went up @89.99. she just charge more Because I look different and naive! I complained to the manager. I had to spend 2:45 to get oil change. I asked why it is taking long and then they said they were doing thorough inspection. When I got my car back they said that timing belt has oil leak and it will be $2001 to repair. I think they were messing up with my car because I complained. Usually it take 1:10 to 1:30 min. If you complain about anything they will mess up your car to make more money.  People came after me left long time before me. I learned my lesson the hard way.

We also told him that when we start the car there is a noise going on it so we asked if they can check what that noise is, he said will check with the the technician and will get back on us after like an hour and a half. We noticed that we are the only one sitting on the waiting area and the cashier is already closed. So we approched the front desk and asked what happened to our car. We waited for like 4 hours and we did not get any advise from Andrew Cortez on what the status of our car was. We went home so disappointed and upset as we have wasted almost 4 and a half hour waiting and did not get an answer to the problem we have consulted.",6,82,14
67627,04-Apr-18,"I had my car towed in because it wouldn’t start... They ran a Diagnostic .. called me on the phone and told me that I needed a new starter and a starter relay and it was $743... I said ok I need my car to work so go ahead and install it... When my car was ready I got another phone call stating that my car was ready it was running and ready to go.. The Person On The Phone asked me .. have you noticed you have a knock when you start the engine... I said no Ive never heard a knock, I don’t know what that even means, he said well you just have to make sure you keep oil in it and every should be fine.. I said ok the dealership service closed at 5, I got there at 4:30... stood in line Paid the $743 and got my car at about 4:52... I got 1/2 a mile down the street and my car shut off.. I tired to start the car again, it would not start and the engine started smoking... I had my car towed back to the dealership the same day... the service department was closed at that time so I had to wait until Monday to talk to someone about what was going on with my car... Long Story Short.. On Monday They gave me a rental car and by Tuesday they told me that my engine had seized and it would cost me $6500 to have it replaced.... I Feel With every fiber of my being that they knew I needed a new engine when they initially ran their diagnostic but didn’t tell me... They were completely dishonest with me From The Beginning... I Feel Scamed, Taken Advantage Of And Really Hurt By their actions... I thought I was doing the best thing I could by taking it to an actual Toyota dealership versus a regular body shop... But I was left with my car in worse condition then when I brought it in, and I’m out $743. Their solution was for me to buy a new car from them... Yeah right,

67656,09-Dec-17,"I generally don't take the time to write negative reviews but I believe this time it's warranted. My cousin and I went to Crown Toyota to meet up with Eric to test drive a 2015 Mustang GT.  When we arrived Eric said that the car was parked in the garage next to the showroom.  I thought it was kinda odd the car was separated from all of the other vehicles but my gut feeling was to pay extra attention to the car.  I inspected the car it was pretty obvious that it had been in an accident and Eric asked me how I knew.  I pointed out the scraped paint around the bolt heads that secure the fender to the car, the fender didn't align properly with the door.  He took one quick look and stated that the passenger side fender looks just the same!  I pointed out the flaws again and he dismissed what I said and stated that the CarFax was clean and explained that every used car goes through a thorough inspection before it sells on the lot.  Okay whatever....so he starts up the car and it sounded REALLY good but a bit on the loud side so I'm thinking there's possibly an aftermarket exhaust installed. 

The test drive was quick and there was some squealing from the front of the car but that wasn't a major concern.  When we got back to the dealership Eric called out his manager to speak with us because we weren't willing to pay the asking price for the car since Crown Toyota's pricing policy is fixed. The manager addressed our concerns and looked at the car and said that it wasn't in an accident.  Since we parked outside in direct sunlight the flaws in the car were much easier to see.  We found out that the driver's side rim had curb rash and was touched up with some generic matte black paint that didn't match to hide the damage, we also found out that the reason the car was so loud was that it was missing BOTH mufflers!  The driver's side mirror was also poorly repainted and the clear coat was bubbling from the edges and I even pointed out the inner fender fasteners and the headlight fasteners were rounded off and the manager insisted that the car was NEVER in an accident.  He then stated that maybe the headlight needed to be changed so the fasteners were taken off (on a 2 year old car!?!?), that Ford's paint job isn't always the best, and made every other excuse to deny that the car was damaged to get us to buy the car. At that point, I didn't even bother to explain that the sanding scratches can be seen underneath the repainted fender in direct sunlight because the body shop was in rush and didn't care.  I've been working on cars for over 20 years so it's pretty annoying when the staff kept denying the obvious.  

I went with my gut feeling and told my cousin so just skip this car since there's just WAAAAY too many flaws, inconsistencies, and misleading statements that we received from the salesperson and manager.  My only guess as to why the car was in a dark garage was to hide the flaws.  In conclusion, I would NOT trust this dealership to purchase a new or used car due to the misleading statements that were given by the staff. The last thing that the manager said to me that stood out was: ""Just because you pointed out these flaws doesn't mean we're going to lower the price of the car because it's already priced aggressively""  LMAO..... Awesome way to win over customers by trying to pawn off damaged goods at market value. Eric also had the nerve to call us the next day and insisted that the car has never been in an accident. I should have taken photos of the damaged areas to add to this review but was too wrapped up in arguing with the manager to do so. 

About 2 weeks later I get a message on Yelp from Carlos C. and I quote ""I think so you just looking for attention , wasting my time and yelp comunity""  

My response:

You might try rereading your messages a few times before hitting the send button.  It took a while before I could decipher it.  

The negative Yelp review was my EXACT experience at your dealership.  There was no embellishment, exaggeration, or seeking of attention that you speak of. If your sales staff, managers, and mechanics at John Elway's Crown Toyota in Ontario, were better trained in customer service you wouldn't get any negative reviews.  

You had the EXACT Ford Mustang that we were looking for and we were ready to purchase if it was the right car.  I found a bunch of flaws with the car and pointed them out,  we were willing to put up issues but instead of acknowledging the problems, your salesman and manager flat out denied them and made a bunch of excuses to convince us to buy.  Here are a few tips that would save you a bunch of headaches in the future.

1)  If you're buying used cars from the Manheim Auction, spend a little extra time going through their inspection report and pay attention to the flaws.  They're pretty thorough and it'll save you headaches down the line.
2) If you're flipping trade-in's it's probably best to decline the beaters or just send it straight to the auctions versus selling them on the lot
3)  Your mechanics are busy BUT details are important. They did the standard maintenance on the car, but how do they overlook 2 missing mufflers? LOL What if they missed safety features that were missing?  You open up the dealership to liability and litigation.
3)  Your sales guys need better training.  If a customer has issues with a car, simply acknowledge the problem and offer them another alternative.  If they decline....LET IT GO! Denying obvious issues only brings up mistrust and a difficult sales process.  Also a clean Carfax report isn't always strong selling point and the salespeople need better material versus repeating the same thing over and over again. It's like forcing a girl to date you when she's not interested.....if you act weird, lie, and chase they'll run.  This same principle applies to potential customers.
4) Your manager needs additional training.  He's there to help the sales guys move inventory, solve problems, and take care of customer issues.  It doesn't help the sales process if the manager denies the obvious issues with the car.  

The manager said....and I quote ""I deal with cars all day, I don't see anything wrong with the car, it's never been repainted, Ford doesn't always have the best paint job, we have fixed pricing and it's aggressively priced, just because you pointed out a few things doesn't mean we're going to lower the price.""  There was nothing positive about anything he said.  How is that going to help the sales process?

5) All of your sales staff needs additional training in ALL AREAS of communication with clients.  You're not going to increase sales or win over disgruntled clients by ignoring their concerns or sending inappropriate condescending messages via Yelp.  

Thank you again for reading my review on Yelp and taking the time to message me.  I hope you have a good weekend with lots of sales and finish strong before the end of the year!

 But the Rep how checked me in told me that the advisor name is Christian
I have been your customer now for over one year and I had always excellent experiences with your service and advisor like Andrew Cortez  and Venesse Ramirez but today your advisor was super rude and unprofessional in dealing with customer .My appointment was at 2.30 pm and because I am driving from Beaumont ca 92223 (39 Miles) I came at 3.17 pm due an unexpected traffic jam, it is my fault but out of my hand. As he came to me and before saying any thing, looked on his watch and told me sir my team will leave in 30 min, you can only drop off your car, I asked him if he can send me for any other team to do oil change only today and I will come back later for the other services because I am coming from Beaumont, he looked in his watch again and said no, in between he started to remove all signs and forms from my car. He has the right to cxl my appointment because of my delay but he should dealing with me in better way or show me some flexibility especially that I am coming to you all of this distance because of your good service, ignoring all of other toyta dealership closer to my address. This advisor make me very upset by his arrogant and  may be I will never come back to your location ",6,82,261

67672,02-Apr-17,My son had his toyota camry seviced for engine oil and filter changed at your prestigious service center but when he arrived home I was so disappointed to see that there were quite a number of oil smudges on top of the engine especially the black plastic cover of the engine very near the engine oil cap. My guess was that the mechanic who attended to my son's car did not bother to use a FUNNEL that is why when the mechanic pour the new engine oil he missed the opening that was why there were oil spill marks on the engine. The mechanic did clean the smudges but not clean enough as they were still very obvious and untidy to look at. Maybe next time your mechanics can use funnels in pouring in oil or any fluids to avoid smears or smudges especially if they can not clean it well. You can avoid these kind of problem if someone will inspect first the service (job) done before  giving back the vehicle to the customer. I am making this review to help you improve your service and maintain high customer rating. Thank you and God Bless. ,6,82,90
67778,23-Aug-16,"Don't ever... ever buy used car from this dealership. Sales people that harp on the one price no games. Fail to tell you that the only games they play are the managers and service mechanics manipulating things in their favor so that they don't have to come out of pocket for lousy service. I purchased a used vehicle from them not even 3 months ago, not a week after leaving the loft I was hit with multiple lights in my dash.  Having a mechanic of my choice troubleshoot the codes, telling me what was wrong to know when I took it back to the stealership. When dropping the vehicle off I stated the exact issue. Simply resetting the code they told me the vehicle was fixed and ready to be picked up that the issue was taken care of. A week or so later the exact issue comes up again.. crown has a 3,000 mile warranty for used vehicle purchases. So happens that my vehicle doesn't cover it now that I have driven it for about 2000 miles or so. Still under the the 3000. They tell me they sell extended coverages which wasn't offered to me and I stated to them that it wasn't in the contract. The Are admitting  that the original problem I toke it in for is in fact the problem that is throwing the check engine light and their response to helping me out is doing a in house cost repair which is only 300 off a almost 1300 dollar repair. Not to my satisfaction I spoke with a manager about this issue and he told me basically crown doesn't have to do anything for you... you bought a 150k milage vehicle expect problems. Poor, lazy or con mechanics cleared the code to only come back on again to let me drive more miles for them to justify not having to fix this issue. The whole your getting a great car for a better price is a scam... straight bs... I paid about 2k over blue book being told constantly that don't worry you'll have a piece of mind knowing your getting a trouble free great car... O ya... we at crown pride ourselves on customer service and we're at the top for customer satisfaction. Even with haggling with a manager I won't say his name he offered to pay 350 of the cost of the repair if I were to take it to a private mechanic to fix. Well that doesn't even cover the cost of the part... bottom line is this dealership is no better than a dealership you see on the corner of a street or a craigslist dealer... they want to push problematic cars off the lot fast as they can without having to do close to no repairs. Beware of dealing with the used car side you can never ask to many questions. Get everything in writing... even if you do that they'll find a way to manipulate their guidelines to not fix initially what should have prior to even putting it up for sale. Since purchasing this vehicle the light hast came on 15 times.. 15 and I counted and documented them and called crown about it to the service writer knows as well. 0 stars if I could honestly.

67840,04-Jun-15,"On March 29th I purchased 2008 XB from Crown Toyota. BIG MISTAKE, it was an AS IS car and I am paying for it. 2 months now and I still have not been able to get Doug to replace the piece I was promised the day I bought which opens and closes the back seat, I also pickup the car and they have broken the runner that goes along the truck above the license plate but they told me it was like that, that was a lie. And now as of Sunday May 31st my transmission needs to be replaced and I have only driven the car for two months and added 2000 miles, how is it that I need a new transmission, I'm sure the dealership knew that there was something wrong with the car that is why they sold it tome AS IS in the clause. I don't believe that they put the car threw 18 point inspection like they claim they did or something would have came up as a problem on their computers as they were running diagnostics. I would be very weary of buying a car from them or referring anyone to them. Then you have to be careful with the finance dept. because they aren't up front about the warranty, and when you ask a question they just push it under the rug and move on, and then if you question it again or anything  make sure you aren't talking to Randall Bedill or  ""Randy"" as he called himself the  finance manager, he was rude when I questioned him about my loan. He told me to stop pointing fingers and accept blame, that if I wouldn't of been hungry the day  when I purchased the car we wouldn't be having the conversation and that next time I should eat a sandwich before going.

67921,01-Jan-15,"Good morning and Happy New Year to all. My name is Steffen Malek. I wish I could say my experience shopping for a car at John Elway's Crown Toyota was good but it was horrible. I will briefly recount my experience for you. I have been dealing with Mike Breicha via the internet to attempt to lease a vehicle. He did provide me with information over the phone but turned out to be false when we got there. When I arrived at the dealership a gentleman by the name of Lewis Vargas greated me and my family and proceeded to take my information to work up numbers for me. Lewis seemed to be a very nice guy however, he had to leave and turned me over to Robert Cruz (Attitude). A very sarcastic gentleman whose response to my Mom, when she asked if the seats on the Camry had special seatcovers you can order ""Doesn't all cars have seat covers"". He was very RUDE and unhelpful with all of his answers to me and my families questions we asked. Following the drive Mike and Robert presented me with an offer. I asked if it could be lower and they said no it was firm. I asked if I could get a lower model at a better price and they said no.It was clear to us that they did not want to sell a car to us or even try to work out a deal like most dealerships do when you are inquiring about a vehicle. So I said ok let me have my registration back (I was tradeing a 2012 leased Honda civic ex). THEY LOST MY REGISTRATION AND DID NOT MAKE A CONCERTED EFFORT TO FIND IT. (I am also now missing my license that i gave to them in which i didint realize untill i had already left the dealer.) I COMPLAINED TO THE DESK MANAGER AND HE ONLY GAVE LIP SERVICE NEVER FOUND IT, RIDICULOUS. HOW CAN AN ORGANIZATION AS BIG AS YOURS LOOSE A CUSTOMERS REGISTRATION AND LICENSE? I AM TOTALLY BLOWN AWAY AND DISGUSTED. I FELT EMBARASSED AND LIKE A SECOND CLASS CITIZEN. I AM A HARDWORKING MIDDLE CLASS GUY WHO FELT LIKE I WAS NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO BE IN YOUR DEALERSHIP. I WOULD LIKE MY REGISTRATION AND LICENSE BACK. I AM TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED AND WOULD WELCOME AN AUDIANCE WITH THE GENERAL SALES MANAGER OR GENERAL MANAGER. MY WHOLE FAMILY WAS THERE AND WITNESSED THIS ATROCITY. MY MOM AND DAD OWN A TOYOTA AND NOW THEY ARE QUESTIONING YOUR PRODUCT JUST BECAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT. I AM VERY UPSET OVER THIS INCIDENT AND WILL CONTINUE TO ADVERTISE THIS TERRIBLE SERVICE INCIDENT. ",6,82,1598
67947,02-Sep-14,"I was referred by Costco to this dealership and got assigned to my dealer James Miller. He was friendly over the phone when he first contacted me and said he'd take good care of me if I could just visit him in the office, which I did. Big mistake.

We scheduled an appointment for 11AM and I only got to talk to him 11:30AM. No water, no apologies. We went over the price I wished to get and showed him other dealers were offering the same deal. He immediately got uncomfortable with the competitive price and became extremely pushy by saying ""OK, that's a very very low price and we're losing money on this. If you're not planning to get the car today. I don't want to waste my time on you."" I politely told him that I had every intention to complete this deal as I believed Costco's auto buying program. So he agreed to beat the price by $100 to seal the deal.

The next day we came back to test drive the car. I mentioned that the tire pressure warning light was on, and he explained to me the reason was because the weather was too hot. I didn't say anything. But high temperature would actually increase tire pressure instead of lowering it and causing the low pressure warning. So he didn't know what he was talking about and let his customer test drive a car that's potentially unsafe.

Later when we were ready to sign the documents, we found out he'd inflated acquisition fees, double taxed, and added unnecessary fees which he couldn't explain, and just said that's the number the computer gave him. I even asked him to go over the numbers with me since it's much higher than the number I'd expected from the negotiated price we'd reached the day before. At that moment, he basically just stood up and said he's done with me.

This is our 5th time buying a car and absolutely the first time seeing a rep with that much attitude and rude customer service. We walked out and happily got our car with a price that's $432 lower than what he'd promised from another dealership at the same day within an hour. I guess I've found my Toyota dealership and it's unfortunately not John Elway's Crown Toyota Scion.",6,82,1793
67975,14-Jun-14,"So this is what I emailed, Mike Aguila the Internet Sales Manager after he was asking if I was still in the market for car.

John Elway's Crown Toyota,  I'm not in the market anymore and I decided to go with another dealer instead.  I really liked that Prius but the truth of the matter is when I came in to get the proper documentation to take to my credit union I was confronted with a racism or ignorant loan officer.  I had already decided to finance the Prius through my own credit union. However, the signing consultant ROB? I think... was god awful. Not only was his customer service incompetent, but impersonal and not very helpful about going over concerns. He didn't take the time to explain nor listen to what I needed.  He abruptly was set on the price for the warranty insurance and Gap ""AND"" said no can't do, but maybe someone with more authority  can work something out, but NOT ME!!!. I can't even believe he said that. He even had the nerve to tell me that I really wasn't buying anything until I sign for it. ""AND"" to think about it! I was shocked.  Lastly, it's up to you if you want to come back or not since there are other buyers.  So I hope you understand that after this experience there is no way I was I going to deal Toyota and his pushy and rude attitude.....

Please forward to this email to the proper manager since the loan guy or preparer of documents shouldn't be in this position or the very least get some customer service training.   

I will be posted some blogs on yelp and the business bureau about this experience. I hope that this guy doesn't come across this way with all customers. I would say that the experience and the perception he left was impersonal and somewhat racist or bluntly ignorant. . Kind of sucks that they treat their customers this way.

67979,10-Jun-14,"Dealing with the sales person was a pleasant experience, he was kind and really tried to help us. Dealing with the manager made this experience terrible. We were ignored, when the manager did bother to come over he kept telling us it would be 30 minutes, it was closer to 2 hours! He was disrespectful and unprofessional. When my husband went up to him to ask if he could get a ride so he could sell our old car Vincent first asked him if we were going to give him an excellent review. When my husband kindly told him it wouldn't be excellent but it would be good Vincent then said he didn't want to do the deal anymore. Simply because we told him he wasn't going to get a perfect hundred he rather we leave so his score wouldn't be affected. After that rude remark we told him we didn't want the deal, no reason to do business with people who only treat you like a money bag. The GSM came over to ask what happened when we explain he tried to justify the rude remarks, we then left. I cannot believe it is the higher ups that would be the problem.

67994,23-May-14,"I brought to the service manager's attention about my brand new Prius Plug In Hybrid battery becoming dead after it was parked at a covered LAX airport area x roughly 1 week. With the remote key not even able to open the car doors, I had to manually open the driver door with the metal key and called AAA to jumpstart the car. When I brought it to the toyota dealer service manager's attention  (Mr Buenrostro) the following day, he showed me a blogposts (www.priuschat.com) detailing similar battery bproblems experienced by other people with the prius and the prius plug in (PIP). He recommended buying a trickler charger or a portable jumpstart kit. I find this unacceptable especially buying a new car roughly a month old. After several discussions with  the customer relations lady Isabel, she recommended leaving my car in their dealership when I go for a few days or weeks vacation (i have to provide my own car rental) and they will try to prolong the batteries life by removing one of rhe fuses (which they intend to teach me). I find the it unacceptable that the dealer was not upfront and I was not told about this problem during the sales talk prior to the purchase. It seemed more that certain information about this issue were witheld probably deliberately. Knowing about this battery issue would have significantly played a role in my decision making. They claim that this was the ""normal"" characteristic of the battery. It does not sound normal if your brand new car battery is dead if  unused/parked for roughly a week .and needs jumpstarting. The only advise offered is to teach me how to remove one of the fuse prior a long trip so as to prolong battery life.

68203,13-Jul-13,"If their  internet department provides a no-haggle price, then they better stick to it and update it based on their latest information if necessary. I went there with their no-haggle, fixed price but ended up haggling on the final price for almost two hours. The final sale price changed many times with different ways of doing price calculations that were simple and straight forward. It was supposed to be a stress-free, no-haggle fixed price experience, but it was anything but a stress-free experience. I told them I'll be there on Friday to get the car using their quoted no-haggle price. Once I arrived, I tested the car and told them to finalize the sale with the power seat option with their agreed-upon price and they said fine. The process started fine but then Mr. Bill Leyva came back with a message that the $500 loyalty discount in the no-haggle price has expired and cannot be given. They never stated in the e-mail that price will be $500 higher. I ended up haggling on the price for two hours which I wanted to avoid in the first place and ended up sharing half of expired discount and some more. Their final price ended up higher than what other dealers offered. It was not a good car buying experience.",6,82,-1

68342,24-Oct-11,"One of the worst car buying experience in my life!  I made a deal with the sales team and I was on my way to the finance dept where I encounter THE most horrible experience.  The finance manager, Anthony Barnes was rude and condescending.  Needless to say, I walked away from the deal and purchased my vehicle from another dealership.",6,82,-1
68345,13-Aug-11,"Went for routine 50,000 mile service.  Never received a call that my truck was ready to pick up.  When I called in, I was told that ONLY my service rep could tell me if my truck was ready, but he was not available so I left him a message.  Never heard back, so called again.  Again told that my service rep is the ONLY person at the entire service dept. who can tell if my car is ready (which is a HORRIBLE system considering it must be on the computer).  Waited over 1/2 hour for my service rep to finally call back.  My truck had been ready the whole time.  No apologies or explanations.  Won't be going back to this dealer again.",6,82,22
68363,29-Oct-09,"Same as previous post.  Overstated price, even though the car was supposed to be sold at "" Guaranteed "" lower price through American Express/ Zag.com network. Wish I had check with DealerRater.com first before wasting my time with Crown Toyota. BUYERS BEWARE !! ",6,82,-1
68364,23-Sep-09,"NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE!!!! From overstated price, even though the car was supposed to be sold at lower price through Sam's Club network to overblown interest rate on the loan.  Don't be too hopefull even though you may have perfect credit score and significant down payment.  This dealership should not be trusted and I do not recommend to make any purchases over there.  THEY CHEAT!!!!",6,82,-1
68365,07-Jul-09,"i get my car serviced here for all maintenance not just one car all my toyotas. i have a prius, a 2008 corolla type s and also a lexus rx300awd i purchased here, all my cars have had horrible problems with this dealership doing a simple oil change.

first incident was with my prius, i told service i smell gas from my car and they checked and said nothing wrong with it. i left the dealership and almost arrived home and car stops,  towed it to dealership and found out their was a hole in gas tank... wow! they didn't see that huh? But they did fix it, for a fee. which I could of blew up because they told me nothings wrong with it. i just think they dont actually do anything their at the dealership. then with my corolla, they do regular maintenance and car gets worst after leaving the dealership. first time i had an oil change i had no oil in it because their techs are stupid. then they had it fixed then my clutch went out, after having the car for 3 months, then now my car is making lots of rattling noises. took it back and said nothing is wrong with it after waiting for 2hrs. so whatever with that i sold the car.  Now I have this lexus rx300 i bought from them and they always mess this car up. first time for oil change, they broke my exhaust so i fixed it myself because i have a welder. ok. thats not a problem. then again another oil change then another exhaust problem.... ok im getting tired of welding something that i didnt break. so i told them... what do they say? we only did an oil change... what a jack ass you are Arthur.... tell the truth did you do the oil change. nope you didnt. so whatever with that. then now i have this check engine light the last time i brought it a week ago. went on after 2 days from maintenance.  i call them and go their and they say they didnt touch anything other than doing an oil change and filter change.  by the way im an ASE Cert. master mechanic, and I manufacture car parts. This Arthur guy tells me, oh maybe they forgot to put the vacuum lines in when they changed your air filter, and i told him they didnt change the filter, he said they did change it. so i tell him to look at it. the filter is brown when its supposed to be white. hmmm thats not new, he says nothing and closes it.  also i know they didnt change the oil filter when they did the oil change,,, because i marked it with my marker, and its the same oil filter i had when i got the car, and i've asked them if they change it they say offcourse, well to make it a short story, im rebuilding the whole car myself and will no longer deal with these unprofessional mechanics and managers they have at Crown TOyota of Ontario, Ca.  poor service and no mechanical experience.

After speaking with an employee about this incident he told me I don't know anything and what im talking about. but when i told him im a ase master mechanic and i own a automotive aftermarket manufacturing company of course he shut his mouth, especially when he had my company sticker on his car.

68366,23-Feb-07,"I called the Crown Toyota Dealership and spoke to an Internet salesperson and explained that I would like an emailed quote with breakdowns and an out-the-door price, but she never got back to me by phone, nor did she send me an email. She did not seem interested in dealing with me at all; apparently she did not want to deal with a knowledgeable shopper. I was not surprised that she never emailed me a quote or even sent me a thank you response. Bad shopping experience and poor customer service. If asked, I will steer people away from Crown Toyota.",6,82,484
68367,27-Feb-04,"Four days after I bought a Toyota Sienna, I get a call from Stacey Alexander telling me they made a mistake on the contract that had been executed and they wanted me to re-write it.  As explained to me, the $750 manufacturer's rebate (to be used as the down payment) that was represented to me in the contract didn't exist.  I was supposed to execute a new contract and pay an additional $750!  I guess Ms. Alexander believed that the no ""cooling off period"" only applied to the consumer and not the dealer.  As I explained to Ms. Alexander, the executed contract as well as the new forms sent to me gave me the option of not writing a new contract.  So I opted not to re-write the contract and let Crown Toyota deal with the manufacturer for the rebate.  After being accused of dishonesty (yes, car dealers give lessons in honesty) they returned the check to my credit union and tell me they can't process it because of some B.S. about the rebate issue.  I offer to give them the vehicle back and magically the rebate issue is cleared up.  Not a pleasant experience!",6,82,-1
